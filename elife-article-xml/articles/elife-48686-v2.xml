However, cells with large genomes sometimes fail to complete replication during interphase and instead enter mitosis with regions of incompletely replicated DNA. These regions are processed in early mitosis via a process known as mitotic DNA repair synthesis (MiDAS), but little is known about how cells switch from conventional DNA replication to MiDAS. Using the early embryo of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a model system, we show that the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase drives replisome disassembly in response to incomplete DNA replication, thereby providing access to replication forks for other factors. Moreover, TRAIP is essential for MiDAS in human cells, and is important in both systems to prevent mitotic segregation errors. Our data indicate that TRAIP is a master regulator of the processing of incomplete DNA replication during mitosis in metazoa.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>TRAIP</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>fragile site</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12016/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonneville</surname><given-names>Remi</given-names></name><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C578/A24558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonneville</surname><given-names>Remi</given-names></name><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102943/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Labib</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hickson</surname><given-names>Ian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008392</institution-id><institution>Danish Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-4004-00155B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhowmick</surname><given-names>Rahul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>616236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mailand</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The TRAIP ubiquitin ligase is required during mitosis to disassemble the replisome at sites of incomplete DNA replication, and activate the mitotic DNA repair pathway, thus preserving genome integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome duplication in eukaryotes is initiated from many origins of DNA replication on each chromosome, leading to the progression of DNA replication forks across the genome until fork convergence induces DNA replication termination. However, in species with genomes larger than about 100 Mb, it becomes increasingly likely that a small number of very late-replicating loci will not have completed DNA replication when cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Mamun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Metazoa have evolved pathways that quickly process sites of incomplete replication during mitosis, in order to facilitate the completion of chromosome segregation before cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhowmick and Hickson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). In human cells, factors such as the FANCD2 protein mark sites of unreplicated DNA, and then SLX4-dependent nucleolytic cleavage in mitosis promotes RAD52-dependent DNA repair synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>). Loci prone to such breakage and repair, particularly in response to DNA replication stress, include common fragile sites that are defined cytologically as breaks or gaps in metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which mitotic processing initiates at such sites is not well understood. In particular, little is known about how conventional DNA replication forks are converted during mitosis into sites of DNA repair synthesis. One possibility is that the processing of sites of incomplete DNA replication begins with disassembly of the replisome, which otherwise protects the parental DNA at replication forks from attack by nucleases. The replisome is assembled at origins of replication once per cell cycle, and is normally disassembled during DNA replication termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dewar and Walter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maric et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 2014</xref>). Replisome disassembly is an active process, which is initiated by ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase via the ubiquitin ligase CUL-2<sup>LRR-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dewar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>), leading to disassembly by the Cdc48 segregase and its essential co-factors Ufd1 and Npl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maric et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using the early embryo of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model system, we previously identified a mitotic pathway for CMG disassembly that also requires CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4, and is able to remove any post-termination replisomes that escape the normal disassembly process during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>). This mitotic pathway for replisome disassembly requires a ubiquitin ligase known as TRAIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Priego Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), which is important for genome integrity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soo Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and is required to remove the replisome from converged DNA replication forks during the repair of inter-strand DNA crosslinks in extracts of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Very recently, it was shown that addition of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts induces TRAIP-dependent replisome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Priego Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), even when DNA replication is incomplete, and leads to fork breakage and DNA rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). However, it has yet to be determined whether TRAIP is important in metazoan cells and tissues for replisome disassembly in response to incomplete DNA replication, and whether TRAIP is required for mitotic DNA repair synthesis at common fragile sites. Here, we address these issues, using an integrated approach that combines the advantages of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo and human cell lines as model systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Replisome disassembly after incomplete DNA replication in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo requires the CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4 segregase</title><p>Monitoring replisome disassembly during mitosis is difficult in eukaryotic cells that have been exposed to DNA replication stress, since the S-phase checkpoint response usually blocks mitotic entry under such conditions. However, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo provides a useful model system in this regard, since the checkpoint response to replication stress is attenuated, such that mitotic entry is delayed but not blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauchle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Encalada et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, the transparent nature of the embryo facilitates live cell imaging.</p><p>We previously established a live cell assay for replisome disassembly in the first cell cycles of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sonneville et al., 2017</xref>), based on monitoring the presence or absence of a GFP-tagged subunit of the CMG helicase on condensing chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; chromatin is visualised via mCherry-tagged histone H2B). To assay for the presence of the replisome on mitotic chromatin after subjecting cells to DNA replication stress, we depleted the RPA-1 component of the RPA single-strand binding protein complex by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sonneville et al., 2015</xref>), chromosome condensation during prophase of the first mitotic cell cycle was impaired after depletion of RPA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), reflecting mitotic entry in the presence of incomplete DNA replication. The chromatin subsequently aligned on the metaphase plate, but anaphase was impaired due to multiple chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; compare <italic>rpa-1</italic> RNAi with control). Strikingly, components of the CMG helicase, such as the GINS subunits PSF-1 and SLD-5, and the CDC-45 protein, were not detected on the partially replicated chromatin during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, metaphase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D,F–H</xref>). This reflected active disassembly of the CMG helicase by the CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4 segregase, since CMG components were retained on mitotic chromatin when NPL-4 and RPA-1 were depleted simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C–D,F–H</xref>; note that <italic>npl-4</italic> depletion also induced chromatin bridges, reflecting the multiple roles of CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4 during the cell cycle, including during mitosis).

CMG components were not detected on mitotic chromatin following <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi, mirroring the defect seen after depletion of RPA-1, and this was due to active disassembly of the replisome by CDC-48_UFD-1_NPL-4, since CMG components persisted on mitotic chromatin in embryos treated with <italic>rnr-1 npl-4</italic> double RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D,F–H</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the mCherry-H2B signal was barely detectable throughout mitosis upon co-depletion of RNR-1 and NPL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and this reflected the absence from mitotic chromatin of both condensin II and condensin I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; note that condensin II normally associates with mitotic chromatin during prophase, whereas condensin I is loaded during metaphase). Most likely, the persistence of the CMG helicase at replication forks supported continued slow progression of the replisome throughout the genome, uncoupled from DNA synthesis, thereby unwinding the parental DNA duplex and displacing parental histones from unreplicated chromatin. In contrast, continued progression of the replisome in the presence of replication stress might be more limited following double RNAi to <italic>rpa-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic>, such that a significant amount of unreplicated chromatin (marked by mCherry-H2B) persists across the genome.

In the second embryonic cell cycle, the effect was greatest (around 90% of embryos, n = 18) in the anterior AB cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is known to have a weak S-phase checkpoint and thus is vulnerable to entering mitosis with persistent DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauchle et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, chromatin bridges were observed less frequently in the posterior P1 cell.

Such extremely late replicating regions of the genome include common fragile sites, but might also correspond to areas where two converging replication forks have both stalled in a region that lacks intervening dormant origins. Together with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Priego Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), our data indicate that TRAIP activity during mitosis promotes replisome disassembly at any remaining replication forks, thus exposing the parental DNA at the junction of the fork (we cannot exclude that TRAIP also has other important targets during mitosis, in addition to CMG). This leads to nucleolytic cleavage and mitotic DNA repair synthesis. In this way, mitotic TRAIP activity brings to an end the period during which conventional DNA replication is possible during the metazoan cell cycle. Although it remains to be demonstrated that TRAIP does indeed drive CMG helicase disassembly during mitosis in human cells, we have recently found that mouse TRAIP is required for mitotic CMG disassembly (Ryo Fujisawa, Fabrizio Villa and Karim Labib, unpublished data), indicating that the role of TRAIP is well conserved in diverse metazoan species.</p><p>As noted recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), if cleavage at each of two converging replication forks is specific to the leading strand template, which is normally encircled and thus protected by the CMG helicase, then one intact chromosome would rapidly be restored by gap filling, whereas repair of the other would require the joining of two broken ends. The latter would be associated with a small deletion and with sister chromatid exchange, thus matching the known features of common fragile sites in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover et al., 2017</xref>). Our data indicate that TRAIP preserves viability when metazoan cells enter mitosis with incomplete replication, by promoting a programmed pathway of breakage and repair. This comes at the price of localised genome rearrangements, but avoids the far more damaging random breakage of loci during cell division in the presence of unreplicated DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>GFP-PSF-1;

Click-IT chemistry was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, but with a final concentration of 10X of the Click-IT EdU buffer additive (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells on glass cover slips or poly-lysine glass slides were fixed and permeabilised using cold PTEMF buffer (20 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 10 mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 4% formaldehyde) for 20 mins at room temperature followed by blocking with PBSAT (0.5% Triton X in 3% BSA dissolved in PBS) for 20 mins at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Excess unbound primary antibody was removed by washing four times with PBSAT for 15 mins each. Samples were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 mins at room temperature, followed by four washes with PBSAT for 15 mins each. Air-dried slides or coverslips were mounted using VectaShield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using an Olympus BX63 microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>The experiments were not randomised, no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p><p>For <italic>C. elegans</italic> microscopy experiments, at least five embryos were analysed and seen to behave similarly, unless indicated otherwise.

The PCR experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> was performed 10 times, whereas the immunoblotting experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> were performed 3 times, and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> were performed twice.</p><p>For work with human cells, at least 45–95 cells were examined per sample in the microscopy experiments (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), and graphical and statistical analysis was carried out using ‘Prism’ software (GraphPad). At least three biological replicates were performed for each data set, which were then used to generate mean values and standard deviations. Statistical significance of these data was calculated using a Mann–Whitney U test (to minimise the effect of outliers in the data).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Medical Research Council for funding (core grant MC_UU_12016/13 to KL), together with Cancer Research UK (Programme Grant C578/A24558), the Wellcome Trust (reference 102943/Z/13/Z for an Investigator award to KL), the Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF115; to IDH), the Danish Medical Research Council (DFF-4004-00155B; a postdoctoral fellowship grant to RB), and the European Research Council (grant no. 616236 to NM).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Remus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the role of TRAIP, a ubiquitin ligase important for genome maintenance, in the cellular response to replication stress. The data show that TRAIP is required for the removal of replisomes from mitotic chromosomes in early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, in which normal DNA replication fork progression was impaired by RPA or RNR depletion, and that this defect correlates with reduced viability and chromosome segregation defects. The data in human cells show that TRAIP is required for mitotic DNA repair synthesis and for the prevention of anaphase chromosome bridges, which by extension suggests a requirement of stalled replisome disassembly for the completion of DNA replication in mitosis after replication stress, consistent with the models derived from the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system earlier. This study is of significant importance for the DNA replication and repair fields, providing critical experimental tests of existing hypotheses. A few suggestions are included below to make the manuscript stronger.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- It is necessary to quantify the intensity of the protein signal to appreciate differences between mutants that show the same phenotype but to different extents in Figure 1. That would be the case of CMG persistence on mitotic cells in <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi and <italic>npl-4</italic> + <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi cells or the barely detectable mCherry-H2B in <italic>rrn-1</italic> RNAi and <italic>npl-4</italic> + <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi cells. Authors could also consider quantifying the amount of CMG components on chromatin during S phase should be quantified to exclude that possibility.</p><p>- The authors show convincingly in Figure 2A and B that TRUL-1, but not LRR-1, is necessary to disassemble CMG from chromatin in the presence of replicative stress in <italic>rpa-1</italic> or <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi cells. However, this comparison is not made in Figure 2D in <italic>div-1</italic> mutant cells. This comparison is important to confirm previous observations.</p><p>- In Figure 3, authors clearly show the role of TRAIP in MiDAS. However, it would be important to link this phenomenon to the CMG disassembly from the chromatin to prove that upon these experimental conditions in U2OS cells, CMG components are retained in chromatin. In addition, TRAIP, but not LRR1, is involved in CMG disassembly when replication is not completed. In that sense, it is also important to show that LRR1 absence does not reduce MiDAS to confirm the observations made in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>- There is no evidence that human TRAIP leads to helicase stabilisation on unreplicated or even fully replicated chromatin. Therefore, it is not clear whether the phenotypes observed after TRAIP siRNA in human cells are due to helicase issues or another function of this protein, such as fork progression (Harley et al., 2016 and Hoffman et al., 2016). This could limit the impact of the study, so please discuss how this uncertainty affects your conclusions.</p><p>- In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, TRAIP is required (with <italic>lrr-1</italic>) for mitotic helicase unloading. The authors show here that failure to unload the helicase in normal cell cycles leads to anaphase bridges (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). It is therefore unclear whether the genome instability that arises from loss of TRAIP in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or humans is due to incomplete replication, failure to unload the helicase or some other function of this ligase. It would be good to clarify this further or modify the message accordingly.</p><p>- We appreciate that it is difficult to get a graded amount of replication stress in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but the three types of stress here (RPA1 Rnai, Rnr1 RNAi and <italic>div-1</italic>) all give different results with helicase unloading and Trul-1 loss (Figure 2A, B and D). A useful experiment would be to use a titration of a replication inhibitor such as HU (see Brauchle et al., 2003).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48686.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- It is necessary to quantify the intensity of the protein signal to appreciate differences between mutants that show the same phenotype but to different extents in Figure 1.

Authors could also consider quantifying the amount of CMG components on chromatin during S phase should be quantified to exclude that possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present quantification of the GFP-PSF-1, GFP-SLD-5 and GFP-CDC-45 signals on metaphase chromatin (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, G-H), expressed as a percentage of the <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi control (which we set to 100%).</p><p>Moreover, Figure 1—figure supplement 1E now presents quantification of the mCherry-Histone-H2B signal during metaphase, expressed as a percentage of the no RNAi control (which we set to 100%). This illustrates the point that we made in the text, namely that the mCherry-Histone-H2B signal is specifically reduced to a barely detectable level upon co-depletion of <italic>rnr-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic>.</p><p>It was not possible to quantify the amount of CMG on chromatin during S-phase in these experiments, as the assay is dependent upon chromatin condensation during mitosis (otherwise we would just be quantifying the total nuclear signal). Though quantification during S-phase would be very interesting, this would require future development of alternative approaches, such as FRET between two different CMG components that only come together at replication forks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors show convincingly in Figure 2A and B that TRUL-1, but not LRR-1, is necessary to disassemble CMG from chromatin in the presence of replicative stress in rpa-1 or rnr-1 RNAi cells. However, this comparison is not made in Figure 2D in div-1 mutant cells. This comparison is important to confirm previous observations.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewers, the assays in Figure 2A-B show that TRUL-1, but not LRR-1, is required for CMG disassembly upon replication stress (RNAi to <italic>rpa-1</italic> or <italic>rnr-1</italic>).</p><p>The experiments in Figure 2C-E then explore the physiological significance of the TRUL-1 pathway, by combining <italic>trul-1∆</italic> with a mild form of replication stress produced by the <italic>div-1(or148)</italic> mutation, and monitoring synthetic phenotypes (synthetic lethality in Figure 2C, synthetic condensation / replication defect in Figure 2D, and synthetic induction of chromatin bridges in Figure 2E).</p><p>The key point for these experiments is that deletion of <italic>trul-1</italic> is not lethal (our data in this manuscript), and does not itself induce DNA replication or perturb cell cycle progression (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In contrast, inactivation of <italic>lrr-1</italic> causes embryonic lethality and DNA replication stress (Merlet et al., 2010). This makes it much harder to interpret the impact of <italic>lrr-1</italic> RNAi on viability and genome integrity in combination with <italic>div-1(or148)</italic>.</p><p>In our unpublished work, we have shown that diluted <italic>lrr-1</italic> RNAi does not cause synthetic lethality with <italic>div-1(or148</italic>), in contrast to the combination of <italic>trul-1∆</italic> with <italic>div-1(or148)</italic> (we diluted <italic>lrr-1</italic> RNAi to a point that we previously showed is viable in wild type, but is lethal in combination with depletion of a factor called UBXN-3: Sonneville et al., 2017). Conversely, 100% <italic>lrr-1</italic> RNA causes a synthetic DNA replication stress phenotype with <italic>div-1(or148)</italic>. However, both of these results are very hard to interpret, for the reasons given above.</p><p>So we prefer in the revised manuscript to discuss briefly these complications, citing the past work of Merlet et al., 2010, from the group of Lionel Pintard. We now do so on in the subsection “TRAIP preserves genome integrity and promotes survival in response to DNA replication stress”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 3, authors clearly show the role of TRAIP in MiDAS. However, it would be important to link this phenomenon to the CMG disassembly from the chromatin to prove that upon these experimental conditions in U2OS cells, CMG components are - in chromatin. In addition, TRAIP, but not LRR1, is involved in CMG disassembly when replication is not completed. In that sense, it is also important to show that LRR1 absence does not reduce MiDAS to confirm the observations made in C. elegans.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 that depletion of LRR1 in human U2OS cells does not reduce MiDAS (subsection “TRAIP is required for FANCD2 focus formation and mitotic DNA repair synthesis at common fragile sites in human cells”).</p><p>Though we agree that it will be important to develop assays with which to monitor CMG disassembly in human cells, this was not possible within the two-month review period for this manuscript. Nevertheless, in another unpublished project with mouse ES cells, we have found in the last few months that LRR1 mediates the S-phase pathway of CMG helicase disassembly, whereas TRAIP drives mitotic CMG disassembly. This indicates that the roles of LRR1 and TRAIP are well conserved amongst diverse metazoa including mammals. So it is highly likely that the role of human TRAIP in MiDAS does indeed reflect its role in a mitotic pathway of CMG helicase disassembly.</p><p>We now refer to these data in the subsection &quot;TRAIP is required for FANCD2 focus formation and mitotic DNA repair synthesis at common fragile sites in human cells</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There is no evidence that human TRAIP leads to helicase stabilisation on unreplicated or even fully replicated chromatin. Therefore, it is not clear whether the phenotypes observed after TRAIP siRNA in human cells are due to helicase issues or another function of this protein, such as fork progression (Harley et al., 2016 and Hoffman et al., 2016). This could limit the impact of the study, so please discuss how this uncertainty affects your conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we now refer to unpublished data in mouse ES cells, showing that mammalian TRAIP is responsible for a mitotic pathway that extracts the CMG helicase from chromatin (subsection &quot;TRAIP is required for FANCD2 focus formation and mitotic DNA repair synthesis at common fragile sites in human cells&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In C. elegans, TRAIP is required (with lrr-1) for mitotic helicase unloading. The authors show here that failure to unload the helicase in normal cell cycles leads to anaphase bridges (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). It is therefore unclear whether the genome instability that arises from loss of TRAIP in C. elegans or humans is due to incomplete replication, failure to unload the helicase or some other function of this ligase. It would be good to clarify this further or modify the message accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>In both worms and human cells lacking TRAIP, we only observe genome instability in combination with DNA replication stress. In human cells lacking TRAIP and subjected to replication stress, the accumulation during mitosis of DNA bridges coated with the PICH ATPase, together with the accumulation of 53BP bodies in the subsequent G1-phase, indicate that genome instability results from a failure to complete DNA replication (likely due to the failure of MiDAS, in turn due to the failure to disassemble CMG during mitosis). At this stage, we cannot exclude that TRAIP also has other functions when cells enter mitosis with incomplete DNA replication, and we now discuss this fact in the subsection “TRAIP is required for FANCD2 focus formation and mitotic DNA repair synthesis at common fragile sites in human cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- We appreciate that it is difficult to get a graded amount of replication stress in C. elegans, but the three types of stress here (RPA1 Rnai, Rnr1 RNAi and div-1) all give different results with helicase unloading and Trul-1 loss (Figure 2A, B and D). A useful experiment would be to use a titration of a replication inhibitor such as HU (see Brauchle et al., 2003).</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that this was an interesting idea, but Brauchle et al. injected worms with HU, and we felt that this would have made it difficult to achieve reproducible data in a titration experiment. Therefore, we took an alternative approach to generating a milder form of DNA replication stress, by titration of <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 5, 10% <italic>rnr-1</italic> RNAi in <italic>trul-1∆</italic> worms produced a similar phenotype to the combination of <italic>trul-1</italic> RNAi with the <italic>div-1(or148ts)</italic> mutant, leading to an accumulation of chromatin bridges and a condensation defect in the AB cell. These data are now discussed on in the subsection “TRAIP preserves genome integrity and promotes survival in response to DNA replication stress”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
