pre-initiation complex (PIC) and its subsequent scanning require the removal of the secondary structure of the by RNA helicases such as eIF4A. However, the topology and mechanics of the scanning complex bound to mRNA (48S-PIC) and the influence of its solvent-side composition on the scanning process are poorly known. Here, we found that the ES6S region of the 48S-PIC constitutes an extended binding channel for eIF4A-mediated unwinding of mRNA and scanning. Blocking ES6S inhibited the cap-dependent translation of mRNAs that have structured 5′ UTRs (including G-quadruplexes), many of which are involved in signal transduction and growth, but it did not affect IRES-driven translation. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation revealed a great diversity in ES6S-mediated scanning dependency. Our data suggest that mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning by 48S PIC slower but more processive. Hence, we propose a topological and functional model of the scanning 48S-PIC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ES6S region</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>scanning</kwd><kwd>mRNA secondary structure</kwd><kwd>G quadruplex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2013-45003-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ventoso</surname><given-names>Iván</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-84955-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ventoso</surname><given-names>Iván</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ES6S region of the small subunit ribosome makes a place for the threading and secondary structure unwinding of mRNA, which regulates genome-wide translation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation initiation of eukaryotic mRNA generally follows the scanning mechanism, which starts with the attachment of an activated 40S ribosomal subunit (43S preinitiation complex; PIC) to the cap structure of mRNA (forming the 48S-PIC), and the movement of the resulting complex along the 5′ UTR of mRNA to locate the initiation codon (TIS, generally AUG). This process directly depends on the extent to which a particular mRNA recruits the PIC, but also on the degree of RNA secondary structure (classical dsRNA and G-quadruplexes) found in its 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kozak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1985</xref>). To locate the TIS, the 48S-PIC must inspect the mRNA sequence codon-by-codon in the decoding groove of 40S neck (also known as the mRNA channel), which includes P and A sites for aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Thus, mRNA molecules must enter the channel in a single-stranded form, which requires prior unwinding by the RNA helicases associated with the 48S-PIC.</p><p>eIF4A is the main helicase that removes local secondary structure by alternating cycles of binding and dissociation from the mRNA during the scanning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svitkin et al., 2001</xref>). eIF4A binds eIF4G to form the eIF4F complex together with eIF4E, which collectively promotes activation of the mRNA, recruitment of the PIC and the scanning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-García et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, other RNA helicases such as yeast Ded-1 (and perhaps its mammalian ortholog DDX-3), DHX-29, DHX-36 and DHX-9 have been reported to assist in the RNA unwinding and scanning of specific mRNA subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pisareva et al., 2008</xref>). It is thought that eIF4F binding to the cap removes the eventual secondary structure near the 5′ extreme of the mRNA (activation) to favor recruitment of the PIC. Recent data support the notion that mRNA is threaded into the channel from the solvent side of the 40S subunit through a chain of cooperative interactions involving eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF3-40S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). The scaffold protein eIF4G can bind both eIF3 (as part of the PIC) and the 40S subunit itself near the feet of the solvent side, thus promoting the attachment of PIC to mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LeFebvre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). However, little is known about the topology of the 48S-PIC, in part because its presumably dynamic nature has limited the use of cryo-EM reconstruction, which has successfully resolved more stable complexes including the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erzberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marintchev et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, the helicase eIF4A has been located bound to alphaviral mRNA on the solvent side of the 48S-PIC assembled in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>). This would support a scanning complex model in which eIF4A is placed at the leading edge of the 40S subunit, thus ‘pulling’ the complex forward as it advances along the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marintchev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>). This model would also explain the greater dependence on eIF4A activity of mRNAs that have structured or long 5′ UTRs, many of which are involved in cell-cycle regulation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Modelska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>). For this reason, natural inhibitors of eIF4A are currently being tested as anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu and Pelletier, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The existence of RNA extensions such as ES6S and ES3S protruding from the solvent side of the 40S body, specifically in mammals, has been interpreted as a platform to recruit eIFs and other ligands, as described recently for ES27L of the 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knorr et al., 2019</xref>), although direct support for this idea has not yet been presented. The ES6S region is composed of four RNA helices near the feet of the 40S particle, which form a bundle of tentacle-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>). Two of these helices (ES6S<sup>A</sup> and ES6S<sup>B</sup>) project outward from the ribosome body, and comparative analysis of the 40S particle alone and in PIC or 80S complexes suggested that these helices can undergo some degree of conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). Moreover, because scanning is a unique capability of 40S that is not present in the bacterial 30S subunit, ES6S has been proposed to participate in the scanning process, at least for some viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toribio et al., 2016b</xref>). The existence of a conserved pattern of ES6S rRNA sequence complementary with eukaryotic mRNA 5′ UTRs also suggested a role for the ES6S region in mRNA loading onto PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pánek et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we detected the interaction of AUG-downstream nucleotides of alphaviral mRNAs with the ES6S region of the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). These viral mRNAs contain a highly stable RNA stem-loop structure (DLP) located 27–31 nt downstream of the AUG, so we were able to snapshot the eIF4A helicase bound to mRNA in 48S PICs assembled in vitro. In this work, we studied the role of ES6S in genome-wide scanning process by the 48S PIC using a combination of structural and functional analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The path of mRNA through the ES6S region of the 48S PIC</title><p>To explore the possibility that ES6S could represent a universal region of the 48S-PIC in which mRNA enters and unwinds, we systematically identified the contacts of mRNA with the 18S rRNA and 40S ribosomal proteins (RPSs) that are in or near ES6S region. To this end, we designed a synthetic 128-nt mRNA (unstructured) bearing a short (19 nt) 5′ UTR, a 3′ poly(A) tail and minimal secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for details). On the basis of previous observations with alphaviral mRNA, we introduced photo-activatable 4-thio-UTPs (4-thio-U) at positions +24, +27, +31 and +34 (downstream of the AUG) as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Sites that crosslink this mRNA with 18S rRNA were identified by reverse transcriptase termination site (RTTS) assay and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kielpinski et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left panel), which provided much higher sensitivity and coverage than the classical electrophoretic resolution in urea-polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). We included GMP-PNP in the assays to restrict the analysis to those interactions that occurred within the 48S-PIC. The vast majority of specific crosslinking sites mapped to within the nt 700–910 region of 18S RNA, concentrating in the ES6S<sup>E</sup> (nt 865–910), ES6S<sup>C–D</sup> (nt 795–864), ES6S<sup>B</sup> (nt 740–793) and ES6S<sup>A</sup> (nt 681–735) helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). No crosslinking with the inner residues of 18S rRNA was detected, indicating that mRNA contacted only surface-exposed regions. We found abundant contacts not only with the projected parts of ES6S, but also with residues that are at the base of these helices (e.g. residues 802–803 of helix C), embedded in the protein–RNA layer of the 40S body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This allowed us to draw an mRNA path through the ES6S region that extends from ES6S<sup>E</sup> to the distal loop of ES6S<sup>C–D</sup>, including the ES6S<sup>B</sup> and ES6S<sup>A</sup> helices, and that is flanked by ribosomal proteins such as eS7, eS4 and uS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In a parallel experiment, we also included a previously characterized mRNA based on the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) genome, which contains a single 4-thio-U at the 5′ flank (+27) of the DLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). SFV-DLP n27 mRNA generated a crosslinking pattern that is similar, though not identical, to that observed for unstructured mRNA. Specifically, the number of crosslinks to residues of the ES6S<sup>E</sup> and ES6S<sup>C-D</sup> helices increased in SFV-DLP n27 mRNA compared to unstructured mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of mRNA contacts with 18S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (RPSs) on the solvent side of the 48S-PIC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram representing the method used to identify mRNA-18S rRNA contacts by specific crosslinking of 4-thio-U, followed by reverse transcriptase termination site (RTTS) assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (left panel).

Attempts to detect proteins that are crosslinked to single 4-thio-U residues of mRNA by mass spectrometry (MS) failed, so unlabeled unstructured and SFV-DLP n27 mRNAs were used to assemble 48S-PICs that were subsequently crosslinked under a 254 nm lamp to detect RNA–protein contacts along the entire mRNA path. A similar pattern of crosslinked RPSs was observed for both mRNAs, with uS5 (formerly RPS2) the hit with the highest score and coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Crosslinking of uS5 at +11 nt downstream of the AUG has been previously reported in 48S-PICs assembled in vitro using a synthetic mRNA and purified 40S subunits and eIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pisarev et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, uS5 was localized between the mRNA entry channel and the ES6S region of the 40S subunit, extending about 48 Å along the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We also detected other crosslinked RPSs with lower scores, including some that were located either on the solvent side of the 40S subunit (uS3, uS4, eS4, eS6 and eS24), or on the intersubunit side near the decoding site (eS19) and at the mRNA exit channel (uS17).</p><p>In previous reports, we found that both eIF4A and eIF3g could be crosslinked with alphaviral mRNAs bearing the DLP structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we compared the crosslinking patterns generated by unstructured mRNAs, which lacks secondary structure, and SFV-DLP mRNAs labeled with [α-<sup>32</sup>P] and 4-thio-U after assembly into the 48S-PIC. Owing to their similar apparent molecular weight, eIF4A and eIF3g protein bands migrated as a doublet in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>). Both eIF4A and eIF3g bands were crosslinked with SFV-DLP n27 mRNA to a similar extent, whereas unstructured mRNA generated strong crosslinking with eIF3g and little (if any) with eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This was confirmed by denaturing immunoprecipitation (dIP) experiments with specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fact that unstructured mRNA generated no crosslinking with eIF4A is consistent with previous data showing the critical role of DLP structure in the trapping of eIF4A within the 48S-PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>). To map the placement of eIF4A in the 48S PIC more precisely, we systematically changed the position of 4-thio-U along the AUG-DLP stretch of SFV-DLP n27 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Maximum crosslinking with eIF3g was observed when 4-thio-U was placed +24 nt downstream of the AUG, whereas maximum crosslinking of eIF4A was achieved when 4-thio-U was placed at +27 nt. By modeling mRNA placement throughout the ES6S region of the 48S-PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toribio et al., 2018</xref>), we found that crosslinking of eIF3g at position +24 fit well with the suggested placement of eIF3g bound to eIF3b near ES6S<sup>A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">des Georges et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliseev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>).

Therefore, we decided to block ES6S by means of specific oligos targeting 18S rRNA, or by fusing RPSs surrounding the ES6S region to proteins that could sterically block this region. From among all the oligos tested, we selected oligo 4, which targets a partially single-stranded sequence in ES6S<sup>D</sup> that showed some inhibitory effects on translation of alphavirus mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). We determined the 3′ effective pairings of oligo 4 with ES6S<sup>D</sup> on native 40S particles by RNAse H assay, which allowed us to construct models of oligo 4 bound to the 40S particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all of these models, the 5′ extreme of oligo 4 is likely to be projected towards an open cavity that is delimited by ES6S<sup>B</sup>, ES6S<sup>A</sup>, uS19, uS4 and the C-terminus of eS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also conjugated fluorophores such as VIC, Texas Red (TR) and Fluorescein (FITC) to the 5′ end of oligo 4 to increase its blocking capacity and to facilitate its detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, we found the conditions for optimal oligo delivery into cells, which maximized transfection efficiency and reduced oligo aggregation, to increase its bioavailability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We transfected human (HEK293T, HeLa) and murine (MEF) cells with 70–90% efficiency. To confirm that oligo 4 bound to 18S rRNA properly in transfected cells, we carried out an ‘in situ’ RT-PCR amplification using the endogenous bound oligo 4 to prime retrotranscription of 18S rRNA isolated from transfected cells. PCR amplification of the resulting cDNA revealed that oligo 4 was bound to both 40S and 80S fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, lower right panel). Next, we analyzed the effect of VIC-oligo 4 on general translation by means of metabolic labeling with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met. Transfection of MEFs with VIC-oligo 4, but not with its unconjugated form, strongly inhibited protein synthesis at 12 hr post-transfection (hpt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, upper left panel). In these experiments, we also included oligo 5.4 (both VIC-conjugated and unconjugated), which targets helix ES6S<sup>B</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) without significantly affecting translation, showing that the effect of VIC-oligo 4 was specific.</p><p>To test the role of the fluorochrome in the inhibitory activity of VIC-oligo 4, we replaced VIC with FITC or TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, upper left panel), finding a similar degree of translation inhibition for all of the fluorochromes tested.

Plasmids encoding recombinant eS4 fused to different polypeptides were transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells, and their expression, incorporation into 40S particles and effect on translation were analyzed. Among the constructs tested, eS4 fused to EGFP was the one that gave the most consistent results.

Comparison of the distribution of endogenous eS4 and eS4–EGFP in sucrose gradients confirmed that eS4–EGFP was incorporated into 40S and 80S particles with the same efficiency as eS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, lower panel).

Clearly, protein synthesis was blocked by eS4–EGFP, to an extent comparable to that resulting from cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). To test whether the incorporation of eS4–EGFP into the 40S particle affected the binding of some eIF3 subunits (such as eIF3g, which binds eIF3b near ES6S<sup>A</sup> of 40S), we probed sucrose gradients with different antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), finding no significant differences in the distributions of the analyzed eIFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ES6S blockage differentially affects scanning-dependent translation</title><p>ES6S may represent an mRNA-threading region for the unwinding of the RNA secondary structure that is necessary for scanning, so we evaluated the effect of VIC–oligo 4 on the translation of luciferase (luc) mRNAs bearing 5′ UTRs of different lengths (33–656 nt) and secondary structure (ΔG° from −5 to −70 kcal.mol<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Translation of luc mRNAs bearing a long 5′ UTR (656 nt) or an average-sized 5′ UTR (121 nt) with a stable stem-loop structure (SL20) was dramatically impaired by VIC–oligo 4 transfection (50–80-fold inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

Interestingly, a similar but not identical effect on translation was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Whereas hipp, like VIC–oligo 4, reduced the accumulation of GRK2, AKT1 and CCND3 proteins, HRAS translation was not affected by hipp, and translation of eIF4B mRNA increased upon treatment with hipp, as also observed for TR–oligo 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These results suggest a partial functional overlap of the ES6S region and helicase eIF4A in the translation of specific mRNAs. To analyze this in more detail, we compared our data set with that published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Modelska et al. (2015)</xref> using human cells, in which the expression of eIF4A was silenced by interference. Notably, translation of these eIF4A-dependent mRNAs was also affected by VIC–oligo 4, and about half of the eIF4A-dependent mRNAs fell into our VIC–oligo-4-sensitive group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in comparing our data set with the available information on the genome-wide effects of eIF4A inhibition or downregulation, we find that ES6S blockage seems to have a wider impact on translation than eIF4A downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Modelska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We also tested the effect of the overexpression of two different eS4–EGFP fusion proteins on the accumulation of some representative proteins. Notably, translation of AKT-1 mRNA was strongly inhibited by eS4–EGFP overexpression, whereas the accumulation of GRK2 and HRAS proteins was less affected. A slight increase in eIF4B protein level was also observed upon transfection of eS4–EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This confirmed that ES6S blockage by both VIC–oligo 4 and eS4–EGFP resulted in comparable effects on translation. mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning slower but more processive.</p><p>To better understand the influence of the ES6S region on the scanning process, we studied the effect of VIC–oligo 4 on translation in vitro. As observed in transfected cells, the addition of VIC–oligo 4 to rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) drastically inhibited the translation of mRNAs bearing stable RNA stem-loops in their 5′ UTRs. However, for mRNAs with short and unstructured 5′ UTRs (63 nt and G-less), translation was unaffected or even stimulated by VIC–oligo 4 when reactions were measured at end-point times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). To better understand this, we analyzed the effect of FITC–oligo 4 in real-time translation experiments. Continuous recording of luc activity has been used to measure the time required to detect luc activity (full-translation time, FTT) and its dependence on scanning time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vassilenko et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, FTT increases linearly with 5′ UTR length, as the 48S-PIC requires more time to complete the scanning of the mRNA when a long 5′ is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vassilenko et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, FITC–oligo 4 accelerated the accumulation of luc activity in the reactions programmed with 5′ UTR G-less mRNA, and to a lesser extent in those programmed with 5′UTR 63 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). FITC–oligo 4 reduced the FTT of 5′ UTR G-less mRNA by 2 min, suggesting accelerated scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>In parallel experiments using highly structured 5′ UTR-SL20 mRNA, the addition of FITC–oligo 4 drastically reduced the accumulation of luc activity at every time point, although the FTT was not significantly altered, suggesting arrest rather than delay of scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Interestingly, addition of hipp to 5′ UTR-SL20 mRNA delayed the accumulation of luc activity, which followed a differently shaped curve than that observed for FITC–oligo 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In contrast to the addition of FITC–oligo 4, the addition of hipp increased the FTT by 2 min, suggesting a delay in the scanning process. Thus, the effect of eIF4A inhibition was similar but not identical to that observed for FITC–oligo 4 on mRNAs that have stable structures in their 5′ UTRs.</p><p>To further explore the functional links between the ES6S region and eIF4A, we tested the combined effect of VIC–oligo 4 and hipp on the translation of mRNA with stem-loop (5′ UTR-SL30) or G4 (5′ UTR-G4-1). To this end, we used suboptimal concentrations of VIC–oligo 4 that induced a moderate blockage of translation (2–3-fold), in combination with increasing concentrations of hipp. Clearly, the combination of VIC–oligo 4 and 0.3 μM hipp induced a dramatic synergistic inhibition of translation of 5′ UTR-SL30 mRNA (up to 60-fold), whereas the effect on 5′ UTR-G41 translation was less dramatic (12-fold inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the function of eIF4A helicase and the ES6S region converge during the initiation step.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>mRNA threading into the ES6S region slows down scanning but makes it more processive.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of FITC-oligo 4 on the translation of Luc mRNAs with different 5′ UTRs in RRL.

Rather than a narrow cleft like the decoding groove, the topology of the ES6S region resembles an open channel in which some differences in the accommodation of mRNA molecules are found. The presumed flexibility of ES6S extensions, especially of ES6S<sup>A</sup> and ES6S<sup>B</sup>, may assist in the placement of mRNAs according to their secondary structure content. These extensions are similar to the tentacle-like structures described recently for some ESs of the 60S subunit, which are involved in the recruitment of MetAP and NatA proteins to 80S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knorr et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, as eIF4G has been found to contact both ES6S<sup>E</sup> and ES6S<sup>B</sup> extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), direct participation of eIF4F in the accommodation of the mRNA in the ES6S region seems likely. Three lines of evidence presented here suggest that eIF4A helicase acts on the mRNA in the ES6S region: (1) crosslinking of eIF4A with mRNA was only detected when 4-thio-Us were placed in mRNA positions that fit in the ES6S region of 48S-PIC model; (2) Hipp and VIC–oligo 4 exhibited a strong inhibitory synergy when assayed on 5′ UTR-SL30 mRNA in vitro; and (3) ES6S blockage affected the translation of mRNAs with a 5′ UTR that is enriched in classical dsRNA structures and/or G4s, similar to that previously described when eIF4A activity was inhibited by drugs or silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Modelska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the exact placement of the eIF4A helicase bound to mRNA in the scanning complex could not yet be mapped, most probably because of the dynamic nature of eIF4A–mRNA interactions. Besides eIF4A, we also detected interaction of eIF3g with mRNA in the ES6S region, which fits well with its binding to eIF3b very close to the ES6S<sup>A</sup> helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">des Georges et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliseev et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, some mutations in the RNA-binding domain of eIF3g have shown decreased processivity of scanning of the structured 5′ UTRs of yeast mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cuchalová et al., 2010</xref>). The possibility that other RNA helicases, such as DDX3, DHX9 and DHX36, could also associate with the ES6S region to unwind dsRNA and G4 structures in mRNA deserves further investigation.</p><p>The blocking activity showed by oligo 4 was striking because it was only observed when relatively bulky molecules (such as VIC) were conjugated to its 5′ extreme. Although the exact arrangement of VIC–oligo 4 bound to 40S was not determined, the fluorophores probably project toward the cavity of the ES6S region, at least partially blocking it. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the binding of VIC–oligo 4 to the target sequence may also restrict the conformational changes that ES6S<sup>A</sup> and ES6S<sup>B</sup> helices have been shown to undergo during initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). The differential sensitivity of mRNAs to the translational blockage imposed by VIC–oligo 4 reveals the existence of a great diversity in mRNA-dependence for scanning. Thus, the translation of mRNAs with relatively long and structured 5′ UTRs (like CCND3, H-RAS and ODC-1) was impaired by ES6S blockage, whereas the translation of mRNAs with short and unstructured 5′ UTRs (like many 5′TOP mRNAs) was unaffected or even enhanced by VIC–oligo 4 transfection. This differential effect can be explained if we consider the ES6S region as a true threading path for mRNA that makes the scanning of the 48S-PIC slower but more processive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Thus, translation initiation of mRNAs with short and unstructured 5′ UTRs could be enhanced by blocking of ES6S, as PIC recruitment and scanning of these mRNAs does not require unwinding. Under ES6S blockage, these mRNAs could be threaded directly into the classical mRNA channel, bypassing the ES6S region and thus accelerating the scanning process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). In addition, these mRNAs could also better compete for translational machinery in the context of general shut-off induced by VIC–oligo 4. According to this, participation of the ES6S region in ribosomal attachment to mRNA would be dispensable, at least for some mRNAs with unstructured 5′ UTRs such as 5′ TOP mRNAs, which also show little or no requirement for eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). However, whether mRNA is threaded into the ES6S region during ribosomal attachment, or rather is slotted into the ES6S region once the 5′-cap has entered the classical mRNA channel is still an open question that deserves further investigation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the scanning 48S-PIC showing the path of mRNA through the ES6S region.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stem-loop (SL) and G4 (three layer square) represent elements of mRNA secondary structure; core eIF3 and some peripheral subunits (3b/3 g/3i) are shown.

The model represents an extreme situation upon ES6S blockage that excludes mRNA from the ES6S region. For mRNAs with short and unstructured 5′ UTRs, bypassing the ES6S region could accelerate the scanning process (upper). For scanning-dependent mRNAs with long and structured 5′ UTRs, exclusion from the ES6S region would cause the stacking of secondary structural elements at the mRNA entry channel (shown), dissociation of the 48S-PIC, or even the aberrant threading of folded structures into the decoding groove (not shown).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48246-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For mRNAs that have long and structured 5′ UTRs, ES6S blockage probably reduces the processivity of the scanning complex along the 5′ UTR. The stem-loop and G4 structures in the 5′ UTR of mRNAs that are not effectively unwound in the ES6S region would become stacked at the mRNA entry channel, resulting in stalling and/or dissociation of the 48S-PIC from the mRNA. Even if the 48S-PIC could bypass some stem-loops without unwinding, as previously observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abaeva et al., 2011</xref>), it is not clear whether these aberrant complexes would end up being productive. The DHX29 helicase located at the mRNA entry channel of PIC may also alleviate the eventual stacking of some RNA structures at the mRNA entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>), although its involvement in the genome-wide unwinding of stable stem-loops and G4s is unknown.</p><p>Finally, our data point out the ES6S region as a novel target for small molecules (oligos and aptamers) that could block the translation of specific mRNA subsets, for example those involved in signal transduction and oncogenesis that show extensive RNA structure in their 5′ UTR.

At the indicated times, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence (IF), infected with the indicated viruses or metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met/Cys for 1 hr and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ventoso et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>esiRNA-mediated interference</title><p>To silence the expression of eIF4A1 gene, HeLa cells (≈ 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> growing in 6-well plates) were transfected with 0.6 μg of esiRNA (EHU-11150–1, SIGMA) targeting human eIF4A1 mRNA (NM_001416), using INTEREFERin (PolyPlus) as facilitator. Three days later, the level of eIF4A1 protein was analyzed by WB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Polysome analysis and profiling</title><p>Two subconfluent p100 plates of MEF or one plate of HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated oligonucleotide for 12 hr and lysed in polysome buffer (Tris-HCl 30 mM [pH 7.5], 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100 and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide) for 10 min on ice. After three passages through a 22G needle, cell lysates were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and loaded on a 10–40% sucrose gradient prepared in polysome buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a SW-40 rotor for 3 hr at 4°C in a Beckman SW40.1 rotor and fractionated from the bottom using an ISCO fractionator coupled to a UV recorder. For protein analysis, fractions were extracted with a methanol-chloroform protocol and analyzed by WB with the indicated antibodies. For RNA analysis, fractions were extracted with phenol, ethanol precipitated and pooled in submonosomal (40S, 48S and 60S), monosomal (80S) and polysomal (&gt;2 ribosomes per mRNA) fractions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-seq and data processing</title><p>A total of 12 samples were prepared for sequencing. To track the dilutions made during the construction of RNA-seq libraries, 0.3 μL of 50X Mix 1 dilution of ERCC RNA spike-in mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Fisher) was added to the samples prior to rRNA depletion. The cDNA libraries were prepared with 1 μg of rRNA-depleted RNA using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, Inc). RNA-seq was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, and raw data quality control was generated using FastQC. We used the GRCh38 human genome release and Ensembl annotation for further analysis. Bowtie 1.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used with default parameters to remove rRNA reads, to estimate the differential dilution of the samples via the spike-in, and to align RNA reads. About 75% of reads were aligned in each sample. Alignments were refined with Hisat2 2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) using the –<italic>known-splicesite-infile</italic> parameter to define the intron limits. Read counting per gene was done with Featurecounts release 1.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). The library size and spike-in were used to normalize counts using the median of ratios method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The DESeq2 R package was used to estimate the translation efficiency (TE) of each sample and to compare TE between samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Love et al., 2014</xref>). We defined TE as the ratio of the mRNA abundance in the polysomal fraction divided by the abundance in the monosomal fraction. Change in TE was calculated as TE<sub>oligo 4</sub>/TE<sub>VIC–oligo4</sub> and expressed in log<sub>2</sub>fold change TE (FC TE). To generate the database with feature annotations for every mRNA, we integrated information from the Ensembl human 95 database with stable RefSeq ID, with Transcript Support Level (TSL) and APRIS annotation. We also incorporated experimental mapping of the +one transcription start site (TSSs) using the nanocage technique that was available for 2500 mRNAs of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandin et al., 2016</xref>). RNA secondary structures were predicted using the RNAfold 2.2.10 algorithm of the ViennaRNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). For the analysis, the minimum folding energy of the centroid structure was used, including G4s or not.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>UV crosslinking experiments</title><p>Crosslinking experiments using [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled mRNAs with photoreactive 4-thio-U were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>). 48S or 80S complexes were assembled with GMP-PNP or cycloheximide, respectively, and incubated at 30°C for 20 min. After crosslinking at 360 nm, lysates were centrifuged over a 20% sucrose cushion at 90,000 x g for 3 hr, and the whole ribosomal fraction (WRF) was resuspended in 50 μL of TE buffer. For protein analysis, samples were digested with RNAse A and T1 for 1 hr at 37°C before SDS-PAGE analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toribio et al., 2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mapping mRNA–18S rRNA contacts</title><p>To identify contacts between mRNA and 18S rRNA within the 48S PIC, a large-scale experiment using 0.5 ml of RRL and cold 4-thio-U labeled mRNAs was carried out. After UV crosslinking at 360 nm, the WRF was denatured in 500 μl buffer D (Tris-HCl 30 mM [pH 7.5], 0.5 M LiCl, 0.5% LiDS, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) and poly(A)+ mRNA was captured with oligo(dT) magnetic beads (NEB) under denaturing conditions. After extensive washing, RNA was eluted with 100 μl H<sub>2</sub>O and concentrated by ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. Captured 18S RNA that was crosslinked to mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcriptase termination site (RTTS) assays as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kielpinski et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, 18S rRNA was retrotranscribed with Superscript IV (Invitrogen) using 2 pmol of primer 3 followed by a 20 min digestion with RNAse H. The resulting cDNA population was purified with AMPURE beads and 3′ ligated to primer 3′ RTTS_adapter with CirLigase (Illumina). Then, a 30-cycle PCR with oligos 3′_adapter and RP_FWD was carried out, followed by a final 10-cycle PCR with oligo RP_FWD and oligos RP_REV_INDEX 5, 6, 7 or 12 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The resulting libraries were sequenced in a MiSeq system (Illumina), and reads were aligned to rabbit 18S rRNA with Bowtie 2 using the default parameters.

The WRF was obtained as above and denatured in a buffer containing Tris-HCl 50 mM (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT and 5% w/v SDS. After 5 min boiling, samples were kept on ice and slowly renatured in Tris-HCl 50 mM (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. Then, the extract was split and incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4°C.

The 3′ end of the resulting RNA fragments was polyadenylated with poly(A) polymerase (NEB) and retrotranscribed with oligo(dT) primer. Finally, the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligo(dT) and oligo 9 primers, and sequenced. Data confirmed that the final 6 nt at the 3′ end of oligo 4 remained unpaired, and that the first nt of 18S rRNA that paired with the oligo 4 was C835.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Western blot and immunofluorescence</title><p>Western blots were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ventoso et al., 2006</xref>) using the following primary antibodies: anti-RPS4X (sc-85133, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-RPS7 (sc-377317, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-RPS6 (sc-74576, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-eIF4A (STJ2724, St. John´s lab,), anti-eIF3g (STJ23512, St. John´s lab), anti-EGFP (11814460001, Roche), anti-eEF1A1 (2551, Cell Signaling), anti-AKT1 (9272, Cell Signaling), anti-ACTB (T-5168, Sigma), anti-eIF4b (sc-376062, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-HRas (sc-53959, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-CCND3 (sc-453, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-ODC1 (sc-398116, Santa Cruz Biotech.), anti-GRK2 (a gift from C.

mechanistic insight into the mechanism that explains the inverse correlation between mRNA 5'UTR G+C content/ ΔG and mRNA translation efficiency. It bolsters the model for the function of eIF4A in unwinding the mRNA 5' secondary structure to facilitate ribosome recruitment. They have documented the role of the ribosomal ES6S region in the control of ribosome scanning. They provide evidence that mRNA is threaded into the ES6S region of 48S pre-initiation complex (PIC), and unwound by the RNA helicase eIF4AI, rendering the 48S PIC more processive, particularly on mRNAs with long and structured 5´UTRs. It would be important in the future to distinguish between the activities of eIF4AI and eIF4AII because the functions of eIF4AI and eIF4AII are were suggested in some studies not to be equivalent.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An mRNA-threading channel in the ES6S region of the translation 48S-PIC promotes RNA unwinding and scanning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Nahum Sonenberg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that explores the role of a specific topological region of the ribosome in translation initiation. The authors performed experiments to interfere with the ES6S region of the 48S-PIC and report that this selectively blocks translation of mRNAs with structured 5' UTRs. They interpret their data to indicate that mRNAs that thread into this region are scanned slower and in a more processive manner than mRNAs that bypass this region. Overall this is a good study, but there are some weaknesses, including missing controls and interpretation of the experiments. The reviewers raised many important points, that you can see in the full reviews. The concerns listed below are the most critical.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Consistent with a previous study, the authors show that 4-thio-U crosslinking identifies an interaction between unstructured and viral mRNA with eIF3g and eIF4A. However, only eIF3g is found to crosslink to this region on the unstructured mRNA, raising a question about how general the position of eIF4A may be on non-viral mRNAs.</p><p>2) A major weakness of the study is that the authors have not directly shown whether the oligo-fluorophore conjugate that is complementary to ES6Sd and EGFP-eS4 actually inhibits the interaction of the mRNA and the ES6S region. All interpretations of the experiments assume this, but this should be directly tested using the 4-thio-U crosslinking experiment in the presence of the oligo and EGFP-eS4.</p><p>3) The authors monitor the rate of luciferase translation in the presence of oligo and hippuristanol in Figure 7. The delay in appearance of LUC protein and the synergistic inhibition is interpreted to mean that scanning rates are slower. This seems a bit of a strong statement for an assay that only monitors the rate of luciferase translation. Without additional evidence that more rigorously tests the rate of &quot;scanning&quot;, the authors should significantly tone down the interpretation of this experiment (that mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning slower but more processive).</p><p>The evidence for mRNA &quot;threading&quot; model in this study is not very strong. The claim that eIF4A may function in the ES6S region to unwind duplex regions should be qualified, as the eIF4A crosslink is only studied in the presence of viral mRNAs.</p><p>4) The appropriate control for Figure 3—figure supplement 2B would be VIC-oligo C.</p><p>5) Does GFP tagging of another ribosomal protein yield the same results as eS4-EGFP?</p><p>6) Figure 4A. How do the mRNAs, including HCV IRES respond to VIC-oligo C (the control)? This negative control is missing. The sequences of the 5' UTRs of the reporters used here are shown as some computer printout in Supplementary file 1 in a few crude ways with no attempt to make this reader-friendly – this should be corrected. Please confirm that there are no upstream AUGs in any of the reporters used, as this could confound interpretations (by my visual scan there didn't appear to be).</p><p>7) The authors do not specify whether the antibody they used for IP in the cross-linking experiments is anti-4AI or 4AII. This was neither done in their previous paper (Toribio et al., 2018). Because the functions of eIF4AI and eIF4AII are not equivalent, it is important to show which eIF4A is studied in this paper, and some discussion about the different functions of 4AI and II would be very informative to the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper provides a strong mechanistic insight towards the understanding of the inverse correlation between mRNA 5'UTR G+C content/ ΔG and mRNA translation efficiency. It provides further support for the function of eIF4A in unwinding the mRNA 5' secondary structure to facilitate ribosome recruitment. However, it is surprising that the authors have not made use of their excellent experimental system to distinguish between the activities of eIF4AI and eIF4AII. In fact, they do not specify whether the antibody they used for IP in the cross-linking experiments is anti-4AI or 4AII. This was neither done in their previous paper (Toribio et al., 2018).

This is also a good opportunity for the authors to test how systematically increasing structure tracks with translational efficiency using this assay. As well, the analysis of the effect of length on efficiency should be more systematically analyzed here. As it stands, the authors have not taken full advantage of the potential of this assay to strengthen their cause.</p><p>- Figure 4A.

The panel is not properly mounted.

The Rubio and Wolfe studies using rocaglates probably should not be cited here since these cause clamping of 4A to RNA, hence they do not lead to only a loss of 4A activity since the clamped complexes themselves can interfere with translation (see PMID 27309803).</p><p>- Do all constructs yield the same final levels of Luciferase in the FTT assay? Why is the area under the curves in Figure 7c between the two conditions very different? Is this reflective of more/less mRNA being translated? Where is the FITC-oligo C control?</p><p>- I am not sure how to interpret Figure 7D. The authors indicate that they utilize suboptimal concentrations of VIC-oligo-4 to induce a moderate block of translation (2-3 fold). Since to get an effect of VIC-oligo4 you only need one oligo bound to the ribosomal target, it means there is a pool of ribosomes that are also not bound by the oligo. I am not sure what exactly the &quot;synergy obtained with hipp means – does it mean synergistic effects with those ribosomes having a bound VIC-oligo-4, or does it mean hipp is acting on those ribosomes not having a VIC-oligo 4 bound and exerting an effect unrelated to the ES6S region and this is being &quot;scored&quot; as a synergistic effect. Where are the controls with VIC-oligo C.</p><p>- The authors refer to the synthetic 128-nt mRNA as &quot;flat&quot;. This is somewhat vernacular and the authors might want to change this to a more scientifically appropriate label.</p><p>- Subsection “The path of mRNA through the ES6S region of the 48S PIC”. The authors write &quot;According to our data, eIF4A may be placed a bit further downstream, probably between the ES6SA 179 and ES6SB 180 helices (Figure 2C).&quot; I don't see in Figure 2c, where the ES6SA and ES6SB sites are indicated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have two major findings that could potentially transform our understanding of mRNA recruitment.</p><p>Firstly, the authors have shown that 4-thio-U crosslinking of the +24 to +34 region of an mRNA occurs around the ES6S region of the 40S subunit (within the 48S PIC). This is obtained using a short unstructured mRNA and GMP-PNP. Consistent with this, non-specific UV crosslinking also reveals interactions between the mRNA and eS4/uS4, which is generally consistent with the ES6S interaction region. Consistent with a previous study, the authors show that 4-thio-U crosslinking identifies an interaction between unstructured and viral mRNA with eIF3g and eIF4A. This crosslinking occurs in the same mRNA region that crosslinks to the ES6S region suggesting that eIF3g and eIF4A are located in this area in the 48S PIC. However, only eIF3g is found to crosslink to this region on the unstructured mRNA, raising a question about how general the position of eIF4A may be on non-viral mRNAs.</p><p>The second major finding is that perturbation of the ES6S region, either by an oligo-fluorophore conjugate that is complementary to ES6Sd or by an EGFP fused eS4 protein (located near ES6S), leads to reduced translation rates. This is shown using reporter mRNAs as well as on a genome wide scale. Interestingly, inhibition of translation is evident on mRNAs harboring highly structured and/or long 5'UTRs (including G quadruplex containing 5'UTRs). The specificity of inhibition is controlled for by using the same oligo without the fluorophore or to an oligo that is complementary to a different rRNA region.</p><p>The main weakness of the study is that the authors have not directly shown whether the oligo conjugate and EGFP-eS4 actually inhibits the interaction of the mRNA and the ES6S region.

Without additional evidence that more rigorously tests the rate of &quot;scanning&quot;, the authors should significantly tone down the interpretation of this experiment (that mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning slower but more processive).</p><p>This reviewer doesn't really see strong evidence for mRNA &quot;threading&quot; model from this study. The claim that eIF4A may function at the ES6S region to unwind duplex regions also seems over interpreted – as far as I can see, the eIF4A crosslink only seems to occur in the presence of viral mRNAs.</p><p>Overall this is an interesting study, but some major weaknesses with interpretation of the experiments does lower enthusiasm somewhat.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An mRNA-binding channel in the ES6S region of the translation 48S-PIC promotes RNA unwinding and scanning&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: There is one concern that was not adequately addressed.

Also, this information is not presented in the material and methods section and they keep refereeing to eIF4A throughout the paper.</p><p>It is important to address this issue because the existing confusing literature that claims that eIF4AII exhibits an antagonistic function to eIF4AI muddles the literature.

As the reviewer points out, eIF4AI binds the EMCV and PV IRES (together with eIF4G and other proteins) to actively prepare the mRNA for 43S-PIC attachment. Importantly, this &quot;activation&quot; step occurs before ribosomal attachment so that it would not be affected by the presence of VIC-oligo 4. Since EMC and PV mRNAs do not require scanning (or a minimal scanning for PV mRNA), translation of these mRNAs would be largely independent of ES6S-associated unwinding activity of eIF4A that promotes scanning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A; The ribosome profile in the polysome region appears abnormal.

Unfortunately, eS7-GFP fusion accumulated at very low levels in transfected cells and it hardly incorporated into the 40S subunit (results not shown). Due to design limitations, we have not explored any further RPSs for GFP tagging.However, tagging RPSs does not necessarily affect translation as demonstrated using the Halo Tag technology for tagging RACK1 or RPS9 with a protein similar in mass to EGFP (Gallo et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Shouldn't there be a length control for SL20 in Figure 4A?

When we combined VIC-oligo 4 and hipp, the dramatic synergistic effect found obviously corresponded to those 48S PIC having bound VIC-oligo and hipp. If not, a simple additive (but not synergistic) effect would be expected. However, we cannot rule out that some of this additive effect can also contribute to the final effect of VIC-oligo 4+ hipp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The authors refer to the synthetic 128-nt mRNA as &quot;flat&quot;.

No eIF4A crosslinking was detected when SL of mRNA was removed, or when experiments were programmed with unstructured (flat) mRNA, suggesting that the presence of stable structures downstream the AUG, rather the viral or non-viral origin of mRNAs, allowed the detection of eIF4A-RNA interaction.

This result not only confirms that mRNA interacts with elements of ES6S region, but also that ES6S blocking accelerates the formation of 48S complex on mRNAs with unstructured 5´UTR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors monitor rate of luciferase translation in the presence of oligo and hippuristanol in Figure 7. The delay in appearance of LUC protein and the synergistic inhibition is interpreted to mean that scanning rates are slower. This seems a bit of a strong statement for an assay that only monitors the rate of luciferase translation. Without additional evidence that more rigorously tests the rate of &quot;scanning&quot;, the authors should significantly tone down the interpretation of this experiment (that mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning slower but more processive).</p><p>This reviewer doesn't really see strong evidence for mRNA &quot;threading&quot; model from this study. The claim that eIF4A may function at the ES6S region to unwind duplex regions also seems over interpreted – as far as I can see, the eIF4A crosslink only seems to occur in the presence of viral mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement that mRNA threading into the ES6S region makes scanning slower but more processive is based not only on results fromin vitro FTT experiments, but also on data using reporter mRNAs with 5´UTR of different lengths and genome-wide polysome profiling. In our opinion, the mRNA threading concept is the simplest and most plausible explanation to the results described here. The new data included in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 further supports this idea. Anyway, to be more conservative, we replaced the term threading for binding in the title and in the summary of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: There is one concern that was not adequately addressed.

The authors should alert the readers to this.</p></disp-quote><p>To clear up doubts about the specificity of the eIF4A1 antibody used in our manuscript (STJ27247 from St. John's lab), we have silenced the expression of human eIF4A1 gene in HeLa cells. A permanent silencing using lentivirus expressing shRNAs was impossible in our hands, probably because eIF4A1 is essential for cell proliferation. So, we carried out a transient silencing by means of esiRNA specific for human eIF4A1 mRNA, and the resulting cell extracts were probed with the antibody cited above. As shown in the new panel b of Figure 2—figure supplement 1, a reduction in the intensity of the 48 kDa protein band was observed, being consistent with the observed transfection efficiency (60-70%). This result shows that STJ27247 antibody is specific for eIF4A1. We have modified the text (figure legend of figure supplement and Materials and methods section) accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
