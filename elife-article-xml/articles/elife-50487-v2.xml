during development in multiple organs including the lung. Previous studies on the role of Notch in the lung focused mostly on Notch pathway core components or receptor-specific functions. It is unclear, however, how Jagged or Delta-like ligands collectively or individually (Jag1, Jag2, Dll1, Dll4) influence differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors. Using mouse genetic models we show major differences in Jag and Dll in regulation and establishment of cell fate. Jag ligands had a major impact in balancing distinct cell populations in conducting airways, but had no role in the establishment of domains and cellular abundance in the neuroendocrine (NE) microenvironment. Surprisingly, Dll ligands were crucial in restricting cell fate and size of NE bodies and showed an overlapping role with Jag in differentiation of NE-associated secretory (club) cells. These mechanisms may potentially play a role in human conditions that result in aberrant NE differentiation, including NE hyperplasias and cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells communicate with each other by sending messages through a range of signaling pathways. One of the ways cells signal to each other is through a well-studied pathway known as Notch. In this pathway, cells display molecules on their surface, known as Notch ligands, that can activate Notch receptor proteins on the surface of neighboring cells. Once the Notch receptors bind to these ligands, they trigger various responses inside the cell. Notch ligands exist in two different families: Delta-like (Dll) ligands and Jagged (Jag) ligands.</p><p>The layer of cells that lines the airways in the lungs consists of several different cell types. These include secretory cells that produce the fluid covering the airway surface, multiciliated cells, and neuroendocrine cells. Together these cells work as a barrier to protect the lung from environmental particles that may be breathed in. Additionally, the lung also has multipotent progenitor cells, which can become any of the other types.</p><p>When Notch signaling is missing from the lung during embryonic development, not enough secretory cells are made, while other cell types are made in excess. This is because the multipotent progenitor cells need to communicate via Notch signaling to decide what type of cell to become and keep the right proportion of different cell types in the airways. In other organs, multipotent progenitors can become different types of cells depending on whether Notch signaling was activated by Dll or by Jag ligands, but it was unknown if this also happened in the lungs.</p><p>Stupnikov et al. investigated the situation in the airways during development by looking at where and when Dll and Jag ligands first appeared, and by inactivating the genes that code for these ligands. They found that Jag ligands appeared well before Dll ligands, and that when the genes coding for Jag ligands were inactivated, more ciliated cells were produced. By contrast, loss of Dll ligands resulted in an increase in the neuroendocrine and their associated secretory cells, with little effect on the multiciliated cells. This increase resembled what is seen in some human diseases.</p><p>The results suggest that the diversity of Notch effects in the airways depends on which Notch ligand is locally available. These observations may help to understand the mechanism of certain diseases involving neuroendocrine cells in the lung, such as small cell carcinoma or bronchial carcinoid tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Jagged</kwd><kwd>Delta</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine</kwd><kwd>lung development</kwd><kwd>airway differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-HL135834-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>Wellington V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch ligands from the Delta and Jagged families have distinct roles in epithelial progenitor cell fate of extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways and differentially restrict expansion of the neuroendocrine microenvironment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Notch signaling is a major regulator of progenitor cell fate and differentiation during organogenesis, repair-regeneration, and cancer. In mammals, four Notch receptors (Notch1â4) and five ligands (Delta-like: Dll1, Dll3 and Dll4 and Jagged: Jag1 and Jag2) have been described. All ligands, except Dll3, are Notch activating. Signaling is triggered by ligand-receptor binding through cell-cell interactions, which leads to sequential cleavage of the Notch receptor and binding of its intracellular domain (NICD) to a CSL/RBPJk-activator complex for activation of downstream target genes, such as HEY/HES-family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Radtke and Raj, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray, 2006</xref>). While differentÂ Notch receptors are known to act in a variety of biological processes, evidence from genetic studies suggest that the Notch effects are not necessarily dependent on the type of NICD but rather of NICD dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, specific Notch ligand-receptor binding in mammalian cells appears to be mostly non-selective or context-dependent.</p><p>Interestingly, systemicÂ deletion of <italic>Jag1, Jag2</italic>, or <italic>Dll4</italic> has been shown to result in distinct phenotypes, suggesting that these ligands could mediate unique functions not entirely due to the receptor they activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Souza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, Notch ligands were reported to activate distinct targets even through binding to the same Notch receptor and ligand-specific effects have been observed in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nandagopal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The Notch pathway plays a crucial role in the developing lung. When airways are still forming epithelial progenitors initiate a differentiation program that gives rise to secretory (club, goblet), multiciliated, and neuroendocrine (NE) cells. Previous studies addressing the role of Notch in the lung focused largely on central components of this pathway (Rbpjk, Pofut1, and Hes1). Disruption of Rbpjk or the o-fucosyl-transferase Pofut1Â required for Notch signaling results in aberrant expansion of multiciliated and NE cells at the cost of secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morimoto et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that club cells are more sensitive to deficiency in Notch2 while NotchÂ 1-3Â receptors contribute to control the NE population in an additive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>). However, it was unclearÂ whether individual ligand families (Delta-like and Jagged) or specific ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) influence distinct aspects of differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors. Notably, these ligands have been reported in partially overlapping but also distinct domains in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Post et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mori et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we explored the role of ligands using single and double conditional Jagged and Delta-like null alleles targeted to epithelial progenitors from early lung development. We show remarkably distinct roles of these ligands in the developing intra- and extrapulmonary airways and in the control of the expansion and differentiation of the NE microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Jagged ligands precede the appearance of Delta-likeÂ ligands in differentiating airway progenitors</title><p>Although the expression patterns of Jag and Dll have been reported in both epithelial and mesenchymal layers of the developing lung, specific information about their onset of expression and regional distribution in the epithelial compartment at early stages of differentiation has been scattered and not well integrated to functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Post et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>). To gain further insights into this issue we revisited the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of Notch ligands when epithelial cells are initiating commitment to different cell fates in developing airways.</p><p>By in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis none of these ligands were detectable in the airway epithelium prior to or at E11.5 (not shown). However, at around E12.0 evidence of <italic>Jag2</italic> epithelial signals in the developing trachea made it the first of all Notch ligands to be induced in the differentiation program of airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Expression progressed in a proximal-to-distal fashion; at E12.5 low level signals were detected in the epithelium of extrapulmonary but not intrapulmonary airways. This contrasted with the strong <italic>Jag2</italic> signals present in the esophageal epithelium and in neighboring vascular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, the <italic>Jag2</italic> detection in epithelial progenitors of the trachea and extrapulmonary airways coincided with the previously reported onset of Notch activation and appearance of the secretory cell marker <italic>Scgb3a2</italic> locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guha et al., 2012</xref>). No epithelial <italic>Jag1</italic> could be detected anywhere in airways at these stages, although clearly present in vascular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data supported the idea of a Jag2-Notch program giving rise to secretory cell precursors as one of the earliest events initiating differentiation in airways, even preceding the appearance of pulmonary NE cells (PNEC) reported to beginÂ only within a day later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Linnoila, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo and Krasnow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sui et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, expression of <italic>Ascl1</italic>, which marks PNEC precursors, was first foundÂ ~E13-13.5 in large intrapulmonary airways and both <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Dll4</italic> were then subsequently expressed in these precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,D</xref>). By E13.5-E14.5 strong <italic>Jag2</italic> epithelial signals were seen throughout the trachea and main bronchi, in contrast to <italic>Jag1</italic>, nearly undetected at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). At E14.5 NEBs and PNECs were sharply demarcated by Ascl1, and <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Dll4</italic> transcripts became prominently expressed in NEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâF</xref>). This was accompanied by the appearance of clusters of cells adjacent to NEBs, collectively marked by expression of the uroplakin <italic>Upk3a</italic>, the cell surface stem cell (secretory) marker SSEA1, the secretoglobin Scgb3a2 and low levels of theÂ cytochromeÂ geneÂ <italic>Cyp2f2</italic> and CC10.Â TheÂ patternÂ was consistent with the initiation of a Notch-dependent program of secretory cells in the NEB microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guha et al., 2012</xref> and described later).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Jag and Dll ligands arise in distinct spatial and temporal patterns in airway epithelial progenitors undergoing cell fate commitment.</title><p>In situ hybridization of E12-E14.5 lungs.

Inactivation of Jag1 in epithelial progenitors of intrapulmonary airways undergoing branching morphogenesis using aÂ surfactantÂ protein-c (<italic>Sftpc</italic>)-<italic>tet</italic>-<italic>O</italic> system was shown to disrupt epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), confirming the previously reported role of Notch signaling in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morimoto et al., 2010</xref>). Although efficient, in this targeting strategy Cre-mediated recombination was restricted to intrapulmonary airways,Â initiatingÂ at theÂ onset of <italic>Sftpc</italic> expression in secondary buds (~E10.5). Thus, information about a putative role of Jag1 in extrapulmonary airways (trachea, main bronchi) and at stages prior to E10.5 was missing. Moreover, little was known about how Jag2 influences lung development and whether there is any functional overlap between Jag2 and Jag1. Jag2 systemic knockout animals die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>). Lastly, no information was available about compensation of Jag by other ligands during epithelial differentiation.</p><p>We used the Shh-cre line to inactivate Jag1 and Jag2 individually or in combination in early epithelial progenitors of both extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary at the onset of lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>). Jag1<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Shh<sup>cre/+</sup> (Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>), Jag2<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Shh<sup>cre/+</sup> (Jag2<sup>cnull</sup>) and double (Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup>) null mutants were analyzed at early (E14.5) and late (E18.5) stages of airway differentiation. Gross morphological analysis of the mutant lungs showed no notable macroscopic difference in size or shape (not shown). We compared the effects of Jag1 and Jag2 lossÂ in multiciliated-secretory cell fate selection at E18.5, once differentiated cell profiles were largely established in extrapulmonary (trachea) and intrapulmonary (lung) airways. qPCR analysis of E18.5 lung homogenates showed significant changes in markers of epithelial differentiation in all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Expression of the secretory markers Scgb3a2 and Scgb1a1 (encoding CC10) were reduced by 86.2% (p=5Ã10<sup>â12</sup>) and 85.6% (p=0.0001), respectively in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup> mutants, but only by 25.9% (p=0.015) and 34.4% (p=0.019), respectively in Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants. These changes were accompanied by a significant increase in Foxj1 expression in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup> (183% increase, p=0.0006) but not in Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> (13% reduction, p=0.501) mutants. Thus, the differentiation program of intrapulmonary airways was more severely affected in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup> than in Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants. The predominant contribution of Jag1 to the program of secretory cell fate as represented by these markers could be clearly seen in double Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnullÂ </sup>mice.Â These mutants showed Scgb3a2 and Scgb1a1 nearly abolished and an increase in Foxj1 similar to that found in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>.

Interestingly, ISH of E14.5- E18.5 WT lungs showed that <italic>Jag2</italic> expression in the trachea and extrapulmonary airways continued to be robust at later stages while remaining weak and scattered in intrapulmonary bronchial epithelia. By contrast, <italic>Jag1</italic> expression was progressively stronger in the intrapulmonary airway epithelium from E15.5 onwards and by E18.5 expression extended to the distal bronchioles. Double ISH-immunohistochemistry for Foxj1 confirmed our previous report of <italic>Jag1</italic> localization in multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, our data suggested that Jag1 is the predominant ligand in intrapulmonary airways mediating secretory vs. multiciliated cell fate choice during differentiation. Consequently, Jag1<sup>cnull</sup> mutants were expected to display the unbalanced abundance of multiciliated cells in intrapulmonary airways compared to Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants. We also reasoned that in Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants Notch-mediated signaling by Jag1 should compensate for the loss of Jag2, preserving the balance of multiciliated vs. secretory cell differentiation in these mutants.

Single Jag1<sup>cnull</sup> or Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants were then examined to assess the contribution of each Jag ligand to the double mutant phenotype. For morphometric analysis we first performed IF for p63 and Foxj1, which label basal and multiciliated cells, respectively, and have the advantage of displaying nuclear signals, thus facilitating quantitation. Tracheal sections from all groups at E18.5 were analyzed and the %p63+/DAPI and %Foxj1+/DAPI were estimated. This analysis revealed that Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> tracheas had a significant increase in the number of prebasal cells (%p63+/DAPI) but a trend (not significant) towards an increase in the abundance of the multiciliated cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

This contrasted with the nearly absent expression of these markers outside the NEB microenvironment in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâC</xref>, described above). Remarkably, in double Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> airways the only population of cells expressing secretory markers was that associated with NEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). This NEB-associated cell population was heterogeneous in regards to expression of the markers above even in the same airway, as also observed in control lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, double Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> showed no evidence of change in the size of this population relative to NEBs. Since these cells are crucially dependent on Notch signaling and their only source of ligand should be Dll1 and/or Dll4 from PNECs, we performed N1ICD immunofluorescence to examine the status of Notch activation locally. Strong N1ICD labeling was found selectively in the SSEA1+ NEB-associated cell populations of mutants, indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Lastly, qPCR analysis of <italic>Upk3a</italic>, a gene marker highly enriched in NEB-associated secretory cells but that also labels scattered secretory cells of intrapulmonary airways, showed markedly decreased levels of expression in double Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This was consistent with the dependence of <italic>Upk3a</italic> on Notch signaling we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guha et al., 2012</xref>). The similar levels of <italic>Ascl1</italic> and the Cgrp expression pattern we found in controls and double <italic>Jag</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggested that the NEB size and frequency in airways is not dependent on Jag ligands. Thus we reasoned that the remaining population of <italic>Upk3a</italic>-expressing cells in Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants was associated with NEBs and that the significant decrease in <italic>Upk3a</italic> seen by qPCR resulted from the loss of the <italic>Upk3</italic>a-expressing scattered cell population. Indeed, ISH of <italic>Upk3a</italic> in these mutants showed signals restricted to branch points in proximal regions of intrapulmonary airways associated with Ascl1-expressing NEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This was further supported by the evidence of a preserved NEB-associated SSEA1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>) and the fact that <italic>Upk3a</italic> requires Notch activation not present in the extensive areas devoided of Jag ligands.</p><p>Together these results suggested that Jag1 and Jag2 have overlapping but also distinct roles in the cell fate specification of respiratory lineages in extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways.

The large patches of Ascl1+ cells were identified at branch points in E18.5 lungs and by then co-expressed Cgrp, indicating their continued differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, loss of Dll ligands expanded the Ascl1+ pool of PNEC/NEB precursors and did not prevent these cells from initiating maturation. Interestingly, Ki67 staining showed no difference in labeling associated with the Ascl1-expressing cells between control and double mutants at E18.5 or E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Our Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> mutants provided the first genetic proof that these ligands are crucially involved in regulating the size the NEBs, with no clear role in controlling other aspects such as the number of PNECs or NEBs per airway. By contrast, Jag ligands had no detectable influence in NEB size or abundance. Even at E14.5, when NEBs are forming along the proximal-distal axis of intrapulmonary airways, <italic>Jag2</italic> is still strongly expressed only at partially overlapping proximal domains such that nascent distal clusters of Ascl1+ cells arise in non-<italic>Jag2</italic> or non-<italic>Jag1</italic>-expressing areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Together our data suggest a model for the role of Notch ligands in lung development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in which early, when epithelial progenitors start to differentiate, a wave of Jag-Notch activation initiating in the trachea progresses in a proximal-distal fashion to establish the balance of secretory vs. multiciliated cell fates in intrapulmonary airways. A program of NE cell fate also emerges in intrapulmonary airways and as NEB start to express Dll ligands, Dll-Notch signaling is turned on in adjacent cells to form NEB-associated CCs. Local activation of Notch signaling in these cells shelters the NEB microenvironment from the neighboring epithelium, preventing aberrant NEB expansion. This role is restricted to Dll1 and Dll4, given that <italic>Jag1</italic>, <italic>Jag2</italic> single or double mutants showed no detectable effect in the size of NEBs, NEB-associated CCs or local Notch activation. The NEB microenvironment is maintained by Dll ligands that induce Notch to maintain the local balance of NE and non-NE cell types. The relevance of a late Notch-dependent phase is underscored by the expansion of the NE domain when Dll ligands are unavailable to induce Notch to generate NE-associated CCs locally. Our observations are not in conflict with recent reports that describe aggregation of NEB by a mechanism of NE cell migration (slithering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo and Krasnow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>). Rather we envision that the cell fate specification events described above precede these migratory and cluster-forming events, or overlap at least partially with mechanisms reported here. Intriguingly, in spite of the absence of Dll ligands and having Jag1 and Jag2 as the sole ligands available, the NEB-associated CC in Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> airways exhibited robust Notch activation and maintained the unique features of CCs in this microenvironment (strong <italic>Upk3a</italic>, SSEA1, and low <italic>Cyp2f2</italic>). This suggested that the features above do not necessarily depend on the differential activation of Notch by NE-derived Dll ligands and can result from Jag-Notch activation in the cells immediately adjacent to NEBs. We speculate that a currently unidentified cell membrane-associated component of NE cells or a short-range diffusible signal(s) emanating from NEBs modulates Notch signaling or influences the cell fate program in adjacent CCs to endow these features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for ontogeny and function of Notch ligand families in airway epithelial progenitors.</title><p>In all panels cells expressing Jag (1, 2) or Dll (1, 4) ligands are represented collectively; Notch activated by Jag or Dll are depicted distinctly (box, right). (<bold>A</bold>) Distinct spatial and temporal onset of expression of Jag and Dll in wild type differentiating airways. <italic>Top row</italic>: Jag expression (green dots) and Jag-Notch activation (yellow dots outlined in green) initiate in trachea/extrapulmonary airways but no Jag or Dll is present in intrapulmonary airways where NE/NEBs exist (Ascl1, blue circles). <italic>Middle row</italic>: Jag expression continues to advance into intrapulmonary airways in a proximal-to-distal fashion to activate Notch signaling and establish the balance of secretory vs multiciliated cell fates. In intrapulmonary airways Dll ligands are induced in NEBs (red dots outlined in blue) and Dll-Notch signaling is activated in adjacent cells to form NEB-associated club cells (CC, yellow dots outlined in red), limiting NEB expansion. <italic>Bottom row:</italic> As differentiation proceeds, Jag-Notch activation advances more distally and surrounds the NEB and associated CCs. (<bold>B</bold>) In Jag1<sup>cnull</sup>; Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mutants the size and composition of the NEB microenvironment in intrapulmonary airways are unaffected since Jag ligands are not required for NE specification or Dll induction. Later, the NEB microenvironment is surrounded by Jag null multiciliated cells and remains unperturbed (right). (<bold>C</bold>) Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> double mutants: NE/NEB formation is initiated in intrapulmonary airways (left, compare to A). However the inability of Ascl1 cells to induce Dll ligands prevents induction of Notch-Dll signaling in surrounding undifferentiated progenitors, leading to aberrant expansion of NEBs (middle). Later, as Jag expression advances in intrapulmonary airways, Jag-Notch is activated in the progenitor cells surrounding the NEB, generating CCs and restricting its expansion (right, see Discussion).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50487-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Lastly, the strength of receptor-ligand interactions is well known to depend on post-translational modifications of Notch receptors, particularly by the family of Fringe proteins, Lunatic (Lfng), Manic (Mfng) and Radical (Rfng) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stanley and Okajima, 2010</xref>). Mass spectrometric analysis has demonstrated Lfng to promote Notch activation by Dll1 and decrease its activation by Jag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>). Lfng is expressed in NEBs ratherÂ than in the NEB-associated CCs, which activates Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2010a</xref>). This is reminiscent of the developing intestinal epithelium where Fringe is expressed in the ligand-presenting cells to promote Notch activity in the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kadur Lakshminarasimha Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). There is currently no evidence that these proteins influence epithelial Notch signaling in the developing lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Tuyl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xu et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>In summary our study provides novel insights into developmental mechanisms mediated by Jag/Dll/Notch in the lung. These observations could be of significance in studies of human conditions associated with aberrant expansion or differentiation of NEBs and their associated CCs. Indeed, analysis of human biopsies from normal donors and patients with pulmonary NE cell hyperplasias suggest that both the NE and NE-associated CC components are coordinately altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guha et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies examining the impact of Notch ligands and downstream signals in these diseases are likely to provide important insights into their pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All of the reviewers found your study to be insightful and important. Reviewer 1 had concerns regarding some of the interpretations of the role of the Jagged ligands which may require some additional experimentation. Moreover, reviewers 2 and 3 had concerns on the timing and quantitative nature of the roles for Jagged and Delta ligands which may also require additional experiments to address. The additional experimentation should be well within the authors abilities. Please also revise the text to address the noted grammatical issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting report from a group that has been at the forefront of exploring the role of Notch signaling in airway development. The authors have provided evidence of a divergence in the role of specific Notch ligands with Jag ligands regulating the balance of luminal cell development whereas delta ligands regulating neuroendocrine cell development. There are a few things that need to be done to strengthen the report:</p><p>1) The data in Figure 3 showing that loss of Jag1/Jag2 is a bit confusing at least how it is described. The authors state that there is little to no effect of these 2 ligands on NEB formation. Yet their data show a strong decrease in <italic>Upk3a</italic> expression and their ISH shows what appears to be a reduction in the number of NEBs. The authors should clarify whether loss of Jag1/Jag2 lead to a quantitative loss of NEBs and what this means in the context of differential Notch ligand usage in lung development.</p><p>2) The data in Figure 4 and Figure 5 showing expansion of NEBs upon loss of Dll1/Dll4 are a bit confusing. Do the authors think this is really an expansion of NEBs or could it be a reprogramming of airway epithelium into a neuroendocrine fate rather than secretory or ciliated? It is difficult to tell in the pictures provided. This is an important comparison as it could lead to an even more interesting result.</p><p>3) The <italic>Upk3a</italic> staining in Figure 5C is not very convincing. It needs to be improved upon or another technique used (i.e. RNAscope) to really define the differences between WT and Dll1/Dll4 knockouts.</p><p>4) There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the manuscript that should be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting article that explores roles for various Notch ligands in the regulation of epithelial cell fate in the developing mouse lung. These studies build upon a fairly extensive literature published by these and other authors. This is important work but even though the presented data are of good quality, conclusions seem overstated and data raise unexplained questions that should be addressed with additional experimental analysis and/or discussion. The following concerns were noted:</p><p>1) Figure 1. Data presented in Figure 1 show in situ localization of Jag1, Jag2, Dll1 and Dll4 mRNA within embryonic mouse lungs at either E12, 12.5 or E13.5 (Jag1 and Jag 2) or E13.5 and E14.5. Even though these data provide information regarding spatial distribution of these ligands, it does not adequately address differences in the temporal expression pattern that the authors suggest represents an important distinction between these Notch ligands. As such, conclusions such as those made in multiple statements such as &quot;Analyses of the ontogeny of these ligands showed that Jag2 is expressed well before all others and that Dll ligands appear last.â¦.&quot; are not supported by data presented in this manuscript. If temporal/spatial expression data are fragmented and spread across a number of other manuscripts in the existing literature, it would be helpful to cite these papers and perhaps present a comprehensive analysis in this manuscript.</p><p>2) Results from Figure 1 and Figure 2 present a rather confusing picture that most likely results from the fact that experiments in Figure 1 only evaluate Jag ligand expression from E12-E14.5 yet results of <italic>Shh</italic>-cre mediated loss-of-function are evaluated at E18.5. A more comprehensive presentation of spatial/temporal expression in Figure 1 would allow readers to better appreciate why Jag2-lof has minimal impact on lung development compared to Jag1-lof (which according to data in Figure 1 is only expressed within developing lung vasculature and not endoderm)?</p><p>3) Related to concerns above, the authors conclude that &quot;We propose that Jag1-Notch mediated signaling compensates for the loss of Jag2, preserving most of the secretory cell population in these mutants&quot;. However, no data are shown regarding Jag1 expression in either later stages of normal developing lung or following Jag2-lof.</p><p>4) Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 â title states that NEB's appear in &quot;non-Jag2 expressing&quot; domains. In fact, the data suggest that appearance of NEB's occurs independently of Jag2 expression as neither presence nor absence of Jag2 mRNA impacts presence of clusters of Ascl1-expressing cells.</p><p>5) The Discussion section is written in a rather cryptic style that is difficult to read. For example, the statement &quot;While our findings are not in conflict with the reported role of Hes1-Ascl1 in NE-non-NE cell fate choice, they strongly suggest that this mechanism occurs in a Notch-independent fashion.&quot; is not adequately discussed. Please reference the article being referred to and also explain why their data strongly suggest that this mechanism occurs in a Notch-independent fashion. Perhaps related to this, an interesting but unresolved observation in the current study is that it appears that even though Dll ligands activate Notch signaling in variant club cells that limit expansion of NEB's, this occurs despite the persistence of N1ICD immunoreactivity within this population. What about other Notch receptors? Is it possible that N1ICD results from Jag signaling? Further discussion and possibly experimental analysis would be of value in clarifying these issues for the reader.</p><p>6) The statement &quot;These mechanisms likely contribute to the pathogenesis of human conditions resulting from aberrant lung differentiation, including NE hyperplasias and cancer&quot; are not supported by data and seem rather speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper determines the specific roles of Notch ligand family of genes in airway epithelial fate determination during lung development. The authors showed that Dll and Jag start to express in different temporal and spatial manner. While Jag1 and Jag2 are crucial for multiciliated cell differentiation in the lung and basal cell and multiciliated cell differentiation in the trachea, loss of Dll1 and Dll4 led to expansion of PNECs. The authors also assayed the molecular characteristics of the NEB-associated club cells in both Dll<sup>cnull</sup> and Jag<sup>cnull</sup> mutants, providing a novel insight into their initiation. Overall, this manuscript presents a systemic characterization of the distinct functions of Jag/Dll/Notch in lung epithelium, and should raise broad interest.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>- What may be the reason that loss of Jag1, but not Jag2, led to significant multiciliated cell phenotype, given the fact that Jag2 is the predominant Notch ligand in the extrapulmonary airway by in situ? qRT would be informative of the level.</p><p>- What may be the reason behind the role of Jag1 in ciliated cells, and Jag2 in basal cells?

The authors state that there is little to no effect of these 2 ligands on NEB formation. Yet their data show a strong decrease in Upk3a expression and their ISH shows what appears to be a reduction in the number of NEBs. The authors should clarify whether loss of Jag1/Jag2 lead to a quantitative loss of NEBs and what this means in the context of differential Notch ligand usage in lung development.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we have not emphasized in our text that the <italic>Upk3a</italic> expression depicted in Figure 3E by qPCR analysis in whole lungs included <italic>Upk3a</italic> expression from NEB-associated CCs and the multiple small foci of <italic>Upk3a</italic> scattered in airways. Since Ascl1 qPCR analysis in the same samples and IF for Cgrp confirmed that NEB population was equally preserved in control and double Jag mutants (Figure 3A), the significant decrease in <italic>Upk3a</italic> was unlikely due to the loss of the NEB-associated CCs but rather resulted from the loss of the <italic>Upk3a</italic>-expressing scattered cell population. This was further supported by the evidence of preserved NEB-associated SSEA1 population (Figure 3B-D) and the fact that <italic>Upk3a</italic> requires Notch activation not present in the extensive areas devoid of Jag ligands. These explanations have been added in the current revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in Figure 4 and Figure 5 showing expansion of NEBs upon loss of Dll1/Dll4 are a bit confusing. Do the authors think this is really an expansion of NEBs or could it be a reprogramming of airway epithelium into a neuroendocrine fate rather than secretory or ciliated? It is difficult to tell in the pictures provided. This is an important comparison as it could lead to an even more interesting result.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the expanded domains of expression of NEB and NEB-associated markers without evidence of increased proliferation, we ascribed these changes to the activation of an aberrant differentiation program in which NEB expansion was no longer restricted by Dll induction of Notch signaling in adjacent cells. This restriction occurred only later, when the expanded NEB was surrounded by Jag-Notch activation (independent of Dll). We do not believe that this results from reprograming (switch in cell fate) but rather the induction of an aberrant program of cell fate selection. We have commented on these issues in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Upk3a staining in Figure 5C is not very convincing. It needs to be improved upon or another technique used (i.e. RNAscope) to really define the differences between WT and Dll1/Dll4 knockouts.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide new additional evidence of major expansion in the <italic>Upk3a</italic> domain of Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> mutants (new Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the manuscript that should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text extensively to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Figure 1. Data presented in Figure 1 show in situ localization of Jag1, Jag2, Dll1 and Dll4 mRNA within embryonic mouse lungs at either E12, 12.5 or E13.5 (Jag1 and Jag 2) or E13.5 and E14.5. Even though these data provide information regarding spatial distribution of these ligands, it does not adequately address differences in the temporal expression pattern that the authors suggest represents an important distinction between these Notch ligands. As such, conclusions such as those made in multiple statements such as &quot;Analyses of the ontogeny of these ligands showed that Jag2 is expressed well before all others and that Dll ligands appear last.â¦.&quot; are not supported by data presented in this manuscript. If temporal/spatial expression data are fragmented and spread across a number of other manuscripts in the existing literature, it would be helpful to cite these papers and perhaps present a comprehensive analysis in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, other papers, including some from our lab, have already reported the Jag and Dll ligand expression patterns in the developing lung at late developmental stages. We focused on the relatively less explored early stages of lung development and initially did not include stages already reported. However, we agree that, as presented, the information seemed fragmented and difficult to interpret. Thus, in our revised manuscript we now provide a more comprehensive expression pattern analysis with stages ranging from E12-E18.5. We also include a diagram that summarizes the timing and spatial distribution in the respiratory epithelium (revised Figure 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results from Figure 1 and Figure 2 present a rather confusing picture that most likely results from the fact that experiments in Figure 1 only evaluate Jag ligand expression from E12-E14.5 yet results of Shh-cre mediated loss-of-function are evaluated at E18.5. A more comprehensive presentation of spatial/temporal expression in Figure 1 would allow readers to better appreciate why Jag2-lof has minimal impact on lung development compared to Jag1-lof (which according to data in Figure 1 is only expressed within developing lung vasculature and not endoderm)?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, in our revised manuscript we now provide a comprehensive expression pattern analysis (E12-E18.5) of ligands and a summary diagram. Indeed, these show more clearly that the Jag1 is the predominant ligand in intrapulmonary airways, explaining the differences in phenotype between the Jag mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to concerns above, the authors conclude that &quot;We propose that Jag1-Notch mediated signaling compensates for the loss of Jag2, preserving most of the secretory cell population in these mutants&quot;. However, no data are shown regarding Jag1 expression in either later stages of normal developing lung or following Jag2-lof.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this criticism we now include Jag ligand expression analysis at later stages (revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) and show that Jag1 expression is extensively expressed in intrapulmonary airways, only partially overlapping with Jag2. We also show expression of Jag1 in the airway epithelium of Jag2<sup>cnull</sup> mice (new Figure 2). These support the idea that Jag1 maintains Notch signaling in intrapulmonary airways as an attempt to preserve the secretory cell population in Jag2 mutants. We have commented on these observations in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 â title states that NEB's appear in &quot;non-Jag2 expressing&quot; domains. In fact, the data suggest that appearance of NEB's occurs independently of Jag2 expression as neither presence nor absence of Jag2 mRNA impacts presence of clusters of Ascl1-expressing cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. However, we included this picture rather to illustrate the discrepancy between sites of Jag2 and Ascl1 expression along the proximal-distal axis of intrapulmonary airway as NEBs form more distally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion section is written in a rather cryptic style that is difficult to read. For example, the statement &quot;While our findings are not in conflict with the reported role of Hes1-Ascl1 in NE-non-NE cell fate choice, they strongly suggest that this mechanism occurs in a Notch-independent fashion.&quot; is not adequately discussed. Please reference the article being referred to and also explain why their data strongly suggest that this mechanism occurs in a Notch-independent fashion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text extensively and discuss in more detail the Notch-independent mechanism proposed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps related to this, an interesting but unresolved observation in the current study is that it appears that even though Dll ligands activate Notch signaling in variant club cells that limit expansion of NEB's, this occurs despite the persistence of N1ICD immunoreactivity within this population. What about other Notch receptors? Is it possible that N1ICD results from Jag signaling? Further discussion and possibly experimental analysis would be of value in clarifying these issues for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to stress that the inability of Dll mutants to limit NEB expansion is an early event that results from the failure to activate Dll-mediated Notch signaling locally. Indeed, in Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> mutants the expanded NEBs are later surrounded by club cells that express NICD as a result of a proximal-distal âwaveâ of Jag-activation of Notch signaling for secretory-ciliated cell fate selection in airway progenitor cells. These ideas and model are presented in Figure 7 (âLater, Jag ligands in intrapulmonary airways activate Notch signaling in progenitor cells surrounding the NEB and generate typical NEB-associated CCsâ). Other Notch receptors besides N1ICD are likely involved in these events as shown by genetic studies in which Notch1-3 were sequentially inactivated in the developing lung (Morimoto et al., 2012). We did not explore further the role of Notch receptors as we considered it be beyond of the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The statement &quot;These mechanisms likely contribute to the pathogenesis of human conditions resulting from aberrant lung differentiation, including NE hyperplasias and cancer&quot; are not supported by data and seem rather speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have edited the abstract and discussion to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>- What may be the reason that loss of Jag1, but not Jag2, led to significant multiciliated cell phenotype, given the fact that Jag2 is the predominant Notch ligand in the extrapulmonary airway by in situ? qRT would be informative of the level.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data is consistent with the reviewerâs idea that this is due to the predominant expression of Jag1 in intrapulmonary airways mediating secretory vs ciliated cell fate choice. Thus, Jag1 mutants have unbalanced excessive abundance of ciliated cells at the costs of secretory cells in intrapulmonary airways. The differences in Jag patterns of expression are now more clearly depicted in current Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What may be the reason behind the role of Jag1 in ciliated cells, and Jag2 in basal cells? Temporal expression of Jag1, Jag2 at E15.5-16.5 would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Similarly, as above, this could be attributed to differences in the spatial distribution of the Jag ligands. Jag 1 is essentially expressed in intrapulmonary airways, which do not contain basal cells. By contrast Jag2 is prominent in the tracheal epithelium from the earliest stages, where basal cell precursors undergo differentiation. We have included Jag2 expression in E15.5-E16.5, as requested, and show Jag2 co-localization with the basal cell marker p63 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C; Jag1 is not expressed in trachea).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A close analysis of Jag expression in the NEB microenvironment in the Dll mutant will be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies from our lab and from our colleagues, as well as data from our current analysis showed Jag ligand expression, mostly Jag1, throughout the epithelium of intrapulmonary airways, including the regions immediately flanking the NEB microenvironment (Tsao et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2009; Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, Figure 1âfigure supplement 2). Moreover, we had evidence that Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> mutants have a normal balance of secretory-ciliated cells in intrapulmonary airways, as seen by analysis of markers of differentiation that are largely dependent on normal Jag-Notch signaling (Figure 6A: Scgb1a1, Foxj1). These observations leave Jag as the only ligands acting in Dll1<sup>cnull</sup>; Dll4<sup>cnull</sup> mutants to mediate Notch-related events nearby and away from the NEB microenvironment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Subsection âDLL ligands control the size and of the NEB microenvironmentâ: &quot;Interestingly, Ki67 staining.â¦â¦ in proliferation&quot; is based on data at E18.5.
