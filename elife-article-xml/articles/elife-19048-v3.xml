The hormone auxin is redistributed in stimulated organs leading to differential growth and bending. Auxin application triggers rapid cell wall acidification and elongation of aerial organs of plants, but the molecular players mediating these effects are still controversial. Here we use genetically-encoded pH and auxin signaling sensors, pharmacological and genetic manipulations available for Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyls to clarify how auxin is perceived and the downstream growth executed. We show that auxin-induced acidification occurs by local activation of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, which in the context of gravity response is restricted to the lower organ side. This auxin-stimulated acidification and growth require TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA nuclear auxin perception. In addition, auxin-induced gene transcription and specifically SAUR proteins are crucial downstream mediators of this growth. Our study provides strong experimental support for the acid growth theory and clarified the contribution of the upstream auxin perception mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19048.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19048.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>hypocotyl</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project ERC-2011-StG-20101109-PSDP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friml</surname><given-names>Jiří</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Actions FP7 2007-2013</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REA grant agreement n.291734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fendrych</surname><given-names>Matyáš</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nuclear pathway for auxin perception is responsible for the rapid auxin-induced cell wall acidification and growth of aerial organs of plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants support their bodies by a hydrostatic skeleton that consists of pressurized cells encased by a strong extracellular composite, the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Höfte, 2014</xref>). This has several crucial consequences for plant multicellularity: (vascular) plant cells do not move, and they grow mostly symplastically (no sliding occurs; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lintilhac, 2014</xref>). Thus plant shapes and patterns are sculptured by the precise orientation of cell division and tight control of growth. Growth depends on a balance between the turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ray et al., 1972</xref>) and the yielding of the cell wall to this pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heyn, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lockhart, 1965</xref>).</p><p>The phytohormone auxin represents an excellent case study of growth control. Auxin induces rapid (minutes to hours) cell elongation in the aerial organs. In fact, this feature was used to define and discover auxins in a coleoptile bending test (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Went and Thimann, 1937</xref>). More specifically, applied auxin induces growth of decapitated organs that are depleted of auxin. Auxin-induced growth is characterized by acidification of the cell wall. Acidification of the growth media is sufficient to trigger growth in certain conditions; therefore the term 'acid growth' is often used (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutschera, 1994</xref>). Auxin induces extrusion of protons into the apoplast, activating expansins in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McQueen-Mason, 1992</xref>), which in turn leads to weakening of the cell wall and to growth. The central players in this process are the plasma membrane (PM) P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases – AHAs. By inducing the expression of SAUR19 protein that inactivates a PP2C-family phosphatase, auxin application results into phosphorylation of the critical Thr residue in the autoinhibitory domain of AHA, which leads to activation of the proton pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spartz et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, by pumping protons into the apoplastic space, the PM is hyperpolarized, which drives the opening of voltage-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> inward-rectifying channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hedrich et al., 1995</xref>), leading to accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> ions and turgor increase in the cell. On the other hand, the acid growth theory does not seem to be valid in the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Auxin-induced growth experiments are relevant for the growth and development of plants, and have a direct parallel in the movement of plant organs during tropisms – directional movements. According to the Cholodny-Went theory, the asymmetrical distribution of auxin leads to the bending of the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Went and Thimann, 1937</xref>). Upon a directional stimulus of the shoot, auxin is redistributed by the PIN and ABCB proteins to the cells of the side which will elongate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rakusová et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, these cells experience a sudden increase of auxin concentration and react by elongation. Also more generally, auxin is crucial for growth of aerial organs, as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Went and Thimann (1937)</xref>: “Ohne Wuchsstoff kein Wachstum – without auxin no growth”.</p><p>Currently, the literature considers at least two receptors for auxin: the nuclear TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>), and the Auxin Binding Protein 1 (ABP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Löbler and Klämbt, 1985</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grones and Friml, 2015</xref>). The TIR1 pathway operates by the de-repression of transcription of auxin-induced genes, while the ABP1 pathway was proposed to regulate activities of proteins directly, and thus can operate immediately after auxin perception. Although auxin-induced growth is one of the oldest experimental questions in plant physiology, there is no agreement on how auxin is perceived during this process. This controversy stems from several facts: auxin-induced growth starts only approximately 15 min after application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutschera, 1994</xref>), and requires novel protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelmann and Schopfer, 1989</xref>), hinting to the involvement of the nuclear TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA pathway. The major support for the nuclear auxin pathway involvement is the regulation of AHA activity by SAUR19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spartz et al., 2014</xref>), a member of a family of very small proteins the expression of which is rapidly induced by auxin. Recently, the significance of the ABP1 pathway has been undermined by the lack of any obvious developmental phenotypes of the <italic>abp1</italic> knockout mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michalko et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2016</xref>). Despite these recent findings, there is also evidence demonstrating the importance of the ABP1 pathway, obtained by approaches and methods other than knock-out mutants. In protoplasts auxin induces rapid PM hyperpolarization and swelling that can be blocked by ABP1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leblanc et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamagami et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schenck et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that the TIR1/AFB pathway is not involved in auxin-induced elongation, based on the fact that a quadruple <italic>tir1/afb</italic> mutant still responds to auxin by elongation. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al. (2012)</xref> report that the AHA PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is still phosphorylated, and thus activated, upon auxin application in a double <italic>tir1-1 afb2-3</italic> mutant.</p><p>In the current literature the question how is auxin perceived and what downstream processes are involved in auxin-induced growth remains unanswered (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dünser and Kleine-Vehn, 2015</xref>). Here we analyze the components of the response – auxin signaling, cell wall acidification and growth. We aim to solve how auxin is perceived during auxin-induced growth, and whether there are any rapid, ‘non-genomic’ components of this response. By analyzing lines that overexpress stabilized version of the SAUR protein or by genetically activating the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases we attempt to clarify whether the acid growth hypothesis is valid in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. Finally, we test how the results from the auxin-induced growth experiments relate to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation on the example of gravitropic response. The combination of genetic tools and techniques that have become available enabled us to systematically re-evaluate this classical question in plant biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Auxin-induced growth, acidification, and transcriptional response are tightly correlated</title><p>When grown in darkness, hypocotyls of plants rapidly elongate, and this elongation is fueled by the auxin from the cotyledons. Therefore, the etiolated hypocotyl is an excellent experimental model for auxin-induced elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schenck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). In this work we used three-day-old etiolated hypocotyls of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We used the auxin analog NAA, to ensure that auxin penetrates the hypocotyl segment well, and is not degraded by light during the experiments. NAA is stable, readily enters cells by diffusion, and is a substrate for auxin efflux carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delbarre et al., 1996</xref>). In the etiolated hypocotyl of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, depleted of endogenous auxin by decapitation, auxin induced growth with a delay of approximately 20 min (19.75 ± 2.9 min stdev, n = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To ensure that this delay is not an artifact of the experimental system, we used the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballio et al., 1964</xref>) that activates the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by enabling binding of an activating 14-3-3 protein to the pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baunsgaard et al., 1998</xref>), and so triggers apoplast acidification and growth. Application of FC triggered growth in 6–8 min after its application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To monitor the transcriptional response to auxin, we needed a reporter that would be more rapid than transcriptional GFP reporters, as fluorescent proteins require significant time to mature and become fluorescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaner et al., 2005</xref>). The Firefly luciferase enzyme is, on the other hand, active immediately after its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolb et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore we used the auxin response reporter DR5 driving the expression of Firefly luciferase enzyme – DR5::LUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreno-Risueno et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly to the growth onset, nuclear auxin response could be detected 20 min after auxin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To visualize the auxin-induced acidification and thus approximate the activity of the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, we used the genetically encoded apoplastic pH sensor apo-pHusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gjetting et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to the growth initiation and the nuclear auxin signaling, a sudden drop in apoplastic pH could be detected 20 min (20.11 ± 5 min stdev, n = 12) after auxin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). We developed a MATLAB-based tool that we named AreaKymo in order to be able to visualize and quantify apoplastic pH changes in an un-biased way. The apo-pHusion pH sensor consists of mRFP (insensitive to pH changes) and GFP (responsive to pH changes). AreaKymo selects the cell wall areas based on RFP fluorescence, measures RFP and GFP intensities in each pixel, and plots these pixels in a time-space plot. Using AreaKymo, the delay between auxin application and apoplast acidification is clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Again, in the case of FC, the apoplast acidification followed immediately after its application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The ‘acid growth’ literature often discusses the necessity to abrade the stem segments in order to achieve proper penetration of the drugs into the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutschera, 1994</xref>). Our results show that in the case of the comparably minute Arabidopsis hypocotyl segments, auxin enters the tissue rapidly, inducing growth, acidification, and transcriptional auxin response within approximately 20 min. If we take into account the velocity of auxin transport in Arabidopsis ~8 mm hr<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kramer et al., 2011</xref>), auxin should reach the middle of the hypocotyl segment (~1.2 mm) in ~4.5 min. Our results are thus in a good agreement with the published timescale of auxin-induced elongation (17 min in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutschera, 1994</xref>). Most importantly, we directly visualized auxin-induced acidification, transcriptional response to auxin, and segment elongation, all of which are tightly correlated in time and happen with an approximately 20-min lag phase after auxin application.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19048.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Auxin-triggered growth of hypocotyl segments correlates with nuclear auxin signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A brightfield image of a three-day old etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyl and the corresponding decapitated hypocotyl segment used in the elongation assay.

This decrease was evident in the later phases of growth, when the lack of protein synthesis might affect the overall status of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result demonstrates that protein synthesis is not necessary for growth as such; hypocotyl segments are able to grow for some time without protein synthesis. However, protein synthesis is absolutely required for <italic>auxin</italic>-induced growth. Furthermore, CHI treatment completely inhibited the auxin-induced apoplast acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and auxin response, visualized by the DR5::LUC reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This result is consistent with previous results in maize coleoptiles and pea internode segments, where CHI blocked auxin-induced growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lado et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelmann and Schopfer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutschera, 1994</xref>). Other studies reported auxin-induced growth in the presence of CHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rose, 1974</xref>). It was also shown that Small Auxin Up mRNAs (SAUR) accumulate in hypocotyl segments after CHI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franco et al., 1990</xref>), but without translation, these mRNAs are not able to trigger growth. In our experimental setup, the total inhibition of the DR5::LUC response by CHI leaves no space for doubts that the CHI treatment was effective, and so demonstrates the necessity of protein synthesis for the auxin growth response, further supporting the involvement of the nuclear auxin pathway. Finally, we used auxinole that binds to the TIR1 auxin co-receptor and blocks the formation of the TIR1-auxin-Aux/IAA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment with auxinole led to a decrease in the nuclear auxin response visualized by DR5::LUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and resulted in a large decrease in auxin-induced growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while FC-induced growth still occurred. This result strengthens the hypothesis that the nuclear auxin receptors are perceiving auxin in the hypocotyls to mediate apoplastic pH changes, growth, and probably maintenance of the turgor pressure, necessary for continued growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Auxin-induced growth requires TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA signaling</title><p>Previous works established that multiple mutations in the TIR1/AFB pathway do not inhibit the auxin-induced growth of the hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schenck et al., 2010</xref>), and it was suggested that auxin is perceived by the ABP1 pathway, the null mutants of which were not available at that time. We therefore set out to test the new mutants in the ABP1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). The new <italic>abp1</italic> null mutants’ reaction to auxin was identical to that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the works using the multiple <italic>tir1/afb</italic> mutants, the nuclear auxin pathway was not completely eliminated, most likely due to the redundancy of the 6 TIR1/AFB receptors. It is also important to note that the development of the higher order mutant is seriously affected, and the phenotypes range from normal-looking plants to seriously stunted plants lacking a root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>), making it very difficult to assess their physiology. As reported previously, a <italic>tir1-1/afb2-1/afb3-1</italic> triple mutant still responded normally to auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In our hands, the quadruple <italic>tir1-1/afb1-3/afb2-3/afb3-4</italic> mutant was hardly able to form a hypocotyl in which we could assess the growth reaction to auxin. To circumvent the problem with the redundancy in the TIR1/AFB, we focused on the second part of auxin co-receptor – the Aux/IAA proteins. We used the <italic>axr3-1</italic> mutant that harbors a mutation in the DII domain of the IAA17 gene, leading to a semi-dominant auxin-resistant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leyser et al., 1996</xref>), expressed from the heat shock-inducible promoter – <italic>HS::axr3-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knox et al., 2003</xref>). After induction of the <italic>axr3-1</italic> protein, hypocotyls responded to FC treatment by rapid growth identical to that of control, but their reaction to auxin was completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Without induction, the behavior was identical to that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We introduced the apoplastic pH sensor apo-pHusion into the <italic>HS::axr3-1</italic> background and analyzed the apoplastic acidification. Induction of the <italic>axr3-1</italic> protein completely prevented the auxin-induced apoplastic acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), fitting with the original agravitropic and short hypocotyl phenotype of <italic>axr3-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leyser et al., 1996</xref>). These results again show that auxin-induced growth is downstream of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA co-receptor.

The auxin signaling pathway exhibits a homeostatic nature and contains several negative and positive feedback loops.

It remains a question why the picloram-induced DR5 response, acidification and growth show a delay when compared to NAA. It is possible that AFB5 has partially different functions than the other TIR/AFBs or that picloram needs more time to enter the cells of the hypocotyl segment.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19048.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases triggers auxin-independent growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> hypocotyls elongate in the absence of auxin, and the addition of auxin (10 µM NAA) does not further increase their growth.

To address the downstream components involved, we looked at the SAUR proteins. SAURs form a family of very small, short-lived proteins that are rapidly induced by auxin application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren and Gray, 2015</xref>), and act downstream of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor. In a recent publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spartz et al. (2014)</xref> showed that the SAUR19 protein indirectly activates the PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. They found that tagging SAUR19 with GFP leads to its stabilization and confers overexpression phenotypes. The <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> line evoked up to 35% higher H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activities and increased cell expansion, as compared to Col-0. The <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> line behavior in our experimental system was remarkable. After decapitation, the hypocotyl segments elongated on the control medium without auxin, and the addition of auxin did not lead to further stimulation of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We analyzed the apoplastic pH in the F1 cross between the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> and the apo-pHusion marker line. In the control (Col-0 x apo-pHusion) the apoplastic pH rises and growth stops quickly after decapitation, while apoplastic pH remained acidic in the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> background and the growth continued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). SAUR genes are arranged in clusters on chromosomes and encode very small proteins, which likely enables very rapid production of these proteins upon perception of auxin. Moreover, SAUR proteins are extremely short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren and Gray, 2015</xref>), meaning that transcriptional regulation is a crucial determinant of their abundance. Stabilization of SAUR proteins leads to increased cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chae et al., 2012</xref>). These properties make SAUR proteins a suitable ‘gearbox’ of growth that is able to rapidly respond to changing conditions, while involving the relatively slow transcription and translation steps. Our results show that SAUR proteins mediate the signal between nuclear auxin perception and auxin-induced growth execution, but it is important to note that the conclusion is based mainly on the overexpression of a stabilized version of the SAUR19 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is sufficient to trigger growth</title><p>The stabilized <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> overexpression line supposedly stimulates growth by activation of the AHA PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spartz et al., 2014</xref>), supporting the acid growth hypothesis for hypocotyls. In Arabidopsis, the AHA family has 11 members, of which AHA2 and its close homolog AHA1 together contribute about 70–80% of the total H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. While individual <italic>aha1</italic> or <italic>aha2</italic> showed only modest phenotypes such as impaired root growth on alkaline pH, the double mutant is embryo-lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haruta and Sussmann, 2012</xref>). To clarify the functional relationship of auxin and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases directly <italic>in planta</italic>, we took advantage of the availability of dominant mutations (<italic>ost2</italic>) available for the <italic>AHA1</italic> locus that render the pump constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merlot et al., 2007</xref>). Although the over-expressing <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> transgenic lines have been described to behave comparably to the <italic>ost2-2D</italic> mutant in several tests, we found that decapitated <italic>ost2-2D</italic> showed no or minor auxin-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As constitutive mutations are not known for AHA2, we nonetheless created a double mutant by combining the <italic>aha2-5</italic> knock out with the <italic>ost2-2D</italic>, so that of the two main isoforms of AHAs, one is constitutively active and the other one absent. Indeed, the <italic>ost2-2D/aha2-5</italic> hypocotyl segments elongated in the absence of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), more than the <italic>ost2-2D</italic> single mutants. The <italic>ost2-2D/aha2-5</italic> also showed a slightly decreased reaction to fusicoccin compared to <italic>ost2-2D</italic> and Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results provided additional insight into the functions of the two pump subunits: not only AHA1 and AHA2 play redundant roles, they are also interdependent. At least a notable fraction of the mature PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases in the plant cell might be hetero-oligomers of AHA1 and AHA2 subunits (a mature pump is thought to be a hexamer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanczewska et al., 2005</xref>). In the complete absence of AHA2, the equilibrium in the composition of the mature pump complex would shift towards more of the <italic>ost2-2D</italic> subunits. However, the ability of <italic>ost2-2D/aha2-5</italic> to elongate without auxin did not reach the magnitude of the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> plants. There are several possible explanations of this difference. Other of the 11 PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases might be activated by the SAUR proteins, or other sites of the auto-inhibitory loop might be regulated than those mutated in <italic>ost2-2D</italic>. Alternatively, the 'acid growth' explanation of SAUR action is not sufficient, and SAURs might target multiple proteins that initiate the growth response; and activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is only a part of their action.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we used the line that inducibly expresses AHA2, devoid of its autoinhibitory domain – <italic>AHA2<sup>δ95</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pachecon-Villalobos et al., 2016</xref>). Approximately 4 hr after transfer on the induction medium, hypocotyl segments of <italic>AHA2<sup>δ95</sup></italic>started to elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The auxin-independent growth of <italic>AHA2<sup>δ95</sup></italic>was similar to that of <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic>. Based on these results we conclude that in the hypocotyls, strong activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is sufficient to trigger growth and can explain the auxin-independent elongation phenotype caused by the overexpression of stabilized SAUR19 protein. The strongest effect of GFP-SAUR19 overexpression can be explained by the fact that SAURs might regulate all PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, while our genetic manipulation always influences only some of them. This corroborates the crucial role of the SAUR proteins in mediating auxin-induced growth, and it also means that in contrast to the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pachecon-Villalobos et al., 2016</xref>) the acid growth hypothesis seems to be valid in the hypocotyls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The elongation assays are relevant for the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation</title><p>Next we tested gravistimulation of hypocotyls to address the relevance of the results to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation and to avoid any mechanical interference caused by hypocotyl decapitation and external auxin application. During gravistimulation of the shoot, auxin is redistributed to the lower side of the gravistimulated organ where it triggers growth, which in turn leads to bending of the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Went and Thimann, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison and Pickard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friml et al., 2002</xref>).

The reason is that the GFP-based markers are too slow to show differences in such a short time, and the DII-Venus marker is extremely weak in the etiolated hypocotyls, most likely due to a high level of auxin in this elongating tissue (data not shown). Gravistimulated hypocotyls bend visibly 20–40 min after gravistimulation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Since our results point to acidification being an early detectable outcome of gravistimulation, we analyzed apoplastic pH in the upper and lower sides of gravistimulated etiolated hypocotyls using the apo-pHusion marker. One hour after gravistimulation, the lower side cell walls were visibly more acidic than the upper ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In non-gravistimulated hypocotyls, both sides showed either similar pH, or one of the sides was more acidic than the other, without a tendency to the left or right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This could reflect the fact that vertically-growing hypocotyls do not grow completely straight, but gently wave during growth (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Interestingly, plants expressing a stabilized version of the SAUR63 showed an increased waviness of hypocotyls and stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chae et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hohm et al.

The asymmetry of acidification has been approximated before using a pH-sensitive dye to visualize differential pH in vicinity of gravistimulated aerial organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mulkey et al., 1981</xref>).

We therefore tested how the mutated protein affects the gravitropic response. While the heat-shocked control hypocotyls bent upwards, the <italic>HS::axr3-1</italic> line was utterly agravitropic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Hypocotyl growth was almost completely inhibited as well. As expected, approximately 16 hr after the heat shock, the <italic>HS::axr3-1</italic> seedlings initiated bending; nicely demonstrating the transient nature of the heat-shock inducible system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knox et al., 2003</xref>). This result clearly shows that the nuclear auxin response is indispensable for gravitropism, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> results correspond well to the elongation assay results. This result is also in agreement with the agravitropic phenotype in the stable <italic>axr3-1</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leyser et al., 1996</xref>) and very similar to the stabilized mutant of Aux/IAA19, <italic>msg2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatematsu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> hypocotyl segments elongated in the absence of auxin, and the addition of auxin did not increase their elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,F</xref>). This in fact means that these hypocotyls are <italic>functionally insensitive</italic> to auxin or to the absence of auxin. Because of this insensitivity, this line should be unable to respond to the redistribution of auxin during gravitropism. Also the <italic>ost2-2D/aha2-5</italic> line showed significant auxin-independent elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, we subjected the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19, ost2-2D</italic> and <italic>ost2-2D/aha2-5</italic> lines to gravistimulation and analyzed the bending angle after 6 hr of treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lines that showed auxin-independent growth in the elongation assays also responded less to gravistimulation than the control, resulting in a smaller gravitropic bending angle. This means that the ability to respond properly to the relocation of auxin is compromised in these lines, resulting in a decreased growth gradient between the upper and lower sides of gravistimulated hypocotyls. It was shown that the <italic>35S::GFP-SAUR19</italic> line is less phototropic than the control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spartz et al., 2012</xref>), pointing to a common role in photo- and gravitropic response. With the example of gravitropism, we showed that the results obtained in the semi <italic>in vitro</italic> elongation assays are relevant to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, and that apoplast acidification is one of the earliest hallmarks that can be visualized in the gravistimulated hypocotyls. The ability to rapidly induce growth after perception of auxin as well as to stop growth after withdrawal of auxin are crucial for the plants to be able to respond to directional stimuli such as gravity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work, we systematically re-evaluated the auxin-induced growth knowledge and test its predictions on the Arabidopsis model system using the available genetic tools. We showed that after auxin application, nuclear auxin signaling, apoplast acidification and growth occur with a similar lag phase of approximately 20 min. This is not an artifact of the model system, as the drug fusicoccin is able to trigger growth and acidification in a time substantially shorter, and without triggering the nuclear auxin response. Both the auxin-induced apoplast acidification and growth require new protein synthesis, Aux/IAA protein degradation, and are dependent on the SAUR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spartz et al., 2014</xref>). In other words, no non-genomic auxin pathway is required to acidify the apoplast and regulate growth in the hypocotyl. This contrasts with the situation in the root, where auxin inhibits growth very rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monshausen et al., 2011</xref>) and may act via different mechanism. In the hypocotyl, the <italic>afb5-5</italic> mutant shows a clear reduction of the reaction to the auxin analogue picloram, further confirming the involvement of the TIR1/AFB Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor complex. Furthermore, overexpression of stabilized SAUR19 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spartz et al., 2012</xref>) causes auxin-independent hypocotyl segment growth that can be also achieved by genetic activation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, strengthening the concept of acid growth hypothesis. Using genetically-encoded apoplastic pH marker, we could directly monitor apoplast acidification <italic>in situ</italic> during auxin-induced growth and during gravitropism. The lines that showed auxin independent growth display problems with gravitropic bending, which demonstrates the necessity of acidification and growth gradient formation across the bending organ. It remains to be solved whether the SAUR-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases activation is the only mechanism that triggers cell elongation, or whether SAUR proteins have other targets that are responsible for growth regulation. We are lacking tools to monitor PM hyperpolarization in-vivo, which is tightly linked to apoplast acidification, and is crucial for regulating ion fluxes over the PM and turgor regulation. It will be interesting to address the dynamics of cell wall properties and turgor pressure using this model system. The fact that auxin-induced growth of the hypocotyl utilizes the relatively slow gene transcription and protein synthesis to regulate its growth, illustrates that plant tropisms do not need to be instantaneous, as the changes in direction of gravity or light are relatively slow as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Col0 was used as wild type control.

For most experiments, seeds were surface sterilized by chlorine gas, plated on ½ MS medium, 1% sucrose, pH 5.8, 0.8% plant agar, stratified 1–2 days at 4°C, then placed into the growthroom (21°C, long day) for ~6 hr and then wrapped into aluminum foil. The dark imaging experiments with gravitropism were done as follows: 3-d-old plants were vertically placed into dark boxes equipped with infrared LEDs (850 nm wavelength) and photographed by a Canon EOS 550D camera (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smet et al.

The segments were placed onto a cellophane foil placed on the surface of the depletion medium (10 mM KCl, 1 mM MES, pH 6 (KOH), 1.5% phytagel) and kept in darkness for 30 min. Then the segments were transferred to a new plate with depletion medium using the cellophane foil, which was removed after the transfer. Falcon 60 × 15 mm dishes were used with 5 ml of medium with the drugs or auxin treatments as indicated. The samples were placed on a flatbed scanner (Epson perfection V370) and imaged through the layer of phytagel, a wet black filter paper was placed above the open dishes to improve the contrast of the images.

The apo-pHusion marker line for the elongation experiments was imaged using ZEISS LSM700 confocal microscope with a 20x/0.8 Plan-Apochromat M27 objective. GFP and RFP were imaged simultaneously, splitting the light with a SP550 and LP560 filters, 16bits per pixel, excited using 488 and 555 nm diode lasers. Hypocotyls were decapitated and depleted on the depletion medium, as described above, then the segments were transplanted onto medium with the indicated treatment and transferred into LabTekkII chambered coverslide and imaged. Alternatively, the treatment was pipetted to the samples during imaging on the confocal microscope. For the apo-pHusion imaging during the gravitropic response, seeds were plated into channels 0.25 mm deep and 0.5 mm wide that were stamped into 1.5% agarose with ½MS, 1% sucrose. After one day of germination, the channels with seeds were covered with a microscopic coverglass and the plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and grown for additional three days. Then the plates were gravistimulated for 1 hr, and taken directly for imaging at a confocal microscope. This way, the original position of the gravistimulated organ was maintained and the handling was minimized. Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope equipped with GaAsP detectors and using a 20x/0.8 Plan-Apochromat M27 objective was used, and imaged analogously to the ZEISS LSM700 settings.

The kymographs were done using the Multiple Kymograph ImageJ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html">http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html</ext-link>). To achieve unbiased measurements, the length of hypocotyl segments was measured by thresholding the scanner images, manual clicking on each segment using the Wand tool (Fiji) and recording their Feret’s diameter (maximum caliper), this was done for the entire time series. The initial length of the segment was taken as 100%, data was analyzed in Excel. The results in the figures represent one of three repetitions of each experiment, which is based on quantification of 6 hypocotyl segments. For confocal time series, image drift was stabilized using the StackReg Fiji plugin in the ‘translation’ option. Luciferase luminescence was measured by selecting the region of interest containing the hypocotyl segment and measuring the mean intensity in this region over time. The apoplastic pH visualized by the apo-pHusion marker was measured both manually and automatically by the AreaKymo MATLAB script. Manual measurement was done by thresholding the cell wall area based on the RFP channel, using this thresholded area as a base for a region of interest (using the ‘create selection’ command), and then measuring the mean intensity in these regions both for GFP and RFP channels. For the gravitropic experiment, each z-section of the image was measured individually. The AreaKymo script essentially does the same procedure, but does so automatically without the user input, allowing for rapid processing of several hypocotyls at a time. The user specifies the value of the threshold for the RFP signal (this is set arbitrarily to highlight just the cell wall area) and the desired width of the rectangle that will represent the individual timeframe. The script outputs the visual representation of apoplastic pH and also the values in a form of a series of boxplots. The AreaKymo script is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Evidence accumulated over many years suggests that cell expansion in the hypocotyl occurs through acid growth. Auxin is thought to activate plasma membrane H-ATPase, either indirectly or indirectly, and thereby acidify the apoplast resulting in changes in the cell wall. Recent studies suggest that the H-ATPase is activated by phosphorylation, and that this achieved by SAUR dependent inhibition of a PP2C phosphatase. Although there is some evidence for each component of this model, there is no information of the auxin receptor that mediates this growth response. In this paper, the authors use excised hypocotyls from etiolated seedlings as their model. Using this system, they show that changes in growth and acidification of the apoplast are correlated in time. Further, they show that these responses are dependent on protein synthesis implying that they involve changes in transcription/translation. A novel and important finding is that growth is also correlated with an increase in auxin transcriptional response as measured by a DR5:LUC reporter. Most significantly they also show that these effects are dependent on the TIR1/AFB receptor system but not ABP1. The authors make elegant use of the afb5-5 mutation. These plants are resistant to the synthetic auxin picloram but are otherwise normal in appearance. By showing that afb5 is resistant to the rapid effects of picloram on growth, the authors demonstrate that AFB5 is required for the response to auxin. It follows that the TIR1/AFB receptors act to mediate the response to endogenous auxin.</p><p>Critique and required revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers agreed that the problem being addressed by the manuscript is an important one and they all appreciated the care with which experiments have been done. However, there were concerns about the overall novelty of the work, issues about organization and presentation, as well as some specifics related to certain experiments. I have outlined these below taking, whenever possible, text directly from the various reviews.</p><p>1) The reviewers felt that the real novelty in the paper had to do with the results using AFB5. Much of the rest is technically excellent but largely confirms previous work. Hence, the authors need to clarify in the Introduction, as well as the Discussion, which aspects of the current work truly are novel and which are confirmatory to previous findings. Here is just one example of the concerns that the reviewers raised in this regard:</p><p>&quot;The last section of the manuscript describes an attempt to validate these new results in vivo by examining the effects of axr3-1, GFP-SAUR19 on gravitropism. […] The technology used is more sophisticated in this study, but the bottom line is the same.&quot;</p><p>Similar comments were made with regard to other sections of the manuscript so there is a real need to clarify for the reader what aspects of the paper are truly novel.</p><p>2) A very important question is, 'is there a RAPID response to auxin in Arabidopsis that is related to auxin signaling?' The authors show that in contrast to fusicoccin, which causes growth and apoplast acidification within seconds and minutes, auxin requires 15-20 minutes for an effect. These results are in complete agreement with our current model where fusicoccin is binding to and stabilized the activated form of the pump (via binding to the phopshoTh947 in concert with 14-3-3) whereas the SAUR gene must be expressed as a mRNA and then translated to make a SAUR protein that then binds to the protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates Thr947. There is a very big difference in time dependence for growth and apoplastic pH changes between auxin and FC and this is a critical important observation. The authors should explicitly state that the earliest auxin response they see is 15 minutes or more that is not an artifact of their measurement because fusicoccin causes a rapid immediate response. The authors ultimate conclude that they see no such rapid response with auxin but this is only mentioned briefly in the discussion. This is an example of how the writing of the paper obscures some of its significance. The authors should clearly state in the introduction the key questions being addressed and then emphasize in a clear, concise way in the discussion how their data relates to these questions.</p><p>3) In the Abstract, the acid growth hypothesis is presented as established fact. Although the model is attractive, the importance of the H-ATPases to auxin induced growth seems clear but not airtight. The aha1 and aha2 KO mutants have very subtle growth related phenotypes although a double is lethal. The proposed function of the SAURs is based mainly on stabilized gain-of-function fusion proteins. In other words, we know that increased levels of GFP-SAUR19 are sufficient to promote growth, but we don't yet know if the SAURs are all that is necessary for the 15 minute auxin induced growth. This uncertainty should be reflected in this manuscript. It may be worth checking the rapid fusicoccin response in all the mutants and also, in the presence of auxin, to make sure that auxin or the TIR mediated auxin signaling pathway is not doing something unusual to prevent the rapid response (e.g., by FC) under the conditions of these experiments.</p><p>4) In the Introduction the authors state &quot;Despite these recent findings, there is also ample evidence demonstrating the importance of the ABP1 pathway&quot;. This statement and those that directly follow should be deleted or modified. The lack of phenotype of the abp1 null mutant clearly indicates that ABP1 is not important in Arabidopsis under any conditions so far reported. The physiological significance of protoplast swelling is unknown and the phenotype of the tmk mutants clearly has nothing to do with ABP1 since the abp1 mutant does not have this phenotype.</p><p>5) At several points the authors use the word &quot;perfect&quot; to describe something. Since nothing is perfect, words like &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; would be better.</p><p>6) Describing an experimental system as &quot;spectacular&quot; (subsection “Stabilization of SAUR19 protein leads to auxin-independent growth”, first paragraph) is a bit over the top. How about &quot;remarkable&quot;?</p><p>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Stabilization of SAUR19 protein leads to auxin-independent growth”, &quot;nearly instantaneous&quot; is a bit strong. Presumably several events must occur before transcription can begin, like histone acetylation, chromatin remodeling etc. How about “very rapidly&quot;.</p><p>8) In the subsection “Conclusions” the authors state: &quot;We also show that auxin-induced apoplast acidification is dependent on nuclear auxin signaling and is mediated via the SAUR proteins&quot; Surely the role of the SAURs has already been demonstrated by the Gray lab (Spartz et al.). Again, refer to point one above.</p><p>9) It is important for these authors to consider the possibility that all of the rapid-auxin electrophysiological responses are in fact related to transport of auxin rather than action. Since auxin uptake is likely to involve proton mediated symporters or antiporters and auxin efflux is likely to be an electrogenic efflux of the negatively charged auxin ion, there are likely to be very rapid changes in the PMF (equal to sum of δ pH and EMF) that may be small and unrelated to the auxin growth response. Use of citations in the literature (e.g. protoplast swelling) that are not replicated in this work, and whose reproducibility and relevance to auxin induced growth as measured in this carefully done report, detracts from its credibility to readers. For example, in the subsection “Conclusions”, it is unclear why the protoplast swelling phenomenon is even mentioned since it has nothing to do with this paper. On face value the lack of a phenotype in the abp1 mutant suggests that the effects of ABP1 on protoplasts are not important. Given the importance of auxin action in plant life, and the confusion and poorly interpreted experiments presented in the past, the authors should pause, stay close to their own data and double check their writing and interpretations.</p><p>10) The difference between afb5-5 and the other tir1/afb lines may be due to specialized function of AFB5. The authors may want to note this.</p><p>11) In Figure 1A, a little bit more information to help the reader understand the kymograph would be useful. Perhaps an arrow indicating time. It also might not be obvious that the bar refers to 10 min. In this regard, it looks like much more growth occurs in the apical part of the segment than in the basal part contrary to what is stated in the figure legend.</p><p>12) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Auxin-induced growth requires TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA signaling”: change to 'most likely due to the redundancy[…]&quot;. The authors take the evidence to unequivocally conclude that it is gene redundancy that explains their results but such a conclusion is not justified by the data presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19048.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers felt that the real novelty in the paper had to do with the results using AFB5.

We rewrote the end of the Introduction and the conclusion section completely as well.</p><p>We propose that the true importance of our paper is bringing the old and new knowledge about auxin-induced growth into one experimental system, and systematically focus on and analyze this phenomenon. More specifically, we clarified how auxin is perceived during this process, and showed that there are no obvious ‘rapid’ responses to auxin in the hypocotyl growth. Very importantly, by visualizing apoplastic pH we also demonstrate that auxin-induced acidification is not a ‘rapid, non-genomic’ effect, but instead requires the nuclear auxin signaling pathway. These questions were unanswered in the field and needed to be sorted out. We did not want to specifically state which pieces are novel in our text, we think this is not appropriate, but here we can state that not only the above mentioned questions have really not been answered, but also the apoplastic pH in situ observation after auxin application has not been shown before, as wasn’t the apoplastic pH behavior during gravitropism. Yes, the behavior of stabilized Aux/IAA mutant during gravitropism has been shown before, but we also show that the ost2-2D/aha2-5 mutant has a problem bending, which we put into context of the elongation assays and compare it to the behavior of the GFP-SAUR19 plants. Because of the nature of the manuscript, we were trying to be extremely careful with referencing the existing literature wherever possible throughout the text. We would welcome any specific suggestion on literature that we might have missed. In summary, this work clarified several decades-lasting controversies and given how important the auxin-induced growth is as experimental topic in plant hormone biology – we find this a very important contribution.</p><p><italic>2) A very important question is, 'is there a RAPID response to auxin in Arabidopsis that is related to auxin signaling?' The authors show that in contrast to fusicoccin, which causes growth and apoplast acidification within seconds and minutes, auxin requires 15-20 minutes for an effect.

This is an example of how the writing of the paper obscures some of its significance. The authors should clearly state in the introduction the key questions being addressed and then emphasize in a clear, concise way in the discussion how their data relates to these questions.</italic> </p><p>We entirely agree with this point. There is an important argument to think that the delay of auxin action is not an artifact of the system – the behavior of the DR5::LUC reporter. The earliest observable LUC signal appears 20 minutes after auxin application, similarly to acidification and growth onset. The DR5 promoter needs to be activated, luciferase protein needs to be transcribed and translated and the luminescent product needs to accumulate to be detected. Therefore, it is probable that auxin enters the hypocotyl very rapidly, and the delay is caused by the auxin signaling machinery and transcription and translation of the executor genes.</p><p>To test whether FC can indeed act ‘rapidly’, we performed additional experiments focusing on its early action on hypocotyl elongation and triggering apoplast acidification. These data are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> (we split the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> into two figures to accommodate the data). After application of 5uM fusicoccin, the first detectable elongation occurred in 6-8 minutes. Also the acidification of the apoplast was apparent immediately after application of FC. We rewrote the end of the Introduction to clarify the questions we are trying to answer, and we rewrote the conclusion section as well.</p><p><italic>3) In the Abstract, the acid growth hypothesis is presented as established fact. Although the model is attractive, the importance of the H-ATPases to auxin induced growth seems clear but not airtight. The aha1 and aha2 KO mutants have very subtle growth related phenotypes although a double is lethal. The proposed function of the SAURs is based mainly on stabilized gain-of-function fusion proteins. In other words, we know that increased levels of SAUR19-GFP are sufficient to promote growth, but we don't yet know if the SAURs are all that is necessary for the 15 minute auxin induced growth. This uncertainty should be reflected in this manuscript. It may be worth checking the rapid fusicoccin response in all the mutants and also, in the presence of auxin, to make sure that auxin or the TIR mediated auxin signaling pathway is not doing something unusual to prevent the rapid response (e.g., by FC) under the conditions of these experiments.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the interpretation of the SAURs role, which is based on overexpression of stabilized protein, is an important point that was missing in our interpretation and we included this in the end of the respective paragraph.</p><p>However, we do not agree that we presented the acid growth hypothesis as a fact. We show in the previous version of the paper that the acid growth hypothesis might be more complicated than just activation of H-ATPases. We show that the overexpression of SAURs has much stronger effect than the presence of a constitutively active AHA1 form (the ost2-2D mutant), where the auxin-independent growth was not observed. We could see auxin-independent growth when the active AHA1 (ost2-2D) was in the aha2-5 mutant background, but still the magnitude of the response could not be compared to the effect of SAUR19-GFP overexpressor. During the review process, the Pacheco-Villalobos et al. paper introduced the AHA2<sup>delta95</sup> line, where the non-regulated, active AHA2 ATPase can be expressed inducibly. We tested this line for the auxin-independent growth, and found that ~4 hours after the transgene induction, a rapid growth can be observed. Even though this again is an experiment based on the strong overexpression, it clearly shows that activation of H-ATPases is sufficient to trigger elongation of the hypocotyl segments. Still, acid growth hypothesis is probably a simplification, as the acidification of the apoplast is only a part of the processes – activation of the pump will hyperpolarize the membrane and increase the proton motive force, which is crucial for maintaining or increasing the turgor pressure. We added this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, and added an extra paragraph to the text.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we showed that the HS::axr3-1 line unable to respond to auxin still responded normally to FC. In the new version, we included the fusicoccin growth data for afb5-5, SAUR19-GFP, ost2-2D and ost2-2Dxaha2-5 mutants as well; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and the text.</p><p><italic>4) In the Introduction the authors state &quot;Despite these recent findings, there is also ample evidence demonstrating the importance of the ABP1 pathway&quot;.

For the protoplast swelling, please see the point 9 of this response.</p><p><italic>5) At several points the authors use the word &quot;perfect&quot; to describe something. Since nothing is perfect, words like &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; would be better.</italic> We changed ‘perfect’ as suggested.</p><p><italic>6) Describing an experimental system as &quot;spectacular&quot; (subsection “Stabilization of SAUR19 protein leads to auxin-independent growth”, first paragraph) is a bit over the top.

Again, refer to point one above.</italic> </p><p>Here the main point of the sentence was supposed to be that apoplast acidification needs nuclear auxin signaling –i.e. there are no rapid pathways that acidify the apoplast. We rewrote the sentence as follows: “Both the auxin-induced apoplast acidification and growth require new protein synthesis, Aux/IAA protein degradation, and are dependent on the SAUR proteins (Spartz et al., 2014). In other words, no non-genomic auxin pathway is required to acidify the apoplast and regulates growth in the hypocotyl.”We hope it is clearer now?</p><p><italic>9) It is important for these authors to consider the possibility that all of the rapid-auxin electrophysiological responses are in fact related to transport of auxin rather than action. Since auxin uptake is likely to involve proton mediated symporters or antiporters and auxin efflux is likely to be an electrogenic efflux of the negatively charged auxin ion, there are likely to be very rapid changes in the PMF (equal to sum of δ pH and EMF) that may be small and unrelated to the auxin growth response.

That was the reason to include protoplast swelling references. The possibility that the rapid electrophysiological effects of auxin are actually connected with auxin transport is interesting. We do not feel competent to say that the protoplast swelling papers that we referred to are ‘poorly interpreted’. Anyway, we removed the protoplast swelling from the paper conclusions, because indeed it was inappropriate there, but we kept it in the Introduction, for the above mentioned reasons.</p><p><italic>10) The difference between afb5-5 and the other tir1/afb lines may be due to specialized function of AFB5.
