Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsoventral embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates for BMP gradient formation is through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often along with ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. To delineate the mechanism in zebrafish, we precisely quantified the BMP activity gradient in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Our analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a <italic>bmp</italic> transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Surprisingly, rather than supporting a counter-gradient mechanism, our analyses support a fourth model, a source-sink mechanism, which relies on a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22199.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before an animal is born, a protein called BMP plays a key role in establishing the difference between the front and the back of the animal. Cells nearer the front of the embryo contain higher amounts of the BMP protein, whilst cells nearer the back have progressively lower levels of BMP. This gradient of BMP ‘concentration’ affects the identity of the cells, with the level of BMP in each cell dictating what parts of the body are made where.</p><p>The prevailing view among scientists is that the BMP gradient is created by an opposing gradient of another protein called Chordin, which is found at high levels at the back of the embryo and lower levels near the front. Chordin inhibits BMP and the interaction between the two proteins establishes the gradients that create order across the embryo.</p><p>Zinski et al. used computer models to investigate how the BMP gradient is created. Several possibilities were considered, including the effect of Chordin. Comparing the models to precise experimental measurements of BMP activity in zebrafish embryos suggested that a different mechanism known as a source-sink model, rather than the opposing Chordin gradient, may be responsible for the pattern of BMP found in the embryo. In this model, the BMP is produced at the front of the embryo and moves towards the back end by diffusion. At the back of the embryo, BMP is mopped up by Chordin, resulting in a constant gradient of BMP along the embryo.</p><p>Many other processes that control how animals grow and develop rely on the formation of similar protein gradients, so these findings may also apply to other aspects of animal development. Understanding how animals grow and develop may help researchers to develop strategies to regrow tissues and organs in human patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BMP signaling</kwd><kwd>mathematical model-based computational screens</kwd><kwd>quantitative analysis</kwd><kwd>BMP diffusion</kwd><kwd>BMP shuttling</kwd><kwd>counter-gradient</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM056326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinski</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>Mary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD073156,T32 HD08318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinski</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Bu</surname><given-names>Ye</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><name><surname>Dou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Umulis</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>Mary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinski</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Embryo-wide quantitative analysis of BMP signaling in zebrafish embryos, combined with a mathematical model-based computational screen, challenges the prevailing model of an antagonist counter-gradient shaping the gastrula BMP morphogen gradient and supports an antagonist sink with BMP diffusion mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogen gradients pattern axonal pathways, the neural tube, the dorsal-ventral (DV) and anterior-posterior (AP) embryonic axes, as well as multiple organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bökel and Brand, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rushlow and Shvartsman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sansom and Livesey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tuazon and Mullins, 2015</xref>). Morphogens are defined as factors that form a spatially non-uniform distribution spanning multiple cell-lengths that instructs different cell fates at distinct levels. Their importance in specifying multiple cell fates in a gradient has spurred decades of research deciphering how they work. In 1970, Francis Crick proposed that such a gradient could be formed by a source of morphogen flowing to a sink that destroyed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crick, 1970</xref>). We now know that the mechanisms by which morphogen gradients are established are diverse and complex, and that understanding these mechanisms is paramount to understanding developmental biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>). Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) act as morphogens repeatedly during development, including in patterning the embryonic DV axis, the neural tube, and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bier and De Robertis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>).</p><p>BMP morphogen systems are established by a network of extracellular regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutko and Mullins, 2011</xref>). A crucial class of these regulators is the BMP antagonists, defined by their ability to bind BMP ligand with high affinity, thereby blocking ligand-receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brazil et al., 2015</xref>). During axial patterning in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, three antagonists, Chordin, Noggin, and Follistatin play key roles in inhibiting BMP signaling to promote dorsal cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dal-Pra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khokha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schulte-Merker et al., 1997</xref>). These antagonists bind to the BMP ligand, preventing BMP from binding its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iemura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piccolo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zimmerman et al., 1996</xref>). In both zebrafish and frogs, Chordin differs from Noggin and Follistatin in its expression domain, its phenotype, and its interaction with the metalloprotease Tolloid (Tld). Chordin is expressed in a larger domain than Noggin and Follistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dal-Pra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khokha et al., 2005</xref>). While the loss of Chordin ventralizes the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammerschmidt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oelgeschläger et al., 2003</xref>), the depletion of Noggin or Follistatin alone or together does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dal-Pra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khokha et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike Noggin and Follistatin, Chordin can be cleaved by the metalloprotease Tolloid, releasing bound BMP ligand and allowing it to signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blader et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piccolo et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of Chordin, Sog, can act as both a BMP agonist and as an antagonist during DV patterning. To act as an agonist, Sog binds to and moves BMP ligand via facilitated diffusion to regions of Tolloid activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tolloid then cleaves Sog, which releases BMP thus increasing peak BMP levels, a process altogether known as shuttling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marqués et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Umulis et al., 2010</xref>). The shuttling mechanism is essential to <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV patterning, where Sog shuttles BMP ligand from lateral regions to dorsal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marqués et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Umulis et al., 2010</xref>). This shuttling mechanism is required to steepen the BMP signaling gradient and specify the dorsal-most cell fates in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marqués et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Umulis et al., 2010</xref>).

In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the shuttling of a particular BMP ligand, ADMP, by Chordin was reported to play a role in DV axial patterning in the scaling of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reversade and De Robertis, 2005</xref>). In the mouse, Chordin has been suggested to shuttle BMP ligand from where it is expressed in the intervertebral disc to its site of signaling in the vertebral body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zakin et al., 2010</xref>). Mathematical models of zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> DV patterning have predicted that Chordin could shuttle BMP ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The transcriptional profiles of zebrafish BMP components at the onset of gastrulation resemble that of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutko and Mullins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>sog</italic> is expressed ventral-laterally while the BMP ligand <italic>dpp</italic> is expressed dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Vertebrates have undergone a DV axis inversion with respect to arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Robertis and Sasai, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerhart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacalli, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sander and Schmidt-Ott, 2004</xref>), thus <italic>chordin</italic> is expressed dorsally while <italic>bmp</italic> ligands are expressed ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, whether Chordin acts as a BMP agonist by shuttling BMP ligand during DV patterning in zebrafish or other vertebrates has not been determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, the mechanism by which the BMP ligands and antagonists shape this gradient is unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed: 1) an inverse gradient of BMP antagonists imparts the shape of the BMP signaling gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connors et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Little and Mullins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomsen, 1997</xref>), 2) BMP antagonists generate the peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), 3) the gradient shape mirrors the shape of the <italic>bmp</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramel and Hill, 2013</xref>), and 4) the gradient is generated by BMP diffusing from its ventral source to a dorsal sink of BMP antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and multiple may act in combination.</p><p>To identify the mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in the zebrafish embryo, we established a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient. We integrated the results with a mathematical modeling approach, using the experiments to inform our model selection. The modeling then provided information on key parameters to measure to identify the mechanism by which the BMP signaling gradient is formed. We used phosphorylated Smad5 protein as a direct read-out for BMP signaling in both wild type (WT), <italic>chordin</italic> mutant, and <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygous embryos. We quantified nuclear phosphorylated-Smad5 (P-Smad5) fluorescent intensity across the entire embryo at single-cell resolution at different stages of development. Combining the P-Smad5 data with a computational screen of mathematical models showed that shuttling of BMP during DV patterning does not shape the gradient, and that a gradient of <italic>bmp</italic> transcription cannot account for the gradient of BMP signaling activity. From these results, we conclude that the signaling gradient patterning the vertebrate DV axis is generated by either a source-sink or counter-gradient mechanism. To discern between these mechanisms, we developed and measured the diffusion rate of a BMP2-Venus fusion protein in the zebrafish blastula and found that it is relatively mobile, which supports a large number of source-sink simulations, but far fewer counter-gradient simulations. Our results suggest that significant differences exist between the biophysical parameters of conserved proteins in zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV patterning. Through quantification and modeling, we present a new view of the mechanism that the BMP antagonists and ligand use to establish the BMP signaling gradient patterning the DV axis in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying the Wild-Type signaling gradient</title><p>To measure the BMP signaling gradient, we quantified the levels of the BMP signal transducer P-Smad5 across the entire embryo at single cell resolution.

BMP signaling patterns prospective head and rostral trunk DV axial tissues during late blastula to mid-gastrula stages at ~5 to 7 hr post fertilization (hpf) in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashiguchi and Mullins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tuazon and Mullins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tucker et al., 2008</xref>). We quantified the BMP signaling gradient at 30 min intervals across this period. We found that the ventral-most 30˚ undergoes about a 2-fold intensification from 4.7 to 6.7 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This is accompanied by a 3 to 5 fold increase in the slope of the gradient in ventrolateral regions of the embryo (0–75 degrees) over this 2 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, the lateral region encompassing the high slope (&gt;0.5 A.U./degree) expands from a size of 20˚ to 75˚, meaning that by 6.7 hpf, nearly half the embryo falls within this high slope region. This contrasts with <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV patterning, where an initial broad, low-slope distribution of P-Mad is refined into a steep peak of BMP signaling covering only the dorsal-most 8% of the embryo (11 cell lengths) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sutherland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</xref>).

We counted the number of cells in each embryo from a single timecourse and observed an approximately 70% increase in cell number from 4.7 to 6.7 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Cell nuclei do not change significantly in size during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keller et al., 2008</xref>). The increase in cell number occurs throughout the embryo and is not restricted to a particular DV region, while the change in gradient amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and slope is restricted to the ventral third of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus an increase in cell number does not account, via an unknown mechanism, for the increase in amplitude or slope. Additional support that cell number has little effect on gradient shape stems from the observation that the absolute number of cells at a given time point can vary by as much as 20% between different embryos within the same cross or between crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) with no detectable change in gradient shape or phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mathematical modeling and computational screen of BMP gradient formation</title><p>We then performed a computational screen of mathematical models to investigate which gradient-forming mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>) fit the WT P-Smad5 gradient profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

If 80% of the BMP ligand was degraded where it was produced or accumulated there, the simulation was classified as transcriptional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’</xref>). If the majority of BMP diffused away from its site of production rather than being bound by Chordin, the simulation was considered a source-sink mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’</xref>). Conversely, if the majority of BMP was bound at its site of production by Chordin, the simulation was classified as a Chordin counter-gradient mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’</xref>). We classified a simulation as shuttling if the ventral-most point in the predicted <italic>chordin</italic>-/- BMP profile was at least 20% lower than in WT, as shuttling by the antagonist leads to a net accumulation of ligand in the ventral-most region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’’</xref>).

The source-sink mechanism required either high diffusivity with predominantly high decay rates or low diffusivity with low decay rates, while the transcriptional mechanism filled a near complementary parameter space with progressively higher BMP diffusivity necessitating higher decay rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which allows the P-Smad5 gradient to match the <italic>bmp</italic> expression profile. Neither of these mechanisms constrained Chordin range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Although only four shuttling mechanism solutions were identified, they required both BMP-Chordin range to be high and its decay rate to be low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). The shuttling solutions also required BMP range to be high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,I</xref>), because if Chordin moved ventrally to bind BMP in this scenario, it would interfere with the <italic>bmp</italic> expression gradient matching the BMP signaling gradient.

However, Smad5 or another signal transducing component could be limiting in the ventral-most cells of WT embryos, rendering them unresponsive to further increases in free ligand.

Gastrulation begins in zebrafish at 6 hpf. While the initial <italic>bmp</italic> expression domains are established independently of BMP feedback, a BMP feedback loop becomes active with reported onset times ranging from ~5.5 to 6.5 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kishimoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller-Bertoglio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramel and Hill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid et al., 2000</xref>).

There was no discernable difference in the <italic>bmp2b</italic> domain size at 4.7, 5.3, or 5.7 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), indicating that <italic>bmp</italic> transcriptional feedback is not active before 5.7 hpf.

We then measured recovery of fluorescence over one hour. To ensure we only recorded extracellular Bmp2b-Venus, we photobleached a region away from the cells producing Bmp2b-Venus.

This faster rate of Venus diffusion indicates that it per se does not reduce BMP2 diffusion.</p><p>A measured BMP diffusivity of ~4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s fits a large portion of the source-sink modeling simulations. In fact, 1421 source-sink simulations have diffusivities within 2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s of our measured diffusivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). In contrast, only 31 counter-gradient simulations were within 2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s of our measured diffusivity, and these simulations have very high BMP decay rates (above 10<sup>−3</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). A decay rate of that magnitude would cause the half-life of BMP ligand in the embryo to be very short, &lt;10 min for decay rates above 1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>/s. We can infer the BMP lifetime in the embryo based on our previous studies. We found previously that a pulse of injected BMP ligand protein in a <italic>bmp</italic> deficient embryo sustains P-Smad5 for at least 1.5 hr after injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>). In another study, we found that P-Smad5 can persist for a maximum of 40–60 min in the absence of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tucker et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, P-Smad5 persistence 1.5 hr after a BMP protein pulse indicates that the ligand remains for at least 30 to 50 min after injection, if P-Smad5 can persist for 40–60 min in the absence of signaling. A BMP ligand lifetime of 30 to 50 min is inconsistent with the low BMP half-lives required for the counter-gradient simulations, but consistent with the BMP half-lives of source-sink simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), suggesting that the source-sink mechanism much more likely establishes the BMP signaling gradient patterning the zebrafish DV axis.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms are robust to uniform <italic>chordin</italic> expression.

We then used these data to inform a computational model-based screen of over 1,250,000 combinations of biophysical parameters of the major extracellular BMP modulators. We defined mathematical criteria to distinguish between four widely proposed mechanisms to set up the BMP signaling gradient. Our computational model-based screen excludes the shuttling and transcriptional mechanisms as possibilities for establishing our measured WT and <italic>chordin</italic> mutant P-Smad5 profiles, providing compelling evidence that the BMP signaling gradient patterning the zebrafish DV axis is established by either a counter-gradient or source-sink mechanism. We further determined that the effective diffusivity of the BMP ligand in the zebrafish embryo is relatively fast, consistent with 1421 source-sink simulations but only 31 counter-gradient ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Comparison of models that satisfy zebrafish or <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like gradient profiles suggests that the range of BMP-Chordin differs between zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like DV patterning mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), and the <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like patterning mechanism requires restricted Tolloid degradation rates for BMP-Chordin and Chordin, which were not observed for the zebrafish patterning mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fish vs. flies: A mechanism diverged</title><p>The shape of the BMP signaling gradient differs greatly between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish DV patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

For shuttling to be possible in a system with a broad peak of signaling, as it is in zebrafish, the BMP-Chordin cleavage rate needed to be low enough to allow BMP-Chordin to move farther and distribute BMP over a larger region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,L</xref>). For shuttling to be possible in a system with a tight peak of signaling as it is in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, BMP-Chordin cleavage needed to be rapid to release BMP-Chordin over a smaller region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). We show that a shuttling mechanism is not functioning in zebrafish, indicating that this delicate balance of BMP-Chordin mobility and Tolloid cleavage has been lost or did not emerge in vertebrate DV patterning.</p><p>Sog and its vertebrate homolog Chordin differ in how they are processed by the metalloprotease Tolloid depending on whether it is bound to BMP ligand. Chordin can be cleaved by Tolloid whether bound to BMP ligand or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piccolo et al., 1997</xref>), while Sog is only cleaved when bound to BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marqués et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, when Sog is mutated to allow it to be processed by Tolloid regardless of BMP binding, the shuttling of BMP-Sog complexes in flies is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that this attribute of Sog is necessary for effective shuttling. However, surprisingly, we found numerous shuttling simulations in our zebrafish modeling-based screen with the opposite properties, high Chordin cleavage rates and low BMP-Chordin cleavage rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,L</xref>). The requirement for preferential cleavage of BMP-Chordin by Tolloid only emerged when we screened for <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like simulations, in which shuttling was generating a tight peak of BMP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,F</xref>). This suggests that the preferential processing of BMP-Sog by Tolloid seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not an inherent requirement of the shuttling mechanism, but may instead be a result of both the requirement to facilitate shuttling <underline>and</underline> to generate a steep gradient.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV patterning, the BMP signaling gradient is so steep that its base falls well within the region of <italic>bmp</italic> expression, far from the <italic>sog/chordin</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francois et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holley et al., 1995</xref>). To suppress lateral BMP signaling and form the <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like simulations seen in our mathematical model-based screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), Sog/Chordin needed to have a high range to diffuse far from its site of expression to inhibit BMP signaling over most of the <italic>bmp</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,E</xref>). Therefore, the degradation of free Sog/Chordin by Tolloid needed to be low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). However, to generate a narrow peak of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), BMP-Chordin cleavage by Tolloid needed to be high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Therefore, the requirement to preserve the range of action of free Chordin, combined with the requirement to rapidly cleave BMP-Chordin to generate a steep peak of signaling may explain why the preferential cleavage of BMP-Sog by Tolloid is needed for shuttling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparing the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms</title><p>While the shuttling mechanism relies on the movement of the bound BMP-Chordin complex, the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms rely on the movement of unbound BMP and Chordin. The source-sink mechanism relies on BMP diffusing dorsally to bind Chordin. Conversely, the counter-gradient mechanism relies on Chordin diffusing ventrally to bind BMP. Consistent with this, we found that the majority of simulations consistent with the source-sink mechanism require a high BMP range and a high BMP diffusivity (above 1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s), while the counter-gradient mechanism requires a high Chordin range and high Chordin diffusivity (above 1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>To illustrate the distinct manners by which a source-sink and counter-gradient mechanism would generate the zebrafish BMP signaling gradients observed, we graphically display in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> the relative contributions of BMP and Chordin diffusion and BMP-Chordin binding to gradient formation for the median simulations that fit our WT, <italic>chordin</italic> mutant, <italic>chordin</italic> +/-, and Bmp2b-Venus FRAP data. The primary differences between the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms manifest in the relative amount of Chordin protein that diffuses ventrally into the <italic>bmp</italic> expression domain and the primary role of Chordin in forming the BMP gradient. A counter-gradient mechanism leads to higher levels of Chordin that extend over a greater region of the ventral <italic>bmp</italic> expression domain compared to a source-sink mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Counter-gradient and source-sink mechanisms also differ significantly in where Chordin binds and inhibits BMP ligand activity along the DV axis, which is consistent with the distinct Chordin protein distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In a counter-gradient mechanism Chordin binds BMP in a broader domain, extending over a much greater extent of the DV axis than in a source-sink mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>). In a source-sink mechanism, Chordin binds BMP largely in dorsal regions and extends little ventrally, effectively generating a driving force for the movement of BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>).

While the source-sink gradient mechanism is also modulated by Chordin, Chordin instead acts in a distinct manner as a sink, binding BMP ligand predominantly in dorsal regions, thus allowing a BMP diffusive gradient to form throughout most of the ventral half of the embryo. Key to deriving this alternate model was the integrated approach used that combined quantitative experimental analysis with computational modeling. Importantly, a role for Chordin in establishing a sink that drives gradient formation would not have been revealed to us had we not performed the mathematical model-based computational screen. By narrowing the compatible simulations successively with the WT, <italic>chordin</italic> +/-, and then <italic>chordin</italic> mutant P-Smad5 profiles, 15-fold more source-sink simulations than counter-gradient simulations perdured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E’</xref>). Furthermore, the computational modeling also illuminated the BMP diffusivity parameter as one to further test the source-sink mechanism. Significantly, our measured Bmp2 diffusivity further supports the source-sink mechanism of gradient formation. Thus the seamless integration of quantitative experimental analysis with mathematical model-based computational screens has proved to be a highly successful approach to elucidating mechanisms of BMP gradient formation. Future studies will be required to definitively determine the mechanism and further test the source-sink and counter gradient models of BMP gradient formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>WT TU (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZIRC_ZL57">ZIRC_ZL57</ext-link>) zebrafish were used as the wild-type strain.

The resulting individual digital embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’–E’</xref>) from each condition were averaged together to generate large datasets from which embryo-wide P-Smad5 levels could be quantified in WT and mutant conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22199.016</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Quantifying nuclear P-Smad5 intensities embryo-wide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Marginal P-Smad5 intensity from a <italic>chd</italic> LOF embryo imaged twice.

The ‘.lsm’ files were converted to ‘.tif’ files using ImageJ, and then imported into Matlab as 1024 × 1024 X Z multidimensional arrays. XY pixels were 0.55 um, Z pixels were 2.3 um. The images were then smoothed using a 9 × 9×3 kernel (most nuclei are 10 × 10×4 pixels large). Local minima and maxima were removed using the ‘imhmax’ and ‘imhmin’ functions. The remaining maxima were found using the ‘imregionalmax’ function on the entire 1024 × 1024 X Z array. Maxima closer together than six pixels were assumed to be in the same nucleus, and were combined. The remaining maxima were assumed to be the centerpoints of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>).</p><p>These centerpoints were used to extract P-Smad5 intensities on the P-Smad5 channel. P-Smad5 distribution in each nucleus was approximately uniform, so a small sphere within each nucleus was averaged to attain the P-Smad5 intensity. On the P-Smad5 channel, pixels within a spherical 6 × 6 × 3 kernel of each maxima were averaged.</p><p>Cell types unresponsive to Bmp signaling were removed. P-Smad5 appears to be uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm during cell division, making measurement impractical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). In dividing cells, chromatin condenses making DNA stains such as Sytox concentrated and bright. Cells with a bright DNA fluorescence staining above 140% of the mean DNA fluorescence were considered dividing and eliminated from the analysis. Extra-embryonic cells such as the Enveloping Layer (EVL) and the Yolk Syncytial Layer (YSL) did not appear to respond to BMP ligand the same way as the deep cells. These cell types are not patterned along the DV axis by BMP, and were eliminated from our analysis. To do so, sparse EVL cells located below the vegetal margin were eliminated by hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11J</xref>). Next, the inner and outer layer of approximately 15% of the total cells was eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11K,L</xref>). The remaining cells were assumed to be non-dividing deep cells.</p><p>Embryos of similar stages were then aligned and conformed to a template embryo of the same stage using Coherent Point Drift (CPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Myronenko and Song, 2010b</xref>). Embryos were aligned in the AP direction by fitting them to a sphere, finding a plane that spanned the marginal region, and rotating until that plane was aligned with the XY axis. Embryos were aligned in the DV direction using the embryonic shield as a morphological marker. Before 6 hpf, when the shield is not present, the embryos were aligned in the DV direction by fitting a polynomial regression to the P-Smad5 gradient around the margin and rotating until the max peak was ventral. Next, embryos were all aligned to a template using an affine CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Myronenko and Song, 2010b</xref>). This corrected for any distortions in embryo shape that may have occurred during fixation and staining.</p><p>Embryos from the same set were subjected to no normalization. Embryos stained and imaged on different days with different settings were normalized by multiplying the entire set by a single scalar value. To determine this normalization scalar, control WT embryos were always imaged in conjunction with each experimental condition. The scalar normalization value was determined by minimizing the sum of the error between the control WT embryos imaged on different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Generating and comparing P-Smad5 profiles around the margin of the embryo</title><p>To generate marginal profiles, a 40 um thick band of cells around the vegetal margin was chosen for each embryo. Cells within that band were grouped into 10 degree intervals and averaged together to form 36 individual points. The left and right side of the gradient were averaged together into a single ventral to dorsal profile. For 3-D embryo-wide averages, all nuclei were projected onto a sphere fitting the embryo. The sphere was then divided into 4800 approximately equilateral triangles. All nuclei falling within each triangle were averaged together. Slopes were obtained by fitting a lowess fit to the averaged 3-D data’s spherical coordinates phi and theta using the ‘fit’ function in Matlab. To determine if the marginal gradients of WT and <italic>chordin</italic> mutant embryos were significantly different, two-tailed T-Tests were performed with a rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).We observed a difference in WT vs. <italic>chordin</italic> mutant embryos that was much larger than our observed embryo-to-embryo variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our t-tests confirmed that our sample sizes are sufficient to discern differences between the WT and <italic>chordin</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mathematical model-based computational screen method</title><p>For each set of parameters defined in the parameter vector, we solved the five non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for BMP ligand, Chordin, Noggin, and the complexes of BMP-Chordin, BMP-Noggin in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Equations were solved on the half-circumference, with ‘symmetry’ boundary conditions imposed on the first and last node-point in the spatial discretization. The half-circumference was discretized into 36 node points with equidistant spacing and the second order spatial derivative is discretized via the finite difference method. The production regions of BMP ligand, Chordin, Noggin, are specified along the nodes by mapping the spatial position to subsequent node position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Tld is treated parametrically as a function of position according to its domain of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Time-stepping of the simulation is handled by the adaptive solver ode15s with a relative tolerance set to 1e-9. The model is solved for the developmental window that spans from 3.5 to 5.7 hpf and all measurements of model error are calculated at 5.7 hpf.</p><p>For each model iteration, parameters were selected from a uniform distribution in log space that covered four orders of magnitude within the physiological range for each parameter. Each parameter was selected independently of the remaining parameters. Adaptive and subsampling methods that increase parameter selection in regions with high variance in model output were not used in our parameter selection for a number of reasons. Firstly, a parameter matrix is produced that is then subdivided across distributed computers to solve the PDEs to produce a stored file of model solutions and parameter vectors associated with the stored solution. For each parameter vector, the PDE system is converted into a set of 180 ordinary differential equations after discretization and dynamically solved for WT, <italic>chd−</italic>/−, <italic>nog−</italic>/<italic>−</italic>, and <italic>chd+/-</italic> conditions using the implicit solver ode15s. Ode15s is well suited to problems with numerical stiffness that arise during numerical screens with random parameters. Thus, for an ensemble of 1 million parameter vectors, the system of differential equations are solved four times to simulate the wt and mutant conditions, increasing the total model evaluations to 4 million. Following calculation of the model solutions for each parameter vector, post processing, sorting, and calculation of model fitness against the data is handled by a separate program that operates on the stored solutions. The separation of model evaluation from model analysis allows for much greater flexibility, the total number of simulation results, and an ability to add additional simulation results to existing simulations that have previously been computed. If a job is interrupted, the index and solutions up to the parameter index are stored and simulation jobs can be restarted at the last iteration point.</p><p>Random sampling is not susceptible to the ‘curse of dimensionality’ that is common to regular grid spacing methods allowing for more efficient estimation of the NRMSD landscape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(C,D)</xref>, and random points fill in the parameter space more evenly than regular grid spacing that forces evaluations of the model within the same parameter hyperplane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caflisch et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref> demonstrates the dense coverage and sampling to estimate the NRMSD values and dense coverage in regions with acceptable NRMSD values. Random sampling of the biophysical parameters is common to these types of problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">von Dassow et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>For each parameter vector, the model is initially solved against WT conditions and subsequent simulations for mutant conditions are carried out for the same parameter vector by setting the corresponding production rates for the mutant to zero and re-simulating. Error between the model results and the fluorescent data are calculated via a two-step process. First, the amplitude of the P-Smad5 fluorescent-intensity data and model peak levels for free BMP are normalized as commonly done when calculating a residual with fluorescent intensity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hengenius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pargett and Umulis, 2013</xref>). This approximation is valid considering that (1) BMP ligands are not saturating receptors and (2) Smad5 activity is not saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The scaling parameter determined for model-fitness against P-Smad5 was then applied to the remaining model results to capture any changes in BMP levels in the mutant simulations. Residuals were calculated for WT and mutant conditions independently and simulations were scored for passing the WT and mutant conditions independently as opposed to using an aggregate residual. Simulations were classified as transcriptional, source-sink, counter-gradient, or shuttling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Constructs, mRNA, and morpholinos (MOs) for FRAP</title><p>Sequence encoding fluorescent protein Venus was amplified from pBSK12-<italic>her1:Ub2-Venus</italic> (a gift from Sharon L.

Embryos used for FRAP were injected in one cell at the 8-cell stage. Embryos were mounted in 1% low melting point agarose (Sigma) in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corporation). FRAP experiments were performed using a LSM 800 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0 objective (D = 0.17 M27 75 mm). Photobleaching in a square region (160.4 μm × 160.4 μm) was performed through the depth of the blastoderm with 100% laser power for ~10 min. In the secreted Venus FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), some recovery occurred at the t = 0 time point at the periphery of the bleached region.

Cells displayed characteristic higher intensity signals in the intercellular space and no signal was detected intracellularly in the non-producing cells. Images are taken before the FRAP experiment commences, and saved every 10 s during acquisition. All files are exported in lossless TIFF format for subsequent quantification in MATLAB. To measure the recovery, all TIFF files are imported into MATLAB and the FRAP region is identified for subsequent measurements. Internal FRAP region is scaled from 8-bit [0 255] to [0, 1] and an extracellular mask is generated by removing background with a minimum threshold level set at 1% of the image maximum value. This excludes the intracellular compartments from biasing the average intensity calculations for the extracellular recovery. With background removed, recovery is calculated as the average fluorescence intensity of the extracellular fluorescence within the masked region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Calculation of diffusion coefficients from FRAP data</title><p>The FRAP region is modeled using a finite-difference equation for diffusion in the FRAP region. Diffusion was estimated by measuring model recovery starting from zero initial conditions and constant concentration boundary conditions. Masked region dimensions for measurement were mapped directly to node-points and distances in the finite difference model to compare and optimize recovery in the mask region. A steepest-descent optimizer with multiple starts was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient for each FRAP experiment. We did not explicitly model the occlusion and tortuosity of the diffusion process caused by the arrangement of cells, nor did it account explicitly for binding and unbinding to HSPGs and other immobile binding components. The impact of binding and the role of occlusions in the diffusion path are very well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cussler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garnett, 1904</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Robb Krumlauf as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors use quantitative imaging and modeling to come to the conclusion that a source-sink mechanism underlies the BMP/Chordin patterning system. This is novel as formation of a BMP gradient by a source-sink mechanism is distinct from previously reported models such as transcriptional, shuttling, or counter-gradient mechanisms. The measurement of BMP2 diffusion in vivo is novel. The topic is not only of broad interest but also quite controversial, and this study brings some much needed clarity to the field. The main weakness is the limited attempt to minimize the parameter space used for the modeling. Some of the measurements are difficult but there are several key measurements that need to be made. The computational and experimental analyses are incomplete, and some details of simulations have not been provided. For their model to be made more convincing a variety of concerns/comments should be fully addressed.</p><p>Major specific points:</p><p>1) The source-sink model is puzzling in light of previous reports showing that zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> chordin mRNA injections at the one-cell stage can fully rescue zebrafish chordino mutants (Fisher and Halpern, 1999; Schulte-Merker et al., 1997). In these embryos, injected chordin mRNA is present throughout the embryo and yet, the rescued mutants develop normally to adulthood (and presumably form a normal BMP gradient). The mRNA rescue experiments also call into question the notion that the transcriptional pattern is critical for BMP gradient formation. The authors should discuss the various models in light of these reports.</p><p>2) Relevant to the above, did the authors measure the effective diffusion of BMP2 by FRAP in chordin mutant embryos? This will provide experimental evidence to test the models.</p><p>3) Cell numbers increase substantially between 4 and 7 hpf, when the authors report a steep increase in the BMP gradient. How does the change in cell number in the zebrafish gastrula (between 4-7 hpf) compare to that during fly DV patterning? To what extent does this account for the increase in gradient slope in zebrafish?</p><p>4) The authors state &quot;The equations were simulated 1,000,000 times&quot;.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> lists 15 free parameters; therefore each parameter can, in principle, only take ~2.5 different values when combined randomly (2.52^15 is ~10^6). However, the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that many more values have been chosen for individual parameters. The authors should clarify how the parameters were varied in the simulations.</p><p>5) The authors state &quot;To our surprise, there are greater than 50 times the number of source-sink to counter-gradient modeling solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>'), suggesting that the source-sink mechanism predominates.&quot; However, the number of different parameter combinations that can explain the data cannot be taken as a measure of support for a specific modelling solution. Different parameter combinations can result in similar solutions simply because the model is not identifiable or because it is difficult to find a unique solution when trying to fit the data directly.</p><p>6) If the authors already have or are making a BMP-destabilized GFP/degradFP fusion, precise measurement of BMP2 decay rates would be useful to distinguish between the models. If these are available it would be useful but not essential for the paper.</p><p>7) Why were the equations solved for the developmental window from 3.5 to 5.7 hpf and not from 4.7 to 6.7 hpf, when the pSMAD intensities were measured?</p><p>8) The authors presumably solved the equations in 1D in order to sample parameter space in a reasonable amount of time. I think it would add to the paper if the authors showed that the same parameters found to satisfy the 1D case would also set up the 3D P-Smad gradient when solving the equations in the hemispherical geometry of the zebrafish embryo as in Zhang, Lander, and Nie, J. Theor. Biol., 2007.</p><p>9) Can the P-Smad5 gradient of the chordin heterozygotes be included? Why are they &quot;not shown&quot;? Does the model fit the chordin heterozygote P-Smad5 gradient?</p><p>10) The pSmad5 measurements are impressive but the models ultimately rest on the BMP transcript and (active and inactive) protein expression profiles. I understand that there are no good antibodies to detect BMP but minimally, the authors need to use now standard quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization approaches to measure BMP transcript distribution.</p><p>11) The BMP FRAP experiment goes a long way to reduce parameter space but why not also measure BMP diffusion in the presence of Chordin? This experiment seems trivial but would greatly help to test the shuttling model.</p><p>12) The characterization of the bmp2-venus chimera is too superficial. Does it have the same range and activity as wild-type bmp2?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Systems biology derived source-sink mechanism of BMP gradient formation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. =</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. In the absence of measurements of BMP diffusion in the presence of chordin or Chordin protein expression, the alternate model Zinski et al. suggest for BMP gradient formation cannot be substantiated. To support their clams, it is crucial that the authors:i) determine how the BMP gradient forms in the presence of uniform chordin ii) show expression of tagged BMP / Chordin proteins at early gastrula stages in mutants injected with RNA. iii) clarify how random sampling was done.</p><p>Key comments:</p><p>1) In response to how BMP diffuses in the absence and presence of chordin (previous review comments 2 and 11), in the revised Zinski m/s, the authors examined BMP diffusion without chordin. However, they did not examine BMP diffusion with uniform chordin. This is a crucial test of the model which is missing.</p><p>2) In their explanation of how their data and preferred model can explain the previous reports of rescue of chordino mutants with uniform chordin injections, Zinski et al. contend that chordin RNA injections likely do not generate uniform Chordin protein expression in embryos. But no evidence is provided to support this view – either experimentally or in their simulations. (The triple morphant is not relevant to the comment).</p><p>3) Regarding how parameters were varied in their simulations, the authors state that they prefer random sampling as opposed to a regular grid.</p><p>Did the authors refine sampling depending on the outcomes? If solutions did not change in a region in parameter space, did they increase the sampling density?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22199.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major specific points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The source-sink model is puzzling in light of previous reports showing that zebrafish and Xenopus chordin mRNA injections at the one-cell stage can fully rescue zebrafish chordino mutants (Fisher and Halpern, 1999; Schulte-Merker et al., 1997).

The authors should discuss the various models in light of these reports.</italic></p><p>The ubiquitous expression of <italic>chordin</italic> RNA, which can rescue <italic>chordin</italic> mutant embryos, likely does not generate a ubiquitous distribution of Chordin protein due to the presence of Tolloid and Bmp1a, two ventrally expressed metalloproteases that degrade Chordin protein. The rescue of embryos lacking Chordin, Tolloid, and Bmp1a using <italic>chordin</italic> RNA injection at the one-cell stage has not been attempted as it is a difficult experiment to execute, but we hypothesize that it would not be effective. We agree that the <italic>chordin</italic> expression domain is likely not critical to BMP gradient formation.</p><p><italic>2) Relevant to the above, did the authors measure the effective diffusion of BMP2 by FRAP in chordin mutant embryos? This will provide experimental evidence to test the models.</italic></p><p>We have now repeated our FRAP experiments in Chordin deficient embryos and have added it to the main text of the paper and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>. The effective diffusivity of Bmp2b-Venus in <italic>chd</italic> deficient embryos matched the effective diffusivity we had measured in WT embryos. This new experiment validates our previous assumption that the majority of BMP-Venus observed in our WT FRAP experiments was not bound to Chordin, as expected due to the ventralized embryonic phenotype at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> row 2). However, performing the FRAP experiment in <italic>chd</italic> deficient embryos assures that 100% of Bmp2b-Venus observed is not bound to Chordin, removing the potential impact of a subpopulation of Chordin-bound Bmp2b-Venus on the FRAP measurements in WT embryos.</p><p><italic>3) Cell numbers increase substantially between 4 and 7 hpf, when the authors report a steep increase in the BMP gradient. How does the change in cell number in the zebrafish gastrula (between 4-7 hpf) compare to that during fly DV patterning? To what extent does this account for the increase in gradient slope in zebrafish?</italic></p><p>Fly DV patterning takes place during stage 5. Mitosis is paused during stage 5 until gastrulation begins at stage 6. Cells do not divide at this time, but nuclear localization of P-Mad increases from nearly none to a steep gradient in less than 1 hour from early stage 5 to early stage 6 when gastrulation begins. Thus, in this context while there are no changes in nuclei density, the gradient of PMad starts broad and refines to a higher amplitude and sharper profile [1]. However, in the context of patterning the embryo termini in <italic>Drosophila</italic> via Torso RTK signaling, the nuclei are present in a syncytium in the absence of cell membranes, where the nuclear density plays a role in shaping the gradient of phosphorylated ERK at the termini [2]. The nuclei density doubles with each successive division providing an increase in nuclear trapping of dpERK at the most terminal positions, resulting in a steeper gradient with higher peak amplitude and reduced gradient extent or length over time. The zebrafish embryo is not a synctium, so this same nuclear trapping mechanism could not occur. Moreover, the gradient DV length is constant over this time period, also inconsistent with this type of mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>From our cell counts in embryos from a single timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), we observe an approximately 70% increase in cell number from 4.7 to 6.7 hours post fertilization (hpf) and a 100% increase in nuclear P-Smad5 amount. Cell nuclei do not change significantly in size during this time [3]. The increase in cell number occurs throughout the embryo and is not restricted to a particular DV region. So half of the 70% increase in cell number occurs in lateral and dorsal regions, where the slope does not change over this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The increase in slope observed during the 2 hour period occurs over the ventral half of the embryo, which accounts for 35% of the increase in cell number, while the gradient peak doubles in amplitude. Thus an increase in cell number, via an unknown mechanism, could not account for the increase in slope. Additional support that cell number has little effect on gradient shape, we observed that the absolute number of cells at a given time point can vary by as much as 20% between different embryos within the same cross or between crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) with no detectable change in gradient shape or phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) The authors state &quot;The equations were simulated 1,000,000 times&quot;.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> lists 15 free parameters; therefore each parameter can, in principle, only take ~2.5 different values when combined randomly (2.52^15 is ~10^6). However, the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that many more values have been chosen for individual parameters. The authors should clarify how the parameters were varied in the simulations.</italic></p><p>For each model iteration, parameters were selected from a uniform distribution in log space that covered four orders of magnitude within the physiological range for each parameter. Each parameter was selected independently of the remaining parameters. We prefer the coverage offered by this method, as opposed to a regular grid wherein each parameter has a set of discrete values and coverage at those values is complete. Random sampling is not susceptible to the “curse of dimensionality” that is common to regular grid spacing methods allowing for more efficient estimation of the NRMSD landscape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(C,D</xref>), and random points fill in the parameter space more evenly than regular grid spacing that forces evaluations of the model within the same parameter hyperplane [4]. Random sampling of the biophysical parameters is common to these types of problems [5, 6].</p><p><italic>5) The authors state &quot;To our surprise, there are greater than 50 times the number of source-sink to counter-gradient modeling solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>'), suggesting that the source-sink mechanism predominates.&quot; However, the number of different parameter combinations that can explain the data cannot be taken as a measure of support for a specific modelling solution. Different parameter combinations can result in similar solutions simply because the model is not identifiable or because it is difficult to find a unique solution when trying to fit the data directly.</italic></p><p>We agree with this point and have changed the sentence so it now reads: &quot;To our surprise, the source-sink modeling solutions emerged more frequently within our computational screen than the counter-gradient solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>'). &quot;</p><p><italic>6) If the authors already have or are making a BMP-destabilized GFP/degradFP fusion, precise measurement of BMP2 decay rates would be useful to distinguish between the models. If these are available it would be useful but not essential for the paper.</italic></p><p>We agree it would be useful, but these constructs are not currently available.</p><p><italic>7) Why were the equations solved for the developmental window from 3.5 to 5.7 hpf and not from 4.7 to 6.7 hpf, when the pSMAD intensities were measured?</italic></p><p>While dorsal-ventral cell fate for the head and trunk is largely specified from 4 to 7 hours post fertilization [7-10], <italic>bmp</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic> are first expressed after the mid-blastula transition (MBT) at 3 hpf [11-14]. We started our simulation at 3.5 hpf to account for the time needed for these proteins to be translated, folded, and secreted. We have now added that rationale to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) The authors presumably solved the equations in 1D in order to sample parameter space in a reasonable amount of time. I think it would add to the paper if the authors showed that the same parameters found to satisfy the 1D case would also set up the 3D P-Smad gradient when solving the equations in the hemispherical geometry of the zebrafish embryo as in Zhang, Lander, and Nie, J. Theor. Biol., 2007.</italic></p><p>We agree that this would add to the paper and the development of data-driven three dimensional models continues to be an effort of our work. We have made progress in developing data-driven 3D models and this is being worked on but not achievable within the timeframe of the revision. The primary scope of the modeling effort herein focused on broad coverage of potential mechanisms to provide an unbiased view of data-consistent mechanisms. At this time, the screen and scope of our study is only achievable with models with one space dimension. Moreover, the inputs to the system based on gene expression are distributed symmetrically across the embryo, so a 1D model should largely reflect one in 3D. We added the rationale for performing a 1D model now to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>9) Can the P-Smad5 gradient of the chordin heterozygotes be included? Why are they &quot;not shown&quot;? Does the model fit the chordin heterozygote P-Smad5 gradient?</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now added a comparison of WT to <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygotes to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). There is no significant change in the P-Smad5 gradient or embryonic phenotype between WT and <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygous embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). We also now required mathematical model solutions to fit our <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygous data, when the Chordin production rate was set to 50%. Forcing the model to fit our <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygous data decreased the overall number of solutions, but did not eliminate all solutions of either the source-sink or counter-gradient mechanism. The mathematical model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and associated text have been updated to include <italic>chordin</italic> heterozygous data.</p><p><italic>10) The pSmad5 measurements are impressive but the models ultimately rest on the BMP transcript and (active and inactive) protein expression profiles. I understand that there are no good antibodies to detect BMP but minimally, the authors need to use now standard quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization approaches to measure BMP transcript distribution.</italic></p><p><italic>bmp2b</italic> expression is now quantified by RNAScope fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We have adjusted our BMP production gradient in our mathematical model to fit the measured <italic>bmp2b</italic> expression gradient and simulated the mathematical model an additional 1,000,000 times. The adjusted BMP production gradient increased the overall number of solutions, but did not modify our conclusions about the mechanisms. All modeling figures and data displays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) have been updated incorporating the new data.</p><p><italic>11) The BMP FRAP experiment goes a long way to reduce parameter space but why not also measure BMP diffusion in the presence of Chordin? This experiment seems trivial but would greatly help to test the shuttling model.</italic></p><p>While we agree that measuring the diffusivity of BMP bound to Chordin would be very useful for further testing the shuttling model, the experiment is not feasible without extensive overexpression or the development of additional tools. To see Bmp2b-Venus, we must moderately overexpress it. To ensure all Bmp2b-Venus is bound to Chordin, we would need to heavily overexpress Chordin. Chordin has been shown to interact with Tsg [15], Bmper [16-18], Ont1 [19], and HSPGs [20]. By overexpressing both BMP and Chordin, these interacting factors, which may limit BMP-Chordin diffusion could be diluted out, causing FRAP to overestimate the diffusivity of the BMP-Chd complex. Since we do not have time to develop more sophisticated tools to test this, we think it is best not to include a double overexpression experiment.</p><p><italic>12) The characterization of the bmp2-venus chimera is too superficial. Does it have the same range and activity as wild-type bmp2?</italic></p><p>To assess whether Bmp2b-Venus is properly processed and remains attached to the Venus tag, we performed a Western Blot for Venus on embryos injected with <italic>venus</italic> or <italic>bm2b-venus</italic> RNA. We have added this experiment to the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the activity and range of the Bmp2b-Venus chimera, we rescued embryos lacking Bmp2b with <italic>bmp2b-venus</italic> RNA. It has been previously reported that embryos lacking Bmp2b can be rescued using <italic>bmp2b</italic> RNA [21]. We were able to rescue embryos to a WT phenotype by injecting <italic>bmp2b-venus</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, rows 5-7). This result has been added to the text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, a direct comparison of <italic>bmp2b</italic> RNA activity and <italic>bmp2b-Venus</italic> activity is not possible, as RNA activity can vary from synthesis reaction to synthesis reaction. In addition to this we have now measured secreted Venus diffusion rates with our approach and added additional measurements for Bmp2b-Venus diffusion in <italic>chordin</italic> MO-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>At this time we are unable to compare the range of Bmp2b to that of Bmp2b-Venus. Range has two components: diffusivity and decay rate. Measuring diffusivity via FRAP requires the protein in question to be tagged fluorescently. While decay rates of Bmp2b and Bmp2b-Venus could be measured and compared by injecting Bmp2b and Bmp2b-Venus protein and performing a western blot time-series, previous estimates of Tgf-β decay rates have relied exclusively on tagged proteins [22].</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Key comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In response to how BMP diffuses in the absence and presence of chordin (previous review comments 2 and 11), in the revised Zinski m/s, the authors examined BMP diffusion without chordin. However, they did not examine BMP diffusion with uniform chordin. This is a crucial test of the model which is missing.</italic></p><p>We presume that by requesting that we measure BMP diffusion with uniform chordin that the reviewers are asking us to measure bound BMP-Chd diffusion. We do assert that the Shuttling mechanism requires high diffusivity of BMP-Chordin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> x-axis), however, our <italic>chordin</italic>-/- mutant data already exclude the Shuttling mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, when discussing the Source-Sink versus the Counter-Gradient mechanism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we omitted an important plot of BMP-Chd diffusivity in our latest submission, which addresses the reviewers’ point. We thank the reviewers for making us aware of this. A plot of BMP-Chd diffusivity shows that possible values of BMP-Chd diffusivity over the 4 orders of magnitude tested in our simulations does not distinguish between the Counter-Gradient and Source-Sink mechanisms. Both of these mechanisms are compatible with BMP-Chd diffusivities over 4 orders of magnitude from nearly immobile (10<sup>-2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) to free diffusion (10<sup>2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s). Therefore, measuring BMP-Chd diffusivity would not help discern between the two remaining models, Counter-Gradient and Source-Sink. We added this BMP-Chd diffusivity plot now to the manuscript to clarify this important point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In their explanation of how their data and preferred model can explain the previous reports of rescue of chordino mutants with uniform chordin injections, Zinski et al. contend that chordin RNA injections likely do not generate uniform Chordin protein expression in embryos. But no evidence is provided to support this view – either experimentally or in their simulations. (The triple morphant is not relevant to the comment).</italic></p><p>In comment 1 of the previous review, the reviewers asked us to discuss the rescue of <italic>chordino</italic> mutants with uniform <italic>chordin</italic> RNA injections. We address this point now by simulating the system with ubiquitous Chordin production. We found that 426 of the 1452 solutions that fit our WT, <italic>chordin</italic>-/-, and <italic>chordin</italic>+/- data and BMP diffusivity (within 2 um<sup>2</sup>/s of our measured 4.4 um<sup>2</sup>/s) retain a WT BMP gradient when Chordinis uniformly produced. The 426 remaining solutions are all source-sink mechanisms with steep gradients of Chordin that are high dorsally and low ventrally. The results of the simulations show that the BMP gradient is generated by Tolloid degrading Chordin ventrally. We include these simulation results that show how uniform <italic>chordin</italic> RNA can rescue a <italic>chordin</italic> mutant in the Results section of our paper, as a new panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion, as it provides further support for the source-sink mechanism.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding how parameters were varied in their simulations, the authors state that they prefer random sampling as opposed to a regular grid.</italic></p><p><italic>Did the authors refine sampling depending on the outcomes? If solutions did not change in a region in parameter space, did they increase the sampling density?</italic></p><p>For each model iteration, parameters were selected from a uniform distribution in log space that covered four orders of magnitude within the physiological range for each parameter. Each parameter was selected independently of the remaining parameters. Adaptive and subsampling methods that increase parameter selection in regions with high variance in model output were not used in our parameter selection for a number of reasons. Firstly, a parameter matrix is produced that is then subdivided across distributed computers to solve the pdes to produce a stored file of model solutions and parameter vectors associated with the stored solution. For each parameter vector, the PDE system is converted into a set of 180 ordinary differential equations after discretization and dynamically solved for wt, chd-/-, nog-/-, and chd+/- conditions using the implicit solver ode15s. Ode15s is well suited to problems with numerical stiffness that arise during numerical screens with random parameters. Thus, for an ensemble of 1 million parameter vectors solved, the system of differential equations are solved 4 times to simulate the wt and mutant conditions, increasing the total model evaluations to 4 million. Following calculation of the model solutions for each parameter vector, post processing, sorting, and calculation of model fitness against the data is handled by a separate program that operates on the stored solutions. The separation of model evaluation from model analysis allows for much greater flexibility, the total number of simulation results, and an ability to add additional simulation results to existing simulations that have previously been computed. If a job is interrupted, the index and solutions up to the parameter index are stored and simulation jobs can be restarted at the last iteration point.</p><p>Random sampling is not susceptible to the “curse of dimensionality” that is common to regular grid spacing methods allowing for more efficient estimation of the NRMSD landscape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(C,D</xref>), and random points fill in the parameter space more evenly than regular grid spacing that forces evaluations of the model within the same parameter hyperplane (Caflisch et al., 1998). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref> demonstrates the dense coverage and sampling to estimate the NRMSD values and dense coverage in regions with acceptable NRMSD values.
