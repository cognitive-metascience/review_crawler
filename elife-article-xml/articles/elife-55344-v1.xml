play an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory and are largely classified based on amino acid sequence homology and pharmacological properties. Among group III metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR7 and mGluR4 show high relative expression in the rat hippocampal area CA2. Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors are known to down-regulate cAMP-dependent signaling pathways via the activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins. Here, we provide evidence that inhibition of group III mGluRs by specific antagonists permits an NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent long-lasting synaptic potentiation in the apparently long-term potentiation (LTP)-resistant Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses. Moreover, long-lasting potentiation of these synapses transforms a transient synaptic potentiation of the entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 synapses into a stable long-lasting LTP, in accordance with the synaptic tagging/capture hypothesis (STC). Furthermore, this study also sheds light on the role of ERK/MAPK protein signaling and the downregulation of STEP protein in the group III mGluR inhibition-mediated plasticity in the hippocampal CA2 region, identifying them as critical molecular players. Thus, the regulation of group III mGluRs provides a conducive environment for the SC-CA2 synapses to respond to events that could lead to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CA2 region</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>synaptic tagging and capture</kwd><kwd>Group III mGluR</kwd><kwd>mGluR4</kwd><kwd>mGluR7</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC-CBRG-0099-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreedharan</surname><given-names>Sajikumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFIRG/0037/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreedharan</surname><given-names>Sajikumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2017-T3-1-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreedharan</surname><given-names>Sajikumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DPRT/944/09/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreedharan</surname><given-names>Sajikumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-185-000-271-720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sreedharan</surname><given-names>Sajikumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011002</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behnisch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benoy</surname><given-names>Amrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Group III metabotropic glutamate receptor inhibition facilitates synaptic plasticity in the plasticity-resistant synapses of hippocampal area CA2, a brain region critical for social memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity and memory formation have remained fascinating areas of neuroscience research and have been widely studied in the hippocampus, a brain area that is primarily responsible for memory formation and spatial navigation. The hippocampal area CA2 has recently been the subject of much attention owing to its involvement in social memory formation and socio-cognitive information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pagani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). The excitatory neurons in the CA2 area have unique intrinsic properties such as more negative resting membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Distal CA2 neurons receive strong excitatory inputs from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC-LII) directly and these EC-CA2 synapses express activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). In contrast, the Schaffer collateral inputs (SC) from CA3 to CA2 do not support activity-dependent LTP in response to typical induction protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Although the functional importance for this difference in synaptic plasticity is unclear, it reflects the ability of various brain regions to precisely regulate activity-dependent modulation of synaptic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caruana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudek et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to adjacent hippocampal areas, CA2 has a distinct molecular profile, with an enhanced expression of several genes and proteins, such as Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulanger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caruana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farris et al., 2019</xref>) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4), a specific group III mGluR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotuhi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phillips et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein coupled receptors which consists of four subtypes, namely mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8. They are largely presynaptically localized and downregulate neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niswender et al., 2010</xref>). These receptors are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and, via the activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins, lead to the inhibition of the cAMP cascade that is critical for the maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mercier and Lodge, 2014</xref>). Therefore, given the prominent expression of mGluR4 in the CA2 region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phillips et al., 1997</xref>), we speculated that the elevated expression of group III mGluRs in the CA2 area is one of the factors contributing to the resistance to canonical activity-dependent plasticity observed at the SC-CA2 synapses.</p><p>A typical mGluR is primarily composed of an intracellular C-terminal tail, seven transmembrane domains (heptahelical) and an extracellular N-terminal domain or Venus flytrap domain (VFD), which ‘traps’ orthosteric ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beqollari and Kammermeier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niswender et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a cysteine-rich linker bridges the N-terminal domain with the first of seven transmembrane domains. Although a number of orthosteric agonists that are specific to each mGluR has been identified to date, mGluR specific antagonists are relatively scarce. Orthosteric antagonists such as (RS)-MPPG and (RS)-CPPG are selective to group III mGluRs and display a hierarchical preference to these receptors over group II mGluRs. (RS)-a-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenyl glycine or CPPG, a phenylglycine analogue, shows a 30-fold selectivity towards group III receptors over group II receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). In order to develop a more potent group III mGluR antagonist, derivatives of the parent phenylglycines (MPPG and CPPG) were produced, such as UBP1110, UBP1111 and UBP1112 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). These compounds also exhibit greater selectivity towards group III mGluRs over group II mGluRs.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate in greater detail the expression and role of group III mGluRs in the hippocampal CA2 region. We analyzed the relative expression levels of different group III mGluRs within the CA2 region and hypothesized that the high expression of group III mGluRs in area CA2 is a probable factor limiting plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses. Due to the lack of specific antagonists for each group III mGluR subtype, we used two general but potent group III mGluR antagonists, (RS)-CPPG and UBP1112, and studied if activity-dependent plasticity could be induced in the LTP-resistant Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses upon group III mGluR inhibition. We further addressed whether group III mGluR inhibition supports late associativity, a unique phenomenon that leads to the strengthening of weakly stimulated synaptic inputs that are usually incapable of expressing long-lasting potentiation. This study also highlights the activation of ERK/MAPK and the downregulation of STEP protein in area CA2 as a result of group III mGluR inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of group III mGluRs promotes NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent long-lasting LTP in Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses</title><p>Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses are known from previous studies to be resistant to activity-dependent LTP induced by conventional induction protocols that are effective in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).

In particular, the spatial expression pattern of mGluR4 is distinctly concentrated in area CA2, in contrast to most of the other mGluRs that are widely expressed throughout the rat hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotuhi et al., 1994</xref>). mGluR4 expression is the highest in the area CA2, while there is only sparse mGluR4 expression in the dentate gyrus, CA3, and subiculum, and no observable expression in the CA1 region. A similar trend has also been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phillips et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>To corroborate the above observations, we further studied the relative expression levels of group III mGluRs within the CA2 region using qPCR. We observed that mGluR7 and mGluR4 mRNA expression levels within the CA2 region were much higher than the expression of mGluR6 and mGluR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, one-way ANOVA, p<italic>=</italic>0.0001). The high relative expression levels of mGluR7 and mGluR4 within area CA2 point towards a possible role of these receptors in restricting the induction of synaptic plasticity in the SC-CA2 synapses. To study if pharmacological inhibition of group III mGluRs promotes LTP induction at SC-CA2 synapses, we bath applied group III mGluR antagonists, either (RS)-CPPG or UBP1112, for a total time period of 1 hr. After the initial 30 min of drug application, a strong tetanization (STET, triple 100 Hz tetanizations) was given to the SC-CA2 synaptic input to induce late-LTP in the presence of the antagonists. When either (RS)-CPPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; blue circles) or UBP1112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; blue circles) was bath applied, STET in SC-CA2 input induced an immediate significant LTP (at 30 min, Wilcoxon test; p=0.005 and 0.017 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, respectively) that was maintained for at least 4 hr (at 240 min, Wilcoxon test; p=0.013 and 0.027 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, respectively).

Thus, we tested whether group III mGluR inhibition facilitates LTP in SC-CA2 by acting presynaptically. To test this, we have analyzed the effect of group III mGluR antagonists (RS)-CPPG or UBP1112 on high frequency stimulation-mediated summation of field potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>) and high frequency stimulation-mediated EPSCs at 0 mV holding potential recorded in the whole-cell voltage clamp configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In both cases, we could not observe any presynaptic changes. Thus, in our experimental conditions, the observed SC-CA2 LTP is not based on mechanistically enhanced glutamate release during the 100 Hz trains. We therefore assume, together with the other data presented in this study, that the observed effect of the group III mGluR inhibition is postsynaptically mediated. In addition, when a weak tetanization was delivered to EC-CA2 and SC-CA1 synaptic inputs in the presence of (RS)-CPPG or UBP1112, a short-lasting early-LTP was observed in the tetanized pathways, similar to that in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–H</xref>). These results suggest that the LTP induction threshold was not changed by group III mGluR inhibition in the EC-CA2 and SC-CA1 pathways. Hence, application of group III mGluR inhibitors lowers LTP induction threshold only in SC-CA2 synapses.</p><p>To further understand the nature of group III mGluR inhibition-mediated LTP, we analyzed its protein synthesis and NMDA receptor dependency using protein synthesis inhibitors emetine and anisomycin, and the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5.

According to the STC hypothesis, an LTP-like event can induce short-lasting ‘tags’ that mark the potentiated synapses. It is noteworthy that ‘tags’ can be set by both weak and strong synaptic events (in this case, weak and strong tetanization to induce early- and late-LTP, respectively), and can eventually capture plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) that are synthesized de novo in response to strong synaptic activity that is sufficient to induce late-LTP. We performed experiments within the STC framework to determine whether late-LTP induction in the presence of group III mGluR antagonists, (RS)-CPPG and UBP1112, can lead to the expression of PRPs that can contribute to the potentiation of ‘tagged synapses’ and transform an early-LTP in the other synaptic input to a late-LTP (‘strong before weak’ paradigm (SBW)). After recording a stable baseline for 30 min, a STET was delivered to the SC-CA2 synaptic input in the presence of the group III mGluR antagonists as per the previously mentioned experimental design. A statistically significant potentiation was observed in the SC-CA2 synaptic input immediately after the induction of late-LTP by STET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A &amp; C</xref>, blue circles; statistically significant potentiation at 30 min, Wilcoxon test; p=0.012 and 0.018 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A &amp; C</xref>, respectively) and maintained throughout the experiment (p=0.012 and 0.018 at 240 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A &amp; C</xref>, respectively). Application of the antagonists was continued for another 30 min and a weak tetanization (WTET) was induced in the EC-CA2 synaptic input 1 hr after the induction of STET in the SC-CA2 synaptic input.

Of particular interest, Schaffer collateral synapses that project onto CA2 (SC-CA2) do not express canonical activity-dependent LTP, unlike SC-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caruana et al., 2012</xref>). Reasons for this include expression of particular genes, such as Regulator of G protein signalling 14 (RGS14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2018</xref>), and extracellular matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carstens et al., 2016</xref>), as well as higher calcium buffering and calcium extrusion in CA2 spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simons et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, area CA2 has a higher density of interneurons as compared to area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botcher et al., 2014</xref>). Activity-dependent plasticity of CA2 interneurons, namely long-term depression at inhibitory synapses (iLTD), has been shown to increase the excitatory drive between CA3 and CA2, allowing SC inputs to drive action potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs), thus providing a mechanism whereby CA2 PNs can be engaged by CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nasrallah et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, what contributes to the plasticity-resistant property at only the proximal Schaffer collateral synapses of CA2 neurons is not fully understood. Indeed, SC-CA2 synapses exhibit synaptic potentiation under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstens and Dudek, 2019</xref>). For example, a previous study from our lab has demonstrated that bath application of the neuropeptide substance P can elicit NMDAR-dependent lasting synaptic potentiation at both SC and EC synapses at CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasgupta et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we investigated the role of group III mGluRs in synaptic plasticity in CA2 using specific pharmacological inhibitors (RS)-CPPG and UBP1112. The most striking result is that an activity-dependent Hebbian LTP, that is NMDAR- and protein synthesis-dependent, becomes inducible at SC-CA2 synapses upon inhibition of group III mGluRs. The results from this study also suggest that group III mGluR inhibition-mediated LTP at SC-CA2 synapses is mechanistically postsynaptic and inhibition of these receptors decreases the threshold for inducing LTP only in SC-CA2 synapses. Furthermore, inhibition of group III mGluRs facilitates associative plasticity through synaptic tagging and capture at the entorhinal cortical and Schaffer collateral synaptic inputs to CA2 neurons.</p><p>This observed modulation of synaptic plasticity in the CA2 region by group III mGluRs is dependent on the ERK/MAPK pathway, which is important for the maintenance of LTP in other hippocampal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">English and Sweatt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenblum et al., 2002</xref>). Our result suggests that STEP is downregulated when group III mGluRs are inhibited during the induction of LTP. As the protein-tyrosine phosphatase STEP is a known inactivator of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pulido et al., 1998</xref>), this reduction in STEP could have contributed to the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed after group III mGluR inhibition-mediated LTP. In turn, this increased activation of ERK could have led to the activation of downstream mechanisms that sustain synaptic potentiation, such as de novo protein synthesis. Indeed, studies have shown that the loss of STEP leads to enhanced hippocampal LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venkitaramani et al., 2011</xref>) in mice. Moreover, STEP interacts with NMDA receptors and has been shown to be a critical regulator of NMDA receptor trafficking and function as the reduction in STEP expression by RNA interference results in increased NMDAR function and surface expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braithwaite et al., 2006</xref>). These are suggestive of the possible functional implications of the observed reduction in STEP levels in hippocampal area CA2 upon group III mGluR inhibition.</p><p>The notion that group III mGluR inhibition facilitates induction and maintenance of potentiation through enhancing ERK signaling pathway and the resulting synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) is supported by our results that MEK inhibitors and translation inhibitors abrogated mGluR inhibition-mediated LTP. This elevation of PRPs could also underlie our observation of the expression of synaptic tagging/capture in CA2 in the presence of group III mGluR antagonists. Frey and Morris demonstrated in their seminal paper that a transient form of LTP (early-LTP), induced by a weak stimulus, can be converted to a more persistent form of LTP (late-LTP), induced by a strong stimulus, if the two stimuli are applied on different synapses of the same neuron within a time frame of 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>). The ‘tag’, formed as a result of weak stimulation, can capture the newly synthesized PRPs, provided by the strong stimulation, in order to sustain the LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>). Typically, SC-CA2 synapses do not engage in STC, but we observed STC-like processes in the presence of (RS)-CPPG and UBP1112. This substantiates the notion that inhibition of group III mGluRs not only provides a conducive environment for LTP induction and maintenance in CA2 neurons but also promotes PRP synthesis to a level high enough to help associate weak information with strong information in a time-dependent manner.</p><p>It is to be noted that the high relative expression of mGluR4 in the CA2 region appears to be restricted to the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phillips et al., 1997</xref>). Similar enrichment of mGluR4 in CA2 region has not been reported from expression studies in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farris et al., 2019</xref>). However, functionally, both species display similar plasticity resistance at CA2 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasgupta et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests possible mechanistic differences in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the CA2 region across species.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that group III mGluRs gate SC-CA2 synaptic plasticity by suppressing ERK signaling and maintaining an elevated expression of STEP. Blocking group III mGluR activity during high-frequency stimulation can facilitate the induction of LTP, as well as late-associative plasticity, in a protein synthesis- and NMDAR-dependent manner. However, the implications of group III mGluR-mediated regulation of SC-CA2 plasticity and associativity on social memory performance remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC- protocol approval number R16-0135) of the National University of Singapore. The rats were anesthetized using CO<sub>2</sub> and decapitated to take out the brains quickly, which were then placed in 4°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 17 D-Glucose equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (carbogen). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm in thickness) were prepared from the right hippocampus with a manual tissue chopper. For field potential recordings, the slices were then transferred onto a nylon net in an interface chamber (Scientific Systems Design, Ontario, Canada) and incubated at 32°C. An aCSF flow of 1 mL/min and carbogen consumption of 16 L/h were maintained throughout. The whole process from anaesthetization to the transfer of slices to the chamber was fast and did not exceed the average duration of 5 min. The slices were incubated for at least 2–3 hr before starting the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Field potential recordings</title><p>For most of the experiments, monopolar lacquer-coated stainless-steel electrodes were positioned in the hippocampal area CA2. The stimulating electrodes were located in the Schaffer collaterals (CA3 → CA2) and cortical fibers in the <italic>Stratum lacunosum-moleculare</italic> (Entorhinal cortex → CA2) and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from the distal dendritic region of the CA2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The independence of the two synaptic pathways was ensured by a cross-input paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) protocol with an interpulse interval of 50 ms similar to that of our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasgupta et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to our previous study, the absence of PPF indicated that the two stimulation electrodes activate independent SC and EC synaptic inputs to CA2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasgupta et al., 2017</xref>). The stimulation strength for the experiments was determined by an input-output curve (stimulus intensity vs. field EPSP slope) and set to obtain an fEPSP slope of 40% of the maximum slope value. A custom-made software, PWIN (Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg, Germany, can be provided upon request), was used to regulate stimulation and to record and monitor fEPSP signals online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shetty et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A stable baseline was recorded for at least 30 min prior to the application of pharmacological substances and electrical LTP induction.

In addition, a CED 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge Electronic Design) and a custom-made software program, PWIN, were used to regulate stimulation and to record evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (evoked EPSCs). Evoked EPSCs were recorded from the soma of visually identified pyramidal neurons located within the CA2 region of the hippocampus. Patch pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 135 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.25 EGTA, 2 Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 0.1 spermine, seven phospho-creatine, and 5 QX-314 (pH 7.3).

Schaffer collateral projections were stimulated at 0.05 Hz by 200 µs voltage pulses generated by an isolated pulse stimulator (Model 2100, AM systems). The stimulation strength (2–5 V) was adjusted to evoke EPSCs with an amplitude of approximately 50 pA. Baseline synaptic currents were recorded for at least 10 min prior to LTP induction. LTP was induced within 10 min after whole-cell break-in by a one second 100 Hz stimulation, synchronized with a membrane depolarization to 0 mV for two seconds through the patch-pipette (paired HFS (dep. to 0 mV + 100 Hz/s)).

That unmasked LTP has all the features that define Hebbian LTP, including the capacity to associatively support long-term LTP in other synapses. The observation that classical Hebbian LTP is actively suppresed in CA2 is novel and significant, considering the emerging -and increasing- interest in this hippocampal subfield. This novel finding should be of general interest to researchers studying synaptic plasticity. The experiments were well executed, and the results are convincing. The reviewers suggest strengthening several important points to support the findings:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One obvious limitation concerns the question of whether the type III mGluRs limit LTP by acting pre- or postsynaptically. These mGluRs are mostly presynaptic whereas the induction and expression of classical LTP is postsynaptic. Thus, a simple scenario would be that the type III mGluRs somehow limit transmission at high frequencies, preventing the induction of LTP with tetanic stimulation. The presynaptic scenario is easy to check. If that were the case, the induction LTP with pairing protocols (low freq. stim. + depolarization to 0mV) should work even in the absence of the antagonists.

Indeed, we have used a similar kind of pairing protocol for the induction of LTP in SCCA2 by providing 1x100Hz stimulation coupled with depolarization to 0 mV (dep. to 0 mV + 100Hz/s). This was not explicitly represented in Figure 3 initially. To avoid further confusion, we have now replaced œHFS representation in Figure 3 with œPaired HFS (dep. to 0 mV + 100Hz/s). Using this protocol, we could not induce long-lasting LTP at SCCA2 synapses (Figure 3B).</p><p>To check whether the type III mGluRs limit LTP by acting pre- or postsynaptically, we have now analyzed the LTP induction traces from single cell and field recording experiments from three groups: (1) without type III mGluR inhibitors, (2) with (RS)-CPPG and (3) with UBP1112. In short, we could not find any specific pre-synaptic enhancement in the presence of the drugs. We have now included these findings in the Results section and the data are now presented in the manuscript as Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1 A-F and Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2 A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Within CA2, is the threshold for LTP at entorhinal inputs altered by the group III mGluR antagonist?

We have now tested this idea by inducing an early-LTP (1x100 Hz, 21 pulses) in EC-CA2 and SCCA1 synapses. The early-LTP induced in the presence of group III mGluR inhibitors did not transform to long-lasting LTP and was comparable to normal early-LTP in EC-CA2 and SC-CA1 synapses. Thus, the antagonist lowers the threshold for inducing LTP specifically in SC-CA2 synapses. We have now discussed these findings in the manuscript and the new data are presented in the manuscript as Figure 3â€”figure supplement 3 A-H.</p></body></sub-article></article>
