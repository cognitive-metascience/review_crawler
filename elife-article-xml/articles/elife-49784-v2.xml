One especially challenging problem occurs when a replication fork encounters a barrier in the template DNA (e.g. a DNA lesion or tightly bound protein) that triggers its collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambert and Carr, 2013</xref>). Collapsed forks require the intervention of homologous recombination proteins to resume DNA synthesis through a process termed recombination-dependent replication (RDR) (also called break-induced replication [BIR] if the collapsed fork is broken) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ait Saada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakofsky and Malkova, 2017</xref>). RDR is thought to prevent mitotic catastrophes by ensuring that genome duplication is completed before chromosomes are fully segregated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Özer and Hickson, 2018</xref>). However, this beneficial function of RDR is somewhat offset by its proclivity to cause mutations and genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ait Saada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakofsky and Malkova, 2017</xref>). Completion of DNA replication by an oncoming canonical fork, converging with the collapsed fork, limits the need for RDR and, therefore, reduces the frequency of mutations and genome rearrangements that would otherwise be caused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jalan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). However, this type of fork convergence, involving an active and collapsed fork, is not without its own risks as it can lead to genomic deletions via a process called inter-fork strand annealing (IFSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our favoured model for IFSA posits that the collapsed replication fork undergoes regression followed by Exo1-dependent resection to form a fork with a protruding 3’ single-stranded (ss) DNA tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). This is followed by the Rad52 recombination protein binding the tail and annealing it to complementary ssDNA exposed in the lagging strand gap of an oncoming replication fork. If this annealing occurs between repetitive DNA elements, then cleavage of the resulting ‘IFSA junction’ by a DNA structure-specific nuclease, such as Mus81, causes the formation of a genomic deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, it was found that Fml1 plays an important role in suppressing genomic deletions induced by replication fork collapse at the <italic>RTS1</italic> replication fork barrier (RFB) in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). However, it was not established whether these were deletions coming from Rad52-mediated IFSA or from a pathway involving D-loop formation by Rad51 catalysed strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fml1 is a member of the FANCM family of DNA helicases/translocases, which play a variety of roles in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basbous and Constantinou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whitby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xue et al., 2015b</xref>). The importance of FANCM in humans is highlighted by the fact that it both promotes fertility and acts as a potent tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basbous and Constantinou, 2019</xref>). Many of the roles attributed to FANCM family members have been linked to their ability to catalyse branch migration of DNA junctions by harnessing the motor activity of their conserved N-terminal DEAH helicase domain. For example, they catalyse the dissociation of D-loops to drive DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by synthesis-dependent strand annealing, and regress stalled replication forks to promote lesion bypass by template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crismani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gari et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gari et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). FANCM family proteins also have a non-catalytic C-terminal domain that variously controls and directs their functioning through interaction with other proteins. One of these interactions, which is conserved from yeast to human, is with the centromeric proteins Mhf1 and Mhf2 (also known as CENP-S and CENP-X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). These small histone-fold proteins combine to form a structure that resembles the histone H3/H4 tetramer, which acts to support and modulate FANCM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although many roles have been attributed to FANCM and its orthologues, the finding that Fml1 suppresses deletions that might stem from IFSA represented a potentially novel function for this family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). In this paper we confirm that Fml1 does indeed suppress Rad52-mediated IFSA. Moreover, we establish that this role is dependent on its DNA motor activity and is promoted by Mhf1-Mhf2 in a manner that is dependent on its interaction with Fml1’s C-terminal domain. Finally, we reveal a new in vitro activity for Fml1 (and, therefore, potentially for other members of the FANCM family too), namely catalysing the restoration of a regressed replication fork, which we speculate could account for how it suppresses IFSA in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fml1’s catalytic activity and C-terminal domain are required for it to suppress <italic>RTS1</italic>-induced spacer-dependent deletions</title><p>To investigate Fml1’s role in supressing IFSA, we used a recombination reporter consisting of a direct repeat of <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> heteroalleles, with an intervening <italic>his3<sup>+</sup></italic> gene and <italic>RTS1</italic> RFB, inserted at the <italic>ade6</italic> locus on chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>RTS1</italic> is a polar RFB meaning that it only blocks replication forks in one direction and at the reporter it is positioned in its so-called ‘active orientation’ (AO), blocking forks moving from telomere to centromere, which is the prevailing direction of replication at this genomic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Replication fork blockage at <italic>RTS1</italic> strongly induces recombination between the <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> heteroalleles leading to two types of <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> recombinants, namely gene conversions and deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The standard version of our recombination reporter has ~3 kb of DNA separating <italic>ade6-L469</italic> and <italic>his3<sup>+</sup></italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). However, we showed previously that expanding this distance, by insertion of spacer DNAs, results in a dramatic increase in the frequency of deletions (so-called spacer-dependent deletions or SDDs), which we proposed stemmed from IFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, to investigate Fml1’s role in suppressing IFSA, we used a version of the reporter with an extra 2 kb spacer and compared the frequency of Ade<sup>+</sup> recombinants in a wild-type and <italic>fml1</italic>∆ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Consistent with our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>), we observed a ~ 3 fold reduction in gene conversions and ~2.5 fold increase in SDDs in a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant. To see if Fml1’s ability to promote gene conversions and suppress SDDs depends on its ATPase and associated DNA helicase/translocase activity, we next tested the effect of mutating conserved residues in its Walker A (K99R) and Walker B (D196N) motifs, which render Fml1 catalytically inactive without affecting its ability to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>). Both mutants exhibit a similar reduction in gene conversions and increase in SDDs as a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant, indicating that Fml1’s catalytic activity is essential for its suppression of IFSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next tested whether Fml1’s C-terminal domain is required for its suppression of IFSA using a <italic>fml1</italic><sup>∆C</sup> mutant, which encodes a truncated form of Fml1 missing its terminal 231 amino acids that nevertheless retains DNA binding and key catalytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This <italic>fml1</italic><sup>∆C</sup> mutant exhibited a similar reduction in gene conversions as a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant (p=0.961). However, whilst it also displayed a significant increase in SDDs compared to wild-type, the increase was noticeably less than observed in a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant (p&lt;0.001). These data indicate that Fml1’s C-terminal domain is required for its ability to promote gene conversions but only partially required for its ability to suppress SDDs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of SDD and gene conversion frequency in different <italic>fml1</italic> mutant strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the direct repeat recombination reporter and its position on chromosome 3.

It was also reported that mutation of three amino acids (Y672, R674 and R678) to alanine within this domain (henceforth referred to as the ‘AAA’ mutation) disrupts Fml1’s interaction with MHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>). To reaffirm these findings, we tested different fragments of Fml1, which were fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) and bound to amylose resin, for their ability to ‘pull-down’ purified MHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Under low salt conditions (10 mM NaCl), several different C-terminal fragments of Fml1, encompassing amino acids 576–690, including one containing the AAA mutation, were able to pull-down MHF, whereas two N-terminal fragments (encompassing amino acids 1–575 and 1–603) and a MBP control could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, under high salt conditions (600 mM NaCl), robust pull-down was only achieved with a Fml1<sup>576-834</sup> fragment, with shorter fragments (Fml1<sup>576-690</sup> and Fml1<sup>576-725</sup>) and Fml1<sup>401-730</sup> showing reduced levels of MHF pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, consistent with our previous findings, AAA mutation of Fml1<sup>576-834</sup> strongly reduces its ability to pull-down MHF under high salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite reducing the interaction between Fml1<sup>576-834</sup> and MHF in vitro, the AAA mutation (<italic>fml1</italic><sup>AAA</sup>) had little or no effect on resistance to the genotoxins methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ultra-violet light (UV) and cisplatin in vivo, whereas a <italic>fml1</italic><sup>∆C</sup> mutant exhibited even greater hypersensitivity to these agents than a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that either the AAA mutation does not sufficiently disrupt Fml1’s interaction with MHF in vivo to affect its DNA repair role or that Fml1’s C-terminal domain is important for some other reason than interacting with MHF. It should be noted that the original phenotypes reported for <italic>fml1</italic><sup>AAA</sup> and <italic>fml1</italic><sup>∆C</sup> mutants were found to be incorrect due to problems with the strains that were tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mapping the region of Fml1 that interacts with Mhf1-Mhf2 (MHF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme for investigating the interaction between different MBP fused fragments of Fml1 and purified MHF.

The substrates contain heterologous DNA arms, which restricts the reaction to fork restoration only, and base pair mismatches that prevent spontaneous branch migration. We first tested whether Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> could catalyse fork restoration by incubating increasing concentrations of the protein with the three different substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). This established that Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> has a clear preference for restoring a lagging gap fork as ~20 fold less protein was required to achieve the same level of fork restoration within 20 min with this substrate compared to the leading gap and regressed fork substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We also confirmed that fork restoration depends on Fml1’s ATPase activity, as Fml1<sup>∆CK99R</sup> was unable to catalyse this reaction with any of the three substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we tested the ability of the Fml1-MHF complex to catalyse fork restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). Similar to Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>, the Fml1-MHF complex exhibits a preference for restoration of the lagging gap fork, albeit it performs less well than Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> at sub-stoichiometric concentrations (i.e. at a ratio of 0.1 nM protein to 0.5 nM lagging gap substrate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). It is also slightly better at restoring the regressed fork substrate than Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). To further evaluate the ability of Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> and Fml1-MHF to catalyse fork restoration, we performed time-course experiments using 0.5 nM of DNA substrate and either 0.5 nM protein (in the case of the lagging gap fork) or 2 nM protein (in the case of the leading gap and regressed forks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). Even with less protein added, the lagging gap fork was restored, by both Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> and Fml1-MHF, with faster kinetics than either the leading gap or regressed forks. Intriguingly, Fml1-MHF exhibited noticeably faster restoration kinetics than Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> on both the lagging gap and regressed fork substrates, even though Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> is better at restoring the lagging gap fork at sub-stoichiometric concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,E,F,G</xref>). A possible explanation for these seemingly conflicting observations is given in the Discussion.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model showing potential ways in which Fml1 could promote gene conversions and suppress SDDs formed by recombination between DNA repeats at a collapsed replication fork.</title><p>Step 1: Replication fork collapses at RFB.

Both versions of Fml1 could unwind the 5’ flap and adjacent DNA strand, indicative of a 3’ to 5’ DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We next set up a reaction in which Rad52 was responsible for annealing the 5’ flap DNA strand into the ssDNA gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Having established this reaction, we tested whether Fml1 could unwind the annealed strand in the presence of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,E</xref>). Both Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> and Fml1-MHF were strongly inhibited from unwinding the annealed strand when Rad52 was present, whereas they were still able to unwind the ‘adjacent’ DNA strand on the gapped substrate with no annealed 5’ flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The extent of inhibition by Rad52 in these reactions appeared to be greater than observed previously with the lagging gap fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the conditions used for the Rad52 annealing reactions were quite different from those used in the fork restoration assays in terms of temperature, incubation time and concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP.

We think it does this by catalysing fork reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 1) and/or by unwinding D-loops formed by Rad51-mediated strand invasion, which would also limit deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 5* - 7*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). However, in addition to influencing Rad51-dependent recombination, Fml1 also suppresses genomic deletions that arise from Rad51-independent IFSA. Most telling is our finding that Rad51-independent SDDs increase by ~8 fold in a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which clearly establishes that Fml1’s role in suppressing SDDs is distinct from its role in promoting Rad51-dependent gene conversions. We have shown that suppression of SDDs depends on Fml1’s ATPase activity, suggesting that its DNA helicase/translocase activity is required. Fml1’s non-catalytic C-terminal domain also supports SDD suppression. However, our observation that Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> retains some ability to suppress SDDs suggests that this domain is only needed to enhance or support the catalytic activity. This contrasts with Fml1’s roles in promoting gene conversion and DNA repair, which are both totally dependent on the protein’s C-terminal domain. We have re-affirmed that the C-terminal domain of Fml1, like in its human and budding yeast orthologues, mediates the interaction with MHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). We have also shown that specific amino acid mutations within Fml1’s C-terminal domain and Mhf2, which weaken Fml1-MHF complex formation in vitro and in vivo, phenocopy a <italic>fml1</italic><sup>∆C</sup> mutant with respect to SDD frequency, and partially phenocopy it with respect to gene conversion frequency and MMS hypersensitivity. These data show that the interaction between Fml1’s C-terminal domain and MHF is important for Fml1’s role in DNA repair and recombination.</p><p>Our finding that the level of Fml1-13Myc is dramatically reduced in <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> cells suggests that a key function for Fml1’s interaction with MHF is to promote its stability. Presumably MHF protects Fml1 from being targeted for removal by the proteasome by preventing its C-terminal domain from misfolding or by shielding a hypothetical degron. Indeed, it is interesting to speculate as to whether modulation of Fml1’s interaction with MHF is used as a mechanism to regulate its level. It will also be interesting to ascertain how the AAA mutation in Fml1 enhances its stability.</p><p>Although clearly important, promoting protein stability is not the sole function for Fml1’s interaction with MHF. This is evident from two observations: 1) Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> is defective in DNA repair and recombination whilst remaining relatively stable; and 2) the synergistic increase in MMS sensitivity of an <italic>fml1</italic><sup>AAA</sup> <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> double mutant correlates with reduced interaction between Fml1 and MHF in vitro but not further reduction in Fml1 stability in vivo. This second observation implies that there must be residual interaction between Fml1 and Mhf2<sup>D87A </sup>in vivo, which is sufficient to promote Fml1 activity without imparting protein stability. We also think that the increased stability of Fml1<sup>AAA</sup> may explain why it appears to be proficient in DNA repair despite exhibiting a weakened interaction with MHF in vitro.</p><p>So, what other role(s) for Fml1’s interaction with MHF? In addition to promoting its stability, MHF may directly aid Fml1 by promoting its DNA binding and/or recruitment to collapsed replication forks. Indeed, it is known that the interaction between Fml1/FANCM and MHF synergistically enhances DNA binding through the creation of an additional DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). It is thought that this enhanced DNA binding explains how FANCM-MHF exhibits a stronger fork regression activity than FANCM alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). We observed a similar difference between Fml1-MHF and Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> in driving the restoration of both lagging gap and regressed forks, with Fml1-MHF catalysing an ~3–4-fold faster reaction rate than Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>. Although we cannot attribute this enhancement to MHF (due to an inability to purify and, therefore, test full-length Fml1 in the absence of MHF), it seems likely that the kinetics of fork restoration would be improved by MHF, either through the additional DNA binding that it brings to the complex, which could promote on-rate and processivity, and/or its potential ability to anneal complementary ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), which could help drive fork restoration. Enhanced DNA binding, especially to linear duplex DNA, may also explain how Fml1-MHF performs worse than Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> when restoring the lagging gap fork at sub-stoichiometric protein concentrations. In this case, turnover of the complex between substrates may be delayed by Fml1-MHF binding to the linear duplex reaction products.</p><p>Our finding that Fml1 can catalyse fork restoration in vitro provides a plausible explanation for how it might suppress SDDs in vivo. Essentially this reaction would deprive Rad52 of the ssDNA tail it would need to anneal into the lagging strand gap of the oncoming replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, steps 2a and 3a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). It might even drive the displacement of an already annealed strand, prior to DNA junction cleavage by Mus81, which would abort the IFSA reaction and thereby prevent deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 5b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly Fml1 exhibits a strong preference for restoring a lagging gap regressed fork, which is precisely the type of substrate that is thought to form following fork collapse at the <italic>RTS1</italic> barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jalan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teixeira-Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, its ability to catalyse this reaction is not impeded by RPA, meaning that it is capable of functioning under conditions similar to those expected in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3a). However, our finding that Rad52 inhibits the restoration reaction suggests that Fml1’s ability to act in vivo will be impeded by the binding of Rad52 to the regressed fork. Human RAD52 was recently shown to impede SMARCAL1 binding to stalled replication forks and thereby inhibit fork reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malacaria et al., 2019</xref>). We suspect that Rad52 similarly inhibits fork restoration in fission yeast by occluding Fml1 from the regressed fork. The extent of fork restoration in vivo may therefore depend on the relative concentrations of Rad52 and Fml1 at the regressed fork, with optimal Fml1 activity occurring prior to Rad52 loading (i.e. steps 2a and 3a rather than 4a and 5b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our in vitro data also indicate that Fml1 is unlikely to be very effective at directly unwinding the IFSA junction in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 5a), as this reaction seems to be even more strongly inhibited by Rad52 than fork restoration.</p><p>In comparison to a lagging gap fork, Fml1 exhibits relatively little activity on a leading gap regressed fork and, unlike the lagging gap fork, its ability to restore this substrate is inhibited by RPA. This would make sense in vivo, where a leading gap regressed fork is thought to be an intermediate of a particular type of DNA damage tolerance pathway, in which uncoupling of leading and lagging strand polymerases is provoked by a lesion in the leading template strand (e.g. a 3-methyl adenine induced by MMS), resulting in progression of the lagging strand polymerase beyond where the leading strand polymerase is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higgins et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marians, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prado, 2018</xref>). Fork regression in this scenario generates a 5’ ssDNA tail, which can be used by the leading strand polymerase in a template switching reaction to bypass the blocking lesion. Various motor proteins, including Fml1 and its orthologues, have been implicated in catalysing this fork regression in vivo to promote template switching and consequent resistance to MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Luis and Machín, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quinet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whitby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xue et al., 2015b</xref>). Following lesion bypass, the regressed replication fork, which is now a fully duplex structure, has to be reset so that DNA replication can continue. Resetting may involve resection by a 5’ to 3’ exonuclease, such as Exo1, to generate a regressed fork with a 3’ ssDNA tail that is amenable to restoration by a motor protein. One motor protein that has been implicated in driving this reaction is human SMARCAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bétous et al., 2013</xref>). However, our finding that Fml1-MHF is also adept at catalysing the restoration of a lagging gap regressed fork suggests that it too may contribute to fork resetting following template switching. A combination of fork regression followed by fork restoration may also account for FANCM’s role in promoting the resumption of DNA synthesis after fork stalling induced by camptothecin in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luke-Glaser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwab et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Similar to bacterial RecG and SMARCAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bétous et al., 2013</xref>), Fml1 is capable of catalysing both fork regression and restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nandi and Whitby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). The balance of these two opposing activities is presumably crucial in determining the extent to which Fml1 promotes and suppresses IFSA. Exactly how this balance is struck remains unclear, but it is likely that additional factors, including Rad52, will be instrumental in vivo. For example, in budding yeast, the fork regression activity of Fml1’s orthologue Mph1 is inhibited by Smc5-Smc6 and promoted by Mte1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xue et al., 2016</xref>). In future studies, it will be important to investigate whether the orthologues of these proteins influence IFSA in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCW8020</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28586299">28586299</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>standard laboratory strain (972) derivatives;

Reactions were started by the addition of Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>/Fml1-MHF and incubated at 37°C for 20 min (or as indicated). For the reactions containing RPA, the reaction mixture was pre-incubated with RPA (20 nM) at 22°C for 15 min before addition of Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>/Fml1-MHF. For fork restoration reactions containing Rad52, the reaction mixture was pre-incubated with Rad52 (210 nM) at 22°C for 10 or 15 min before addition of Fml1-MHF. The unwinding reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> contained 0.1 nM of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 5’flap substrate in strand annealing buffer plus the indicated amount of Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>/Fml1-MHF and were incubated at 22°C for 30 min. The strand annealing/unwinding reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and E</xref> contained 0.1 nM of unlabelled oligonucleotide oMW308 and 0.1 nM of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled single-strand gap DNA (oligonucleotides oMW305, oMW1657 and oMW1658) in strand annealing buffer. All fork restoration and strand annealing/unwinding assays were stopped by addition of 5X termination buffer (2.5% SDS, 200 mM EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K and 50% glycerol). Terminated reactions were resolved on 8% (19:1) polyacrylamide gels in 1X TBE buffer. Gels were dried on 3 MM Whatman paper, exposed to a Phosphor screen which was then scanned by a Fuji FLA3000 PhosphorImager. The digitised data was then analysed using ImageGauge V4.21 software (Fuji). Reactions were quantified by determining the substrate and product band intensities, which were normalized relative to the no protein control. The following formula was then applied: % reaction product = (p<sup>1</sup> - p<sup>0</sup>)/(p<sup>1</sup> - p<sup>0</sup> + s<sup>1</sup>) x 100 where p<sup>1</sup> is the normalized product band intensity, p<sup>0</sup> is the product band intensity from the no protein control reaction and s<sup>1</sup> is the normalized substrate band intensity. All fork restoration, strand annealing and unwinding assays were repeated at least once to ensure that results were reproducible.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

proteins Mhf1 and Mhf2 (CEMP-S, CEMP-X) in promoting genetic stability and genotoxin tolerance. This manuscript builds on the authors' previous work that described a novel Rad51-independent mechanism for genomic deletions during DNA replication, termed inter-fork strand annealing (IFSA). IFSA requires the Rad52 strand annealing protein and Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease and is suppressed by Fml1 helicase. The current study shows that suppression of IFSA requires Fml1 catalytic activity and is partially dependent on the C-terminal regulatory domain. The authors propose that the catalytic activity of Fml1 drives fork restoration to prevent deletions. In the revised manuscript, the authors also show that Rad52 inhibits fork restoration by Fml1-MHF in vitro. The authors identified a mhf2 mutant that is partially defective for Fml1 interaction and MMS resistance, and appears to retain full centromere function. When <italic>mhf2<sup>D87A</sup></italic> is combined with the previously described <italic>fml1<sup>AAA</sup></italic> mutation, which partially impairs interaction with Mhf1-Mhf2, the double mutant exhibits a similar phenotype to the mhf1 null for MMS sensitivity, and is similar to fml1 δ C for deletion formation. Furthermore, they show that Fml1 and Fml1 deltaC catalyze fork restoration in vitro, though activity is lower for the truncated protein.</p><p>The work has been substantially revised after the initial submission; the new data provide a strong support for the authors' model. All previous critiques were adequately addressed.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Fml1-MHF complex suppresses inter-fork strand annealing in fission yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript has been reviewed by three experts who were positive about the overall quality of work and concluded that it provides new interesting information. All three reviewers, however, raised some concern over whether the <italic>mhf2<sup>D87A</sup></italic> is a clean separation-of-function mutation. The experiments suggested by the reviewers are quite doable within the revision time frame, and can clarify some of the main claims of the work:</p><p>Major points that need to be addressed by additional experiments:</p><p>1) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B) Mhf1-GFP foci look very different in wild type and <italic>mhf2<sup>D86A</sup></italic> cells, and the cells appear elongated. The authors suggest the additional nuclear staining of Mhf1-GFP in wild-type cells is due to its co-localization with Fml1. The authors should verify this conclusion by analyzing Mhf1-GFP in fml1 null or fml1 deltaC cells. Whether <italic>mhf2<sup>D87A</sup></italic> is indeed a clean separation of function mutant needs to be addressed by checking endogenous protein level and co-IP in cells with Fml1 and <italic>fml1<sup>AAA</sup></italic>. To be certain that <italic>mhf1<sup>D87A</sup></italic> is a clean separation of function allele, it will be also useful to test whether it affects centromere functions (not just CEN localization).</p><p>2) Main prediction of the proposed model is that Fml1-MHF removes Rad52 from regressed forks. Can this be directly demonstrated in the same set up?</p><p>3) Subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that disrupts the interaction between Fml1 and MHF” and Figure 3B: the epistasis claimed is not supported by these data, since the <italic>mhf2<sup>D87A</sup></italic> mutant shows no sensitivity to MMS at these doses (and therefore epistasis can't be measured). This experiment should be done at 0.01% MMS, where it is sensitive.</p><p>Major points that need be addressed in revision:</p><p>1) (Figure 6) The authors compare biochemical activities of Fml1-MHF and Fml1 deltaC. The lagging gap and regressed forks are the most likely substrates in vivo and both are efficiently restored by Fml1-MHF. Fml1C exhibits higher activity than Fml1-MHF on the lagging gap substrate at sub-stoichiometric concentration, but at stoichiometric concentration, it restores the fork more slowly than Fml1-MHF. Given the high activity of Fml1delta C on the lagging strand substrate, it is surprising that it is not very effective in suppressing deletions. Is Fml1delta C recruited to the stalled fork?</p><p>2) Abstract: &quot;enhanced by Mhf1 and Mhf2&quot; this claim is too strong since the fork restoration activity of Fml1 in the absence of Mhf1/2 isn't done.</p><p>3) Subsection “Fml1 suppresses Rad51-independent SDDs”: it does look like there are some Rad51-dependent deletions as well, please comment</p><p>4) Subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that disrupts the interaction between Fml1 and MHF” paragraph two: It is surprising by the extent of mobility change conferred by the D87A Mhf2 mutant. It is interpreted as being a subtle, separation-of-function mutant, but is seems likely there is a gross conformational change. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>5) Paragraph three in the same section: &quot;speckled&quot; this looks diffuse to me plus the signal from Mhf1 is more extensive than the DAPI. Explain?</p><p>6) Discussion in general: Is there some consequence/advantage of recruiting Fml1 to the centromere? Or do the authors think that Fml1 only plays a role at Mhf1/2 binding to noncentromeric sites?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49784.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points that need to be addressed by additional experiments:</p><p>1) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B) Mhf1-GFP foci look very different in wild type and mhf2<sup>D86A</sup> cells, and the cells appear elongated.

To be certain that mhf1<sup>D87A</sup> is a clean separation of function allele, it will be also useful to test whether it affects centromere functions (not just CEN localization).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 3—figure supplement 3B to include data for Mhf1-GFP localization in a <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant. The <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> mutant does not have an elongated cell phenotype and, therefore, we have used a different example image that is more representative of the overall cell population. The data show that in wild-type cells Mhf1-GFP forms foci that co-localize with Mis6-mCherry at the centromeres plus a more diffuse pattern of fluorescence throughout the rest of the nucleus. However, whilst Mhf1-GFP centromeric foci are observed, the diffuse pattern of nuclear fluorescence is absent or greatly diminished in <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup>and <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant cells.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have been unable to directly measure the level of Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> in cells as epitope tagged constructs are not functional and antibodies raised against Mhf2 have so far been ineffective in western blots. Therefore, we have indirectly assessed the levels of Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> by determining the levels of its obligate partner Mhf1. In Figure 3—figure supplement 3A we show that the levels of Mhf1-GFP are greatly diminished in a <italic>mhf2</italic>∆ mutant whereas the same is not true in either a <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> or <italic>fml1</italic>∆ mutant. The accompanying text describing these new data is in subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that causes MMS hypersensitivity but does not disrupt MHF’s centromeric function” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>To determine the effect of <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> on the interaction between Fml1 and MHF in vivo, we have performed a co-IP experiment using Fml1-13Myc/Fml1<sup>AAA</sup>-13Myc and Mhf1-GFP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Unlike <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, Mhf1-GFP is not detected in Fml1-13Myc or Fml1<sup>AAA</sup>-13Myc immunoprecipitates from <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> mutant cells. The accompanying text describing these new data is in subsections “A D87A mutation in Mhf2 disrupts the interaction between Fml1 and MHF” and “Combining Fml1<sup>AAA</sup> and Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> mutants greatly impairs Fml1<sup>604-834</sup>-MHF complex formation in vitro and causes a synergistic increase in MMS sensitivity in vivo” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>To determine whether the D87A mutation in Mhf1 disrupts its centromeric function, we compared chromosome segregation in wild-type, <italic>mhf2</italic>∆, <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> and <italic>fml1</italic>∆ strains (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and described in subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that causes MMS hypersensitivity but does not disrupt MHF’s centromeric function”). These data show that chromosome segregation is severely disrupted in a <italic>mhf2</italic>∆ mutant but is relatively normal in a <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> mutant.</p><p>In addition to the experiments requested by the reviewers (see above), we have also investigated the effect of <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> on the stability of Fml1-13Myc and Fml1<sup>AAA</sup>-13Myc. In new data, presented in Figure 6, we show that the levels of both Fml1-13Myc and Fml1<sup>AAA</sup>-13Myc are greatly diminished in whole cell extracts from <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> mutant cells compared to <italic>mhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. These data provide evidence that Fml1 stability depends on its interaction with MHF in vivo. The levels of Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>-13Myc and Fml1-13Myc are similar in <italic>mhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells indicating that the instability of Fml1 is mediated by its C-terminal domain. Intriguingly, we also show that the levels of Fml1<sup>AAA</sup>-13Myc are much higher than Fml1-13Myc in both <italic>mhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>mhf2</italic><sup>D87A</sup> cells. Altogether these data provide important new insights into the function of Fml1’s C-terminal domain and interaction with MHF, which are described in subsection “A fml1<sup>AAA</sup> mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> double mutant exhibits reduced gene conversions and increased SDDs” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Main prediction of the proposed model is that Fml1-MHF removes Rad52 from regressed forks. Can this be directly demonstrated in the same set up?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to directly determine whether Fml1-MHF removes Rad52 from regressed forks. However, we have investigated whether Rad52 inhibits fork restoration by Fml1-MHF (Figure 8—figure supplement 2 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1). We show that a large molar excess of Rad52 can partially inhibit restoration of a lagging gap fork by Fml1-MHF in vitro. We also present new experiments in which we have investigated whether Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>/Fml1-MHF can unwind a DNA strand annealed by Rad52 into a ssDNA gap, which is a mimic of the proposed IFSA junction (Figure 9). We find that DNA unwinding of the annealed strand by either Fml1<sup>∆C</sup> or Fml1-MHF is strongly inhibited in the presence of Rad52. Moreover, the level of inhibition appears to be greater than seen in the fork restoration reactions. These new data are described in subsections “Fml1<sup>ΔC</sup> and Fml1-MHF catalyse replication fork restoration in vitro” and “Rad52 inhibits unwinding of a model IFSA junction by Fml1<sup>ΔC</sup> and Fml1-MHF”, with further discussion on in paragraph five of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that disrupts the interaction between Fml1 and MHF” and Figure 3B: the epistasis claimed is not supported by these data, since the mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> mutant shows no sensitivity to MMS at these doses (and therefore epistasis can't be measured).

The new data support the epistasis claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points that need be addressed in revision:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1)</italic> (Figure 6) <italic>The authors compare biochemical activities of Fml1-MHF and Fml1 deltaC. The lagging gap and regressed forks are the most likely substrates</italic> in vivo <italic>and both are efficiently restored by Fml1-MHF. Fml1C exhibits higher activity than Fml1-MHF on the lagging gap substrate at sub-stoichiometric concentration, but at stoichiometric concentration, it restores the fork more slowly than Fml1-MHF. Given the high activity of Fml1delta C on the lagging strand substrate, it is surprising that it is not very effective in suppressing deletions. Is Fml1delta C recruited to the stalled fork?</italic></p><p>We suspect that Fml1<sup>∆C</sup>’s recruitment to collapsed forks is impaired but we currently don’t have any direct evidence for this. However, we have extended our Discussion to mention that Fml1 might require its C-terminal domain (and interaction with MHF) to be efficiently recruited to collapsed replication forks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Abstract: &quot;enhanced by Mhf1 and Mhf2&quot; this claim is too strong since the fork restoration activity of Fml1 in the absence of Mhf1/2 isn't done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Fml1 suppresses Rad51-independent SDDs”: it does look like there are some Rad51-dependent deletions as well, please comment</p></disp-quote><p>We can detect a reduction in deletions in a <italic>rad51</italic>∆ mutant when there is no DNA spacer between the <italic>ade6</italic><sup>-</sup> repeats (e.g. see Sun et al., 2008) and when the spacer is only 2 kb (Figure 1). However, with a 5 kb spacer we don’t see a reduction (Morrow et al., 2017). We have added the following text to make it clear that some deletions can be formed by Rad51: “In a rad51∆ single mutant, the frequency of SDDs is ~2-fold less than in wild-type (p &lt; 0.0001) indicating that some deletions are formed by Rad51.” We also mention in the Discussion that Fml1 may limit Rad51-dependent deletions by its D-loop unwinding activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Identification of a mutation in Mhf2 that disrupts the interaction between Fml1 and MHF” paragraph two: It is surprising by the extent of mobility change conferred by the D87A Mhf2 mutant. It is interpreted as being a subtle, separation-of-function mutant, but is seems likely there is a gross conformational change. This should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the legend for Figure 3—figure supplement 2A: “Note that His-tagged Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> co-migrates with Mhf1 unlike His-tagged Mhf2, which exhibits slower migration. Proteins were fully denatured by boiling in SDS loading dye containing ß-mercaptoethanol prior to running on the gel. Therefore, the difference in migration of His-tagged Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> and His-tagged Mhf2 is not due to a difference in protein conformation.”</p><p>The size-exclusion chromatography profiles of Mhf1-HisMhf2 and Mhf1-HisMhf2<sup>D87A</sup> are also identical, which suggests that the D87A mutation does not cause a major change in protein conformation. One possible explanation for the difference in mobility of His-Mhf2 and His-Mhf2<sup>D87A</sup> is that the D to A change increases hydrophobicity, which is known to promote faster migration in SDS-PAGE (see: Shirai et al., 2008, J. Biol. Chem. 283: 10745-10752).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Paragraph three in the same section: &quot;speckled&quot; this looks diffuse to me plus the signal from Mhf1 is more extensive than the DAPI. Explain?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “speckled” to “diffuse”. We suspect that the diffuse Mhf-GFP fluorescence that extends beyond the DAPI staining is in the nucleolus (which is not stained by DAPI). This is now mentioned in the Figure 3—figure supplement 3B legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion in general: Is there some consequence/advantage of recruiting Fml1 to the centromere? Or do the authors think that Fml1 only plays a role at Mhf1/2 binding to noncentromeric sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no evidence that Fml1 is preferentially recruited to centromeres compared to non-centromeric sites, and the data in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B show that, unlike its non-centromeric localisation, Mhf1-GFP’s ability to localise to centromeres is independent of Fml1. Moreover, in unpublished work we have found that MHF, when bound to its centromeric partner proteins (CENP-T and CENP-W), is unable to interact with Fml1. Nevertheless, it has been reported by others that Fml1 does function at centromeres to suppress gross chromosomal rearrangements caused by recombination between centromeric repeats (Zafar et al., 2017, Nucleic Acids Research 45: 11222-11235). However, at the moment we don’t have anything further to add to the discussion on whether Fml1’s activity at centromeres is fundamentally different from its activity at non-centromeric sites.</p></body></sub-article></article>
