Understanding their operations requires monitoring their activity at synaptic and cellular resolution in 3D at image rates that capture all activity events. In brains that strongly scatter light (<italic>i.e.</italic>, all known adult mammalian brains), the image depth of conventional multiphoton microscopy is limited to 1â2 millimetersÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). To reach depths beyond a few millimeters, the only practical methods currently available are based on microendoscopy, in which miniature probes, such as gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses, are embedded within the brain to relay microscopic images of the neurons belowÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung and Schnitzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levene et al., 2004</xref>). Such systems have been used for fluorescence activity imaging of neurons expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators in a variety of deep nuclei in the mouse brainÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McHenry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy et al., 2017</xref>); however, the spatial resolution has been limited to the cellular level and synaptic structures such as dendritic spines or axonal boutons were not resolved in these studies.</p><p>In addition to its limited spatial resolution, compared to imaging superficial brain regions with a conventional microscope, experiments involving microendoscopy imaging of deep structures face additional challenges. First, surgeries to remove brain tissue and embed endoscope probes typically have lower success rates compared to conventional craniotomies in which no brain tissue is removed. Second, many microendoscopy experiments involve behaviors or brain states with large variability that either cannot be evoked with high fidelity over repeated trials or exhibit short-term adaptation. Finally, research interests are often centered on specific cell types (<italic>e.g.</italic>, inhibitory subtypesÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>] or cholinergic neuronsÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>]) that are usually sparsely distributed in 3D. All these factors limit the yield of experiments using conventional two-photon microendoscopes in which neurons are imaged one cellular layer at a time. For these reasons, a volumetric microendoscopic imaging method, which can simultaneously probe the activity of neural ensembles in 3D while maintaining synapse-resolving spatial resolution, would be greatly beneficial for interrogating neural circuit functions at depth but has yet to be demonstrated for in vivo volumetric imaging of deep brain structures.</p><p>In contrast to the paucity of high-throughput, high-resolution volumetric imaging solutions for microendoscopy, a suite of methods has been developed to image superficial structures at high speed with conventional microscopyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, we developed a Bessel focus scanning method that, when combined with two-photon fluorescence microscopyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Denk et al., 1990</xref>), enabled fast volumetric imaging with synaptic resolutionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2017</xref>) in vivo. By scanning an axially extended focus in two dimensions (2D), we obtained projection images of 3D volumes that increased imaging throughput and reduced data size by 10-to-100-fold. The elongation of the focus in the axial direction also makes imaging resistant to axial motion artifacts, making it ideally suited to the study of neural circuit functions in awake, behaving animals. Here, we showed that high-throughput, high-resolution volumetric imaging of neurons and neural activity in deeply buried nuclei is achievable by combining Bessel focus scanning with microendoscopy. We systematically evaluated and identified commercially available GRIN lenses through which high-quality Bessel foci can be generated. We demonstrated in brain slices ex vivo and in the mouse brain in vivo that volumetric imaging can be achieved with microendoscopy while maintaining synapse-resolving resolution for anatomical and functional imaging of neurons at depth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A two-photon excitation fluorescence microendoscopy system with Bessel focus scanning</title><p>The schematics of a two-photon excitation fluorescence microendoscopy system with a Bessel focus scanning module is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Based on a standard two-photon excitation fluorescence microscope equipped with a pair of galvo scanners, the endoscopy part of the microscope was realized by having a GRIN lens relay the focus of a conventional microscope objective from the image side to the sample side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the small size of the mouse brain, we only considered GRIN lenses with 0.5 mm or 1 mm diameters and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.5. For each diameter, the GRIN lens is either a singlet with NAÂ =Â 0.5 on both sides or a doublet with an object NA of 0.5 and an image NA of 0.2 or 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). With part of the GRIN lens assembly having a lower NA, doublet GRIN lenses have lower intrinsic aberrations than singlets of similar lengths. A 0.45 NA microscope objective was used in conjunction with 0.5-NA singlet GRIN lenses, whereas a 0.2 NA objective was used with doublet GRIN lenses to match their NA on the image side.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40805.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics of two-photon excitation fluorescence microendoscopy with a Bessel focus scanning module.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A Bessel focus scanning module (blue rectangle) made of a spatial light modulator (SLM), a lens (L1), and an annular mask is incorporated into a two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy system.

Briefly, a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) was used to impart specific phase patterns onto the excitation light. As a result, after passing through lenses and being spatially filtered by an annular mask, the excitation light formed a ring-like pattern at the back focal plane of the microscope objective, which in turn generated an axially-elongated, Bessel-like focus in the focal region. A pair of flip mirrors allowed an easy switch from the Bessel imaging mode back to the conventional illumination scheme with a Gaussian beam profile at the back focal plane and a more axially restricted focus (referred to as the Gaussian mode hereafter). In the Gaussian mode,, multiple planes were scanned to acquire anatomical or functional information from a brain volume; whereas in the Bessel mode, volumetric information was obtained via a single 2D scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The resulting fluorescence was collected by a photomultiplier tube following the detection scheme of standard two-photon excitation microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization and identification of GRIN lenses with optimal imaging performance</title><p>GRIN lenses have intrinsic aberrationsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee and Yun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>), which limit the resolution and field of view (FOV) of microendoscopy under the conventional Gaussian modeÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>). To generate Gaussian and Bessel foci of the highest quality, GRIN lenses with minimal aberrations are required. However, a systematic evaluation of the imaging performance of commercially available GRIN lenses had not been undertaken. We therefore characterized GRIN lenses commonly used for in vivo brain imaging to identify GRIN lenses with optimal imaging performance for both Gaussian and Bessel modes.</p><p>To evaluate the imaging qualities of GRIN lenses, 2-Âµm-diameter fluorescent beads were fixed on a coverslip and immersed in water below each GRIN lens. With the distance between the microscope objective and the GRIN lens fixed, we moved the bead sample axially until the beads were in focus. The distance between the microscope objective focus and the GRIN lens top surface was defined as image working distance (WD), while the distance between the bottom surface of the GRIN lens and the bead sample was measured and defined as the sample WD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Such measurements informed on the axial focal shifts inside the brain while the brain and the implanted GRIN lens were moved together axially during in vivo imaging experiments. At each sample/image WD, we measured the axial full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 2 Âµm beads at the center of the FOV, and this measurement served as an indicator of spatial resolution. The optimal GRIN lens should have small axial FWHM, or equivalently, high resolution over a large FOV (with the edges of the FOV defined as where fluorescence signal from 2-Âµm-diameter beads dropped to 10% of the signal at the FOV center).</p><p>Of the ten GRIN lenses tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), three were found to have the best axial FWHM â FOV combinations (green rectangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): a 1-mm-diameter, 8.1-mm-long doublet GRIN lens with 370-Âµm-diameter FOV (â1 mm doubletâ, GRIN No. 4); a 0.5-mm-diameter, 9.9-mm-long doublet GRIN lens with 220-Âµm-diameter FOV (â0.5 mm doubletâ, GRIN No. 5); and a 1-mm-diameter, 4.4-mm-long singlet GRIN lens with 510-Âµm-diameter FOV (â1 mm singletâ, GRIN No. 6). For all three GRIN lenses, the axial FWHMs were below 15 Âµm over most of the sample/image WDs, substantially less than the other GRIN lenses tested (but still larger than the diffraction-limited value at 0.5 NA, 6.3 Âµm, indicating the existence of intrinsic aberrations). In addition to these best performing lenses, we chose an additional GRIN lens for further characterization, a 0.5-mm-diameter, 7.1-mm-long singlet GRIN lens with 310-Âµm-diameter FOV and an axial FWHM between 18 Âµm and 32 Âµm (â0.5 mm singletâ, red rectangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, GRIN No. 10). Even though it had larger aberrations, this GRIN lens had the lowest cost of all GRIN lenses tested and the largest FOV for 0.5-mm-diameter GRIN lenses.

This rapid decrease of bead signal from the center in the 0.5 mm singlet GRIN lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) was caused by its larger off-axis optical aberration, as demonstrated by the signal and the 3D image profiles of 2 Âµm beads located at the center (cyan squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>) or closer to the edge of the FOV (~85 Î¼m from center, magenta squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>) taken with Gaussian foci. At the center of the FOV (upper panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>), the aberration modes of both 1 mm doublet and 0.5 mm singlet were dominated by spherical aberrations. The circular symmetry of spherical aberrations made them minimally degrade the imaging quality of the Bessel focus formed by annular illumination. As a result, we found the measured lateral FWHMs of the Bessel foci (0.93â1.27 Âµm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to be similar to their diffraction-limited value (1.06 Âµm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Richards and Wolf, 1959</xref>), whereas the lateral resolution of the Gaussian foci (measured FWHMs: 1.02â1.47 Âµm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, diffraction-limited value: 0.78 Âµm) were substantially degraded by aberrations. Away from the FOV center, the 3D bead profile obtained through the 1 mm doublet maintained similar characteristics to the profile at FOV center, suggesting a similar domination of spherical aberrations (lower panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, the off-axis aberrations of the 0.5 mm singlet GRIN lens bore strong characteristics of astigmatism (lower panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), which deteriorated the quality of the Bessel focus more than the Gaussian focus. Therefore, the relative FOV change of Bessel versus Gaussian modes was correlated with the optical aberrations present in the GRIN lenses, with Bessel imaging mode performing better in GRIN lenses with higher imaging qualities.</p><p>By carefully characterizing the imaging performance of the four selected GRIN lenses, we found that Bessel focus scanning improves the lateral resolution at the FOV center while providing a comparable, if not larger, FOV compared to conventional Gaussian imaging. These four GRIN lenses have different diameters, lengths, resolutions, FOVs, are suitable for experiments with different goals, and can give us access to different structures throughout the mouse brain.

Such an approach, however, is only applicable to more superficial structures. For deeper structures, providing optical access for a conventional microscope objective requires too much tissue removal. For example, to image the lateral hypothalamus, which is 5 mm from the top surface of the mouse brain, passing the light cone of a 0.5-NA microscope objective requires 22 mm<sup>3</sup> of brain tissue to be removed, whereas an embedded 0.5-mm-diameter GRIN lens only displaces 1 mm<sup>3</sup> of brain tissue. Therefore, microendoscopy employing GRIN lenses is the preferred method for imaging deep nuclei of the brain. In both cases, care must be taken to ensure that inflammation has abated before imaging starts and that the physiology of the structures of interest is minimally affected by tissue removal or displacement.</p><p>Existing implementation of microendoscopy suffers from low resolution and/or low throughput.

A 10Ã/0.45NA microscope objective (CFI Plan Apo Lambda 10X, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was used in conjunction with 0.5-NA singlet GRIN lenses, whereas a 4Ã/0.2NA objective (CFI Plan Apo Lambda 4X, Nikon) was used with doublet GRIN lenses to match their NA on the image side. Microscope control and data acquisition were executed using custom-written LabVIEW software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Alignment of GRIN lenses</title><p>Obtaining optimal image quality from GRIN-lens-based microendoscopes requires the GRIN lens to share the same optical axis as the microscope objective and the excitation light. For the in vitro characterization, the GRIN lens was held with a custom-built clip mounted onto a tilt/tip adjustment platform mount (KM100B, Thorlabs, NJ, USA). The tilt/tip platform was further mounted onto a motorized 3D translational stage (3DMS, Sutter Instrument Company, CA, USA), which allowed us to adjust the tilt/tip and translational position of the GRIN lens. Looking through the eyepiece and the 10Ã/0.45NA objective, we adjusted the tilt/tip of the GRIN lens so that the entire top surface of the GRIN lens came into focus simultaneously, indicating that the optical axes of the GRIN lens and the objective were parallel. Failure to do this causes the excitation light to experience severe optical aberrations and degradation of image quality. To make the GRIN lens and the objective coaxial, we switched to Bessel mode with the excitation light forming an annular illumination pattern when entering the GRIN lens. We then adjusted the translational position of the GRIN lens until the annular illumination transmitted through the lens remained symmetrical when the GRIN lens was translated axially, indicating that the GRIN lens was coaxial with the microscope objective. We then recorded the position of the GRIN lens within the eyepiece field of view (FOV). For in vivo experiments, the mouse was mounted on a tilt/tip platform and was adjusted below the 10Ã/0.45NA objective until the top surface of the GRIN lens was in focus. We then translated the mouse until the GRIN lens occupied the same position as recorded during the in vitro alignment. For doublet GRIN lenses, tip/tiltÂ alignment was established using the 10Ã/0.45NA objective due to its smaller depth of field; this objective was then replaced by the 4Ã/0.2NA objective prior to adjustment of translational position and the imaging experiments to follow.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vitro characterization of GRIN lenses</title><p>The imaging resolution and FOV of 10 commercially available GRIN lenses (GRINTECH GMbH, Inscopix, Go!Foton) were characterized. Prior to the experiment, precise alignment of each GRIN lens was completed as described above. For doublet GRIN lenses with 0.19 NA on the image side and 0.5 NA on the sample side, data were collected with the image WD within a 2000 Âµm range. For singlet GRIN lenses, data were collected with the image WD within a 400 Âµm range. For all the GRIN lenses tested, the sample WD versus image WD followed a linear relationship with a fitted slope <italic>k</italic>. For in vivo experiments, the change of the sample WD (<italic>i.e.</italic>, focal shift in the brain), Î<italic>d</italic><sub>sample</sub>, was calculated as Î<italic>d</italic><sub>sample</sub>Â <italic>=Â kÂ Ã</italic>Â Î<italic>d</italic><sub>image</sub>, where Î<italic>d</italic><sub>image</sub> is the change of image WD (e.g., the axial shift of the brain and the GRIN lens) and <italic>k</italic> is the slope determined by fitting the image WD and sample WD relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stereotaxic surgery and brain slice preparation</title><p>GABAergic neurons were labeled by in vivo injection of AAV2/1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s (1:2 diluted by PBS from stock solution with the titer of 2.7Â ÃÂ 10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml made by viral services at Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute) into the primary visual cortex of the Gad2-ires-Cre mouse (JAX, stock#010802). Thirty nanoliters of viral solution was injected at the following coordinate: Bregma, â3.80 mm; midline:+2.50 mm; depth 0.5 mm. Four weeks later, mice were perfused by 4% paraformaldehyde and the brain was cut using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S) into 100 Âµm-thick brain slices. Brain slices with positively labeled neurons were mounted with mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratory) onto slides for long-term preservation of the fluorescent signal. The same slice preparation procedure was followed for Thy1-GFP-M mice (JAX stock #007788).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stereotaxic surgery for in vivo imaging</title><p>All surgeries were performed using a stereotaxic apparatus (Model 1900, David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA) and aseptic technique. A stereotaxic cannula holder (SCH_2.5, Doric Lenses Inc., QuÃ©bec, Canada) attached with a custom adapter (ODÂ =Â 15.8 mm; IDÂ =Â 7.9 mm, Doric Lenses Inc.) to a Model 1900â54-A tool block assembly (David Kopf Instruments) was used to insert a polyimide guide cannula into the brain.</p><p>Guide cannulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>) (Doric Lenses Inc) were custom designed for hippocampus surgeries. The cannula body was made of a thin-walled polyimide tube (0.25 Âµm wall thickness). The sample-side end was sealed with a 0.13-mm-thick cover glass. The open end of the tube was surrounded by a cap (2.5-mm-diameter body, 3.5-mm-diameter base) that allowed the cannula to be held during implantation and provided a large surface for secure attachment to the skull by dental cement. To fit the 1-mm-diameter GRIN lenses, the polyimide tubes had an inner diameter of 1.07 mm and an outer diameter of 1.12 mm. The length of the polyimide tube was selected such that, with the bottom of the cap contacting the skull, the glass bottom of the cannula was positioned above the deep nuclei of interest (lengths from the bottom of the cap to the glass bottom: 1.55 mm).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Hippocampus surgery</title><p>Thy1-GFP line M mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and the skull was exposed. After both medial-lateral and anterior-posterior alignment of mouse head at Bregma, the coordinate of implantation center on the right hemisphere (Bregma, â2.06 mm; midline:+2.71 mm) was marked. The animal was then tilted mid-laterally by 10 degrees toward the left hemisphere to slightly compensate for the oblique surface of the hippocampus. Then a 1.5-mm-diameter craniotomy was made. The dura was removed with forceps, and aspiration with a 27G blunt needle was used to slowly remove the cortex and clear a 1.2-mm-diameter pathway within the craniotomy. Each aspiration (50â100 Î¼m-thick tissue removed per aspiration) was followed by repeated irrigation with saline until bleeding stopped completely. These steps continued until the external capsule was exposed. The cortex and topmost layers of the external capsule were carefully aspirated with a 30G blunt needle. After bleeding stopped, a guide cannula was inserted and cemented to the skull using C&amp;B Metabond Cement System (Parkell, Inc., NY, USA). A titanium head-post was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and Metabond. The open end of the cannula was sealed with a small piece of Parafilm covered by Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments, LLC, FL, USA), and after the silicone cured, mice recovered from anesthesia. After one month of recovery from the surgery and habituation to head fixation, we inserted a 1-mm-diameter doublet GRIN lens into the cannula for in vivo imaging in anesthetized mice and removed the GRIN lens at the end of imaging. The cannula was resealed with Parafilm and Kwik-Sil to prevent debris from entering the guide tube.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Lateral hypothalamus surgery</title><p>Surgeries were performed as previously describedÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>), except 0.5-mm-diameter singlet GRIN lenses (Go!Foton Corporation) were directly implanted into the brains of Vgat-Cre mice (JAX stock #028862) without guide cannulae (Bregma, â1.4 mm; midline,+0.85 mm; dorsal surface: â5.0 mm; 50 nl AAV2/1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s virus)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

After post-surgical recovery and habituation to head fixation for at least four weeks, neuronal activity was monitored in awake mice at the end of the light cycle (9 a.m.) (<italic>i.e.</italic>, after a period of low food intake) and at the end of the dark cycle (11 p.m.) (<italic>i.e.</italic>, after a period of high food intake). Each mouse was imaged during two sessions daily (light cycle end and dark cycle end) with 10 hr between sessions to record neuronal activity when the mice were in native metabolic states similar to hunger and satiety (light cycle end and dark cycle end, respectively). These two sessions were repeated twice with at least 3 days between repetitions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry characterization of the implant site</title><p>After data acquisition, mice were anesthetized with an overdose of isoflurane and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were postfixed in the same fixative overnight and stored at 4ËC for later histological process. Brains were coronally sectioned (50 Âµm thickness) with a Leica VT1200S vibratome. Alternate brain sections were either immunostained with the astrocyte marker, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Sigma Aldrich), or stained with NeuroTrace 530/615 red fluorescent Nissl Stain (ThermoFisher). Consecutive brain sections encompassing the implant site were mounted on glass slides using VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and coverslipped for imaging with TissueFAXS 200 (TissueGnostics) at wide-field mode using a 20ÃÂ objective.</p><p>In the example brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), only the thin layer of tissue right next to the implant site exhibited enhanced staining for GFAP, in agreement with a previous studyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>). Nissl staining showed some tissue deformation in the hippocampal structures below the implant site.

As indicated by Figure 3 from Bocarsly et al., 2015, whereas inflammation surrounding the surgical site two weeks post implant was heightened, at four weeks post implant, the inflammation was largely gone. The neurons below the implantation site were found to have normal response pattern, suggesting that they maintained normal physiology.</p><p>Based on this prior work, all the in vivo imaging experiments in this manuscript were carried out 30-70 days post implantation of guide tube or GRIN lens. We have added in the Materials and methods section the time between surgery and imaging to highlight this fact.</p><p>Following the reviewerâs comment, we further carried out immunohistochemistry experiments on two brains with 1-mm-diameter GRIN lens implantation above hippocampus (Figure 9 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. These brains were fixed after imaging in 2017 and sectioned for immunohistochemistry in October 2018. (We did not carry out these experiments on the brains used for lateral hypothalamus imaging. Because these brains were already sectioned and coverslipped back in 2017, we are not confident that these sections maintain their antigenicity toward GFAP antibody. We expect that they would give rise to results similar to those in Figure 3 from Bocarsly et al., 2015, as the same brain area, lateral hypothalamus, was imaged.)</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40805.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemistry on brain sections surround the GRIN lens implantation site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B)</bold> Representative brain slices labeled with GFAP antibody and Nissl staining, respectively.

The Nissl staining showed tissue deformation in the hippocampal structures below the implant site. However, CA1 pyramidal neurons within the imaging FOV (indicated by the green bars in Figure 9) maintained laminar distribution. This is consistent with the in vivo imaging results in Figure 8 (same brain as in Figure 9), where the GFP+ dendrites and axons were found to have normal morphology and were devoid of signs of cell death (e.g., fragmented axons).</p><p>The immunohistochemistry results from the 2nd brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) are similar, despite some tearing during sectioning. The hippocampal structures below the implant site showed less deformation than the brain in Figure 3 from Bocarsly et al., 2015 (thus, the results are typical, rather than âtypical bestâ).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added a section in Materials and methods âImmunohistochemistry characterization of the implant siteâ and included discussions on tissue damage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
