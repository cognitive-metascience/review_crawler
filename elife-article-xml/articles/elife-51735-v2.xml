glia activation and mobilization of endogenous progenitors (OPC) which participate in myelin repair. Here we show that in response to demyelination, mature oligodendrocytes (OLG) bordering the lesion express Ndst1, a key enzyme for heparan sulfates (HS) synthesis. Ndst1+ OLG form a belt that demarcates lesioned from intact white matter. Mice with selective inactivation of Ndst1 in the OLG lineage display increased lesion size, sustained microglia and OPC reactivity. HS production around the lesion allows Sonic hedgehog (Shh) binding and favors the local enrichment of this morphogen involved in myelin regeneration. In MS patients, Ndst1 is also found overexpressed in oligodendroglia and the number of Ndst1-expressing oligodendroglia is inversely correlated with lesion size and positively correlated with remyelination potential. Our study suggests that mature OLG surrounding demyelinated lesions are not passive witnesses but contribute to protection and regeneration by producing HS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>Ndst1</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007586</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20140329501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>France-bioimaging/PICSL infrastructure ANR-10-INSB-04-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE16-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AM*DEX NeuroMarseille Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AMX-19-IET-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durbec</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heparan sulfate synthesis by mature oligodendrocytes creates a protective and permissive environment controling microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitors reactivation during remyelination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), OLG are the target of inflammatory and immune attacks and their death results in multiple focal demyelinated lesions in the CNS. Myelin loss remains in defined areas, rather than expanding to involve all of the white matter, and the mechanism by which demyelinated lesions stop expanding is not understood. Some of these lesions may stop expanding as inflammation is controlled and lesions are remyelinated. Remyelination involves OPC recruitment to the lesion, differentiation into myelin forming cells and remyelination of denuded axons, and the success of this depends on environmental context, including secreted factors from neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patrikios et al., 2006</xref>). This repair process, which occurs spontaneously in MS patients, is highly variable between patients and between lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patrikios et al., 2006</xref>). Regenerative failure is mainly attributed to defects in OPC recruitment towards the demyelinated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>) and/or to their incapacity to differentiate into myelinating OLG at the lesion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolswijk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franklin, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Multiple factors are involved in this regenerative process including those produced by reactive astrocytes or microglia and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron et al., 2013</xref>). These contribute to myelin destruction, but also to myelin debris removal and beneficial effects by secreting factors that directly or indirectly support remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Waly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emery, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courtès et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vernerey et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly oligodendrocyte lineage cells also produce factors that modulate remyelination, such as the morphogen shh which is produced by OLG and OPC at the onset of demyelination in lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC)-induced lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, blocking Shh activity induces an increase in lesion size and a block in OPC proliferation and differentiation, and conversely Shh overexpression leads to the attenuation of the lesion extent and promotes oligodendrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>). Identifying such actors involved in myelin damage and remyelination is needed for the design of future protective and regenerative therapies.</p><p>The presence of a multitude of signals regulating specific steps of remyelination raises the hypothesis that key factors may be necessary to integrate all these cues. One of these key factors may be HS proteoglycans (HSPG), as there is now compelling evidence that HSPGs play a critical role in regulating spatiotemporal coordination of signals in the extracellular microenvironment of many tissues during brain development and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>). HS chains consist of linear repeated disaccharide units of N-acetyl glucosamine and glucuronic acid which are synthesized on proteoglycan core proteins. Ndst enzymes perform the first step of these sugar modifications thus specifying the functional properties of HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindahl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perrimon and Bernfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlsson et al., 2008</xref>). Among the four known Ndst enzymes, Ndst1 appears as the key enzyme for addition of N-sulfated motifs to HS chains in brain during development, as shown by limited functional redundancy mediated by other Ndst enzymes (2-4) in <italic>Ndst1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grobe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallerla et al., 2007</xref>). During development, HS proteoglycans provide an important signaling scaffold allowing spatial concentration or trapping of numerous molecules such as morphogens and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuo and Kimura-Yoshida, 2014</xref>) and the control of receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuo and Kimura-Yoshida, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallagher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häcker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker and Kohler, 2010</xref>). Following CNS injury, HSPGs are known to play a pivotal role in post-lesional plasticity and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iseki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagino et al., 2003</xref>). Some HS proteoglycans are over-expressed by reactive astrocytes in injured mouse brain and provide positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iseki et al., 2002</xref>) or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagino et al., 2003</xref>) environmental support for axon regenerative responses. In vitro, HS proteoglycans can prevent OLG differentiation, maintaining OPC in an immature proliferative phenotype by acting as a FGF-2 co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McKinnon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal and Pfeiffer, 1997</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that HS proteoglycans play an organizing role in controlling myelin damage and repair.</p><p>Here we show that mature OLG bordering a demyelinated lesion limit lesion extension and influence OPC mobilization via HS production. Using a model of acute focal demyelination of the corpus callosum in mice, we show that <italic>Ndst1</italic> expression is induced in OLG around the lesion throughout the phases of demyelination and remyelination. <italic>Ndst1</italic> expression and subsequent HS accumulation mostly accumulate at the margin of the lesion, delimiting the lesion from the intact corpus callosum during demyelination. To evaluate the relevance of Ndst1 induction for lesion formation and repair, we exposed genetically modified mice with selective deletion of <italic>Ndst1</italic> in oligodendroglia to focal demyelination of the corpus callosum. Lack of Ndst1 in OLG resulted in an increased lesion size, and a sustained OPC and microglia/macrophage activation at the early stage of remyelination. HS enrichment correlates with and is necessary for the binding around the lesion site of the morphogen Shh, suggesting that Ndst1 expression and HS secretion by OLG enhances Shh signaling after demyelination, thus favoring remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zakaria et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, NDST1 expression in OLG was also increased in human postmortem tissues from multiple sclerosis patients. This increased density of NDST1+ OLG in lesions was inversely correlated with the size of the lesion and positively correlated with remyelination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demyelination triggers <italic>Ndst1</italic> up-regulation by OLG and creates a transient N-sulfated belt around the lesion</title><p>To identify candidates that could regulate interactions between progenitors and the injured environment, a microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression in purified oligodendroglia from adult healthy and demyelinated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayre et al., 2013</xref>). One of the most robustly and significantly up-regulated genes after demyelination was <italic>Ndst1</italic>, a key enzyme of HS proteoglycan synthesis (fold increase of 48.9 and 14.0 in two different trials; p≤0.001; microarray data are available at GEO with accession number GSE47486). This up-regulation of <italic>Ndst1</italic> was confirmed in vivo at 21 days in mice exposed to EAE by in situ hybridization combined with Olig2 labeling, a pan OLG marker. While <italic>Ndst1</italic> was not detected in the corpus callosum of control brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it was highly expressed by the Olig2+ population after EAE in the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) in close proximity to lesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the up-regulation of <italic>Ndst1</italic> after demyelination, we used LPC to trigger focal demyelination lesions in the mouse corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To do so, we used the anti-HS antibody 10E4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grobe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pan et al., 2014</xref>), which exclusively detects the N-sulfated motifs produced by Ndst1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallerla et al., 2007</xref>). While no staining was detected in the contralateral corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), N-sulfated HS positive puncta formed a belt around the demyelination lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), similar to the profile of Ndst1-induction. Furthermore, as with Ndst1 expression, no HS staining was detected within the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This staining is specific as it was absent after treatment with Heparinase, an enzyme that digests N-sulfated motifs on the HS chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We first probed the snRNAseq data provided by Jakel et al work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jäkel et al., 2019</xref>), and observed that few cells express Ndst1 in both control and MS tissues but when the oligodendrocytes that express Ndst1 are compared, there is a trend to increased expression in MS tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because such approach identifies around 15% only of nuclear RNA, we then directly examined the expression pattern of NDST1 protein in MS patient brain sections. Normal appearing white matter (WM), remyelinating, active, chronic active or chronic inactive lesions were analyzed. While NDST1 staining was very weak in control WM (without MS), we observed a significant increase of NDST1 labeling in MS patients WM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). Comparison of healthy control, MS normal appearing WM and MS lesions showed that there is a significant increase of NDST1 staining in multiple sclerosis lesions vs. control (p=0.0014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Comparison of each MS lesion with its surrounding normal appearing WM using a paired t test, revealed that there is significantly more NDST1 labeling in MS lesions compared to their surrounding normal appearing WM (paired two-tailed t test, t<sub>9</sub> = 3.39, p=0.0095).

The number of NDST1+ oligodendroglia in each lesion was inversely correlated with the lesion’s size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). As blocks of MS tissue contained multiple lesions and sometimes we had multiple blocks from the same patient (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we gave each patient an overall remyelination ability score corresponding to how many lesions in the blocks from that patient were remyelinated, or likely to remyelinate if the patient had survived. Here, we were aiming to see whether patients considered being ‘good remyelinators’ using this score express more NDST1. A lesion was given a score of 3 points (complete remyelination), two points (active - likely to remyelinate), one point (chronic active less likely to remyelinate) and 0 points (chronic inactive -unlikely to remyelinate). The total score of all the lesions per patient was then divided by the number of lesions per patient, to allow comparisons. We showed that NDST1+ cell density positively correlated with patient’s score of remyelination ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). These data reveal that MS tissues with a higher repair potential (containing most active and remyelinated lesions) display a high number of NDST1+ cells therefore suggesting that higher numbers of NDST1+ cells in a lesion may provide a positive environmental support for myelin repair.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Classification and

demyelination. Using LPC-induced demyelination of the corpus callosum in mouse, we showed for the first time that Ndst1-dependent N-sulfate sugar modifications occur at the onset of demyelination and during remyelination. These modifications limit the extension of demyelination and create a permissive substrate enhancing remyelination. First, we show that <italic>Ndst1</italic> is almost exclusively expressed by oligodendroglia present at the margin of the lesion delimiting the lesion from the intact corpus callosum. Second, we found that the conditional deletion of <italic>Ndst1</italic> in the Olig2 population concomitantly triggers an enlargement of the LPC-induced demyelinated area, alters OPC mobilization and favors the pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype in microglia. We propose that these effects could be mediated through HS dependent binding of the morphogen Shh which has been shown to be a positive regulator of myelin repair through increased oligodendrogenesis and microglial regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zakaria et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, using MS brain tissue samples, we show that NDST1 is up-regulated, especially within lesions and that the density of NDST1+ cells in these lesions is negatively correlated to lesion size, and positively correlated to the patient’s potential remyelination ability. Our data suggest that Ndst1/HS expressed by oligodendrocytes around the lesion create a protective and permissive environment playing a positive role in myelin repair.</p><p>HS and chondroitin sulfates are the two main classes of sulfated proteoglycans constituting the extracellular space. Chondroitin sulfates are strongly expressed by astrocytes and microglia providing a hostile environment impeding regeneration and remyelination following brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siebert and Osterhout, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pendleton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 2012</xref>). Enzymatic degradation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans using chondroïtinase ABC treatment in vivo promotes OPC mobilization and remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 2012</xref>). In vitro, chondroitin sulfates reduce OPC maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karus et al., 2016</xref>) and in vivo the use of a CSPG synthesis inhibitor promotes OPC maturation and accelerates remyelination following focal demyelination in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keough et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study has shown that Surfen, a proteoglycan binding agent, reduces inflammation and delays remyelination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warford et al., 2018</xref>). Our study provides evidence for a beneficial effect of HS proteoglycans (and upstream enzyme Ndst1) on limiting demyelinated lesion size and promoting remyelination. Here we propose that HS on mature OLG changes the amount/stability of soluble factors, and thus the recruitment and proliferation of surrounding cells (such as OPC or microglia). Thus, OLG modify their environment which in turn regulates the behavior of cells in the lesioned CC including microglia and OPC. Therefore, two classes of sulfated proteoglycans have opposite effects on myelin repair; one being detrimental (chondroitin sulfates), and the other (HS) having a beneficial effect. Interestingly, both are found at the margin of the lesion, but while the chondroitin sulfates are secreted by astrocytes and microglia, HS are expressed by oligodendroglia. Our data show that the majority of <italic>Ndst1+</italic> cells at the margin of the LPC-induced lesion are mature CC1+ OLG revealing that mature OLG around a demyelination lesion, respond to post lesional cues. Interesting, recent data have shown that pre-existing mature OLG can also participate to myelin regeneration in human and rodent by forming new myelin sheaths further indicating that mature OLG have an active role in myelin repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This OLG response to nearby demyelination appears propitious to regeneration by restricting the lesion spread, favoring OPC mobilization and modulating microglia response.</p><p>Macrophages/microglia participate to myelin repair through myelin debris clearance and the secretion of regenerative factors that altogether promote the recruitment of OPC, their proliferation and differentiation into mature myelin-forming cells. Activated microglia also produces various pro-inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines…) that may affect OPC since they express a battery of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peferoen et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have shown that efficient remyelination required the dynamic regulation of functional microglia phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lloyd et al., 2019</xref>). Microglia respond to demyelination with initial pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) followed later by pro-regenerative phenotype (M2) which actively contributes to myelin repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olah et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, this transition from pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative phenotype is a rate-limiting step in the repair process since intra-lesional depletion of pro-regenerative microglia blocks oligodendrocyte differentiation and delays the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, lack of Ndst1/HS from Olig2+ cells in transgenic mice leads to increased microglial proliferation, a strongly activated rhomboid polarization of CD68-expressing cells and an increased density of pro-inflammatory (M1) microglia at an early stage of the remyelination phase (eight dpi). Altogether these effects may contribute to enlargement of the demyelinated lesion and delayed myelin repair. This non-cell autonomous effect observed on microglia activation could in turn disturb OPC mobilization and thus modify the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The beneficial action of HS may be related to their ability to bind numerous growth factors and morphogens, as observed during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häcker et al., 2005</xref>). HS can act as co-receptors for these ligands or are involved in the stabilization and/or local concentration of ligands in the extracellular space, which modulates cell signaling. Ndst1 global knock out mice display developmental defects that mainly resemble those found in embryos deficient for Shh or FGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pallerla et al., 2008</xref>). FGF and Shh implication in myelin regeneration and glial reactivation have been extensively examined in mouse models of demyelination (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Waly et al., 2014</xref>). A role of both factors in remyelination was first inferred by correlating their spatial and temporal upregulation after demyelination particularly in LPC-induced demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gudi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinks and Franklin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tourbah et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Concerning FGF, conflicting results have been published on its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruffini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehghan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). A recent report has addressed this issue using the simultaneous ablation of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 specifically in cells from the oligodendrocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furusho et al., 2015</xref>). This study revealed that FGF signaling is not required for myelin regeneration in acute models of demyelination including LPC-induced demyelination of the spinal cord and cuprizone intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furusho et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, in all these analyses the phenotypes observed after LPC-induced demyelination never recapitulate (even partially) the phenotype observed in the present report using <italic>Olig2-Cre; Ndst1 <sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice. This suggests that FGF is probably not the main ligand regulated by HS activity during myelin repair in this model.</p><p>By contrast, blocking Shh activity leads to an increase in demyelinated lesion size and an altered OPC mobilization after LPC-induced demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>) similar to what we observe in <italic>Olig2-Cre; Ndst1 <sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice. However, these effects persist at later time points at the end of remyelination, and OPC maturation is also inhibited after Shh inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, recent in vitro findings show that the proteolytic processing of Shh required for signaling pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohlig et al., 2012</xref>) is finely regulated by HS chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortmann et al., 2015</xref>), perhaps influencing Shh concentration and/or spreading. Here we show that Shh binds to HS around demyelinated lesions in mouse. Thus, we propose that HS removal may delay the local accumulation around the demyelinated lesion of Shh produced by OLG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref>) and/or delay Shh activation and spreading, leading to a reduction in signaling as suggested by reduced Ptch1 expression at early time-points. Later, the sustained production of Shh may overtake the absence of HS, leading to efficient recovery. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferent et al., 2013</xref> have shown that the main Shh responding cells (cells expressing Gli1 and/or Smo) after LPC-induced demyelination of the corpus callosum are OLG and microglia. These observations further support the idea that sustained microglia and OPC activation in the absence of HS are at least in part due to altered Shh signaling.</p><p>Finally, we can confirm that NDST1 is also over-expressed in human MS brain samples, mostly in Olig2-positive oligodendroglia. High levels of HS proteoglycans and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been previously associated with inflammatory CNS diseases such as MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berezin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Horssen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Satoh et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we show that NDST1 is upregulated within and surrounding MS lesions in post mortem tissue compared to control. NDST1 expression is significantly higher in MS lesions compared to surrounding normal appearing white matter (NAWM), irrespective of lesion type (remyelinated, active, chronic active or chronic inactive). The distribution of the NDST+ cells was different from the mouse model, in that we saw no surrounding band of positive cells, but instead the entire lesions contained positive cells, though the majority of these cells were OLIG2+ oligodendroglia. This difference may be related to the timing of examination of the tissue after the lesion onset, which is later in the human tissue, and secondary to poorer repair in humans. In MS lesions, a large proportion of these OLIG2+ cells express NDST1, suggesting that at least some of these are mature, but we were unable to distinguish mature and immature oligodendroglia in this tissue (due to limitations in double-labelling using effective antibodies in human tissues). However, these observations still concur with our mouse data indicating that oligodendroglia respond to neighboring demyelination. Also consistent with our results showing increased lesion size in <italic>Olig2-Cre+/-; Ndst1 <sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice, in human samples we observed an inverse correlation between lesion size and density of NDST1-expressing Olig2+ cells. NDST1 cell density also positively correlates with a pathological score of potential remyelination ability in patients.</p><p>Overall, our results in mouse and human tissues suggest that NDST1/HS levels are an indicator of oligodendroglial reactivity after demyelination, and are involved in both limiting the size of the lesion and creating a permissive environment for myelin regeneration. Furthermore, this study shows for the first time that mature oligodendrocytes around lesion are active players during demyelination/remyelination by producing HS and thus modifying the local environment. This study will help improve understanding the neuropathology of MS in both limitation of damage and promotion of remyelination, which may in the future help target pharmacological approaches to potentiate myelin repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

protocols were performed following the guidelines established by the French Ministry of Agriculture (Animal Rights Division). The architecture and functioning rules of our animal house, as well as our experimental procedures have been approved by the ‘‘Direction Départementale des Services Vétérinaires’’ and the ethic committee (ID numbers F1305521 and 2016071112151400 for animal house and research project, respectively). Surgery and perfusions were performed under ketamine (100 mg/kg, MERIAL, Lyon, France))/xylazine (10 mg/kg, BAYER, Puteaux, France) anesthesia. C57BL/6 wild-type and transgenic mice were successively used to characterize post-lesional expression of <italic>Ndst1</italic> and HS after demyelination and to investigate the impact of conditional deletion of <italic>Ndst1</italic> in the Olig2-positive cell population. Heterozygous <italic>Olig2-Cre+/-</italic> (from B6D2F1J/Rj genetic background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>) and double transgenic <italic>Olig2-Cre+/-; Ndst1 <sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grobe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>) will be referred below as control and mutant mice, respectively. Mice expressing GFP under the control of the proteolipid protein (plp, a protein largely present in myelin) promoter were used in some experiments to better observe demyelination lesions (called thereafter <italic>plpGFP</italic> mice). Animals were housed under standard conditions with enrichment and access to water and food ad libitum on a normal 12 hr light/dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Human postmortem samples</title><p>Postmortem unfixed frozen tissues were obtained from the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank via a UK prospective donor scheme with full ethical approval (MREC/02/2/39). Luxol fast blue (LFB) (staining myelin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and Oil Red O (staining lipids phagocytosed by macrophages) were performed to characterize and classify the lesion types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>). Active lesions have indistinct borders on LFB and lipid-laden macrophages/microglia. Chronic active lesions have a ring of lipid-laden macrophages/microglia and a core with few immune cells. Chronic inactive lesions have a distinct border on LFB and few immune cells. Finally, shadow plaques, thought to represent remyelination, have less intense staining on LFB. This classification was done by two independent researchers for a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we used active (n = 7), chronic active (n = 4), chronic inactive (n = 14) and remyelinated (shadow) MS plaques (n = 21) from 14 blocks of brain tissue from 9 MS patients and 4 blocks of brain tissue from four controls with no neurological disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Focal demyelination in the corpus callosum and tissue processing</title><p>Focal demyelination was performed by stereotactic injection of Lysolecithin (LPC) (SIGMA-ALDRICH, St Louis, USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magalon et al., 2007</xref>). The corpus callosum from healthy or demyelinated mice, from the ipsilateral and contralateral side to the LPC-induced lesion, were dissected 7 days post injection (dpi) from 1 mm thick coronal slices in cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (GIBCO by life technologie, Paisley, UK) and processed for RT-qPCR analysis (<italic>Ndst1 primers : exon 6</italic> (forward, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">gctggacaagatcatcaatgg</named-content>-3′) and exon 7 (reverse, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">acacagtacttctacgactatcc</named-content>-3′); for <italic>Gapdh</italic>: exon1 (forward, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">gggttcctataaatacggactgc</named-content>-3’) and exon2 (reverse 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ctggcactgcacaagaagat</named-content>-3’). Primers from EUROFINS GENOMICS, Ebersberg, GERMANY). For histological analysis, mice were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (FISHER SCIENTIFIC, Loughborough Leics, UK) in PBS (GIBCO by life technologie, Paisley, UK). Brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and cut on a vibratome (Leica) in 4 series of coronal sections (50 µm thick) for immunofluorescence, or cryopreserved and cut with cryostat (20 µm thick) for in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed using <italic>plp/dm20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peyron et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>Ndst1</italic> probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grobe, 2005</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Virard et al., 2006</xref>. RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent kit (323133; Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was used to detect Ptch1 mouse mRNA. Briefly cryosections were baked for 30 min at 60°C and dehydrated, incubated for 30 min at 40°C with protease III before incubation with RNAScope probe Ptch1 (402811-C2) for 2 hr at 40°C. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayre et al., 2013</xref>. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Olig2 (AB9610; 1/1000, Millipore, USA), mouse anti-APC (CC1) (1/400; Calbiochem, USA), and rat anti-PDGFRα (CBL1366; 1/250; Millipore, USA) for oligodendroglial lineage cells; anti-MBP (mouse, 1/500, Chemicon, Millipore S.A.) for myelin sheaths; mouse anti-Ki67 (556003; 1/500; BD Pharmingen) for proliferating cells; rabbit anti-caspase 3 (9661; 1/200; Cell Signaling) for apoptotic cells, rabbit anti-GFAP (1/400) for astrocytes; goat anti-Iba1 (1/500, Abcam) for microglia and macrophages; rat anti-CD68 (1/400, Abcam) for activated microglia and macrophages; rabbit anti-Cox2 (1/400, Abcam) for proinflammatory M1 microglia/macrophage; mouse IgM anti-N-sulfated motifs on HS chains (10E4 antibody, 1/500; Seikagaku, Japan). For Olig2 and Ki67 immunofluorescence, antigen unmasking was performed by 20 min incubation in boiling citrate buffer (10mM pH6). For N-sulfated motifs labeling, floating sections from PFA perfused-brain were incubated for 2 hr 30 at 37°C in buffer (100 mM Sodium Chloride, 1 mM Calcium Chloride, 50 mM Hepes 5 µg, BSA pH 7) with or without Heparinase (3.3 mU from Flavobacterium heparinum, Seikagaku Kogyo Co. # 100700, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 1992</xref>) before permeabilization. Secondary antibodies coupled to alexa 488, 555 and 647 (1/500, Invitrogen Molecular Probes) were applied for 2 hr 30 at RT in a humid chamber. Sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1/500, Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>AP-Shh recombinant protein binding test in mice</title><p>Plasmids containing sequences for AP-tagged N-terminal WT or deleted Shh were produced by PCR and ligated into pWIZ vector as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grobe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubin et al., 2002</xref>. Briefly, plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection proceeded for 3 hr. Culture supernatants were collected after 60 hr and filtered through 0.45 µm filters (Corning Incorporated, Durham, USA). Hepes 10mM pH7 was added to increase stability. Shh concentration was then evaluated measuring AP activity in culture supernatants. Preparations from mock-transfected HEK cells were generated and used as vehicle controls. The AP-Shh binding test was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubin et al., 2002</xref>.</p><p>Fresh frozen brain sections were post-fixed with ice-cooled methanol for 8 min. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mM MgCl2 and blocking with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (SIGMA-ALDRICH, St Louis, MO, USA) 1 hr at RT, frozen adjacent sections from healthy or demyelinated C57BL/6 mice were incubated with 5 nM of two AP tagged versions of Shh: AP-Shh recombinant proteins carrying the N-terminal CW sequence (AP-SHH), the main HS-binding site for Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasco et al., 2005</xref>), or lacking this motif (AP-SHH-CWdeleted). Sections were then washed with PBS to dissociate any low affinity interaction and endogenous phosphatases were inactivated by heating at 65°C for 2 hr. AP was revealed by incubating overnight in NBT (100 mg/ml)/BCIP (50 mg/ml) in 100 mM Tris pH 9,5 with 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry on human post-mortem tissue</title><p>Tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Endogenous peroxidase and AP activity was blocked by 10 min incubation with Vector Bloxall (Vector, SP-6000 VECTOR LABORATORIES, Burlingame, USA). Slides were blocked with ready-to-use 2.5% normal horse serum from Vector secondary antibody kits for at least 20 min. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight in antibody diluent (Spring Bioscience, ADS-125) at 4°C. Primary antibodies used: mouse anti-NDST1 (1/50; Abcam, ab55296), rabbit anti-NeuN (1/500; Abcam, ab104225), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1/500; Wako chemicals, 019–19741), rabbit anti-Olig2 (1/100; Sigma, HPA003254). HS staining with the mouse IgM anti-N-sulfated motifs on HS chains (10E4 antibody, Seikagaku, Japan) did not give any signal on human tissue. NDST1 intensity was evaluated after a short exposition (exactly 2 min). All other stainings were fully developed. To ensure antibody specificity, the NDST1 antibody was pre-absorbed with human NDST1 recombinant protein (Abcam, ab116875), and added to tissue sections, with no staining seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>Secondary antibodies were incubated at RT for 1 hr. Staining was developed with a DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (with Nickel), 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Vector, SK-4100) and a VECTOR Blue AP Substrate Kit (Vector, SK-5300) as per manufacturer’s guidelines. Secondary antibodies used: ImmPRESS-AP Anti-Rabbit IgG Polymer Detection Kit (Vector, MP-5401) and ImmPRESS HRP Anti-Mouse IgG Polymer Detection Kit, made in Horse (Vector, MP-7402). PBS washes were performed between each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopy and quantification</title><p>For mouse tissue analysis, imaging was performed with the Apotome system (Zeiss). The demyelinated area and cell counts were evaluated using Zen software (Zeiss). Immunofluorescent or in situ hybridization positive cells were counted in every fourth section through the whole demyelinated lesion per mouse and averaged for each mouse. Cell counts are presented as the mean of at least three mice. For RNAscope ISH, each punctate dot signal was counted around lesion (by using ROI and analyze particule Fiji Plugins) and reported to total nuclei number. For Heparan sulfate labeling quantification, 10E4-mmunopositive area was analyses on five sections per mouse. A constant exposure time was applied to all sections and for image acquisition, and the area occupied by 10E4+ labeling was quantified using ImageJ software. Lesion size was quantified by measuring the area of high density of nuclei in every fourth section through the whole demyelinated lesion per mouse. In this analysis, high density of nuclei was correlated with myelin loss visualized by MBP staining or by loss of fluorescence in <italic>plpGFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For the human post-mortem tissue analysis, slides were imaged using a ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. One researcher marked out the lesion sites and normal appearing white matter (WM) as areas of interest, while another counted single positive (NDST1+ cells) and double positive cells (NDST+ cells and other brain cell markers combined as above) in these areas of interest (ensuring blinding of counting).</p><p>Myelin content was evaluated by double blind scoring of images taken from Plp immunostaining on brain sections (three photos per section and three sections per brain). Score of 4 was attributed to maximum myelination down to 0 for absence of myelin. The mean score for the control group was considered as 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene expression profile of demyelinated versus healthy mouse progenitors</title><p>This protocol is fully described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayre et al., 2013</xref>. Briefly, OPC from eight mice induced for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE mice) at the peak of paralytic symptoms and from eight adult healthy mice as controls were purified using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec). This experiment was replicated in an independent similar experiment. cDNAs were prepared and used (250 ng) as template for Cy3 and Cy5, combined and hybridized to Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays 4 Å~44K. Agilent Feature Extraction Software (FES) determines feature intensities and ratios (including background subtraction and normalization), rejects outliers and calculates statistical confidences (P-values). We obtained a gene list with all normalized Cy5/Cy3 log10 ratios, Cy5/Cy3 fold changes, sequence description and P-values. Microarray data are available at GEO with accession number GSE47486.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the presented values in mice are means ± S.E.M unless otherwise stated. Data were statistically processed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (independent two group comparisons). p&lt;0.05 was considered significant and p&lt;0.01 highly significant. All measurements and subsequent evaluations were performed blind to the experimental group to which the animals belonged. For the human post-mortem tissue analysis, a d'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was used to test whether the data fit a normal distribution and a parametric test were done only if all compared data sets passed the normality test. The NDST1+ cells in control versus multiple sclerosis WM was compared using a two-tailed Mann Whitney U test. Multiple sclerosis lesions and their surrounding WM were compared using a paired two-tailed t test. The absolute numbers of NDST1+ cells and double positive NDST1+ OLIG2+ cells in individual lesions/normal appearing WM were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test. As MS tissue blocks contained more than one lesion, and we had several blocks from the same patients, we gave each patient an overall remyelination ability score corresponding to how many lesions in the blocks from that patient were remyelinated, or likely to remyelinate if the patient had survived. Remyelinated lesions received an arbitrary three points, active lesions two points, chronic active lesions one point and chronic inactive lesions 0 points. This was divided by the number of lesions counted for each patient, to allow comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to E Traiffort, F Helmbacher and C Bertet for critical reading of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Human subjects: Human postmortem unfixed frozen tissues were obtained from the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank via a UK prospective donor scheme with full ethical approval (MREC/02/2/39).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2"><p>Animal experimentation: All experimental and surgical protocols were performed following the guidelines established by the French Ministry of Agriculture (Animal Rights Division).

explored the role of mature oligodendrocytes in regions surrounding demyelinating lesions in the production of heparin sulfates. These results have implications not only for limiting demyelination, but also in remyelination in MS and other demyelinating disorders.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mature oligodendrocytes bordering lesions limit demyelination and favor myelin repair via heparan sulphate production&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James Fawcett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least not in its present scope. As you will see from the individual reports there was certainly interest in your findings of an oligodendroglial response to a demyelinating lesion. However, the reviewers felt that at present the experiments aimed at mechanistic insight resulted mostly in correlative data. Perhaps, using genetic mouse models would be a strategy to reach stronger conclusions on causation. These would be time-consuming additional experiments and we do not invite a revised manuscript at this point. Any new submission would be independently assessed, possibly with new reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper is interesting because it provides to my knowledge the first report of a molecular response of intact oligodendrocytes close to a demyelinating lesion, the induction of an enzyme (Ndst1) that increases the expression of heparan sulfate and thus HS-modifed proteins. Based on the phenotype of OPC/OL-specific Ndst1 cKO mice the authors suggest that this oligodendroglial response limits the extent of demyelination and promotes remyelination, possibly by locally increasing sonic hedgehog signaling. The authors also show a similar upregulation of NDST1 within (not around) human MS lesions, where the expression level inversely correlates with lesion size.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Since primary development and myelination are not perturbed in the brains of Ndst1 cKO mice, another possible explanation of the data is that enhanced activation of microglia (or their altered phenotype) affects remyelination in a non-cell autonomous way.</p><p>2) Thus, the Shh data are plausible but only correlations, and one should not leave the impression that reduced Shh binding was shown to cause the delay of remyelination.</p><p>3) It is unclear how &quot;remyelination&quot; in the human MS autopsy samples was assessed (pale blue staining could also be incomplete demyelination). In fact, this may explain the different pattern of Ndst1 expression in mouse and human demyelinating lesions.</p><p>4) Figure 3. It is unclear what the anti-PLP staining is actually labeling outside the lesion area (in Figure 3B), as PLP is still a myelin marker</p><p>5) Figure 1C-H: In-situ hybrization of Ndst1 mRNA in demyelinaing lesions: these observations are critical. but lack quantification (required standard). The alignment of the &quot;lesion&quot; with the &quot;belt&quot; is not obvious when using only dashed lines. Why is Ndst1 expression not shown also as an overview type image (similar to Figure 1—figure supplement 2)? Same is true for Figure 2, which also lacks quantitation. While the &quot;estimated&quot; level of upregulation is stronger than in Ndst1 in Figure 1B, the IHC images are (at present) only case reports.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper examines the role of heparan sulphate in remyelination by examining the expression of a key enzyme NDST1 and the consequences of an NDST1 conditional knockout in a mouse model of remyelination. In addition, the authors examine tissue from patients with MS. They conclude that HS containing proteoglycans are involved in remyelination as the enzyme is expressed around demyelinating lesions and its loss delays remyelination as evidenced by an increase in lesion size. Moreover there is a correlation between the degree of expression and the degree of remyelination in MS tissue.</p><p>While I think that the role of proteoglycans in remyelination is interesting, this paper is predominantly descriptive and correlative and doesn't provide sufficient mechanistic detail. The evidence for SHH binding in the region of putative HS expression is noteworthy but it is purely correlative. Equally the increase in microglial proliferation is interesting but not explored further.</p><p>My view would be that experiments are required to define one or more mechanisms by which HS is involved in remyelination, with gain and/or loss of function experiments clearly proving that the proposed mechanism is both linked to HS expression and regulates oligodendrocyte behaviour during remyelination in vivo.</p><p>Additionally I think there are three other areas that require attention.</p><p>First, the authors argue that the distribution around the experimental lesions is significant and that they have uncovered a novel function for surviving oligodendrocytes around lesions. It's notable however that they do not see this distribution in the MS tissue and I wonder whether their results simply reflect the lack of any surviving oligodendrocytes following LPC injection. In other words the distribution they see is simply a consequence of the model rather than having any great biological significance</p><p>Second, the characterization of the OPC response in the presence or absence of HS is very poor and studies of proliferation and differentiation, including the quantification of newly formed oligodendrocytes, is required</p><p>Third, a better characterization of the microglial phenotype (e.g. M1/M2 or similar) is required if the significance of this response is to be understood</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a thorough and interesting account of the role of HSPGs in remyelination. Many mechanisms of remyelination are known, but the idea that a particular sulfation change in HSPGs could be important is new. There is also data from human MS pathology in the paper, which gives clinical relevance.</p><p>1) The paper focuses on NDST which gives a particular form of sulfation to HS. There needs to be some information about the sulfation motif that is produced and any known information on relevant molecules that might bind to this form of HS. Shh is binding is shown, but it is unlikely to be the only effector of the local HS change.</p><p>2) If there is an increase in NDST, do the authors have information about any HS core proteins that might also be upregulated?</p><p>3) Why would a sulfation change in mature oligos increase myelination?

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper is interesting because it provides to my knowledge the first report of a molecular response of intact oligodendrocytes close to a demyelinating lesion, the induction of an enzyme (Ndst1) that increases the expression of heparan sulfate and thus HS-modifed proteins. Based on the phenotype of OPC/OL-specific Ndst1 cKO mice the authors suggest that this oligodendroglial response limits the extent of demyelination and promotes remyelination, possibly by locally increasing sonic hedgehog signaling. The authors also show a similar upregulation of NDST1 within (not around) human MS lesions, where the expression level inversely correlates with lesion size.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Since primary development and myelination are not perturbed in the brains of Ndst1 cKO mice, another possible explanation of the data is that enhanced activation of microglia (or their altered phenotype) affects remyelination in a non-cell autonomous way.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this interpretation of our results. As requested by reviewers, we have further clarified this point and better described microglia activation. We have performed new experiments to further characterize the proliferation and activation states of the macrophage/microglia participating in demyelination-remyelination in the acute demyelination model (See new version of Figure 5). We have shown:</p><p>1) An increase in proliferation of CD68+ cells in mutant compared to control mice at 8 dpi (Figure 5A-C).</p><p>2) A switch of the microglia/macrophage polarization among the whole Iba1 and CD68 population in favor of the rhomboid phenotype in mutant mice compared to control at 8 dpi (Figure 5H).</p><p>3) A significant increase in Cox2 expression (a marker of pro-inflammatory (M1) microglia/macrophage) in mutant mice compared to control, indicating a delay in the pro-inflammatory (M1) to pro-regenerative (M2) switch in the absence of Ndst1 in oligodendroglia.</p><p>These results demonstrate that <italic>Ndst1</italic> deletion in the Olig2 population is sufficient to enhance microglia/macrophage proliferation and activation at the lesion site at the onset of remyelination. The implication of Microglia (in a non cell autonomous effect) is presented in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Thus, the Shh data are plausible but only correlations, and one should not leave the impression that reduced Shh binding was shown to cause the delay of remyelination.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous reports from our lab and others have shown that Shh is a strong candidate for myelin repair acting both on oligodendrogenesis and regulation of microglia activation (Ferent et al., 2013; Zakaria et al., 2019). Indeed, Shh is produced by OLG and OPC at the onset of demyelination in lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC)-induced lesions. In this context, blocking Shh activity induces an increase in lesion size and a block in OPC proliferation and differentiation, and conversely Shh overexpression leads to the attenuation of the lesion extent and promotes oligodendrogenesis. Microglia express Shh receptors (Ferent et al., 2013) and Shh treatment reduces the number of activated microglia in LPC model. Thus, Shh production by OLG lineage cells could act both directly on OPC (cell autonomous) and on microglia activation (non cell autonomous). Since Shh is bound and enriched at the border of the lesion in a HS dependent manner, it is likely that this morphogen contributes to the role of Ndst1/HS in the regeneration process.</p><p>We made the mistake of not presenting these results (Ferent et al….) in the Introduction of the paper but only in the Discussion. To better underline these key findings concerning Shh for the understanding of our work, we described these results and references in the Introduction of new version of the manuscript.</p><p>A second possible candidate could be FGF since HS can also modulate its signaling and since Ndst1 global knock out mice display developmental defects that mainly resemble those found in embryos deficient for Shh or FGFs. Concerning FGF recent work using the simultaneous ablation of both <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>FGFR2</italic> specifically in OLG revealed that FGF signaling is not required for myelin regeneration. Overall, in all the analyses modulating FGF signaling in acute model of demyelination the phenotypes observed never recapitulate the phenotype observed in the present report using Olig2-Cre; Ndst1 <sup>Flox/Flox</sup> mice. This suggests that FGF is probably not the main ligand regulated by HS activity during myelin repair in this model. These data from the literature were absent from the first version of the manuscript and are now added in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear how &quot;remyelination&quot; in the human MS autopsy samples was assessed (pale blue staining could also be incomplete demyelination). In fact, this may explain the different pattern of Ndst1 expression in mouse and human demyelinating lesions.</p></disp-quote><p>“Shadow” plaques where there are patches of pale blue staining on luxol fast blue, suggesting thinner myelin sheaths, have long been suggested to be remyelinated lesions. This assumption is based on their similarity to remyelinated lesions seen in animal models. These lesions are not surrounded by many myeloid cells, and these do not contain myelin debris, again suggesting that these are at least not recently demyelinated. Thus, we believe these are repaired lesions but will call these lesions shadow plaques, to cover all possibilities including remyelination or partial demyelination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3. It is unclear what the anti-PLP staining is actually labeling outside the lesion area (in Figure 3B), as PLP is still a myelin marker</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding. In Figure 3 for plp labeling a double in situ hybridization staining was performed. We make it clearer in the text by writing “We found that <italic>Ndst1</italic> expressing cells are immuno-positive for Olig2 (Figure 3A) and <italic>Plp</italic>+ using double in situ hybridization (Figure 3B)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1 C-H: In-situ hybrization of Ndst1 mRNA in demyelinaing lesions: these observations are critical. but lack quantification (required standard). The alignment of the &quot;lesion&quot; with the &quot;belt&quot; is not obvious when using only dashed lines. Why is Ndst1 expression not shown also as an overview type image (similar to Figure 1—figure supplement 2)? Same is true for Figure 2, which also lacks quantitation. While the &quot;estimated&quot; level of upregulation is stronger than in Ndst1 in Figure 1B, the IHC images are (at present) only case reports.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning quantitative analysis. At this stage of the work (Figure 1 and 2) we describe the expression pattern of ndst1 and HS in the lesioned brain. Both are virtually absent in the healthy corpus callosum as well as in the contralateral part after lesion using ISH and IF. We thus decided to perform quantitative analysis using RT-qPCR, to compare ndst1 expression in the corpus callosum of healthy or demyelinated mice using 5 mice in each condition. These quantitative data are presented in Figure 1. In a second step, we characterized the phenotype of cells expressing ndst1 and performed quantitative analysis showing that 100% of ndst1 positive cells are Olig2 positive.</p><p>As mentioned in the manuscript Ndst1 expression is monitored by in situ hybridization. This technic is not compatible with good quality myelin immunostaining. Thus, in order to delimit precisely lesions in the LPC model, we use Hoechst staining since the lesion is also characterized by an increase in cell density due to glia and microglia proliferation. In order to validate this approach we have performed injection of LPC in a reporter mouse (plp-GFP) and show that the limit of the lesion visualized by loss of GFP fluorescence strictly corresponds with the area exhibiting strong increase in cell density. These data are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Thus the alignment of the lesion was based on cell density after in situ hybridization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper examines the role of heparan sulphate in remyelination by examining the expression of a key enzyme NDST1 and the consequences of an NDST1 conditional knockout in a mouse model of remyelination. In addition, the authors examine tissue from patients with MS. They conclude that HS containing proteoglycans are involved in remyelination as the enzyme is expressed around demyelinating lesions and its loss delays remyelination as evidenced by an increase in lesion size. Moreover there is a correlation between the degree of expression and the degree of remyelination in MS tissue.</p><p>While I think that the role of proteoglycans in remyelination is interesting, this paper is predominantly descriptive and correlative and doesn't provide sufficient mechanistic detail. The evidence for SHH binding in the region of putative HS expression is noteworthy but it is purely correlative. Equally the increase in microglial proliferation is interesting but not explored further.</p><p>My view would be that experiments are required to define one or more mechanisms by which HS is involved in remyelination, with gain and/or loss of function experiments clearly proving that the proposed mechanism is both linked to HS expression and regulates oligodendrocyte behaviour during remyelination in vivo.</p><p>Additionally I think there are three other areas that require attention.</p><p>First, the authors argue that the distribution around the experimental lesions is significant and that they have uncovered a novel function for surviving oligodendrocytes around lesions. It's notable however that they do not see this distribution in the MS tissue and I wonder whether their results simply reflect the lack of any surviving oligodendrocytes following LPC injection. In other words the distribution they see is simply a consequence of the model rather than having any great biological significance</p></disp-quote><p>First, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we have observed the same pattern of Ndst1 expression in the EAE model were <italic>Ndst1</italic> is up-regulated by the Olig2+ cell population in close proximity to inflammation sites in corpus callosum. Since we have observed this expression in both mouse models (LPC and EAE), it is probably relevant.</p><p>Concerning the distribution of Ndst1 expression in the LPC model: Even though OLG are massively killed within the lesion, remaining OLG in close proximity to the lesion do express ndst1 while OLG remote from the lesion in the CC do not. This shape “as a belt” is may be linked to the model but the presence of reactive mature OLG ndst1+ at the lesion site observed in all models including human is biologically relevant.</p><p>This point has been discussed in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the characterization of the OPC response in the presence or absence of HS is very poor and studies of proliferation and differentiation, including the quantification of newly formed oligodendrocytes, is required</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments presented now in Figure 4 in the new version of the manuscript. We performed a quantification of proliferating of OPC (Ki67+/olig2+ cells) in lesion sites at 4 and 8 dpi. We show that the dynamic of OPC proliferation is altered in mutant mice. Overall, Our data show that <italic>Ndst1</italic> expression in the Olig2+ population has no effect on initial demyelination (equivalent lesion size at 4 dpi) but protects the lesion from enlarging and participates in the control of OPC mobilization. We have included these data in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, a better characterization of the microglial phenotype (e.g. M1/M2 or similar) is required if the significance of this response is to be understood</p></disp-quote><p>See response to reviewer 1. We have performed new data showing that <italic>Ndst1</italic> deletion in the Olig2 population is sufficient to enhance microglia/macrophage proliferation and activation at the lesion site at the onset of remyelination. We demonstrate accentuated M1 phenotype in mutant mice compared to wild-type mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a thorough and interesting account of the role of HSPGs in remyelination. Many mechanisms of remyelination are known, but the idea that a particular sulfation change in HSPGs could be important is new. There is also data from human MS pathology in the paper, which gives clinical relevance.</p><p>1) The paper focuses on NDST which gives a particular form of sulfation to HS. There needs to be some information about the sulfation motif that is produced and any known information on relevant molecules that might bind to this form of HS. Shh is binding is shown, but it is unlikely to be the only effector of the local HS change.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included in the new version of the manuscript a full discussion concerning which factors could bind to HS in this context.</p><p>Concerning Shh binding, we have used an AP tagged version of Shh (AP-SHH) to directly assay its binding capacity in demyelinating context. We believe that an important piece of information is the data presented using the AP-SHH recombinant proteins deleted for the CW sequence (AP-SHH-CW deleted) since CW sequence serves as a major HS-binding site for Shh (Carrasco et al., 2005; Rubin et al., 2002). This sequence is necessary for Shh binding to HS.</p><p>Concerning other factors and in particular FGF signalling, please see response 2 to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If there is an increase in NDST, do the authors have information about any HS core proteins that might also be upregulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have preliminary data concerning this issue. We compared by qRT-PCR the expression level of transcripts of the main proteoglycan HS transcripts in mouse CC seven days after injection of the LPC and showed that only glypicans 4 and 5 are over-expressed after injury. Nevertheless, we would rather not include these data in the work since there are several carriers, Glypicans, Syndecans and perlecans, and since their activity is also depending on the fact that some are membrane bound others are soluble. Here focusing on Ndst1 we work on HS “as a whole” and would rather keep this level of complexity. However, these data can be provided and included in the manuscript as a supplementary figure if requested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why would a sulfation change in mature oligos increase myelination? Surely OPCs would be more relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the manuscript we believe that HS on OLG changes the amount/stability of soluble factors, and thus the recruitment and proliferation of surrounding cells (such as OPC or microglia). Thus, OLG trigger non cell autonomous effects by generating a matrix (environment) that in turn regulates the behavior of cells in the lesioned CC. This point is presented in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors show that there is some increase in Shh binding around lesions, but not that it does anything. The statement in the Discussion needs to be modified. Also they do not show local upregulation. Any published information that might link Shh or Shh inhibitor to remyelination needs to be stated. This part of the paper needs attention.</p></disp-quote><p>The data concerning pattern of expression and role of shh during demyelination and myelin repair are already published and were mentioned in the Discussion of the first version of the manuscript. To be more accurate and better present these data we have now included a sentence in the Introduction “Interestingly oligodendrocyte lineage cells also produce factors that can modulate remyelination like the morphogen Shh which is produced by OLG and OPC at the onset of demyelination in lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC)-induced lesions (Ferent et al., 2013). In this context, blocking Shh activity induces an increase in lesion size and a block in OPC proliferation and differentiation, and conversely Shh overexpression leads to the attenuation of the lesion extent and promotes oligodendrogenesis” These data are also included in the Discussion. See also response 2 to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Do the authors believe that the changes they see in NDST etc. are specific to demyelination, or are similar changes seen with traumatic lesions and inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned below and shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we have observed the same pattern of Ndst1 expression in the EAE model. It would indeed be interesting to explore non-demyelinating models in the context of another study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4: Is the increase in cell proliferation in the knockouts entirely accounted for by increased division of microglia?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed co-immunolabelling of Olig2 and Ki67 showing a significant increase of OPC proliferation mutant mouse compared to control 8dpi.
