Such challenges are not usually met by yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation approaches; instead, they require technically demanding methods such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which only work in some cases.</p><p>Recently, antibody-based capture assays on solid supports have been described that can be used in bait-prey experiments in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Löchte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarzenbacher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weghuber et al., 2010</xref>). We now demonstrate an expansion of this concept to characterize location- and conformation-specific protein-protein interactions in a novel two-hybrid assay read out by fluorescence microscopy by using microprinted antibody patterns for the capture of bait proteins to spatially arrange them in the plasma membrane of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dirscherl and Springer, 2017</xref>) and to investigate their interaction with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged prey proteins. The assay is universally applicable for the investigation of protein-protein interactions.</p><p>In this paper, we use this two-hybrid micropattern assay to solve the long-standing question which forms of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) proteins associate laterally (<italic>in cis</italic>) on the plasma membrane. MHC I proteins consist of a polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain (HC), the non-covalently bound light chain beta-2 microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m), and a peptide of eight to ten amino acids. Assembly of HC, β<sub>2</sub>m, and peptide takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by transport to the cell surface, where MHC I proteins present the bound peptides to T cell receptors of cytotoxic T cells; they also bind inhibitory receptors on Natural Killer cells. MHC I antigen presentation is central to the cellular immune response of jawed vertebrates against viruses, intracellular parasites, and tumors.</p><p>At the cell surface, MHC I proteins exist in three different forms: the HC/β<sub>2</sub>m/peptide trimers, the ‘peptide-empty’ HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers derived from them by dissociation of the peptide, and the ‘free’ heavy chains derived from the dimers by dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m. While the lateral association of MHC I proteins has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capps et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arosa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matko et al., 1994</xref>), other researchers have not detected them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Szöllösi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damjanovich et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liegler et al., 1991</xref>). Optical methods have not provided conclusive evidence which of the three forms are interacting, and biochemical approaches have not clarified where in the cell the binding occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capps et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matko et al., 1994</xref>). To add to the complexity, the HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers and the free heavy chains have short half-lives in the cell, which complicates their analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>). For the study of the proposed functions of the MHC I protein-protein interactions (endocytosis, synapse architecture, inflammatory response, receptor modulation; see the discussion), knowledge of location and conformation of the associated proteins is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon-Salazar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nizsalóczki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mocsár et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our work now shows conclusively that MHC I free heavy chains, but not HC/β<sub>2</sub>m/peptide trimers or HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers, associate <italic>in cis</italic> at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H-2K<sup>b</sup> and H-2D<sup>b</sup> are specifically captured by antibody micropatterns</title><p>Membrane proteins on the surface of living cells can be captured into geometric shapes by antibodies that are printed on to the substrate in micrometer-sized patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dirscherl et al., 2017</xref>]).

We inked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamps with solutions of Y3 and 27-11-13S and printed them onto the surface of untreated glass coverslips. We then seeded human STF1 fibroblasts expressing C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of either K<sup>b</sup> or D<sup>b</sup> onto these coverslips and observed capture of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP and D<sup>b</sup>-GFP by confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As anticipated, K<sup>b</sup>-GFP was only captured with Y3, and D<sup>b</sup> only with 27-11-13S. We conclude that the printed β<sub>2</sub>m-dependent antibodies still specifically recognize their target allotypes.</p><p>In addition to β<sub>2</sub>m-dependent capture by Y3 or 27-11-13S, we wished to be able to capture MHC I proteins independently of their β<sub>2</sub>m or peptide association. Thus, we next tested whether MHC I proteins can also be captured <italic>via</italic> an N-terminal (extracellular) influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom). We printed patterns of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 and seeded STF1 cells expressing either a HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP fusion construct or K<sup>b</sup>-GFP, which lacked the HA epitope. As expected, only HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP was captured, but not K<sup>b</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The HA tag did not interfere with the capture of HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP on Y3 antibody micropatterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We conclude that the anti-HA antibody can be used to specifically capture HA-tagged MHC I proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stabilizing effect of conformation-specific antibodies allows for differential patterning of K<sup>b</sup> dimers and free heavy chains</title><p>We next sought to establish conditions in which K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers, without peptide, are preferentially captured in the antibody patterns. In STF1 cells, which lack TAP (the transporter associated with antigen processing) and thus cannot load MHC I proteins with high-affinity peptides in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Salle et al., 1999</xref>), such dimers can be accumulated at the cell surface by incubation at 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>). These peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers can be detected by subsequent binding of fluorescently labeled peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saini et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We therefore printed Y3 on glass coverslips, seeded STF1 cells expressing HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP onto the patterns, and then incubated at 25°C overnight. Next morning, we added the K<sup>b</sup>-specific peptide SIINFEKL(abbreviated SL8) labeled with the TAMRA fluorophore (SL8<sup>TAMRA</sup>). We observed a striking patterned staining of the fluorescent peptide, which demonstrates that peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup>/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers had been captured in the patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 2). To show that binding of the peptide was specific, we pre-incubated the cells with unlabeled SIINFEKL peptide, which blocked SL8<sup>TAMRA</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 3). Thus, we were able to capture K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers into patterns and subsequently bind peptide to them.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34150.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Antibody micropatterns determine stability of the captured K<sup>b</sup> population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells expressing HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP were captured on Y3 or anti-HA antibody micropatterns and incubated at 25 or 37°C to allow for the dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m. To identify the nature of the captured K<sup>b</sup>-GFP population (green channel), specific fluorescent peptide SIINFEKL (SL8<sup>TAMRA</sup>; red channel) was added to the samples. Based on their ability to bind peptide, one can distinguish between the peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimer and the K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chains, which are incapable to bind peptide. (<bold>B</bold>) For further characterization of the captured HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP on Y3 or anti-HA antibody micropatterns, immunostaining experiments were performed. Immunostaining of captured HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP molecules with the anti-β<sub>2</sub>m antibody (BBM.1<sup>Atto542</sup>) reveals dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m from anti-HA antibody micropatterns at 37°C (column 3). Addition of the specific ligand peptide SIINFEKL (SL8) during 37°C incubation prevents β<sub>2</sub>m dissociation (column 4). Scale bars: 25 µm.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34150-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>We then repeated the same experiment on patterns of anti-HA antibody, with the same result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 5). Thus, both Y3 and anti-HA antibodies captured peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers on the surface of the STF1 cells.</p><p>We next wished to dissociate β<sub>2</sub>m from the captured K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers in order to obtain patterned free heavy chains. At 37°C, dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m from K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers occurs rapidly, whereas at 25°C, the rate of dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Day et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, we repeated the above experiments on anti-HA and Y3 patterns, but before adding the SL8<sup>TAMRA</sup> peptide, we shifted the cells to 37°C for two to three hours. As expected, after incubation at 37°C, HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP patterns showed no binding of SL8<sup>TAMRA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 4), which shows that the HA-captured MHC I proteins lost their peptide-binding capacity, probably due to the dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m. Very interestingly, HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP captured with Y3 retained its ability to bind peptide at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 1). This suggests that the β<sub>2</sub>m-dependent Y3 antibody stabilizes the K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimer complex to which it is bound by preventing the dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m, similar to the action of peptide (Townsend and Bodmer 1989).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the lack of peptide binding of the K<sup>b</sup> proteins that were captured by HA and incubated at 37°C was due to the loss of β<sub>2</sub>m, we repeated the same experiment, but instead of adding fluorescent peptide, we fixed the cells and immuno-stained with the anti-β<sub>2</sub>m antibody BBM.1 that was directly labeled with Atto 542 (BBM.1<sup>Atto542</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As predicted, the Y3 micropatterns stained positive for β<sub>2</sub>m at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, columns 1 and 2), whereas anti-HA micropatterns stained for β<sub>2</sub>m only at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, columns 3 and 5). When we added SIINFEKL to the cells on anti-HA-micropatterns before shifting them to 37°C, we observed that BBM.1<sup>Atto542</sup> staining was restored in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, column 4). We conclude that captured K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chains can be generated by inducing the dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m from K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers captured on anti-HA patterns.</p><p>Taken together, we are able to selectively hold three different forms of K<sup>b</sup> on the surface of STF1 cells: free K<sup>b</sup> heavy chains (at 37°C on HA patterns), K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers (at 25°C on anti-HA patterns, or at 25 or 37°C on Y3 patterns), and K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m/peptide trimers (by addition of peptide on anti-HA and Y3 patterns).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Antibody micropatterns reveal conformation-dependent <italic>in cis</italic> interactions of K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chains</title><p>Since we were able to distinguish the three different forms of K<sup>b</sup> held in the patterns, we next investigated whether any of these forms associate <italic>in cis</italic> on the plasma membrane.

Recruitment of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP (green channel) to the anti-HA antibody micropatterns occurs specifically at 37°C and can be inhibited by addition of the SIINFEKL (SL8) peptide (column 3 and 4). The single chain mutant, scK<sup>b</sup>-GFP (which has β<sub>2</sub>m covalently linked to the K<sup>b</sup> heavy chain) is also not recruited to the antibody micropatterns (column 5).

The versatility of our assay with extracellular HA and intracellular GFP fusions supports a broad range of applications, especially in the study of specific protein-protein interactions that require investigation in the native environment of live cells. This two-hybrid assay circumvents the disadvantages of employing two different fluorescent proteins on the cytoplasmic tails of the proteins of interest (for example for FRET microscopy) that may be biased through unspecific interactions and aggregation of the fluorescent tags.</p><p>The example of MHC I proteins demonstrates the challenges of the functional analysis of protein-protein interactions and the limitations of conventional methods, which yield no information on the spatial resolution or the distinction of different protein conformations. Previous experiments with FRET have revealed cluster formation of antibody-labelled MHC I proteins at the cells surface, but the involvement of free heavy chains was only indirectly shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matko et al., 1994</xref>). Other studies involved co-immunoprecipitation experiments that revealed the existence of free heavy chain-dimers of different murine MHC I allotypes by pull-down with conformation-specific antibodies. However, it could not be excluded that the detected interactions were enhanced, or indeed caused, by detergents after cell lysis. Additional pulse-chase experiments confirmed that MHC I proteins associate after they have traversed the medial Golgi, but could not localize them to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capps et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Our own co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm these observations for the murine K<sup>b</sup> allotype, but they also lack spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The differential co-immunoprecipitation of surface-biotinylated MHC I proteins finally confirms the presence of protein-protein associations at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but even this method cannot entirely exclude the involvement of intracellular MHC I proteins.</p><p>Our two-hybrid assay finally solves the questions of generation and location for MHC I protein-protein interactions. The assay principle has allowed us to establish a system in which we generate defined conformations of MHC I proteins. The results demonstrate that MHC I protein association depends on the generation of free heavy chains, and together with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>), they suggest that these free heavy chains originate from the captured empty K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers at the cell surface upon dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m. By holding the dimers in the anti-HA patterns and triggering the dissociation of β<sub>2</sub>m with the 37°C shift, we were able to show that <italic>in cis</italic> interactions are indeed happening at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of course, it is possible that in addition, free heavy chains are generated elsewhere in the cell by β<sub>2</sub>m dissociation, for example in endosomes, and that they might associate in these locations also.</p><p>Is it possible that more than one kind of MHC I protein-protein interaction exists in cells? The MHC I clusters identified by the Yewdell and Edidin groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yewdell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matko et al., 1994</xref>) contain peptide-bound MHC I proteins. Since our cells were TAP-deficient and thus contained no, or few, peptides for binding to MHC I proteins, we would not have seen the clusters observed by them. If, for example, the Yewdell clusters are formed in the ER then they would not even have formed in our system upon addition of external peptide.</p><p>The spatial organization of bait proteins in the plasma membrane allows for the quantification of co-captured proteins into the antibody pattern elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In our setup, we determined the distribution of prey proteins in control experiments as biological background (this corresponds to our background ratio of 1.1). This background includes also MHC I proteins that are co-captured on the antibody pattern elements before the temperature shift. Whether this background corresponds to pre-formed protein-protein interactions or a heterogeneous surface distribution was not tested and requires detailed analysis.</p><p>For MHC I <italic>in cis</italic> interactions at the cell surface, various functional roles have been proposed. They might be a means of accelerated disposal for free heavy chains, preventing re-binding of β<sub>2</sub>m and peptide and perhaps leading to enhanced internalization and degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montealegre et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by our finding that associated MHC I proteins do not bind peptide well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and therefore probably do not interact with TCRs. They might be <italic>in trans</italic> ligands for NK cell receptors or similar proteins, perhaps signaling stress or activation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burian et al., 2016</xref>). We cannot entirely exclude that the associated MHC I proteins contain some K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers that are peptide-receptive, as has been suggested for human MHC I oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodnár et al., 2003</xref>), but free heavy chains are clearly essential for <italic>in cis</italic> interactions, since single-chain K<sup>b</sup>HC/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers do not associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Another possibility is that the associated free heavy chain might influence the surface levels of other proteins with which MHC I proteins are known to interact, such as APLP or insulin receptor, thereby mediating non-immunological functions of MHC I proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shatz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon-Salazar et al., 2014</xref>). Our assay is a promising tool to extend the interaction studies for MHC I proteins by the proposed interaction partners.</p><p>We have shown here the formation of homotypic <italic>in cis</italic> interactions of the murine MHC I allotype K<sup>b</sup>. Interestingly, previous work suggests that the tendency of <italic>in cis</italic> interactions varies among MHC I allotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capps et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, it was hypothesized that those MHC I allotypes that do not associate are not internalized (by the accelerated disposal mechanism proposed above) and that they will bind exogenous peptides to provoke autoimmune reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capps et al., 1993</xref>). This might be interesting in the case of those subtypes of HLA-B27 that are implicated in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as spondyloarthropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1999</xref>). For HLA-B*27:05, formation of heavy chain dimers at the cell surface, or in early endocytic compartments, was demonstrated to occur through a disulfide bond between the unpaired cysteine-67 residues. Since K<sup>b</sup> does not have an unpaired cysteine in the extracellular domain, this type of dimerization is not possible for K<sup>b</sup>. Still, the interesting possibility exists that the <italic>in cis</italic> heavy chain associations described by us for K<sup>b</sup> might also occur with B*27:05 and might cause the formation of the covalent B*27:05 dimers. We look forward to future investigations.</p><p>Due its versatility, our assay allows for the development of a screen to test for the tendency of individual MHC I allotypes to associate with themselves, and with other allotypes. This may be extended to human MHC I proteins, whose empty dimers can be enriched at the cell surface by incubation with low-affinity dipeptide ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saini et al., 2015</xref>), and even to the empty forms of HLA-F that were recently discovered to bind NK cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burian et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, by its application to the human system, this screening tool can be developed to investigate the correlation between cell surface protein-protein interactions and human autoimmune disease. Generation of anti-HA antibody micropatterns by microcontact printing on conventional glass coverslips makes this assay especially suitable for such high-throughput approaches.</p><p>In addition to its demonstrated application in the detection of conformation-dependent <italic>in cis</italic> interactions, the assay can be further developed towards more detailed analysis. One possibility is the integration of conventional immunostaining for the identification of other proteins involved in the redistribution of co-captured proteins. For MHC I proteins, for example, observing the accumulation of adaptor proteins involved in endocytic processes (e.g. Rab proteins) on the pattern elements under condition of co-capture will contribute to understand the nature of MHCI protein endocytosis and the functional role of <italic>in cis</italic> interactions.</p><p>Another possible technical development is to combine the assay with fluorescence revovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements to test the dynamics of the interactions (i.e. dissociation and re-association). Such a combined two-hybrid-FRAP assay is potentially superior to conventional (FRET) experiments, since the enrichment of proteins in the pattern elements increases the abundance of the interaction partners and might thus enable the detection of very weak interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Labeled and unlabeled peptides were added to the cells at a final concentration of 2 µM for 15–30 min at 37°C to detect peptide binding.

These cells were chosen to make sure that only the murine allotype H-2K<sup>b</sup> was investigated, without interference of other murine MHC I allotypes that might cross-react with the used antibodies. STF1 cells were authenticated by HLA haplotype genotyping; they were regularly tested for mycoplasma. The cells were stably transduced with K<sup>b</sup>-GFP, D<sup>b</sup>-GFP, and E3-HA-K<sup>b</sup>-GFP. Lentiviruses were produced and used for gene delivery as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hein et al., 2014</xref>). For co-capturing experiments, co-transduced STF1 cells were used. The cells were first selected with puromycin for E3-HA-K<sup>b</sup> (the additional E3 tag (EIAALEK)<sub>3</sub> is a 21 amino-acid long extracellular tag that was initially introduced for co-staining experiments).

Data acquisition was performed with the LSM 510 META software, release 3.2 (Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH). During image acquisition, patterns and cells were imaged in the same focal plane at a pinhole of ≈1 Airy unit. Image analysis and processing were performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA). Image processing comprises cropping, rotation and adjustment of brightness and contrast levels.</p><p>Generally, all cells on the antibody micropatterns were scanned by eye, and representative cells were chosen for image acquisition. Due to the range of expression levels, only cells with a moderate expression level were selected for evaluation. Only adhered cells were evaluated; cells with altered morphologies (e.g. apoptotic cells) were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of co-captured proteins</title><p>To compare the spatial distribution of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP between the pattern elements and the pattern element interspaces, we determined the mean fluorescence intensity of GFP in the entire cell area and also for the areas on the pattern elements (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA). The ratio of fluorescence intensity on pattern elements over total fluorescence intensity was calculated. Control experiments (peptide addition, incubation at 25°C and the single chain construct) gave a 1.1 ratio, and thus this was defined as the background signal. The co-capturing experiments usually showed a ratio of 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Next day, cells were incubated in presence or absence of 10 µM SL8 for 10 min at 25°C. E3-tagged K<sup>b</sup>-molecules were labeled with K4<sup>biotin</sup> for 5 min at room temperature using 200 nM biotinylated K4 peptide. Following biotinylation, cells were placed at 37°C for 15 min to allow for co-capture. Cells were collected into native lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) by scraping and lysed for 45 min at 4°C. Biotinylated E3-HA-K<sup>b</sup> (with K4<sup>biotin</sup>) was immunoprecipitated from post-nuclear supernatants using neutravidin-agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt Germany). Beads were washed in lysis buffer and wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and supplemented with endogylcosidase F1 for 2 hr at 37°C, or left untreated. Isolated proteins were retrieved from beads by boiling and separated by SDS-PAGE.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the use of micro contact printing to evaluate lateral interactions MHC class I proteins in situ was novel and presented a useful new approach to such problems. There was a consensus that the tool would be more powerful if the patterns were quantified and it was felt that this would be straight forward as the patterns are user defined and should be easy to segment and measure. This might allow application to weaker interactions where results may not as obvious.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Quantify imaging results and validate for this example. Given this signal to noise, how weak an association could be detected?</p><p>2) We would strongly recommend not using the word cluster to describe the patterning of class I molecules with glass bound Abs. While this is clearly a useful technique, it is highly artificial, and for all we know, each &quot;cluster&quot; could be a single pair of co-localized Abs. Cluster has been used (appropriately) in the past to refer to spontaneously concentrated class I molecules, likely present in membrane domains that limit their ability to diffuse from each other. The use of cluster in the present study muddies the waters considerably, and will likely increase confusion, rather than the opposite.</p><p>3) Is it possible to reverse the association of non-conformed K<sup>b</sup> molecules by addition peptide and or β<sub>2</sub>m?</p><p>4) Subsection “Stabilizing effect of conformation-specific antibodies allows for differential patterning of K<sup>b</sup> dimers and free heavy chains”, first paragraph: regarding the use of TAP negative cells (whose original publication should be cited), Day et al., 1994, reported that TAP positive cells actually express more peptide receptive cell surface molecules, undermining the reasoning of these statements.</p><p>5) &quot;So their endogenous class I molecules would not interfere with the Ab micropatterns&quot;. This should be rephrased as it is not clear.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel two-hybrid antibody micropattern assay reveals conformation-specific cell surface clustering of MHC I proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewing editor has now carefully examined these remaining concerns including a review of the literature regarding in situ analysis of protein interactions using microcontact printing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current application of the method is thought to be of high value and provides significant biological insight. The method itself is too conceptually similar to earlier work from the Schütz lab (which you have cited correctly) to be referred to as a &quot;novel&quot; assay and thus it is requested that you remove the word &quot;novel&quot; from the title and anywhere else in the manuscript this is claimed, unless you specifically identify the novel aspect. The reviewers acknowledge that you have literally created a &quot;two-hybrid&quot; version based on using the epitope tagged bait (hybrid 1) and the fluorescent tagged prey (hybrid 2), which Schütz didn't fully realise, but they had already used the bait-prey terminology in their 2010 Jove paper, and conceptually it is too small an advance in terms of assay technology. They didn't need to make a first hybrid as they tested a transmembrane bait interacting with a cytoplasmic prey. But they have everything else you describe and more sophisticated analysis.</p><p>2) While the reviewers appreciate that you define cluster in the context of this study, &quot;cluster&quot; with respect to MHC class I antigens has been previously defined and this needs to be respected within papers in this field to avoid confusion. It is also felt that with the ability to detect only a 10% steady state association with the current method (based on use of 1.1 as a threshold) that you apparently can't detect the earlier defined MHC class I clusters. But you are not saying these don't exist. A compromise would be to refer to the phenomenon you are studying as &quot;induced clusters&quot; throughout to distinguish them from previously described spontaneous clusters of MHC class I trimers, that you neglect due to your detection threshold. It is essential to clarify this or use a term not including &quot;cluster&quot;.</p><p>3) Proposed new title: &quot;A two-hybrid antibody micropattern assay reveals conformation-specific cell surface induced clustering of MHC I proteins&quot;.</p><p>4) You describe the quantitative threshold of 1.1 in the response to reviewers, but we couldn't find this in the paper. Please include in the Materials and methods the 1.1 threshold for defining an induced cluster in the system. It is not clear how the gap between 1.1 and 1.3 is defined as a grey zone in the rebuttal, but you should also mention this if you feel it is important to actually set the threshold at 1.3, although this is very close to your experimental result.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;A novel two-hybrid antibody micropattern assay reveals cell surface clustering of MHC I heavy chains&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing editor, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>There is no editorial policy against use of &quot;novel&quot; in titles of <italic>eLife</italic> papers, but this has been infrequent – at around 0.2%. In the first decision letter the editors did override one reviewer in acknowledging that the approach was novel, but when the reviewer persisted in questioning this an editor went to the primary literature and looked at the precedents specifically to address this issue independently. As described in the second decision letter the opinion of the editors was then changed to agree with the reviewer that the core of the assay technology was well described earlier and that this assay is a novel application of an existing assay concept. Since this is too much information to convey in the title, the decision was to remove &quot;novel&quot; from the title and then explain the more nuanced novelty of this application in the text. The editors still ask that you remove novel from the title.</p><p>The second issue has to do with the definition of cluster and whether this is misleading in this context. The editors still ask that you change this terminology to avoid confusion and quantitative implications of the term. The interaction leading to a signal in this assay could be sub-stoichiometric, 1:1 or super-stiochiometric. The term cluster suggests groupings of greater than 1:1, because 1:1 would be called a dimer, and less than 1:1 would not be cluster. This method doesn't provide any information about stoichiometry, but just that it leads to co-localization of prey with the bait by fluorescence microscopy. The heavy chain interaction you are detecting may very well be a dimer, based on other literature, but this cannot be determined from this data. So describing the process as a cluster seems to be an over-interpretation. The bait and pray are simply co-localized at conventional visible light resolution. The authors should refer to co-localization, co-capture or enrichment to precisely describe what the assay detects as a ratio of on/off pattern as quantified in Figure 3?</p><p>The last issue was the baseline co-localization of prey with bait, which is described as generating a ratio of 1.1 of on/off pattern. This ratio was 1.3 for conditions leading to the empty MHC I heavy chains. Is 1.1 measured under conditions favoring the full heterotrimer of MHC I, peptide and β<sub>2</sub>m, significantly different than 1.0? The quantification was new data added by the authors to Figure 3. This is where 10% came from. The authors may not have data to determine if 1.1 is significantly different than 1.0, but as a discussion point, they might discuss that the previously describe interactions of MHC I proteins on cells may be captured in this number, which would then be a biological background for this assay method and thus will impact its sensitivity. This would also put the relative magnitude of other forms of MHC clustering and this phenomenon in context. More experiments would be needed to sort this out- probably use of different controls to find proteins that are totally unaffected by capture of some of the MHC I molecules to the patterned antibodies. The authors are urged to put these aspects of this assay and earlier investigations of MHC I distribution on the cell surface in context as best they can.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34150.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Quantify imaging results and validate for this example. Given this signal to noise, how weak an association could be detected?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. In our revised manuscript, we have now included the quantification of K<sup>b</sup>-K<sup>b</sup> cluster formation at 37 °C and the respective controls according to our observations in Figure 3B. We have thus added the quantification to Figure 3 (see new Figure 3C) and have extended the Results section (subsection “Antibody micropatterns reveal conformation-dependent <italic>in cis</italic> interactions of K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chains”, fifth paragraph) as well as the Materials and methods section accordingly (subsection “Quantification of clustering”).</p><p>Briefly, for the quantification we used ImageJ to compare the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire cell with the mean fluorescence intensity of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP in the areas of the pattern elements. A relocalization of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP to the pattern elements leads to increased fluorescence intensity levels on the pattern elements and an increase of the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the pattern elements over the fluorescence intensity of the entire cell. According to theoretical considerations and the observations in our system, we interpret a ratio of 1.3 as clustering and values below 1.1 as background signal (Figure 3C). Quantification is not trivial in our example since the K<sup>b</sup>-transfected TAP-deficient STF1 cells have a generally strong ER background. This is because many K<sup>b</sup> molecules that cannot be loaded with intracellular peptides are not transported to the plasma membrane. Despite these high background levels, we obtained significant differences between clustering cells and controls (see Figure 3C).</p><p>We think that the numerical fluorescence ratios might be different for other protein-protein interactions, depending on cell type, expression levels, background signal, and also the pattern element sizes. These factors will play important roles for the sensitivity of the assay but can be adjusted during optimization experiments.</p><p>Regarding the detection of weak protein-protein interactions asked by the reviewer, we think that our method can be even advantageous over conventional methods, since it allows for the accumulation of proteins to the pattern elements over time to increase the signal intensity. Also, one can increase the number of captured proteins by increasing the antibody concentration or achieve better contrast by varying pattern geometries and/or pattern element sizes. Alternatively, a readout by TIRF or super-resolution microscopy techniques might allow researchers to detect weak signals when only shorter incubation times on the antibody micropatterns can be realized, or when protein-protein interactions require temporal resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We would strongly recommend not using the word cluster to describe the patterning of class I molecules with glass bound Abs. While this is clearly a useful technique, it is highly artificial, and for all we know, each &quot;cluster&quot; could be a single pair of co-localized Abs. Cluster has been used (appropriately) in the past to refer to spontaneously concentrated class I molecules, likely present in membrane domains that limit their ability to diffuse from each other. The use of cluster in the present study muddies the waters considerably, and will likely increase confusion, rather than the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which has revealed to us an important potential misunderstanding. To understand our assay, our readers need to be able to discriminate between two events that we have termed captureand clustering. We still believe that this terminology is precise and useful according to the following definitions:</p><p>1) We use the term capture to describe the binding of cell surface membrane proteins to the antibody micropatterns. Capture thus describes the direct antibody-antigen interaction that prevents internalization of the bound proteins, i.e., the mechanical trapping of K<sup>b</sup> proteins at the cell surface (see Figure 3).</p><p>2) In contrast, we use the term clustering to describe the binding of further protein molecules to the already captured proteins on the pattern elements. This is the event that our assay is set up to detect. This definition matches the statement of the reviewer: “Cluster has been used (appropriately) in the past to refer to spontaneously concentrated class I molecules, likely present in membrane domains that limit their ability to diffuse from each other.”</p><p>It is essential that the two terms are clearly introduced, differentiated, and understood by the readers. We very much agree that the term <italic>clustering</italic> might be misleading if not properly defined, but we are convinced that <italic>clustering</italic> is still the best term for our observation. We have therefore introduced a clearer definition of both terms in the manuscript (Introduction, second and third paragraphs). In addition, we have gone through our Introduction to make sure that the term <italic>capture</italic> is now stringently used.</p><p>With these adjustments, we now trust that our explanations are clear and straightforward, and that the readers will be able to distinguish between the two terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is it possible to reverse the association of non-conformed K<sup>b</sup> molecules by addition peptide and or β<sub>2</sub>m?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this exciting possibility. Indeed, during our work, we have thought hard about the molecular structure of the clustered proteins, and especially if they would be able to bind peptide and/or β<sub>2</sub>m.</p><p>First, we tested peptide binding to the clustered K<sup>b</sup> molecules in order to characterize the clustered K<sup>b</sup> molecules in more detail (see Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In these experiments, we observed that peptide binding was impaired, suggesting that the clustered K<sup>b</sup> molecules are no longer peptide-receptive. This is plausible since MHC class I free heavy chains do not usually bind peptide well.</p><p>Second, with respect to β<sub>2</sub>m binding, we have – in previous published work – performed β<sub>2</sub>m incubation experiments in the same experimental system of K<sup>b</sup> in STF1 cells and found that exogenous β<sub>2</sub>m does not significantly increase the lifetime of surface class I, suggesting that it will not significantly re-bind to the K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chain once the original β<sub>2</sub>m has dissociated (Montealegre et al., 2015).</p><p>In the work presented in this manuscript, we show that incubation with peptide prevents the formation of clusters (Figure 3B, column 4). We have not incubated the cells with peptides or with exogenous β<sub>2</sub>m after cluster formation in order to try to reverse the K<sup>b</sup>-K<sup>b</sup> interaction, as the reviewer suggested, but from the above observations of impaired peptide and β<sub>2</sub>m binding, we assume that K<sup>b</sup> free heavy chain clusters will not be dispersed by the addition of β<sub>2</sub>m or peptide.</p><p>We believe that the detailed molecular mechanism of cluster formation, its potential dynamic nature, and the subsequent fate of the class I free heavy chain clusters are very interesting questions to follow up on, but we would like to leave these investigations to a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Stabilizing effect of conformation-specific antibodies allows for differential patterning of K<sup>b</sup> dimers and free heavy chains”, first paragraph: regarding the use of TAP negative cells (whose original publication should be cited), Day et al., 1994, reported that TAP positive cells actually express more peptide receptive cell surface molecules, undermining the reasoning of these statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our manuscript. In our revised manuscript we have now added the original publication of STF1 cells (de la Salle et al., 1999) specifically to the mentioned sections as requested. We have also cited the Day et al., 1995 paper.</p><p>As the reviewer commented correctly, Day and collaborators investigated the role of TAP for the generation of peptide-receptive molecules at the cell surface. In their work, they found that the murine TAP-positive RMA cells have higher surface levels of peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup> molecules than TAP-deficient RMA-S cells (Day et al., 1995).</p><p>For our studies, we opted for a human TAP2-deficient cell line and transduced it with the K<sup>b</sup> constructs described in the manuscript in order to bypass any murine MHC class I background issues in our system. Prompted by the question of the reviewer, we became curious as to the levels of peptide-receptive K<sup>b</sup> molecules on the surface of the STF1 cells, and similar to the work of Day et al., we have now compared STF1 cells with STF1+TAP2 cells (STF1 cells transduced with TAP2, which have wild type TAP function). We transduced both cell lines with HA-K<sup>b</sup>, thus generating the two stable cell lines (STF1/HA-K<sup>b</sup> and STF1+TAP2/HA-K<sup>b</sup>). To quantify peptide-receptive molecules, we added the K<sup>b</sup>-specific high-affinity peptide SIINFEKL (SL8; 10 µM) to the cell culture medium and incubated the cells for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed, trypsinized, and stained with antibodies according to the standard protocol for flow cytometry.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34150.012</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of cell surface expression of HA-K<sup>b</sup> in STF1 and STF1+TAP2 cells by flow cytometry.</title><p>STF1 cells were transduced with HA-K<sup>b</sup> and stained with anti-HA or 25-D1.16 and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and subjected to flow cytometry.

In STF1 cells, K<sup>b</sup> surface levels only showed a small and barely significant increase upon addition of SL8, probably because the peptide prevented endocytosis of some empty dimers (Montealegre et al., 2015). The K<sup>b</sup> surface levels in STF1+TAP2 cells remained the same upon peptide addition, although they have generally higher K<sup>b</sup> surface levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine the peptide-receptive population of the detected K<sup>b</sup> molecules, the same samples were stained with the 25-D1.16 antibody, specifically binding to K<sup>b</sup> molecules that are loaded with the SL8 peptide (Porgador et al., 1997). As expected, the 25-D1.16 signal increases clearly upon addition of the SL8 peptide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, the almost identical increase of the 25-D1.16 signal after peptide addition shows that the levels of peptide-receptive molecules are similar in both cell lines. This suggests that in both cell lines, despite their very different K<sup>b</sup> surface levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), similar mechanisms are at work to limit the amount of peptide-receptive ('empty') class I at the cell surface.</p><p>These findings are in contrast to the findings of Day and collaborators on RMA-S cells that the reviewer mentions. We are not surprised, though, since class I quality control and trafficking parameters vary between different cells; one important difference is that RMA-S cells are lymphocytes, in which the antigen processing and presentation genes in the MHC are fully induced (whereas STF1 cells are fibroblasts).</p><p>Our original reason for using TAP-deficient STF1 cells have to do with the homogeneity of the class I population. The experiments in our manuscript rely on our ability to generate free heavy chains of H-2K<sup>b</sup> on the cell surface, and to trap them there. This is achieved by capturing the K<sup>b</sup> heavy chain/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers and incubating the cells at 37 °C to allow these dimers to dissociate, leaving captured free heavy chain that is unable to bind peptide (see answer to comment 3 above, and Figure 2B, column 3, of the manuscript). These free heavy chains then cluster with other free heavy chains (Figure 3B, column 3). Since we use TAP-deficient STF1 cells, the majority of the K<sup>b</sup> molecules that reach the surface are probably heavy chain/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers, which provides us with a relatively homogeneous population. If, according to the question of the reviewer, we were to use STF1+TAP2 cells, then we would additionally have a large population of K<sup>b</sup> heavy chain/β<sub>2</sub>m/peptide trimers (compare the STF1 and the STF1+TAP2 columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), which do not turn into free heavy chains at 37 °C and thus provide a second species of K<sup>b</sup> at the cell surface that does not undergo clustering and possibly dilutes our readout signal. This, for us, was the main reason for using STF1 cells for the experiments.</p><p>We have not made any changes to the manuscript as a result of the work described in this answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;So their endogenous class I molecules would not interfere with the Ab micropatterns&quot;. This should be rephrased as it is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our manuscript and for the suggested corrections. We have changed the indicated sentences in the revised manuscript accordingly (see subsection “Cell lines and gene expression”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current application of the method is thought to be of high value and provides significant biological insight. The method itself is too conceptually similar to earlier work from the Schütz lab (which you have cited correctly) to be referred to as a &quot;novel&quot; assay and thus it is requested that you remove the word &quot;novel&quot; from the title and anywhere else in the manuscript this is claimed, unless you specifically identify the novel aspect. The reviewers acknowledge that you have literally created a &quot;two-hybrid&quot; version based on using the epitope tagged bait (hybrid 1) and the fluorescent tagged prey (hybrid 2), which Schütz didn't fully realise, but they had already used the bait-prey terminology in their 2010 Jove paper, and conceptually it is too small an advance in terms of assay technology. They didn't need to make a first hybrid as they tested a transmembrane bait interacting with a cytoplasmic prey. But they have everything else you describe and more sophisticated analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is for us the first point of confusion. Perhaps the Editor would like to explain. In the comments on our original submission, the Editors wrote:</p><p>&quot;The reviewers agreed that the use of micro contact printing to evaluate lateral interactions MHC class I proteins in situ was novel and presented a useful new approach to such problems.&quot; Based on this statement, we assumed that the use of the word 'novel' was supported by reviewers and Editors. Does the more recent comment now mirror the opinion of additional reviewers? Or did the original reviewers change their minds?</p><p>In our own opinion, the novelty of our approach is threefold: first, the simple technique of the antibody micropatterns, which in principle allows the method to be adapted by any molecular immunology or cell biology laboratory; second, the ability to investigate, by use of the anti-tag antibody, a defined conformation of MHC class I (and not just any and all MHC class I protein; we are not aware of any other technique that can differentiate different protein conformations in such a clear fashion); and third, the use of the technology to identify and characterize a previously uncharacterized (of course, class I homotypic interactions were previously found in the Zuñiga paper, but it was not possible to her and her coworkers to determine that only the heavy chains were interacting; see the Discussion) interaction (to our knowledge, all previous applications of micropatterns were just proof-of-principle applications, common in biophysical publications, of interactions that were already well-characterized by cell biologists).</p><p>We have left the word 'novel' standing in the manuscript for now, but we will not insist on it if the Editor believes that novelty does not apply. We think that upon publication, the quality and novelty of the work will speak for itself; of course, we think that an article will attract more readers and ultimately citations if the word 'novel' is used wherever justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the reviewers appreciate that you define cluster in the context of this study, &quot;cluster&quot; with respect to MHC class I antigens has been previously defined and this needs to be respected within papers in this field to avoid confusion.

A compromise would be to refer to the phenomenon you are studying as &quot;induced clusters&quot; throughout to distinguish them from previously described spontaneous clusters of MHC class I trimers, that you neglect due to your detection threshold. It is essential to clarify this or use a term not including &quot;cluster&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>2.1) About the use of the word 'clusters'. While we 100% appreciate that confusion must be avoided, we think that the word 'cluster' has no clear definition in the field, but has actually been used in three completely different contexts in the literature. We have seen:</p><p>- Lu et al., 2012, who define clusters as protein islands on the cell surface. In their paper, they found that certain pMHC (K<sup>b</sup>+SIINFEKL or K<sup>b</sup>+ SIYRYYGL) are found in distinct areas or “clusters” (200-900 nm in diameter). They conclude that “Our most important finding is that endogenous antigen processing generates intracellular clusters of class I molecules segregated on the basis of their peptide cargo that are maintained for hours after their delivery to the cell surface.”</p><p>- Pentcheva and Edidin, 2001 (Pentcheva, T., and M. Edidin. 2001. Clustering of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules for endoplasmic reticulum export imaged by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. J. Immunol. 166:6625–32. doi:10.4049/JIMMUNOL.166.11.6625), who see associations ('clusters') of A2 in the ER;</p><p>- Mocsár et al., 2016, who have seen MHC I-Interleukin Clusters (including all MHC I isotypes: A, B, C).</p><p>In the review of our first submission, the following sentence is found:</p><p>&quot;Cluster has been used (appropriately) in the past to refer to spontaneously concentrated class I molecules, likely present in membrane domains that limit their ability to diffuse from each other. The use of cluster in the present study muddies the waters considerably, and will likely increase confusion, rather than the opposite.&quot; We understand from this that the reviewer(s) refer(s) to the Edidin clusters, which are speculated to have something to do with lipid environments. If that is not the case, we would ask the Editor to point out to us the definition of 'clusters' in the literature that they find primary and conclusive. Perhaps, for clarification, it would have been useful if we had been able to see the original remarks of the reviewer.</p><p>In addition to the three different definitions of MHC clusters in the literature, the word 'cluster' is also a commonsense word in the English language, and this is the sense that we would have liked to use. It is important to use a commonsense word since people use search engines such as PubMed to find scientific work, and the words that are used to describe phenomena must be commonsense, so that people will be able to identify our paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. This speaks strongly against the use of unusual or invented terms.</p><p>Finally the Editor suggests the term 'induced clusters', which we find not fitting, since there is nothing induced or inducible in our associations of class I molecules. One possibility, from our point of view, is 'free heavy chain clusters', which also clearly differentiates from the Edidin work.</p><p>The Editor is, and the reviewers are, invited to suggest an alternative wording that is commonsense, correct, and findable. For now, we have left the word 'cluster' standing in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also felt that with the ability to detect only a 10% steady state association with the current method (based on use of 1.1 as a threshold) that you apparently can't detect the earlier defined MHC class I clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>2.2) It is unclear to us how the reviewer arrived at these two statements, namely that s/he believes that the steady-state association that we show is only 10% (of what?) and that s/he believes that we are somehow not detecting other associations that are described in the literature. We are puzzled as to how a 1.1 threshold would correlate with a '10% steady-state association'. Again, perhaps it would have been helpful if we had been able to read the reviewer's original comment, since there was clearly a misunderstanding which must now be addressed.</p><p>In the following, we describe again our method for quantifying the conglomerates as already detailed in our Materials and methods section and in the earlier Smallpaper. To compare the spatial distribution of K<sup>b</sup>-GFP between the pattern elements and the pattern element interspaces, we proceeded as follows:</p><p>1) We determined, for each image, a) the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire cell area, and b) the mean fluorescence intensity of the areas on the pattern elements. Quantification was done with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA).</p><p>2) We calculated, for each image, the ratio of these numbers of the mean fluorescence intensity on pattern elements over total fluorescence intensity. This means: a theoretical ratio of 1.0 describes a homogeneous distribution of proteins where the pattern elements and the interspaces have the same mean fluorescence intensity.</p><p>3) We then checked this ratio in our control experiments, where no clustering was expected, and it was 1.1. This value was thus defined as the threshold.</p><p>4) In the experiments, a clear redistribution of proteins onto the pattern elements corresponds to a ratio of 1.3, with the appropriate significance.</p><p>With this type of evaluation, we were not at all aiming to determine the percentage of interacting proteins, nor does this analysis allow us to derive them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also felt that with the ability to detect only a 10% steady state association with the current method (based on use of 1.1 as a threshold) that you apparently can't detect the earlier defined MHC class I clusters. But you are not saying these don't exist.</p></disp-quote><p>2.3) We think that the reviewer is referring to the MHC class I clusters defined by Yewdell or Edidin (see 2.1.). The fundamental difference between our clusters and these is the following: our clusters are clearly made up of free heavy chains, whereas theirs are associations of trimers (trimer: complex of heavy chain, light chain, and peptide) or mixed associations of trimers and heavy chain/β<sub>2</sub>m dimers.</p><p>We do not say that the Yewdell or Edidin clusters do not exist, since we are not in a position to detect them. We are using TAP-deficient cells, in which very few peptides are available to the class I molecules, and so clusters that consist of, or that contain, trimers are not visible in our experimental system. It is important for the reviewer to appreciate this difference. We have now added a sentence in the Discussion that clearly differentiates our clusters from the Yewdell and Edidin clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A compromise would be to refer to the phenomenon you are studying as &quot;induced clusters&quot; throughout to distinguish them from previously described spontaneous clusters of MHC class I trimers, that you neglect due to your detection threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>2.4.With respect to the terms 'cluster' and 'induced', please see our statements above in 2.1.</p><p>With respect to the 'detection threshold', please see our statements above in 2.2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Proposed new title: &quot;A two-hybrid antibody micropattern assay reveals conformation-specific cell surface induced clustering of MHC I proteins&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that it is not prudent to use the word 'induced' (see above 2.1.).

The editors still ask that you change this terminology to avoid confusion and quantitative implications of the term. The interaction leading to a signal in this assay could be sub-stoichiometric, 1:1 or super-stiochiometric. The term cluster suggests groupings of greater than 1:1, because 1:1 would be called a dimer, and less than 1:1 would not be cluster. This method doesn't provide any information about stoichiometry, but just that it leads to co-localization of prey with the bait by fluorescence microscopy. The heavy chain interaction you are detecting may very well be a dimer, based on other literature, but this cannot be determined from this data. So describing the process as a cluster seems to be an over-interpretation. The bait and pray are simply co-localized at conventional visible light resolution. The authors should refer to co-localization, co-capture or enrichment to precisely describe what the assay detects as a ratio of on/off pattern as quantified in Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed our manuscript and avoid the term 'cluster' as requested. Instead, we describe our findings with the terms “<italic>in cis</italic> (protein-protein) interactions”, “associated” or “co-captured” MHC I proteins. When referring to the findings of other groups, we use the terms that they have used to describe their observations, including the term 'clusters'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last issue was the baseline co-localization of prey with bait, which is described as generating a ratio of 1.1 of on/off pattern. This ratio was 1.3 for conditions leading to the empty MHC I heavy chains. Is 1.1 measured under conditions favoring the full heterotrimer of MHC I, peptide and β<sub>2</sub>m, significantly different than 1.0? The quantification was new data added by the authors to Figure 3. This is where 10% came from. The authors may not have data to determine if 1.1 is significantly different than 1.0, but as a discussion point, they might discuss that the previously describe interactions of MHC I proteins on cells may be captured in this number, which would then be a biological background for this assay method and thus will impact its sensitivity. This would also put the relative magnitude of other forms of MHC clustering and this phenomenon in context. More experiments would be needed to sort this out- probably use of different controls to find proteins that are totally unaffected by capture of some of the MHC I molecules to the patterned antibodies. The authors are urged to put these aspects of this assay and earlier investigations of MHC I distribution on the cell surface in context as best they can.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended our discussions and included the points raised by the Editors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
