Here we show in planarians that modulations to body-wide patterning systems shift the target site for eye regeneration while still enabling homeostasis of eyes outside this region. The uncoupling of homeostasis and regeneration, which can occur during normal positional rescaling after axis truncation, is not due to altered injury signaling or stem cell activity, nor specific to eye tissue. Rather, pre-existing tissues, which are misaligned with patterning factor expression domains, compete with properly located organs for incorporation of migratory progenitors. These observations suggest that patterning factors determine sites of organ regeneration but do not solely determine the location of tissue homeostasis. These properties provide candidate explanations for how regeneration integrates pre-existing tissues and how regenerative abilities could be lost in evolution or development without eliminating long-term tissue maintenance and repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Planaria</kwd><kwd>Regeneration</kwd><kwd>Homeostasis</kwd><kwd>progenitors</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Planarians</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32GM008061-31</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Eric M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2DE024365-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Christian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Homeostatic tissue maintenance can occur at locations distinct from the target sites of organ regeneration planarians.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regenerative ability in adulthood is widespread but unevenly distributed across the animal kingdom, with some species displaying high regenerative capacity while other representatives of the same phyla display a more limited capability. By contrast, the ability to maintain tissue integrity and functionality via homeostatic maintenance throughout adulthood is more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poss, 2010</xref>). Regeneration is initiated by injury, and so it involves unique inputs beyond those needed for tissue maintenance and growth, such as wound healing, injury-induced activation of proliferation, tissue re-patterning, and the integration of new and old tissues. However, beyond initial responses to injury, the processes to produce new adult tissue through homeostatic maintenance or regeneration appear to occur through substantially similar mechanisms involving the shared use of tissue progenitors and stem cells for the formation of new differentiated cells. Organisms with strong regenerative ability in many cases also undergo abundant homeostatic maintenance in the absence of injury, making them ideal systems to interrogate the requirements for these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodrigo Albors et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaible et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodnar and Coffman, 2016</xref>). Indeed, functional studies of gene function in highly regenerative organisms, including planarians and zebrafish, indicate that a large majority of factors required for regeneration are also required for tissue maintenance in uninjured animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Whitehead et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wills et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite the similarity between regeneration and growth programs, most animals exhibit an age-dependent reduction in the ability for de novo tissue formation without a coinciding loss of proliferative growth or tissue maintenance. Examples of this phenomenon can be found across most metazoan phyla, including <italic>Xenopus</italic> limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dent, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Slack et al., 2004</xref>), the distal tips of mammalian digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reginelli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehoczky et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris et al., 2016</xref>), and mouse myocardial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drenckhahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms accounting for age-associated loss of regenerative capacity are unlikely to derive from generic reductions in cell proliferation or differentiation. An alternative cause of regeneration attenuation could be developmental loss of embryonic axis patterning systems, which can provide robust positional and scaling information early in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reversade and De Robertis, 2005</xref>) but are generally not sustained into adulthood in organisms with low regenerative ability in maturity.</p><p>Adult freshwater planarians, which have a nearly unlimited ability to undergo regeneration and tissue replacement through homeostasis, use constitutive positional information as an essential upstream regulator of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>). These animals continually express patterning molecules that demarcate the main body axes and are used for regional identity determination through regeneration: Wnt and FGFRL signaling for the anteroposterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen and Reddien, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>), BMP signaling for the dorsoventral (DV) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaviño and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molina et al., 2011</xref>), and Slit/Wnt5 signaling for the mediolateral (ML) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cebrià et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>). Genes from these pathways are expressed mainly within cells of the body-wall musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>) and are regionally restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>) to mark territories across each axis.

Perturbations to these factors can result in tissue duplications or alterations to regional proportionality, either in regenerating animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>) or in animals undergoing RNAi inhibition over a period of prolonged tissue homeostasis in the absence of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stückemann et al., 2017</xref>). For example, RNAi of the Wnt inhibitor <italic>notum</italic> produces ectopic eyes anteriorly in the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>), RNAi of the Wnt gene <italic>wnt11-6/wntA</italic> and the Wnt receptor <italic>fzd5/8-4</italic> produces ectopic eyes posteriorly in the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>), and RNAi of the Wnt gene <italic>wntP-2/wnt11-5</italic> and the Wnt co-receptor <italic>ptk7</italic> produces ectopic pharynges within the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>). Some dynamic expression changes of positional control genes can occur in animals depleted of stem cells, for example, expression of <italic>wntP-2</italic> and <italic>ptk7</italic> in regenerating head fragments, suggesting that at least some patterning information is not dependent on the ability to produce of missing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen and Reddien, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>). Therefore, patterning factors are influential in regulating axis composition both in regeneration and in homeostatic maintenance in the absence of injury.</p><p>All mature tissues in planarians derive from a body-wide pool of adult pluripotent stem cells of the neoblast population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guedelhoefer and Sánchez Alvarado, 2012</xref>). Therefore, a compelling model to account for the robustness of both pattern restoration through regeneration and pattern maintenance through perpetual homeostasis is the use of positional cues to precisely control the differentiation and targeting of planarian neoblast stem cells for tissue production at correct locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddien, 2011</xref>). Indeed, for the D/V axis, BMP signaling can either directly or indirectly influence the specification of neoblasts into dorsal or ventral epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wurtzel et al., 2017</xref>), and BMP signaling is necessary to maintain D/V axis asymmetry both in regeneration and through homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaviño and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molina et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, Wnt signaling along the A/P axis can regulate neoblast specification in both contexts as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>). One expectation of this model is that the sites of organ regeneration and organ homeostasis should be identical along the body axis even if patterning information is experimentally modified.</p><p>We investigated this model by examining the regenerative and homeostatic properties of tissue duplication phenotypes generated by pattern disruption through RNAi treatment. We focused our analysis on regeneration and maintenance of the planarian eye, a simple, well characterized, and regionally restricted organ that can be specifically removed and easily studied. Using RNAi of Wnt signaling components and surgical strategies to shift head patterning information either to the anterior or posterior, our analyses indicate that sites of organ homeostasis do not always coincide with sites of organ regeneration. These results suggest that patterning molecules have a primary function to control the location of regeneration and that mature tissue can undergo growth and tissue homeostasis through progenitor acquisition independent of more precise positional cues. Collectively, these properties could account for the integration of new and pre-existing tissues during regeneration and suggest potential mechanistic differences between tissue regeneration and tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the regenerative competency and homeostatic stability of duplicated tissue structures, we first sought to establish a reliable method for the production of duplicated organs in planarians.

Four-eyed <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals were subjected to 60 days of RNAi inhibition of <italic>ovo</italic>, a transcription factor that serves as a master regulator of planarian eye differentiation from neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>). Both the <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> regenerative eyes and non-regenerative eyes disappeared with similar kinetics during <italic>ovo</italic> RNAi treatment, suggesting that pre-existing eyes are actively maintained through homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm these predictions, we used BrdU labeling to detect the differentiation of new eye cells. Within the eye lineage, proliferative neoblasts give rise to non-dividing eye progenitors that then terminally differentiate into mature eye cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the incorporation of BrdU into eye tissues allows detection of recently differentiated cells in the growing eye. We found similar numbers of BrdU +mature eye cells (<italic>opsin+</italic>) within both the regenerative and non-regenerative <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eyes 7 and 14 days after BrdU pulsing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that both regenerative and non-regenerative eyes are maintained by stem cell activity. BrdU incorporation was lower in each of the <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eyes compared to control eyes, but the total number of BrdU +eye cells was not altered by <italic>notum</italic> RNAi, suggesting that in such animals differentiating eye cells are partitioned across multiple eyes. Furthermore, we observed that both regenerative and non-regenerative eyes in <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals undergo significant size increases in response to animal feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results indicate that pattern alteration through inhibition of <italic>notum</italic> shifted the location of regeneration but not the location of eye tissue maintenance.</p><p>We next tested whether the region of the pre-existing eye might be deficient in expression of wound-induced genes, which would provide a candidate explanation for why these organs cannot regenerate.

Therefore, the inability of pre-existing posterior eyes to regenerate following resection is not likely due to a failure in injury responsiveness.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the inability of pre-existing <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eye to regenerate could be positional discrepancies with respect to the rest of the body. We next examined the position of the regenerative and non-regenerative <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eyes with respect to anteriorly expressed positional control genes (PCGs) and the brain. In 4-eyed <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals, pre-existing eyes were located far from the anteriorly expressed <italic>sFRP-1</italic> and within the pre-pharyngeal region of <italic>ndl-3</italic> expression, distinct from the location of normal eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with these findings, non-regenerative <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eyes were located much more posterior than control eyes with respect to the primary body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> regenerative eyes were located somewhat more anteriorly with respect to the body axis compared to control eyes. <italic>notum</italic> RNAi can affect multiple aspects of patterning within the animal anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>), so we hypothesized that if <italic>notum</italic> RNAi shifted the site of eye regeneration more anterior, then this site may be well positioned with respect to other anterior tissue such as the brain. Consistent with this hypothesis, non-regenerative eyes were considerably displaced with respect to <italic>cintillo+</italic> chemosensory neurons of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Using Hoechst staining to demarcate the cephalic ganglia, we found that eyes typically formed at a particular location along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with previous reports in other planarian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agata et al., 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, while <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> non-regenerative eyes were located at a more posterior position with respect to the brain, regenerative eyes in <italic>noutum(RNAi)</italic> animals were located at the same relative position as control eyes. Therefore, the site of regeneration correlates with a particular relative location with respect to other anterior tissues, either because of a role for the brain in eye positioning or because the eye and brain are both subject to independent control by an upstream process. <italic>notum</italic> itself is expressed within an anterior domain of the brain in <italic>chat+</italic> neurons and also at the anterior pole within the body-wall musculature and both brain size and ectopic eye phenotypes from <italic>notum</italic> RNAi are suppressed by RNAi of <italic>wnt11-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>), which is consistent with either possibility.

We considered two possible explanations for this phenomenon, either that mature eyes have an ability to induce their own progenitors in order to sustain themselves through homeostasis, or that eyes can acquire nearby eye progenitors regardless of the site of eye regeneration. Normal eye homeostasis involves migration of eye progenitors that specify from neoblasts within the anterior of the animal at a distance from the differentiated eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2012</xref>). In principle, these progenitors could migrate to incorporate into either the anterior or posterior eyes of <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals. To test this, we first examined the numbers and distribution of <italic>ovo+</italic> eye progenitors in 4-eyed <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals. <italic>notum</italic> inhibition did not increase the number of eye progenitors per animal, and progenitors could be detected in the vicinity of both the regenerative and non-regenerative eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We scored the position of eye progenitors across several animals and examined their distribution by normalizing their position to the axis defined by the head tip to the pharynx. <italic>notum</italic> RNAi appeared to cause a slight anterior shift to the domain of eye cell specification but that did not substantially change the abundance of eye progenitors near either the anterior or posterior eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, both anterior and posterior eyes would likely have similar access to eye progenitors, consistent with the observation that the rate of BrdU incorporation into each <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eye is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that nearby tissue removal, which is known to induce additional eye progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>), did not enable regeneration of posterior <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By contrast, a mechanism in which mature eyes incorporate progenitors without affecting specification predicts that non-regenerative eyes should compete with regenerative eyes for acquisition of a limited pool of eye progenitors. Consistent with this model, we found that despite generating additional eyes, <italic>notum</italic> inhibition did not alter total numbers of eye cells, but rather resulted reduced numbers of cells per eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), likely due to a reallocation of the eye progenitor cell pool across an increased number of organs. To further test this model, we resected a posterior eye from 4-eyed <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals, then counted numbers of eye cells from the ipsilateral anterior eye, using the contralateral anterior eye as an internal control. After 16 days of recovery, the posterior eye did not regenerate, as seen previously, but the anterior eye on the side of injury grew substantially larger than its contralateral counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top). Likewise, when we resected an anterior eye, the ipsilateral posterior eye enlarged compared to its contralateral counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom), through the size of this effect was smaller, likely due to the ability for the anterior eye to regenerate.

We interpret these experiments to mean that eyes can compete with each other for acquisition of a limited pool of migratory eye progenitor cells. Together, these observations suggest that mature eyes can incorporate migratory progenitors independent of the site of eye regeneration.</p><p>The ability for patterning alteration to uncouple the sites of regeneration and homeostasis could be a phenomenon either specific to <italic>notum</italic> inhibition, a property specific to eyes, or alternatively reflect a fundamental difference in the mechanisms of organ regeneration and homeostatic maintenance.

In previous studies, it has been shown that the use of sodium azide to cause specific removal of both pharynges from <italic>wntP-2(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</italic> animals allowed for the regeneration of both organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>). However, this amputation method likely leaves behind pharynx-associated tissue such as the pharyngeal cavity and the surrounding bifurcated intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>), which could play a role in the determination of the site of pharynx regeneration. We reasoned that a broader amputation that removes this surrounding tissue would be a stronger test of the regenerative competence of these duplicated tissues. We generated animals with two pharynges after dual inhibition of <italic>wntP-2</italic> and <italic>ptk7</italic>, then performed amputations that removed either the anterior or posterior pharynx and their surrounding tissues. The ectopic posterior pharynx had almost normal capacity for regeneration while the anterior pre-existing pharynx displayed strongly diminished regenerative ability, suggesting that <italic>wntP-2(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</italic> animals undergo a posterior shift to the site of trunk tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Despite this alteration, uninjured <italic>wntP-2(RNAi);ptk7(RNAi)</italic> animals acquired BrdU within both pharynges after a 14 day pulse, indicating that pharynges with high or low regenerative ability both incorporate new cells homeostatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We conclude that modification of trunk patterning can alter the target site for pharynx regeneration away from the pre-existing pharynx without eliminating its ability to undergo homeostatic maintenance.</p><p>We additionally tested whether nou darake (<italic>ndk</italic>) RNAi, which produces ectopic brain tissue and ectopic eyes posteriorly into the prepharyngeal region, would similarly modify the site of eye regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cebrià et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, these animals displayed an unaltered site of eye regeneration, with pre-existing anterior eyes succeeding at regeneration while ectopic eyes failed to regenerate.

Furthermore, these results suggest a specificity of Wnt factors in controlling the target location of organ regeneration along the primary body axis.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the uncoupling of the site of eye regeneration and maintenance only occurs artificially after experimental gene perturbation or could occur as part of the normal regenerative process. Planarians undergo a natural process of patterning alteration after amputation, in which positional control gene expression domains become altered in order to replace regional identities lost to injury as well as accommodate new reduced body proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen and Reddien, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, the tissue remodeling process typically does not appear to produce intermediate states in which new well-positioned tissues are formed prior to the elimination of improperly positioned ones. However, spontaneous appearance of ectopic eyes has been reported at low frequencies, indicating errors can occur in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakai et al., 2000</xref>). To specifically test robustness of pattern control through remodeling, we performed a series of amputations along the primary body axis of the animal that would require an increasing amount of tissue remodeling. Our results confirmed that regenerating head fragments typically undergo remodeling through regeneration without producing a second set of eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, animals that underwent particularly severe truncations to the body axis occasionally produced supernumerary eyes during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We hypothesized that this model would suggest that the site of eye regeneration might become distinct from the position of the pre-existing eyes during this type of regeneration. To test this, we examined the consequences of axis rescaling on the site of eye regeneration by resecting eyes from amputated head fragments in a timeseries after amputation. We fixed and stained these animals after 12 days of eye regeneration, and determined the relative location of the newly regenerated eye (<italic>opsin</italic>+ and <italic>tyrosinase+</italic> cells), using the location of the midline (marked by <italic>slit</italic> expression) and the uninjured contralateral eye as a reference. Surprisingly, resection at early times in remodeling (days 2 and 4) resulted in eye regeneration at an anteriorly displaced position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and these times correlate approximately with a time of dynamic alterations to patterning gene expression of <italic>zic-1, wnt2-1, ndl-2, ndl-3</italic> and <italic>wnP-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vásquez-Doorman and Petersen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vogg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>). Regeneration at an anterior position was dependent on complete eye removal rather than injury itself because partial resection of an eye during remodeling did not result in eye regeneration at a displaced location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>This displacement to the site of eye regeneration eventually decayed as head fragment regeneration proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), so we hypothesized that tissue remodeling might eventually realign these tissues with the target location of regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we measured the position of uninjured, pre-existing eyes versus resected, regenerating eyes with respect to the A/P axis of the brain in head fragments undergoing tissue remodeling through whole-body regeneration. Pre-existing eyes indeed gradually regained their proper position at a more anterior location with respect to the brain over several weeks of tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, gray). By contrast, eye removal during this process caused regeneration of a new eye located at the appropriate final position with respect to the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, red). Collectively, these results suggest that pre-existing tissue exerts an effect on the location of stem cell differentiation during normal tissue remodeling and can actually slow the processes by which regeneration restores proportionality, thus ensuring the maintenance of form during this transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our observations indicate that the location of regeneration can be altered by experimental perturbation of patterning factors or during the normal process of positional information rescaling after severe amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Both the eyes and the pharynx use progenitors that must migrate distantly from the position where they are specified to their final differentiated location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that these adult organs either can absorb progenitors that happen to encounter them or, more likely, use active trophic mechanisms for acquiring them. Our data argue that once an organ is formed, it can acquire progenitors to homeostatically maintain itself for long periods of time, perhaps indefinitely, even if it is not correctly placed with respect to patterning gene expression domains. These observations help to reconcile the fact that planarians generally regenerate perfectly, but that it is possible to recover rare variants with ‘mistakes’ in the process of asexual reproduction, including disorganized supernumerary eyes that are incapable of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakai et al., 2000</xref>). Given the requirement for progenitors in organ maintenance and the inability for mature eyes to produce their own progenitors, we suggest that homeostatic eye maintenance is likely only possible within the domain occupied by <italic>ovo+</italic> progenitors. These interpretations suggest that patterning factors have an important role in precisely specifying the site for initiation of organ formation through regeneration but do not necessarily specify the sites of growth. We suggest that the maintenance of form in the absence of injury therefore likely involves both the use of positional control genes and the ability of existing tissues to acquire nearby progenitors for maintenance.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33680.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Pattern alteration uncouples the sites of regeneration and homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model showing shifts to the anteroposterior target site of eye regeneration (yellow box) in animals undergoing <italic>notum</italic> RNAi or <italic>wnt11-6</italic> and <italic>fzd5/8-4</italic> RNAi.

However, this has generally not been observed for tissue remodeling in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>). Instead, severe truncations that require extensive remodeling generally cause a slow transformation toward normal form without intermediates involving duplicated tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan, 1898</xref>). The discovery that mispositioned organs can be homeostatically maintained provides a candidate model to help explain the process of tissue remodeling (sometimes called morphallaxis in planarians) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan, 1898</xref>). Early after severe axis truncations, patterning genes dynamically shift in order to restore positional information across the body axis. New domains of progenitor specification may be defined and perhaps be mostly restored in short timescales, but pre-existing progenitors and mature tissues remain. Waves of injury-induced cell death likely accelerate the turnover of pre-existing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>), but do not appear to fully eliminate them. The ability for mispositioned organs such as eyes and pharynx to acquire progenitors, combined with the relatively slow turnover of adult organs, would then result in a gradual realignment of the positional system with respect to mature tissue. A similar process could occur in remodeling of other tissues, such as the planarian brain, or through alternate mechanisms that await discovery. The maintenance of mature tissues even when in potential conflict with the positional system could play a vital role in proper integration of new and old tissue.</p><p>Adult regenerative abilities are widespread but unevenly distributed across animal species, so an enduring question has been how these capabilities are lost or gained through evolution and organismal development. While many strongly regenerative species also maintain their tissues through ongoing tissue homeostasis, many other species maintain their tissues homeostatically without possessing strong regenerative ability as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poss, 2010</xref>). The alteration of patterning information can be sufficient to trigger the formation of a new axis or to enhance regenerative ability in flatworm species that are refractory at head regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Umesono et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting constitutive patterning information is vital for regeneration. Our discovery that regeneration and homeostasis can be uncoupled in a highly regenerative organism suggests a potential model for how adult regenerative ability could be lost in development or evolution. Growth and homeostatic maintenance of tissues derived from nearby progenitors would not necessarily require ongoing patterning information after axis regionalization is defined in early development. After the completion of patterning, the signaling states that enable positional gene expression could therefore be lost without sacrificing the ability for tissues to grow, be maintained, or perhaps even heal simple wounds. Whole body regeneration could have been an ancient property, as it is shared among representatives of Radiata, planarians, and acoel flatworms, with increasing evidence for common and conserved specific regulatory programs within these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raz et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, these species retain patterning information constitutively during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raz et al., 2017</xref>), while other non-regenerative species still capable of substantial post-embryonic growth and tissue maintenance are not thought to maintain axis organization programs after embryogenesis. The loss of patterning information in adulthood therefore could account for losses of regenerative ability without the elimination of proliferation and growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian culture</title><p>Asexual Schmidtea mediterranea animals (CIW4 strain) were maintained in 1x Montjuic salts between 18–20°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bret J Pearson (Reviewer #2) and Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>By taking advantage of the eye duplication phenotype triggered by <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic>, Hill and Petersen examine mechanisms that coordinate organ patterning, homeostasis, and regeneration in planarians. The authors show that ectopic eyes contain correct cell types, project to the brain, and are also maintained homeostatically. However, if the original eyes are specifically removed, they fail to regenerate. Further, the authors show that ectopic eyes do not cause ectopic increases of eye progenitors, and existing eyes will compete for progenitor cells during homeostasis. Following analysis of duplicated anterior eyes, the authors used <italic>wnt11-6</italic> and <italic>fzd5/8-4</italic> RNAi conditions to shift ectopic eyes to appear posterior to the original eyes. In this case, similar to above, the original eyes will not regenerate. Additionally, the authors show similar properties to be displayed by ectopic pharynges.</p><p>This study is novel and imaginative. The experiments are well-designed, technically sound, and stainings and imaging are of high quality. The main finding is remarkable, and it is well supported by experiments using multiple morphogens and organ structures to document this effect.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before this manuscript can be considered further, the following concerns must be addressed:</p><p>1) Incorporation of progenitors: In both cases where BrdU staining is shown, the data is not convincing. Quantification over time, together with DAPI, should be included for BrdU staining to support the claim made by authors that both sets of photoreceptors are indeed maintained. As the fundamental drivers of homeostasis and regeneration, understanding the relative contributions of neoblasts to regenerating photoreceptors is a necessary component of the argument that the authors attempt to make here. Hence, quantitative assessment of the number of progenitors and the incorporation of progenitors into the two sets of eyes under the various conditions proposed (homeostasis <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> with eye scrape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> with eye scrape and neck wound (Bret), would go a long way in addressing this concern. This would involve BrdU and <italic>ovo</italic> labelling and tracking the number of progenitors as well as where they incorporate.</p><p>2) It is not clear how <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animals maintain 2 sets of eyes with the same number of <italic>ovo</italic> cells as a regular animal. Does that mean that both sets of eyes are smaller than the eyes of a wildtype animal? And how can it be that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the growth of the posterior eye while also regenerating an anterior eye (bottom panel) is increased compared to the contralateral eye – and that this is even to the same extent it seems as the increased growth of the anterior eye when the posterior eye is permanently eliminated (top panel). It seems that this would only be possible if the total number of <italic>ovo</italic> cells was also increased in the right side of the bottom panel, but it is thought that such eye resections don't elicit a missing tissue response. LoCascio et al. showed that eye scratch plus neck wounding will increase eye progenitors. In the background of <italic>notum</italic> RNAi, the authors should perform original-eye scratches with neck wounding to see whether this increase in eye progenitors would be enough to maintain the original eye. It would be helpful to further clarify this observation.</p><p>3) While the authors did a nice job with their ectopic posterior eye experiments, all reviewers would like to see a set of experiments done with <italic>nou-darake</italic> RNAi, which will generate ectopic eyes much further posterior to original eyes. It would be informative to see a condition where original and ectopic eyes can both be regenerated after a scratch. It would also help the model to show that if an eye field can be greatly removed, there is no interference between sets of eyes that are so close as in <italic>notum</italic> RNAi.</p><p>4) The authors claim that the photoreceptors are shifted posteriorly to positional control genes (PCGs). However, it also seems plausible that long-term RNAi of <italic>notum</italic> causes broad axial patterning changes and fundamentally alters progenitor behavior, since it still remains mysterious how these PCGs communicate with neoblasts to control regenerative potential. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the pre-existing eyes shift posteriorly, yet the number and domain of <italic>cintillo</italic>+ cells decreases, and the relative positioning of PRs to <italic>cintillo</italic>+ cells is changed significantly. This suggests pleiotropic changes in the animals that may influence progenitor behavior. The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which are done in wild-type animals, circumvent this issue, but the authors fail to merge it mechanistically beyond a correlation. Linking the function of patterning molecules with neoblast behavior during regeneration or homeostasis would be a valuable contribution.</p><p>5) The authors propose that after the initial stage of regeneration the rescaled body axes direct the morphallaxis – or more specifically, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the gradual repositioning of the pre-existing eye to the new position which is proportional to the size of the new body. Intuitively we know that this must be true, because if repositioning would not happen, the stereotypic body plan of a planarian would have been long lost. The question then however remains why this does not happen to the mis-positioned pre-existing eyes in <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> or any of the other conditions that cause a shift in the body axes. It seems from their data that other organs such as the brain do rescale to match the new positional information, so what is it about the eyes and the pharynx that makes them behave differently and create a new second structure in the correct anatomical position instead of just moving the old one? This is not due to the stronger role of morphallaxis during regeneration (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) versus homeostasis, because in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> authors show that the exact procedure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in a <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> animal leads to double eyes. Their data concerning the regeneration of the eye only in the new correct position is convincing, but this last piece of the puzzle seems to not fit entirely.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33680.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before this manuscript can be considered further, the following concerns must be addressed:</p><p>1) Incorporation of progenitors: In both cases where BrdU staining is shown, the data is not convincing.

A central claim of our work is that nonregenerative eyes produced from pattern alteration are homeostatically maintained, and we agree that the BrdU incorporations experiments are critical for this argument. In particular, in the first submission we had initially scored the eyes has either having or not having any BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells, so the reviewers raise a valid concern over whether the nonregenerative eyes are truly homeostatically maintained versus incorporating new eye cells only rarely and to a lower extent than regenerative eyes. We now include BrdU analysis of eye cell numbers in each eye over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We find that <italic>notum</italic> RNAi regenerative and nonregenerative eyes acquire approximately equal numbers of new eye cells, indicating homeostatic maintenance occurs as robustly in both types of eyes. We also find that <italic>notum</italic> RNAi does not alter numbers of <italic>ovo</italic>+ progenitor cells in uninjured animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or in animals responding to eye resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations further support the complementary evidence we give for the long-term maintenance of nonregenerative eyes by tracking them over an extended time (over 3x the time required for complete turnover) and finding that their persistence requires the eye differentiation factor <italic>ovo</italic>. Therefore, long-term persistence occurs in conjunction with new eye cell differentiation and requires eye cell differentiation, strongly supporting the model that they are actively homeostatically maintained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear how notum(RNAi) animals maintain 2 sets of eyes with the same number of ovo cells as a regular animal. Does that mean that both sets of eyes are smaller than the eyes of a wildtype animal?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for helping to clarify these results. First, while analyzing BrdU labeled uninjured animals, we found that the rate of eye cell incorporation is indeed about half for each of the four <italic>notum</italic> RNAi eyes compared to control RNAi eyes and that the total rates of eye cell production are similar between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Uninjured animals correspondingly have similar numbers of <italic>ovo</italic>+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We counted eye cells and found that, as the reviewers predicted, both sets of <italic>notum</italic> RNAi eyes are smaller than control eyes, but the total eye cell number is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And how can it be that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the growth of the posterior eye while also regenerating an anterior eye (bottom panel) is increased compared to the contralateral eye – and that this is even to the same extent it seems as the increased growth of the anterior eye when the posterior eye is permanently eliminated (top panel). It seems that this would only be possible if the total number of ovo cells was also increased in the right side of the bottom panel, but it is thought that such eye resections don't elicit a missing tissue response.</p></disp-quote><p>For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (formerly 4B), both eye removal treatments resulted in L/R eye size asymmetry. The graphs are scaled to show the effect (which is significant in each case), though the size of the effect is actually greater after removal of the nonregenerative posterior eye (causing reallocation of ~40 eye cells to the anterior photoreceptor) compared to removal of a regenerative eye (causing reallocation of ~10-20 cells to the posterior photoreceptor). Our interpretation of this difference in effect size is that the posterior eye cannot regenerate, resulting in an additional number of progenitors that can be re-allocated to the anterior eye. We suggest that an explanation for the behavior of the system after removal of the anterior eye is that while this eye is early in its regeneration process there is effectively no anterior eye for several days during which time the posterior eye can competitively acquire additional progenitors, though apparently not to the exclusion of the anterior eye’s regenerative ability. We now provide further experiments now showing that the overall numbers of eye cells and overall rates of eye cell differentiation are not altered by <italic>notum</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Furthermore, data from LoCascio 2017 argue strongly that small injuries to remove eyes do not further alter the global rates of eye differentiation. Therefore, our interpretation of the outcomes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are that eyes compete to acquire an existing pool of progenitors so this competitive landscape is modified by eye removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LoCascio et al. showed that eye scratch plus neck wounding will increase eye progenitors. In the background of notum RNAi, the authors should perform original-eye scratches with neck wounding to see whether this increase in eye progenitors would be enough to maintain the original eye. It would be helpful to further clarify this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We also tried this interesting suggestion to determine whether a nearby injury and its known ability to trigger production of extra eye progenitors would be enough to allow regeneration of the posterior <italic>notum</italic> RNAi eyes that are otherwise nonregenerative. We found that wedge amputations posterior to the eyes did not enable posterior eye regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and behaved identically to animals with no neck wounding. This is consistent with our other analysis showing that posterior eyes have access to eye progenitors for homeostatic maintenance (BrdU staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <italic>ovo</italic>+ cell distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that the lack of posterior eye regenerative ability is not likely due to insufficient eye progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors did a nice job with their ectopic posterior eye experiments, all reviewers would like to see a set of experiments done with nou-darake RNAi, which will generate ectopic eyes much further posterior to original eyes. It would be informative to see a condition where original and ectopic eyes can both be regenerated after a scratch. It would also help the model to show that if an eye field can be greatly removed, there is no interference between sets of eyes that are so close as in notum RNAi.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested eye regeneration in <italic>nou darake</italic> RNAi animals that form ectopic posterior eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). In <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> we have found that the brain expansion phenotype in these animals is highly penetrant whereas ectopic eyes occur at a lower penetrance (~50%) and appeared in the neck region. We performed resections on these animals using the same protocol we had used for <italic>notum</italic> RNAi and <italic>wnt11-6/fzd45-8</italic> RNAi and found that, surprisingly, pre-existing <italic>ndk(RNAi)</italic> eyes were capable of regeneration while ectopic <italic>ndk(RNAi)</italic> eyes did not appear capable of regeneration. This would seem to suggest that <italic>ndk</italic> and <italic>wnt11-6</italic> could act through distinct mechanisms to pattern the anterior and/or restrict brain/eye regionalization. One possibility is that <italic>ndk</italic> factors influence eye progenitor differentiation while <italic>wnt11-6</italic> influences the target location of regeneration. We feel that this is an interesting distinction that would merit further analysis in an independent study designed to study these two pathways but is less related to the goal of the current study in showing that homeostatic tissue maintenance can occur at a site distinct from regeneration. We include this data here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) to emphasize that modifying axis composition itself does not necessarily alter the site of regeneration.</p><p>To address the issue of eye regenerative ability in a context with eyes displaced at a greater distance, we also used longer-term <italic>notum</italic> RNAi and surgery to form 6-eyed animals in which two original eyes are more posterior than two sets of ectopic eyes. In this case, only the most anterior eyes were able to regenerate while the more distant posterior eyes were incapable of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>To address the issue of interference, we also conducted experiments in 4-eyed <italic>notum</italic> RNAi animals in which both anterior and posterior eyes were removed. Only the anterior eyes regenerate in this context, indicating the lack of posterior eye regeneration is not due to the presence of the anterior eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, top panels).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that the photoreceptors are shifted posteriorly to positional control genes (PCGs). However, it also seems plausible that long-term RNAi of notum causes broad axial patterning changes and fundamentally alters progenitor behavior, since it still remains mysterious how these PCGs communicate with neoblasts to control regenerative potential. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the pre-existing eyes shift posteriorly, yet the number and domain of cintillo+ cells decreases, and the relative positioning of PRs to cintillo+ cells is changed significantly. This suggests pleiotropic changes in the animals that may influence progenitor behavior. The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which are done in wild-type animals, circumvent this issue, but the authors fail to merge it mechanistically beyond a correlation. Linking the function of patterning molecules with neoblast behavior during regeneration or homeostasis would be a valuable contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that nonregenerative photoreceptors do indeed have abnormal locations with respect to anterior positional control gene expression domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Notum</italic> itself is a positional control gene and we agree that long-term <italic>notum</italic> RNAi produces changes to axis composition that are likely mediated by modulation of other Wnts acting as positional control genes. We showed previously that the <italic>notum</italic> RNAi ectopic eye phenotype is suppressed by co-inhibition of <italic>wnt11-6</italic>, as were effects of the brain size due to <italic>wnt11-6</italic> RNAi (Hill and Petersen, 2015), suggesting that these two factors oppositely pattern both aspects of the anterior. Our impression of the <italic>notum</italic> RNAi phenotype is that it seems to involve some anterior growth that includes brain tissue so that to an extent original eyes do not move posterior but rather became posteriorly shifted due to this broader anterior axis extension. Eyes always seem to track a particular location with respect to the planarian brain, but because there are no known phenotypes of brain absence but eye presence, there is not yet a way to fully clarify the dependencies of these two effects. We now describe in interpreting these experiments that it is possible that the brain size/position dictates the site of new eye cell regeneration or alternatively that a single process can control both properties (Results, sixth paragraph). It is an interesting suggestion that <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> modifies progenitor behavior. We do not see evidence of strong effects on eye progenitor numbers, distribution, or overall eye differentiation ability after <italic>notum</italic> RNAi. The question of how the positional control gene network interfaces with neoblast activities and the sites of regeneration is a very interesting topic that we hope to pursue in future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors propose that after the initial stage of regeneration the rescaled body axes direct the morphallaxis – or more specifically, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the gradual repositioning of the pre-existing eye to the new position which is proportional to the size of the new body. Intuitively we know that this must be true, because if repositioning would not happen, the stereotypic body plan of a planarian would have been long lost. The question then however remains why this does not happen to the mis-positioned pre-existing eyes in notum(RNAi) or any of the other conditions that cause a shift in the body axes. It seems from their data that other organs such as the brain do rescale to match the new positional information, so what is it about the eyes and the pharynx that makes them behave differently and create a new second structure in the correct anatomical position instead of just moving the old one? This is not due to the stronger role of morphallaxis during regeneration (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) versus homeostasis, because in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> authors show that the exact procedure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in a notum(RNAi) animal leads to double eyes. Their data concerning the regeneration of the eye only in the new correct position is convincing, but this last piece of the puzzle seems to not fit entirely.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the organs we have investigated so far scale with body size and so any regionalized tissues (such as the brain, eyes, pharynx) are subject to size and position control by morphallaxis/remodeling. In general these remodeling events have not been observed to generate duplicated tissue, as would be predicted in a model in which positional information is restored rapidly, followed by synthesis of correctly sized/positioned organs and degradation of old mispositioned organs. In the case of the eye, we only rarely observed this duplication in normal animals. A similar process could occur within the brain, but because this tissue is more spread out than an eye, it may be more difficult to observe. It is also possible that other organs will use different strategies for tissue remodeling, and we now mention both possibilities (Discussion, second paragraph). Alternatively, differences in rates of production or also in the ability for neoblasts and their progeny to respond to A/P positional information could account for these differences. Future discoveries of brain-specific progenitor cells and also their responsiveness to patterning gene signaling will be useful in clarifying these models. However, we feel that a compelling and potentially generalizable model from our analysis of the eye and pharynx is that the flexibility of tissue homeostasis with respect to position helps buffering against the short-term changes to positional information during remodeling. Though our model remains incomplete, our hope is that it will be a useful framework for future studies aiming to understand these aspects of whole-body regeneration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
