if the spindle becomes mispositioned, cells prevent exit from mitosis by inhibiting the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN is a signaling cascade that localizes to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and activates the phosphatase Cdc14. There are two competing models that explain MEN regulation by spindle position. In the 'zone model', exit from mitosis occurs when a MEN-bearing SPB enters the bud. The 'cMT-bud neck model' posits that cytoplasmic microtubule (cMT)-bud neck interactions prevent MEN activity. Here we find that 1) eliminating cMT– bud neck interactions does not trigger exit from mitosis and 2) loss of these interactions does not precede Cdc14 activation. Furthermore, using binucleate cells, we show that exit from mitosis occurs when one SPB enters the bud despite the presence of a mispositioned spindle. We conclude that exit from mitosis is triggered by a correctly positioned spindle rather than inhibited by improper spindle position.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14036.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14036.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14036.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells duplicate their genetic material and then separate the two copies before they divide. This is true for budding yeast cells, which divide in an unusual manner. New daughter cells grow as a bud on the side of a larger mother cell and are eventually pinched off. To make healthy daughter cells, yeast must share their chromosomes between the mother cell and the bud. This involves threading the chromosomes through a small opening called the bud neck, which connects the mother cell and the bud.</p><p>A surveillance mechanism in budding yeast monitors the placement of the molecular machine (called the spindle) that separates the chromosomes before a cell divides. This mechanism stops the cell from dividing if the spindle is not positioned correctly. Two models could explain how an incorrectly positioned spindle prevents budding yeast from dividing. The first model proposes that yeast cells do not divide if protein filaments (called microtubules) touch the bud neck. This only occurs if the spindle is not properly threaded into the bud through the small opening of the bud neck. The second model proposes that specific proteins required for cell division (which are found at the ends of the spindle) are inhibited while they are inside the mother cell. This means that the cell cannot divide until one end of its spindle moves out of the mother cell and into the bud.</p><p>Now, Falk et al. report the results of experiments that aimed to distinguish between these two models. First, a laser was used to cut the spindle filaments in live yeast cells. This stopped the filaments from touching the neck between the mother cell and the bud, but did not cause the cell to divide. Therefore, these results refute the first model. Next, Falk et al. generated yeast cells that had essentially been tricked into forming two separate spindles before they started to divide. As would be predicted by the second model, these cells could divide as long as an end from at least one of the spindles entered the bud.</p><p>These findings strongly suggest that the second model provides the best explanation for how yeast cells sense spindle position to control cell division. The findings also lend further support to previous work that showed that activators of cell division are found in the bud, while inhibitors of cell division are found in the mother cell. Finally, in a related study, Gryaznova, Caydasi et al. identify a protein at the ends of the spindle that acts like a regulatory hub to coordinate cell division with spindle position. Their findings also suggest that the surveillance mechanism is switched off in the bud to allow the cell to divide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14036.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14036.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spindle position checkpoint</kwd><kwd>mitotic exit network</kwd><kwd>Cdc14 early anaphase release network</kwd><kwd>CDC14</kwd><kwd>zone model</kwd><kwd>KIN4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD085866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM105755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lacefield</surname><given-names>Soni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 GM32238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Kerry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In yeast, exit from mitosis is triggered by the movement of one spindle pole body out of the mother cell into the bud, the future daughter cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asymmetric cell division is a common characteristic of development and is seen in diverse cell types ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts to mammalian oocytes. In order to produce viable progeny with distinct cell fates, asymmetrically dividing cells must coordinate nuclear position with the site of cytokinesis. When the spindle is mispositioned with respect to the cleavage plane, cell cycle progression is delayed until the spindle is correctly aligned. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, coupling exit from mitosis with spindle position is particularly important because the site of cytokinesis forms independently of mitotic spindle position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pruyne et al., 2004</xref>). Thus budding yeast has evolved mechanisms that align the spindle and that ensure that cytokinesis only occurs after the nucleus has been partitioned between the mother cell and bud, the future daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Budding yeast employs two redundant mechanisms to position the spindle along the mother – bud axis. The first positioning mechanism relies on the type V myosin motor Myo2. Myo2, together with its adaptor Kar9 and the plus-end microtubule binding protein Bim1, positions the pre-anaphase spindle at the bud neck by pulling cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) along actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kopecká and Gabriel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 1992</xref>). The second pathway is active during anaphase and requires the minus-end microtubule motor protein dynein, together with its associated coactivating complex dynactin. Dynein, when anchored to the cell cortex by Num1, aligns the spindle by essentially towing it along the cortex of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farkasovsky and Küntzel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muhua et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>). The consequences of eliminating either positioning pathway are minor but cells lacking both pathways are inviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>). Cells that fail to segregate the nucleus into the bud will arrest in late anaphase with the spindle mispositioned in the mother cell compartment. If the cell manages to correct this positioning defect and threads the nucleus through the bud neck into the bud, it will then disassemble the anaphase spindle and exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Yeast cells link spindle position and exit from mitosis through the regulation of the essential phosphatase Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Cdc14 functions to reverse mitotic cyclin-CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) activity by dephosphorylating cyclin-CDK targets as well as by targeting cyclins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zachariae et al., 1998</xref>). These Cdc14 functions cause exit from mitosis, the final cell cycle transition that encompasses disassembly of the mitotic spindle and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). Cdc14’s essential role in exit from mitosis requires that its activity is tightly regulated. Cdc14 is kept inactive from G1 to metaphase by its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1, which functions by sequestering the phosphatase in the nucleolus. It is only upon anaphase entry that Cdc14 is released from Cfi1/Net1 to spread throughout the cell where it antagonizes mitotic CDK activity and so returns the cell to G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Two pathways control the activity of Cdc14: the Cdc14 early anaphase release network (FEAR) and the mitotic exit network (MEN). The FEAR network serves to ensure anaphase spindle stability, spindle midzone assembly and proper rDNA segregation by transiently releasing Cdc14 from its inhibitor in the nucleolus during early anaphase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rock and Amon [2009]</xref>). While not essential, this brief release of Cdc14 serves to ensure proper anaphase timing and primes the cell to efficiently exit from mitosis. In contrast, the MEN is responsible for sustained Cdc14 release during later stages of anaphase and is essential for cells to exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1999</xref>).</p><p>The MEN is a GTPase signaling pathway whose constituents primarily localize to spindle pole bodies (SPBs; yeast centrosomes). Regulation of the GTPase Tem1 is central to MEN control. When Tem1 is in its GTP-bound state, the MEN is active and cells will exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scarfone and Piatti, 2015</xref>). Likewise when Tem1 is inactive, the MEN is off and cells will arrest in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirayama et al., 1994</xref>). Tem1 regulates a kinase cascade comprised of the PAK-like kinase Cdc15 and the protein kinase Dbf2. Tem1 activates Cdc15 by recruiting it to the spindle pole body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). Cdc15 in turn recruits Dbf2 to spindle poles by creating a phospho-peptide binding domain on the SPB component and MEN scaffold Nud1. In its phosphorylated state, Nud1 docks the Dbf2-activating subunit Mob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). Activated Dbf2-Mob1 together with Cdc5 then promote the sustained release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus through a largely uncharacterized mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manzoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mohl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Tem1 itself is controlled by two opposing factors, Bub2/Bfa1 and Lte1. Bub2/Bfa1 functions as a GTPase-activating protein complex (GAP) for Tem1 and so inhibits the MEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloecher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirayama et al., 1994</xref>). The GAP complex in turn is regulated by the protein kinase Kin4. Kin4 localizes to the mother cell cortex as well as the mother cell-localized SPBs and functions to maintain GAP activity by preventing the inactivation of Bub2/Bfa1 by the Polo kinase Cdc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Lte1 localizes to the bud cell compartment and promotes exit from mitosis by preventing Kin4 localization to SPBs in the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falk et al., 2011</xref>). Lte1 displays homology with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs); however, whether Lte1 also functions as a GEF for Tem1 remains unknown.</p><p>Spindle position regulates MEN activity. When the spindle is mispositioned, the MEN is inactive: Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus and cells arrest in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>). This regulatory mechanism that prevents exit from mitosis in response to spindle misposition is called the spindle position checkpoint (SPoC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muhua et al., 1998</xref>]). Two models have been proposed to explain how spindle position regulates MEN activity. The 'zone model' proposes that the cell is partitioned into a MEN inhibitory zone in the mother cell compartment and a MEN activating zone in the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Amon, 2010</xref>). The MEN inhibitor Kin4 localizes to the mother cell, the MEN activator Lte1 to the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). In the event that anaphase spindle elongation occurs only in the mother cell, the spindle poles (where Tem1 resides) cannot escape the negative regulation of Kin4 and the MEN is kept inactive. Inhibition of Tem1 is only relieved once the spindle realigns along the mother-bud axis and one spindle pole exits the Kin4 inhibitory zone. The bud compartment promotes Tem1 activation through redundant mechanisms: 1) the bud is largely devoid of Kin4 and 2) the Kin4 inhibitor Lte1 prevents any small amount of Kin4 present in the bud from localizing to the daughter SPB.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14036.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A system to induce spindle misposition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Zone model of exit from mitosis. Yeast cells are partitioned into two zones: a MEN inhibitory zone in the mother cell compartment (red) and a MEN activating zone in the bud cell compartment (green). If the spindle becomes misaligned in the inhibitory zone, MEN inhibitors such as Kin4 prevent Tem1 enrichment on SPBs thereby inhibiting exit from mitosis. It is only once one SPB escapes the MEN inhibitory zone and moves into the bud cell compartment that Tem1 can become enriched at the daughter-bound SPB and the cell can exit mitosis. Note that in this model, Tem1 is shown not to localize to SPBs in cells with mispositioned spindles. This is based on the observation that Tem1-13MYC does not localize to SPBs in cells with mispositioned spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Aquino et al., 2005</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) cMT - budneck model of exit from mitosis. If the spindle becomes misaligned in the mother compartment, cytoplasmic microtubules activate a checkpoint response through their interactions with factors at the bud neck.

The model was proposed based on studies showing that cytoplasmic microtubule loss from the bud neck precedes anaphase spindle disassembly and exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2009</xref>). Laser ablation of cytoplasmic microtubules interacting with the bud neck was further reported to trigger exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe several experimental approaches aimed at distinguishing between the zone model and the cMT - budneck model. These analyses refute the cMT - budneck model and support the zone model. In the first approach we conducted live cell imaging to investigate the relationship between the presence of cMTs in the neck and exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. As previously reported, we found that cMT loss from the bud neck does indeed precede exit from mitosis in cells that inappropriately breakdown their spindle in the mother cell compartment. However, our data show that loss of cMTs from the bud neck is not a cause but rather a consequence of exit from mitosis. We find, in cells wh exit from mitosis despite harboring a mispositioned spindle, that Cdc14 release from the nucleolus precedes rather than follows the disassembly of cytoplasmic microtubules and exit from mitosis. Second, we show that severing cytoplasmic microtubules does not lead to inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. Finally, we developed a method that allowed us to create cells containing two nuclei. We find that as long as one nucleus enters the bud during anaphase, cells will exit from mitosis, irrespective of whether the other nucleus is correctly or incorrectly positioned. Our data are inconsistent with a model where cMT-bud-neck interactions prevent exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. Instead, they support the conclusion that spatial regulation of the MEN is controlled through the delivery of a MEN component bearing SPB into the bud.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A system to monitor spindle misposition by live cell microscopy</title><p>Inactivation of either Kar9 or Dyn1 causes a fraction of cells to transiently misposition their spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The relatively low penetrance and transient nature of the spindle positioning defect of <italic>kar9Δ</italic> and <italic>dyn1Δ</italic> cells has impeded the investigation of the consequences of spindle misposition on cell cycle progression. To overcome this limitation we developed a system to conditionally inactivate both the Kar9 and Dyn1 spindle positioning pathways. We depleted Dyn1 using the Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; auxin) depletion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). IAA is a naturally occurring plant hormone that promotes the degradation of proteins containing an AID degron sequence by targeting them for ubiquitinylation by the SCF-Tir1 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teale et al., 2006</xref>). We generated a strain carrying a <italic>DYN1-AID</italic> fusion and a deletion of <italic>KAR9,</italic> henceforth the <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> strain. Live cell imaging showed that 92% of <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> cells initially mispositioned their spindles (i.e. had spindles greater than 2 μm in length in the mother cell compartment) upon IAA addition in contrast to 13% seen in the wild type controls. This finding indicated that the <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> system effectively inactivates spindle-positioning systems in the cell.</p><p>To characterize the effects of spindle mispositioning on exit from mitosis we compared anaphase duration of cells with correctly aligned spindles to those with mispositioned spindles. Wild-type cells with correctly aligned spindles underwent anaphase within 19.2 ± 4.8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). In contrast, <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> cells spent 65.9 ± 51.7 min in anaphase. This anaphase delay was highly variable. Most cells (85%) eventually were able to pull the mispositioned spindle into the bud (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> for an example), which was followed by exit from mitosis. Only 6% of cells arrested with a mispositioned spindle for the duration of the movie analysis (longer than 200 min, open squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The fact that the majority of <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> cells eventually managed to correctly align their spindles along the mother – bud axis suggests that cells harbor residual dynein activity, perhaps because the depletion is not complete. It is also possible that additional minor spindle positioning pathways exist in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirchenbauer and Liakopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although exit from mitosis was prevented in the majority of cells with mispositioned spindles, we observed inappropriate exit from mitosis in 9% of such cells, leading to the formation of anucleate and binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and I</xref>). This incomplete penetrance of the cell cycle arrest caused by spindle misposition has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). The reason why a small fraction of cells escapes the anaphase arrest caused by spindle misposition was, however, not understood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of cMT- bud neck contacts does not cause inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles</title><p>One hallmark of cells with mispositioned spindles is long cMTs that emanate from one or both SPBs through the bud neck and into the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; 100 min time point). In the small fraction of cells that escape the anaphase arrest caused by spindle misposition, inappropriate mitotic exit is preceded by retraction of cytoplasmic microtubules from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2009</xref>). Having established a tool to induce spindle misposition in many cells, we decided to reinvestigate this correlation.</p><p>As reported previously, we found that cells with mispositioned spindles frequently display cMTs that contact the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cells 1–30; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Also consistent with previous studies, we found that in cells that exit from mitosis despite harboring a mispositioned spindle, this cell cycle transition was preceded by the loss of cMT-bud neck interactions. Contact was lost approximately 2–8 min before spindle breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cells 31–37; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Additionally, we found a small number of cells that did not lose cMT-bud neck contact but entered the next cell cycle as assessed by budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cells 38–40; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). These cells also did not completely breakdown their spindle and did not complete cytokinesis. Importantly, our analysis also revealed that inappropriate mitotic exit was not an obligatory consequence of loss of cMT – bud neck interactions. The majority of cells with mispositioned spindles lacked cMT-bud neck contacts for significant periods of time yet stayed arrested in anaphase (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cells 1–30).

Each row shows the color-coded fate of one cell for the given time period, as well as whether it had a cMT in contact with the bud neck. cMT analysis was performed by assessing whether a cMT was present or absent from the bud neck. Cells in which the tip of a cMT interacted with the bud neck or where the cMT traversed the bud neck was categorized as 'cMT in bud neck' (grey boxes) Cells lacking any cMT in the bud neck are described as 'cMT absent from bud neck' (black boxes). Movement of one spindle pole into the bud is described as 'spindle pole movement into bud' (blue boxes). Inappropriate exit from anaphase was determined by the spindle morphology and is described as 'spindle breakdown' (red boxes). A second category of inappropriate exit from mitosis was scored based on whether the cell rebudded without spindle collapse or cytokinesis (yellow boxes). Due to the low frequency of inappropriate spindle breakdown in the mother compartment, this table shows all cells that inappropriately exit mitosis from 2 experiments (cells 31–40).

We conducted a similar analysis and found this not to be the case. We used a laser to ablate microtubules in cells either lacking both the <italic>KAR9</italic> and <italic>DYN1</italic> spindle positioning pathways or just the <italic>DYN1</italic> positioning pathway. We ablated the cMT that interacted with the bud neck in 15 <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> cells, but exit from mitosis was not observed in the mother cell compartment within the time that we monitored cells post severing (69 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also assessed exit from mitosis following laser ablation in these cells using a marker for cytokinesis. None of the 10 cells with mispositioned spindles in which we ablated the bud-neck interacting cMT exited mitosis as judged by loss of septin Cdc3 from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). To ensure that exposure of cells to the laser pulse did not cause cell cycle arrest, we targeted the cytoplasm of cells with correctly positioned spindles with the laser. In the 20 cells treated in this manner, exit from mitosis occurred within 2–24 min following application of the laser pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B; C</xref>, aligned category). Furthermore, when laser ablated cells with mispositioned spindles managed to realign their spindle, they also exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, spindle breakdown in the bud category). Lastly, we ablated cMTs in <italic>dyn1Δ</italic> cells. Exit from mitosis did not occur for the duration of the analysis (69 min) in cells with mispositioned spindles in which cMTs were ablated. One cell succeeded in positioning its spindle correctly along the mother – bud axis and promptly exited mitosis thereafter. In 2 cells exit from mitosis followed ablation of cMTs. One cell exited mitosis 8 min post ablation and the other cell exited mitosis 69 min post ablation. The latter instance seems unlikely to be the consequence of loss of cMTs from the budneck because the cell initially lacked cMTs in the budneck for at least 7 min but exited mitosis much later (69 min post-ablation). The one cell that exited mitosis shortly after cMT ablation is well in line with the fraction of wild-type cells that exit from mitosis despite harboring a misaligned spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In summary, our results show that ablation of cMTs does not promote exit from mitosis in the vast majority (33/35) of cells analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, mispositioned spindles category). We conclude that although cMT retraction frequently precedes inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with misaligned spindles, it is not the cause of exit from mitosis in these cells.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14036.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>cMT laser ablation does not promote exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Cells harboring the <italic>osTIR1 DYN-AID kar9Δ</italic> constructs that also expressed GFP-tagged α-tubulin, mCherry-tagged Cdc3 and an NLS-mCherry (A35143) were grown overnight to mid-log in YEPD at 25<bold>°</bold>C.

To begin to address this question we asked whether inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles relied on the same regulatory pathways that promote exit from mitosis in cells with correctly positioned spindles.</p><p>Cdc14 is the key trigger of exit from mitosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stegmeier and Amon [2004]</xref>). Cdc14 release from the nucleolus during anaphase activates the phosphatase to trigger exit from mitosis. We used Cdc14 localization as the criterion to determine whether cMT retraction from the bud neck occurred before or after exit from mitosis. To examine Cdc14 localization we used a Cdc14-tdTomato fusion. This allele is slightly hypermorphic (it causes inappropriate exit from mitosis in a small fraction of cells with mispositioned spindles after a substantial anaphase delay, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but nevertheless accurately reflects the changes in Cdc14 localization during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Live cell imaging showed that Cdc14 release from the nucleolus preceded both, cMT retraction from the bud neck and mitotic spindle breakdown in cells that exited mitosis despite harboring a misaligned spindle. In 78.22 ± 3.0% of cells (n ≥ 37 cells per biological replicate. 3 replicates were performed), Cdc14 release occurred approximately 5 min prior to loss of cMT – bud neck interactions and approximately 5–15 min prior to mitotic spindle breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The decrease in nucleolar Cdc14 signal intensity that occurred shortly prior to spindle breakdown was not caused by changes in nucleolar morphology that take place during anaphase.

As Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus and spreads throughout the nucleus and later the cytoplasm, the standard deviation of pixel intensities will decrease as cells progress through anaphase. We should note that despite intense efforts, we were not able to normalize changes in Cdc14-tdTomato CV to that of a protein that localizes to the nucleolus in a constitutive manner. GFP-tagged nucleolar markers overlapped with the Tubulin-GFP signal, a construct that was necessary to determine when cMTs retract. Tags other than GFP, such as BFP, were too dim to detect by live cell microscopy. Despite this limitation, it was nevertheless clear that the coefficient of variation of Cdc14-td Tomato pixel intensity decreased before cMT retraction from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Not all cells showed release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus prior to cMT retraction from the bud neck. In 10.8 ± 4.9% of cells Cdc14 release from the nucleolus occurred concomitantly with cMT retraction. In the remaining cells (11.0 ± 2.2%) that did not release Cdc14 prior to cMT retraction, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was not detected prior to anaphase spindle breakdown. This is most likely because the fraction of Cdc14 that was released from the nucleolus was too small to detect by imaging. Importantly, we never observed that Cdc14 release occurred after cMT retraction from the bud neck. Consistent with the idea that Cdc14 triggers inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles we find that depletion of Cdc14 suppressed exit from mitosis in the rare wild-type cells that escape the anaphase arrest when their spindles are mispositioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We conclude that inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles is not due to loss of cMT – bud neck interactions. Rather, cMT retraction is a consequence of Cdc14 release from the nucleolus in these cells. We further propose that the reason why loss of cMT – bud neck interactions always precedes mitotic spindle breakdown in cells with mispositioned spindles that exit from mitosis is because disassembly of a single cMT occurs more quickly than disassembly of the mitotic spindle.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14036.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Cdc14, the MEN and the FEAR Network prevents Spindle Breakdown in the mother cell compartment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic> osTIR1 dyn1-AID kar9Δ</italic> (A35707) and <italic>osTIR1 dyn1-AID kar9Δ cdc14-1-AID</italic> (A37895) cells harboring GFP-tagged α-tubulin were grown as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>.

The MEN is needed for the sustained release of the phosphatase during later stages of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). Our data showing that Cdc14 is inappropriately released in some cells with mispositioned spindles led us to investigate which pathway regulating Cdc14 was responsible for promoting inappropriate Cdc14 release in these cells. Not surprisingly, inhibition of the MEN, a pathway which is essential for exit from mitosis in all cells, suppressed the inappropriate mitotic exit that is observed in the 11% of cells that exit from mitosis when their spindle is mispositioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

First, cMT – bud neck interactions are not responsible for preventing Cdc14 activation and exit from mitosis in response to mispositioned spindles. Instead, activation of Cdc14 causes cMT retraction from the bud neck and exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles that inappropriately exit from mitosis. Second, Cdc14 activation in the cells that exit from mitosis despite harboring a mispositioned spindle depends on the FEAR network.

Furthermore the time of entry of one spindle into the bud until exit from mitosis was the same in cells in which both spindles aligned correctly and cells in which one spindle was correctly aligned and the other was misaligned (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> column 'bud entry to exit from mitosis').</p><p>Importantly, we were also able to obtain many heterokaryons where both anaphase spindles were mispositioned for prolonged periods of time (henceforth 'Class II delayed').

Strikingly, we also noticed that in a very small fraction of cells (1/51), exit from mitosis occurred even when the mispositioned spindle in the mother cell had not yet initiated anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

It is important to note however, that a spindle simply being in the bud is not sufficient to bring about exit from mitosis. Exit from mitosis only occurred after the bud-localized spindle had undergone anaphase.

Division by budding also means that the connection between mother cell and bud is small and the nucleus and other organelles must be squeezed through the bud neck to be accurately partitioned. Therefore division by budding not only requires sophisticated mechanisms to position the nucleus along the mother – bud axis, it also requires mechanisms to prevent cells from exiting mitosis and undergoing cytokinesis until the nuclei are partitioned between the mother and bud cell compartments. In 1995, Yeh et al. demonstrated the existence of such a mechanism. They showed that cells with mispositioned spindles arrest in late anaphase and fail to exit from mitosis. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muhua et al. (1998)</xref> termed this regulatory mechanism the spindle position checkpoint (SPoC). Ensuing studies showed that exit from mitosis is prevented in cells with misaligned spindles through the inhibition of the Mitotic Exit Network, the GTPase signaling cascade that promotes anaphase spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation and cytokinesis by activating Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Two models have been proposed to explain how MEN activity is inhibited in response to spindle misposition: the cMT - budneck model and the zone model. The former posits that a MEN inhibitory activity is generated by a misaligned spindle, the latter that a MEN activating activity is produced by a correctly aligned spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Amon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2009</xref>). In this paper we took advantage of a new inducible system to study mispositioned spindles to distinguish between these two models. Our data support the conclusion that a correctly aligned spindle promotes exit from mitosis. Our data, together with previous studies, further indicate that it is the movement of the MEN component-carrying SPB into the bud that signals exit from mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>cMT – bud neck interactions do not prevent mitotic exit</title><p>Cytoplasmic microtubules continuously interact with the bud neck during spindle positioning prior to anaphase. However, once the nucleus traverses the bud neck during anaphase these interactions are lost. In cells that misposition their spindles and undergo anaphase in the mother cell, cMT – bud neck interactions persist. The proposal that it is these cMT – bud neck interactions that prevent exit from mitosis in cells with misaligned spindles stems from the analysis of cells that exit mitosis despite harboring a misaligned spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Previous work by Adames and Cooper demonstrated that cMT retraction from the bud neck precedes mitotic spindle breakdown in cells that exit mitosis with a mispositioned spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>). This correlation led them to propose that cMT – bud neck interactions emit an inhibitory signal that prevents exit from mitosis. This hypothesis was supported by the observations that 1) elimination of cMT – bud neck interactions by microtubule ablation or 2) loss of cMTs brought about by the cold sensitive β-tubulin allele (<italic>tub2-401</italic>) increased the frequency with which cells with mispositioned spindles inappropriately exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We also observed this striking correlation between cMT retraction from the bud neck and mitotic spindle breakdown, but several additional analyses demonstrate that this correlation does not indicate causality. First, retraction of cMTs occurs frequently and often for extended periods of time also in cells with-mispositioned spindles that do not inappropriately exit mitosis in the mother cell compartment. Second, in our cMT ablation studies we did not observe exit from mitosis following the loss of cMT – bud neck interactions. We cannot explain why our ablation results differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al. (2009)</xref> but we note that mitotic exit that followed ablation of cMTs took a long time (approximately 18 min) in this previous study and regrowth of cMTs into the bud neck was also observed during the time it took until cells exited mitosis. Third, not all mutants that lack cytoplasmic microtubules exhibit an increased frequency in inappropriate exit from mitosis when the spindle is mispositioned. Gryaznova et al. (accompanying paper) found that cells lacking <italic>SPC72</italic> arrest in anaphase when their spindles are mispositioned despite the absence of cMTs.</p><p>The most conclusive demonstration that loss of cMT bud neck interactions does not trigger exit from mitosis was the analysis of Cdc14 localization. It clearly showed that cMT retraction from the bud neck did not precede Cdc14 release from the nucleolus but was a consequence thereof. We propose that the reason why cMTs invariably disassemble prior to the mitotic spindle in such cells is that disassembly of a single cMT upon mitotic CDK inactivation takes less time than the disassembly of a mitotic spindle that is composed of many microtubules. An inherently higher instability of cMTs compared to spindle microtubules could of course also explain this difference in disassembly timing. Together, our studies disfavor a mitotic exit inhibitory function of cMT – bud neck interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>MEN activating and inhibitory zones couple exit from mitosis to spindle position</title><p>MEN signaling takes place at SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). The GTPase Tem1 and Polo kinase recruit the MEN kinase Cdc15 to SPBs where it is activated by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>). Regulators of the GTPase are strategically placed in the cell. Kin4, the GTPase inhibitor localizes to the mother cell, the Kin4 inhibitor and hence MEN activator Lte1 localizes to the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). These localization patterns led us to propose that spindle position controls exit from mitosis through the establishment of a MEN activating compartment in the bud, a MEN inhibitory compartment in the mother cell and a sensor, the MEN component bearing SPB that shuttles between them. When both of the spindle pole bodies are in the MEN inhibitory mother cell compartment, the cell cannot exit from mitosis and arrests in anaphase. It is only once one MEN component-bearing spindle pole body moves into the mitotic exit-activating zone in the bud does the MEN become active and exit from mitosis occurs. It is important to emphasize that the zone model takes into account that not only are there MEN inhibiting factors in the mother cell compartment, but that there are also factors in the bud that promote exit from mitosis. Evidence that cells have both a negative zone in the mother cell compartment and a positive zone in the bud comes from the analysis of cells in which the MEN activating and inhibitory zones were switched. When the Kin4 inhibitor Lte1 is targeted to the mother cell, cells with mispositioned spindles inappropriately exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>). When Kin4 is targeted to the bud and its inhibitor Lte1 is inactivated, cells with correctly positioned spindles cannot exit from mitosis and arrest in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Amon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falk et al., 2011</xref>). The analysis of heterokaryons presented here also supports the zone model. Irrespective of whether or not a cell harbors a mispositioned spindle, exit from mitosis occurs once one anaphase spindle enters the bud. Our analysis of heterokaryons in which one of the two spindles gets pulled into the bud in its entirety further shows that it is the presence of a spindle pole in bud and not a correctly positioned spindle that leads to MEN activation. In cells that harbor one nucleus in the bud and one in the mother cell, both spindles are mispositioned, yet exit from mitosis occurs once the spindle in the bud has initiated anaphase. This finding further demonstrates that two signals are necessary for MEN activation in anaphase: (1) a spatial signal – the movement of a MEN bearing SPB into the bud and (2) a temporal signal that indicates that anaphase chromosome segregation has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Amon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manzoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>). Dissecting the molecular details of how these two signals interact to control Tem1 activity will be a critical next step in understanding how the MEN integrates spatial and temporal cues to control exit from mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Why is the anaphase arrest caused by a mispositioned spindle not absolute?</title><p>It has long been known that a small fraction of cells exit from mitosis despite the presence of a mispositioned spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). We show here that this event is preceded by the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Our data further indicate that this Cdc14 activation requires FEAR network function because inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles is completely prevented when FEAR network component encoding genes are deleted. FEAR network activity is under the control of the regulatory mechanisms governing the metaphase – anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>). At this cell cycle transition, a checkpoint known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inhibits entry into anaphase until all chromosomes have attached correctly to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musacchio and Salmon (2007)</xref>). Once this has occurred, the SAC inhibition of a protease known as Separase is alleviated and the protease initiates chromosome segregation by cleaving cohesins, the protein complexes that hold sister chromatids together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nasmyth, 2002</xref>). As Separase is also a component of the FEAR network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>), SAC activity also governs the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus during early anaphase.</p><p>It will be interesting to determine why there are cell-to-cell differences in Cdc14 release from the nucleolus when spindles are mispositioned. Metaphase duration could be a factor. Difficulties in mitotic spindle formation and correctly attaching chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, may lead to prolonged metaphase delays, during which FEAR network component levels could increase leading to a burst of FEAR network activity once the checkpoint is satisfied and cells enter anaphase. This could also explain why the cell cycle arrest following spindle misposition is especially leaky in the <italic>tub2-401</italic> mutant, in which the SAC is activated. It is also possible that mitotic CDK activity, which inhibits FEAR network-mediated Cdc14 release from the nucleolus varies between individual cells. Especially high levels of activity could cause a more sustained FEAR-network-dependent release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus causing inappropriate exit from mitosis in some cells with mispositioned spindles.</p><p>Irrespective of where this variability originates from, the fact that the cell cycle arrest is not absolute in cells with mispositioned spindles is interesting. One interpretation of this observation is that FEAR network activity exhibits cell-to-cell variability with biologically meaningful consequences. It is also possible that defects in the spindle positioning pathways also subtly affect spindle position control of the MEN in some cells but not others. However, we consider this latter possibility less likely because such a scenario predicts that the few cells with mispositioned spindles that exit mitosis inappropriately do so only after a very long arrest. This is not the case.</p><p>The observation that spindle position control of the MEN and hence mitotic exit is not complete also raises the question of whether the leakiness of the arrest serves a biological function. Is it possible that under conditions where spindle misposition occurs at higher frequency (i.e. in the cold) that a not universally permanent cell cycle arrest provides an advantage? Could binucleation and hence polyploidization provide a reservoir of cells with increased adaptability? Further investigation is needed to better understand the molecular basis and importance of these cell-to-cell differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Is the spindle position checkpoint a checkpoint?</title><p>Classically, checkpoint pathways are defined as surveillance mechanisms that monitor the proceedings of a (cell cycle) event and prevent the next one from occurring until the preceding event is completed or defects therein have been corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>). That is, an inhibitory signal prevents cells from progressing to the next cell cycle stage if the preceding cell cycle stage is still ongoing or stalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao and Johnson, 1970</xref>). Our data show that an activating signal in the bud can override any mitotic exit inhibiting signal that may emanate from a mispositioned spindle. These data argue against a checkpoint model in the classical sense to explain the anaphase arrest in response to spindle misposition. Instead they support a model where both spatially constrained positive and negative regulatory signals control the activity of a signal transduction pathway.</p><p>Checkpoint regulation has been described for other asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connell and Wang, 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells with mispositioned centrosomes, cell cycle progression is delayed until the centrosomes properly align with respect to the mother-daughter axis of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the AMP-related kinase family member Par-1 (of which Kin4 is also a member) has been shown to be important in delaying cell cycle progression in response to mispositioned spindles in male germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pereira and Yamashita, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Given these recent findings it is tempting to speculate that a mechanism similar to the one described for spatial control of the MEN by nuclear position, rather than a checkpoint mechanism, also operates in these stem cells. The analysis of cells with multiple centrosomes analogous to what has been described here could address this question.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast Strains are derivatives of W303 (A2587) and are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of comments:</p><p>This is an informative and interesting study that addresses the mechanism by which mitotic exit is controlled by the spindle orientation checkpoint in budding yeast. The study interrogates two models that have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which the successful orientation of the spindle along the mother daughter axis to support passage of one nucleus into the daughter cell triggers mitotic exit. In the first model, the association of microtubules with the bud neck region restrains mitotic exit arose. In the second, it is the physical presence of an SPB/nucleus in the bud that triggers exit. The first model was suggested following the observation of an apparent correlation between the time at which cytoplasmic microtubules lost their association with the neck region and the dissolution of the spindle (taken as a marker of mitotic exit). These former studies had been based on observations of rare events within a large population of Kar9 and Dyn1 deficient cells. In the current study the authors combine the use of the Kanemaki auxin degron system to greatly enrich for this rare category of cells within the population with more appropriate markers of mitotic exit; Cdc14 exit from the nucleolus and the departure of the septin Cdc3 from the bud neck region. The comprehensive, focused, data set that is presented reveals no correlation between the timing of the loss of microtubule association with the bud neck and mitotic exit. Rather, ingenious heterokaryon and return to cycle from meiosis experiments support the zonal model in which it is the presence of one nucleus in the bud that promotes mitotic exit. The manuscript also addresses the question of the &quot;leakiness&quot; of the SPOC arrest. As the abolition of the FEAR network abolishes this leakiness, the authors propose that high levels of FEAR activity enable some cells in the population to escape SPOC arrest to propagate as heterokaryons.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the study provides a clear cut answer to two conflicting models that were proposed in the past, and that it is conducted to a high standard and support the conclusions drawn.</p><p>The reviewers raised several minor concerns that should be taken care of prior to publication as following.</p><p>1) The statement in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction that components of the FEAR network are not essential is not technically correct, as the FEAR includes Esp1 and Cdc5.</p><p>2) The Cdc14-tdTomato construct used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is a reason of concern. The authors state that it is slightly hypermorphic without showing the data. Yet, they claim that it accurately reflects the cell cycle changes in Cdc14 localization. Both claims should be documented by data, which could be provided as a supplemental figure. As a matter of fact, a large fraction of Cdc14-tdTomato seems to remain in the nucleolus throughout the cell cycle, which is not what the lab has shown before. Furthermore, in the Lu and Cross paper where Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was quantitatively measured using the coefficient of variation, fluorescence intensities were normalized over Net1 signal, which is constant in the nucleolus and was not used here as reference.</p><p>3) The conclusion that &quot;cMT retraction from the bud neck is a hallmark of cells with misaligned spindles that inappropriately exit mitosis&quot; contradicts the argument that &quot;the majority of cells with mispositioned spindles lacked cMT-bud neck contacts for significant periods of time yet stayed arrested in anaphase&quot;.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, in the left cell with a mispositioned spindle, Tem1 is depicted as two yellow dots that seem to float in the cytoplasm. Work from other groups, including one of the present authors, has shown that in cells with mispositioned spindles Tem1 is symmetrically localized at SPBs (Pereira et al., 2000; Molk et al., 2004; Pereira and Caydasi, 2009). Thus, the cartoon should be modified accordingly.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right cell, cMTs should be shown to be interacting with the bud neck, since this is the signal that is supposed to inhibit mitotic exit according to the alternative model.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “A system to monitor spindle misposition by live cell microscopy”, it is mentioned that the existence of minor spindle positioning pathways could explain the ability of <italic>DYN1-AID kar9Δ</italic> cells to eventually re-position the spindle. Indeed, an auxiliary spindle positioning process independent of Kar9 and dynein has been recently described (Kirchenbauer and Liakopoulos, 2013, MBoC 24: 1434) and could be cited here.</p><p>7) The requirement of the FEAR pathway for the unscheduled mitotic exit of cells in the presence of mispositioned spindles has been published last year by another group (Scarfone et al., 2015, PloS Gen. 11: e1004938). This work should be quoted here.</p><p>8) The authors focus on a minor population of cells: those that exit mitosis despite having mispositioned spindle. They state that why this happens remain unclear. Although the data provided in the manuscript is convincing on their own, I have a concern (though minor) that the interpretation relies on low frequency events for which cause remains unknown. Why do those cells exit mitosis inappropriately? Are <italic>dyn1/kar9</italic> mutant cells also defective in SPOC to some extent (for whatever unknown reasons)?

The authors state that it is slightly hypermorphic without showing the data. Yet, they claim that it accurately reflects the cell cycle changes in Cdc14 localization. Both claims should be documented by data, which could be provided as a supplemental figure. As a matter of fact, a large fraction of Cdc14-tdTomato seems to remain in the nucleolus throughout the cell cycle, which is not what the lab has shown before. Furthermore, in the Lu and Cross paper where Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was quantitatively measured using the coefficient of variation, fluorescence intensities were normalized over Net1 signal, which is constant in the nucleolus and was not used here as reference.</italic> </p><p>We now provide an in depth characterization of the Cdc14-tdTomato construct. We determined the fraction of cells with mispositioned spindles that exit mitosis when harboring this construct. This analysis, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, shows that approximately 25% of Cdc14-tdTomato cells with mispositioned spindles exit mitosis inappropriately, indicating that the allele is hypermorphic.</p><p>To carefully compare the kinetics of Cdc14-tdTomato release from the nucleolus with that of the non-hypermorphic Cdc14-3HA allele that we used in previous studies, we analyzed the timing of Cdc14 release of from the nucleolus as a function of spindle length. This analysis, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, shows that both fusion proteins are released from the nucleolus with almost identical kinetics during anaphase.</p><p>We also provide additional data to demonstrate that the release of Cdc14-tdTomato from the nucleolus in cells with mispositioned spindles is not simply due to changes in nucleolar morphology. As suggested, we compared the localization of a nucleolar marker (we used Cfi1-GFP) with the localization of Cdc14-tdTomato in cells also harboring a tubulin-GFP fusion. As shown in the montage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>, Cdc14 nucleolar intensity decreases during anaphase before cMTs retract from the bud neck, but Cfi1 nucleolar intensity remains unchanged.</p><p>We attempted normalize the CV of the Cdc14-tdTomato intensity to that of Cfi1-GFP but this quantification was not successful because the Cfi1-GFP signal overlapped with that of the tubulin-GFP signal. We next attempted to perform this normalization using a Cfi1-BFP but this fusion was not detectable in live-cell imaging. Lastly, we tried to quantify the Cfi1-GFP signal in cells were only the (+) ends of microtubules were marked with a Bim1-GFP fusion. However, in this set up we were not able to reliably identify cytoplasmic microtubules because the Bim1-GFP signal was too dim. This prevented us from determining when cMTs retract from the bud neck. Because of these complications we are only able to show a qualitative comparison of the Cdc14-tdTomato and Cfi1-GFP signal. The reasons of why we were not able to perform this normalization are also mentioned in the text.</p><p><italic>3) The conclusion that &quot;cMT retraction from the bud neck is a hallmark of cells with misaligned spindles that inappropriately exit mitosis&quot; contradicts the argument that &quot;the majority of cells with mispositioned spindles lacked cMT-bud neck contacts for significant periods of time yet stayed arrested in anaphase&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Fixed.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, in the left cell with a mispositioned spindle, Tem1 is depicted as two yellow dots that seem to float in the cytoplasm. Work from other groups, including one of the present authors, has shown that in cells with mispositioned spindles Tem1 is symmetrically localized at SPBs (Pereira et al., 2000; Molk et al., 2004; Pereira and Caydasi, 2009). Thus, the cartoon should be modified accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We previously showed that Tem1-13MYC, a non-hypermorphic tagged <italic>TEM1</italic> allele, is very rarely detected on SPBs in cells with mispositioned spindles (D'Aquino, et al., 2005). It is our experience that GFP fusions tend to have a higher affinity to SPBs and so caution is warranted when analyzing these constructs. We further found that a Tem1-eGFP fusion is hypermorphic (Chan and Amon, 2009). Together, these observations lead us to believe that the localization of the Tem1-13MYC fusion likely reflects the true localization of Tem1 in cells with mispositioned spindles, that is off the SPBs. We have explained this in the figure legend but kept the figure as is.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right cell, cMTs should be shown to be interacting with the bud neck, since this is the signal that is supposed to inhibit mitotic exit according to the alternative model.</italic> </p><p>To eliminate redundancies in the paper we removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “A system to monitor spindle misposition by live cell microscopy”, it is mentioned that the existence of minor spindle positioning pathways could explain the ability of DYN1-AID kar9Δ cells to eventually re-position the spindle. Indeed, an auxiliary spindle positioning process independent of Kar9 and dynein has been recently described (Kirchenbauer and Liakopoulos, 2013, MBoC 24: 1434) and could be cited here.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for pointing this out and done.</p><p><italic>7) The requirement of the FEAR pathway for the unscheduled mitotic exit of cells in the presence of mispositioned spindles has been published last year by another group (Scarfone et al., 2015, PloS Gen. 11: e1004938). This work should be quoted here.</italic> </p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>8) The authors focus on a minor population of cells: those that exit mitosis despite having mispositioned spindle. They state that why this happens remain unclear. Although the data provided in the manuscript is convincing on their own, I have a concern (though minor) that the interpretation relies on low frequency events for which cause remains unknown. Why do those cells exit mitosis inappropriately? Are dyn1/kar9 mutant cells also defective in SPOC to some extent (for whatever unknown reasons)? I understand that dyn1/kar9 that eventually exit mitosis with correct spindle position don't provide insights into the question being asked in this manuscript, but I think a caution is required to use low frequency events (of unknown cause) to build logic, and I'd suggest adding an explanation about this in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting possibility that we should have considered in the Discussion. The reviewer is correct that we cannot exclude the possibility that the two spindle positioning systems play a minor role in preventing exit from mitosis in the event of spindle misposition. We have added text considering this possibility to the Discussion. However, we should add that if this were the case one would predict that the few cells with mispositioned spindles that exit mitosis inappropriately do so only after a very long arrest. This is however not always true, which would argue against this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
