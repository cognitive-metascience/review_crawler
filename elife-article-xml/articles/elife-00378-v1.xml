Little is known about how cell fate diversification is linked to synaptic target choices. Here we investigate how presynaptic neurons select one type of muscles, vm2, as a synaptic target and form synapses on its dendritic spine-like muscle arms. We found that the Notch-Delta pathway was required to distinguish target from non-target muscles. APX-1/Delta acts in surrounding cells including the non-target vm1 to activate LIN-12/Notch in the target vm2. LIN-12 functions cell-autonomously to up-regulate the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 in vm2, which in turn function together to promote muscle arm formation and guidance. Ectopic expression of UNC-40/DCC in non-target vm1 muscle is sufficient to induce muscle arm extension from these cells. Therefore, the LIN-12/Notch signaling specifies target selection by selectively up-regulating guidance molecules and forming muscle arms in target cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of the nervous system involves the formation of complex networks of connections between diverse cell types, such as motor neurons, interneurons and pyramidal cells. However, the mechanisms by which individual cells are programmed to acquire particular identities, and how they are instructed to form connections with other specific cells, remain unclear.</p><p>In many species, the Notch signaling pathway has a role in setting up these networks. Notch is a transmembrane protein, which means that it has one component inside the cell and another outside. When a ligand binds to the extracellular part of Notch, this causes the receptor to break in two. The intracellular domain then travels to the nucleus where it can influence gene expression.</p><p>The nematode worm (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), which has two Notch receptors, is often used to study the formation of neuronal networks because each worm has only around 300 neurons, and they are connected in roughly the same way in each worm. <italic>C. elegans</italic> relies on two types of cell that are very similar to each other—type-1 and type-2 vulval muscle cells—to lay eggs, and the neurons that trigger egg-laying form synaptic connections on specialized structures called muscle arms. However, these structures are found only in type-2 vulval muscle.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of the egg-laying circuit, Li et al. screened large numbers of mutant worms to find animals that lacked muscle arms. They identified a number of such mutants, which laid fewer eggs compared to wild-type worms, and found that they all had mutations in genes that encode for proteins or ligands that are involved in the LIN-12/Notch pathway. This pathway mediates cell–cell interactions that help to specify cell fates.</p><p>Li et al. showed that type-2 vulval muscle cells develop muscle arms when their neighbors—type-1 vulval muscle cells and vulval epithelial cells—produce enough ligand to activate the LIN-12 Notch receptor on the type-2 vulval muscle cells. They also identified two of the downstream targets of LIN-12, and found that artificially expressing one of these in type-1 vulval muscle cells is sufficient to trigger the formation of muscle arms.</p><p>The work of Li et al. provides further evidence that the Notch signalling pathway, which is well known for its role in early development, also acts at later developmental stages to determine cell fate and patterns of connectivity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Notch/LIN-12</kwd><kwd>postsynaptic development</kwd><kwd>UNC-40/DCC</kwd><kwd>muscle arm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>POST4990016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koelle</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yale Liver Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK34989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koelle</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Notch signaling pathway has a central role in the formation of the circuit that controls egg-laying in the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional neural circuits are generated through coordinated events during the development of the nervous system including cell type specification, neuronal process formation and synaptogenesis. Many studies have demonstrated that stereotyped wiring exists between different cell types. Insights from studies in spinal cord and neocortex development strongly suggest that a combinatorial code of transcription factors mediates cell specification and defines cellular identities among different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jessell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>). An emerging literature indicates that precise synaptic connections are specified by diverse molecular mechanisms. Both positive and negative regulators of synapse formation can specify local synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maeder and Shen, 2011</xref>). Homotypic and heterotypic adhesion molecules can determine the synaptic lamina formation and even synaptic partner choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamagata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Wit et al., 2011</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, many transmembrane molecules, including semaphorin, capricious and teneurins, have been suggested to guide synaptic target selection between olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) and projection neurons (PN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Komiyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hong et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>). In vertebrate spinal cord, a semaphorin-plexin pathway regulates the connection specificity in the sensory motor circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009</xref>). In vertebrate retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form synapses with retinal interneurons in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), generating several synaptic laminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>). This laminar specificity is directed by both the homophilic interactions of several immunoglobin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, including Sidekicks and Dscam, as well as the inhibitory action of semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matsuoka et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the heterophilic interaction of two IgSF proteins, SYG-1 and SYG-2, guides the localization of the en passant synapse formation of HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). Another IgSF protein UNC-40/DCC, the receptor of UNC-6/Netrin, has been shown to regulate axon guidance toward ventral UNC-6 as well as locally promote presynaptic assembly in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> interneuron AIY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colon-Ramos et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, UNC-40 plays critical roles in the formation of dendritic spine-like postsynaptic muscle arms of the body wall muscles in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon and Roy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, this function appears to be independent of UNC-6.</p><p>While it is likely that transcription factors ultimately regulate the expression of cell surface molecules to determine the target specificity, few examples are well characterized. In one such example, the even-skipped transcription factor impacts long-range axon guidance choices through regulating a Netrin receptor, UNC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Labrador et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is largely unknown how cell fate decisions affect local synaptic development and target choices.</p><p>One of the conserved developmental pathways to generate cellular diversity is through the lateral signaling system involving the Notch receptor and its ligands. Through contact-dependent, reciprocal feedback loops, Notch and its ligand Delta can generate different cell fates among identical neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greenwald, 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans, lin-12</italic> encodes one of the two homologs of Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenwald, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wharton et al., 1985</xref>). Extensive literature showed that <italic>lin-12</italic> is required for at least two cell fate decisions: the AC/VU decision and the vulval precursor cell (VPC) specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greenwald, 2005</xref>). In both cases, <italic>lin-12</italic> and its ligands, including <italic>lag-2</italic>, <italic>apx-1</italic> and <italic>dsl-1</italic>, are required to specify alternative cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seydoux and Greenwald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilkinson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shaye and Greenwald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Greenwald, 2004</xref>). Notch signaling has also been implicated in the development of the nervous system. For example, the mammalian Notch 1 protein is asymmetrically inherited by one daughter cell of an active cortical progenitor during mitosis, which inhibits the neural differentiation but allows this daughter to retain the progenitor fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ishibashi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of nuclear Notch in many post-mitotic neurons is also striking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sestan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redmond et al., 2000</xref>), prompting the speculation that Notch signaling might also be important for terminally differentiated neurons. Besides functioning in mature nervous system to regulate synaptic specificity in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Bivort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberi et al., 2011</xref>), Notch has also been found to act in the post-mitotic neurons in multiple developmental contexts. Both the canonical Notch pathway and a cytosolic pathway have been shown to play important roles in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giniger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song and Giniger, 2011</xref>). In the cytoplasmic pathway, Notch functions by regulating the activity of abl, enable and Rac GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giniger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song and Giniger, 2011</xref>). Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate that activation of Notch signaling lead to promotion or sometimes inhibition of axonal growth. In cultured primary <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, Notch is localized in developing axons and growth cones and interacts with an axonal abl tyrosine kinase to promote axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giniger, 1998</xref>). An opposite example is the dorsal cluster neurons (DCN) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hassan et al., 2000</xref>). Reduction of Notch activity results in overbranching of DCN axons. Interestingly, the overbranching phenotype cannot be rescued by expressing wild-type Notch in DCN, indicating its non-autonomous requirement. Similarly, dendritic branching is also sensitive to the level of Notch signaling. Several observations indicate a Notch-mediated, contact-dependent inhibition of dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berezovska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sestan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redmond et al., 2000</xref>). In mammalian brain, significant nuclear localization of Notch 1 was observed in differentiated neurons. Perturbation of Notch 1 activity leads to increased dendritic length and decreased number of branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redmond et al., 2000</xref>). Other in vitro studies further indicated that the intercellular receptor–ligand interaction and the canonical Notch signaling pathway are required for the Notch-dependent dendritic branching inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berezovska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sestan et al., 1999</xref>). It is generally assumed that the canonical pathway regulates post-mitotic phenotypes by controlling the expression of guidance molecules. However, the molecular targets of this pathway have not been identified.</p><p>With the well-described cell lineage and the stereotyped connectivity between neurons, the nervous system of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides an opportunity to study the molecular links between cell fate specification and relevant synaptic target selection. In the egg-laying circuit, the presynaptic neurons, HSNs and VC4/5, form synapses exclusively with type 2 vulval muscles (vm2) but not type 1 vulval muscles (vm1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White et al., 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These synapses are not formed on the cell bodies of the muscles but instead onto the dendritic spine-like postsynaptic membrane protrusions called muscle arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Koelle, 2012</xref>). The HSN presynaptic development occurs before vm2 muscle arm formation and is independent of vulval muscles. Instead, surrounding guidepost cells instruct local HSN presynapse formation with heterophilic interaction of SYG-1 and SYG-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). SYG-2 is expressed in the primary epithelial cells and recruits HSN-expressed SYG-1 to the future presynaptic domain. The development of postsynaptic specializations on the vulval muscles has not been studied. Both the vm1 and vm2 muscle cells are generated from a pair of sex myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foehr and Liu, 2008</xref>). While the lineage, cell morphology and positions of both muscle types are very similar, only vm2 cells, not the vm1 cells, generate muscle arms and serve as the direct postsynaptic target of the HSN and VC neurons. vm1 is connected to vm2 through gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White et al., 1986</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00378.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The muscle arms of type 2 vulval muscles (vm2) are missing in <italic>lin-12(wy750), apx-1(wy755)</italic> and <italic>sel-12(wy760)</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An illustration showing ventral (top) and lateral (bottom) views of <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit. vm1 (orange) and vm2 (red) are vulval muscles.

We found that postsynaptic muscle arm development in egg-laying circuit is mediated by LIN-12/Notch-dependent cell specification. The canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway is specifically activated in the target vm2 cells by the ligand APX-1/DSL expressed in two adjacent cell types, the secondary vulval epithelial cells and the non-target vm1 cells. <italic>lin-12</italic> functions cell-autonomously to up-regulate the activity of the guidance molecules UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2, which in turn generates and guides the development of vm2 postsynaptic muscle arms. The ectopic expression of UNC-40 in vm1 cells that normally do not form muscle arms is sufficient to induce the extension of muscle arm-like membrane structures from vm1, suggesting a deterministic role of LIN-12/Notch and UNC-40/DCC in postsynaptic target selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of postsynaptic muscle arms of type 2 vulval muscles</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying circuit consists four type 1 vulval muscle cells (vm1) and four type 2 vulval muscle cells (vm2), which form two X-shaped structures near the vulval opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While vm1 and vm2 are from a common lineage, are physically adjacent and share many molecular components, the egg-laying motoneurons HSN and VC4/5 form serotoninergic and cholinergic chemical synapses exclusively on vm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duerr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). vm1 is mainly controlled by vm2 via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White et al., 1986</xref>). Besides forming major synaptic connection on HSN and VC4/5, vm2 also receive some additional synapses with the ventral nerve cord (Personal communication with Michael Koelle, November 2012). To understand how vm2 is differentiated as the postsynaptic target and specifies the synaptic specializations, we first developed tools to visualize the egg-laying synapses. We fused presynaptic protein RAB-3 with mCherry (<italic>mCherry::rab-3</italic>) to label presynaptic vesicles in HSN or VC neurons, receptively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumeister et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lickteig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>). On the postsynaptic side, we expressed <italic>ser-1b::gfp</italic> or <italic>unc-103e::gfp</italic>, a GFP tagged serotonin receptor or a voltage-gated potassium channel, in both vm1 and vm2 to visualize the postsynaptic specializations as well as the muscle cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Consistent with EM reconstruction, we found that the HSN presynaptic specializations were closely juxtaposed against the dendritic spine-like membrane protrusions (muscle arms) from the vm2 cell bodies when viewed from both the lateral and ventral sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The muscle arms always extend from stereotyped subcellular locations, medially towards the center of the vulva. The muscle arms from the anterior and posterior vm2 cells often contact each other and form a ‘bridge-like’ structure that is best visualized from the ventral view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, top row). Similar apposition was also observed between VC4/5 presynaptic specializations and the vm2 muscle arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While high level of UNC-103E::GFP expression labels both the muscle arms and the vm cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), low level of transgenic expression of UNC-103E::GFP with an integrated single-copy transgene showed that UNC-103E was dramatically enriched on vm2 muscle arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, middle), indicating that the muscle arms represent functional postsynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Koelle, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>vm2 postsynaptic development requires vulval epithelial cells</title><p>Because most egg-laying synapses are formed onto the vm2 muscle arms, we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the vm2 muscle arm formation to gain insight into the postsynaptic development and synaptic target selection. Developmental studies showed that HSN axon guidance and presynaptic formation preceded both axon growth of VC neurons and vulval muscle differentiation (data not shown). We therefore asked whether the HSN neurons are required for vm2 specification and muscle arm development by examining the vm2 morphology in the <italic>egl-1(n986)</italic> mutant, in which the HSN neurons undergo programmed cell death in embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conradt and Horvitz, 1998</xref>). Surprisingly, in all of the examined animals, the morphology and position of vm2 muscle arms were indistinguishable from the wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Several results further suggested that neither HSN nor VC neurons contributed to the vm2 muscle arm position. First, in a portion of the <italic>egl-1(n986);lin-39(n709)</italic> double mutant animals which lacked both HSN and VC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1993</xref>), the vm2 muscle arms still existed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Second, in <italic>unc-104(e1265)</italic> mutant animals, in which the synaptic vesicles were absent from the presynaptic regions in both HSN and VC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>), vm2 muscle arm development was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, the single-copy insertion of the transgene UNC-103E::GFP potassium channel which specifically labels the vm2 muscle arms, as well as the artificial membrane marker mCD8::mCherry that delineates the entire outline of vulval muscles, was also completely absent in the muscle arm areas, suggestive of a complete loss of the muscle arm structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We considered the possibility that the absence of muscle arms in vm2 could be due to the change of vm2 cell fate to a different cell. We therefore examined several cell-type-specific markers for each differentiation stage: the <italic>hlh-8::gfp</italic> that is specifically expressed in undifferentiated cells of M lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harfe et al., 1998b</xref>) and an <italic>egl-15::gfp</italic> reporter which is exclusively expressed in vm1 cells in egg-laying system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harfe et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang and Stern, 2004</xref>). We also examined <italic>rgs-2::gfp</italic> that labeled uterine muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutants, all three markers exhibits wild type pattern, suggesting that many molecular signatures of the M lineage are intact in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutants, while the development of the postsynaptic specializations completely fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C,E,F</xref>). Furthermore, since both vm2 and vm1 adopt complex cell morphology and stereotyped positions, we reasoned that the morphology and position of these muscles must reflect the execution of cell-specific developmental programs. We therefore quantitatively analyzed the morphology and relative position of vm1 and vm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In both wild type and <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant, the position where vm1 is linked to the body wall is always on the dorsal side of the connection between vm2 and body wall. No significant difference was found on the intersection angle between the vulval muscle and the vulval slit, as well as the relative size of vm2 to vm1 (S<sub>vm2</sub>/S<sub>vm1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Three <italic>apx-1</italic> mutant alleles independently identified from the screen also contain missense mutations in the extracellular domain.

Together, these data suggest that partial loss of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity spares vulval morphogenesis but specifically impairs vm2 specification and muscle arm development, and that muscle arm development might require a higher level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity compared with earlier developmental events (see ‘Discussion’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LIN-12 functions at the L4 stage to specify vm2 postsynaptic identity and muscle arm development</title><p>To further distinguish whether LIN-12/Notch signaling is directly involved in the vm2 muscle arm development or indirectly affects vm2 development due to its role in vulval morphogenesis, we investigated the spatial and temporal requirements of <italic>lin-12</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies suggest a late requirement for <italic>lin-12</italic> activity to allow proper egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaram and Greenwald, 1993</xref>).

Based on the cell-autonomous function of <italic>lin-12</italic> in vm2, we made two predictions. First, the ligand(s) of LIN-12 should be localized in the surrounding cells that directly contact vm2 to activate LIN-12/Notch pathway. Second, downstream components of LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway should also function in vm2 cells to regulate vm2 specification and muscle arm development. APX-1/Dsl is a good candidate as the relevant ligand because <italic>apx-1(wy755)</italic>, but not other known LIN-12 ligand mutants including <italic>dsl-1</italic> and <italic>lag-2</italic>, showed the muscle arm phenotype similar to that of <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and data not shown). A <italic>lin-12(wy750); apx-1(wy755)</italic> double mutant did not show an enhanced muscle arm defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) or more severe egg-laying phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), further suggesting that <italic>apx-1</italic> and <italic>lin-12</italic> function in the same pathway. To further understand where <italic>apx-1</italic> functioned, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>apx-1</italic> with an integrated transgenic expression construct (Personal communication with Iva Greenwald, June 2012). We observed the expression of <italic>apx-1</italic> in both secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 muscle cells during the L4 stage, when LIN-12/Notch signaling was activated to promote vm2 muscle arm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Both secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 cells contact vm2 muscle cells from early L4 stage when vulval muscles are generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, data not shown, and personal communication with Kelly Liu, July 2012). In fact, we observed that the vm2 muscle arms consistently tracked the cell junctions between the primary and secondary vulval epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and data not shown). To further understand the cellular requirement of <italic>apx-1</italic>, we created two constructs in which the <italic>apx-1</italic> cDNA was cloned after two different promoters.

Together, these results strongly support the model that APX-1 expressed in the secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 cells activates the canonical LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2 to promote the formation of the postsynaptic muscle arms. The specific activation of the LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2 but not in vm1 thus appears to dictate the choice of the synaptic target.</p><p>We next investigated the mechanism by which <italic>apx-1</italic> activated LIN-12/Notch signaling in vm2. A reciprocal inhibition mechanism as well as a lateral signaling inducing the differentiation of a Notch cell and a Delta cell, mediates the AC/VU decision and VPC specification, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sternberg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seydoux and Greenwald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilkinson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sundaram, 2004</xref>). We wondered whether a similar mechanism is also used in specifying vm2 identity and regulating the muscle arm development. We first examined the <italic>lin-12</italic> expression pattern in an <italic>apx-1(wy755)</italic> mutant.

On the other hand, we did not observe any change of <italic>apx-1</italic> expression in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

More recently, MADD-2, a C1-TRIM protein encoding a homolog of human MID1, was shown to directly bind and function together with UNC-40 to regulate body wall muscle arm extension as well as axon branching and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore examined the vm2 muscle arms in these two mutants. Interestingly, both <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> and <italic>madd-2(ok2226)</italic> null mutants showed specific vulval muscle arm defects with largely normal vulval muscle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). A significant proportion of the mutant animals completely lacked the vm2 muscle arms, while some other animals showed abnormal muscle arms that extended from incorrect positions or flimsy muscle arms that were thinner and dimmer than the wild-type muscle arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

The transcriptional reporters only contain the promoter regions and report the transcriptional activity. In wild-type animals, both UNC-40 and MADD-2 translational reporters were preferentially expressed in vm2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

However, only vm2 receives synaptic connections from the egg-laying neurons HSN and VC4/5. Based on the data presented above, we speculated that the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway elevates the level of UNC-40 and MADD-2 in vm2, which in turn are directly involved in generating muscle arms. To test the sufficiency of UNC-40 and MADD-2 in conferring postsynaptic specificity, we created transgenic animals that expressed UNC-40 ectopically in the vm1 cells. We found that misexpression of UNC-40 was sufficient to induce the dendritic spine-like membrane extensions from vm1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To circumvent the occasional silencing of the UNC-40 transgene, we achieved UNC-40 expression in vm1 by single-copy insertion and observed the similar ectopic muscle arm-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the ectopic membrane extension from vm1 was usually thinner than the wild-type vm2 muscle arm, the vm1 muscle arms always formed from the medial surface of vm1, the identical location as for the normal vm2 muscle arms, suggesting that UNC-40 responds to specific environmental cues to guide the formation of muscle arms.</p><p>Similar ectopic expression of <italic>madd-2</italic> in vm1 was not able to induce muscle arm formation (data not shown), hinting that the activity of <italic>unc-40</italic> in vm1 might be required. Since both <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>madd-2</italic> mutants showed muscle arm phenotypes, we investigated whether they functioned in the same or parallel pathways. We generated an <italic>unc-40(n324); madd-2(ok2226)</italic> double mutant and found slightly enhanced muscle arm defects in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also found that the overexpression of <italic>madd-2</italic> partially rescued the muscle arm defects of <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of <italic>unc-40</italic> largely rescued the muscle arm defects of <italic>madd-2(ok2226)</italic> mutant, suggesting that <italic>madd-2</italic> likely functioned synergistically with <italic>unc-40</italic> to promote muscle arm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Expression of <italic>madd-2</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> is not mutually regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), consistent to the hypothesis that <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>madd-2</italic> at least partly function in parallel. We conclude that the postsynaptic development and synaptic target selection in the egg-laying circuit are mediated by the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway. The secondary vulval epithelial cells and non-target vm1 cells express APX-1/Dsl, which activates its receptor LIN-12/Notch in the vm2 synaptic target cells. The LIN-12/Notch pathway promotes the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2, which cooperates with each other to generate postsynaptic muscle arms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cell type specification likely plays critical roles in synaptic target selection.

In addition, the mutants lacking vm2 muscle arms show significant defects in the synchronized activation of vm2 and egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating the necessity of the vm2 muscle arm for the integrated functional synapse. Therefore, the ability to form muscle arms during development dictates the choice of vm2, but not its sister cell vm1, to become the postsynaptic partner of the egg-laying motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling is required for postsynaptic muscle arm formation at late developmental stage</title><p>It has been generally accepted that LIN-12/Notch signaling is involved in multiple cell specification processes.

Using a temperature sensitive allele, we showed that disruption of <italic>lin-12</italic> activity at a very late developmental stage caused vm2 muscle arm defects along with egg-laying defects. We never observed the loss or alternation of vulval muscles in these new weak alleles by examining several cell-type-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C,E,F</xref>), indicating that the function of LIN-12/Notch signaling in specifying the sex myoblasts, the sex muscle precursor cells, is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foehr and Liu, 2008</xref>). This developmental timing matches the relatively late window of vulval muscle specification and muscle arm formation. Furthermore, activation of LIN-12/Notch signaling in vm2 is necessary and sufficient to rescue the vm2 muscle arm development, indicating that LIN-12/Notch signaling is directly required in vm2. These results suggest a novel role of LIN-12/Notch signaling in regulating vm2 postsynaptic muscle arm formation and target selection. Therefore, we conclude that LIN-12/Notch signal instructs both vulval organogenesis and synaptic development of the egg-laying circuit by regulating at least three sequential but independent developmental processes: the AC/VU decision, in which LIN-12/Notch signaling promotes the differentiation of AC and VU cells; VPC specification, in which it determines the vulval precursor cell fates; and vm2 postsynaptic specification, in which it specifies the postsynaptic target cell and further regulates the muscle arm development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>High activity of LIN-12/Notch signaling may be required to regulate postsynaptic development</title><p>While <italic>lin-12</italic>, <italic>apx-1</italic> and <italic>sel-12</italic> null alleles show severe vulval morphogenesis and general vulval muscle morphology phenotypes, all the partial loss-of-function alleles isolated from our screen have specific muscle arm phenotype without other defects. Hence, the muscle arm phenotype shown in <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant is not likely the consequence of a complete cell-fate conversion. Even in the muscle lineage, several cell-type specific reporters displayed wild type patterns in <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), supporting the notion that many aspects of the vm2 differentiation remain intact while only a subset of genes that determines specific postsynaptic development are affected. We can envision two hypotheses to explain the specificity of these alleles. First, vm2 muscle arm development requires a high level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity, while vulval morphogenesis and overall muscle development require low activity of LIN-12. The new alleles represent partial loss-of-function mutants that specifically disrupt muscle arm development. Alternatively, LIN-12 could execute two different downstream pathways, one required for vulval morphogenesis and the other required for muscle arm development. Since the lesions in almost all the new alleles are point mutations, they might specifically disable the muscle arm development pathway.</p><p>We favor the first dosage hypothesis for several reasons. First, the new mutations in <italic>lin-12</italic> and <italic>apx-1</italic> were found in the extracellular domains, but not in the signal transducing cytosolic domain of LIN-12. In addition, a nonsense mutation in <italic>sel-12(wy756, W184stop)</italic> caused strong vulval phenotypes, while a missense mutation in <italic>sel-12(wy760, G373D)</italic> showed specific vm2 muscle arm phenotype, further arguing for the difference in the dosage requirement for these developmental events. Along the same line, a <italic>lag-1</italic> dominant negative construct expressed in the vulval muscles led to muscle arm defects, suggesting that the same canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling pathways is required for the muscle arm development. Second, the <italic>lin-12(e2621)</italic> allele, showed muscle arm defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) with intact vulval morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). Sequencing of the <italic>lin-12</italic> locus of this mutant revealed a 541-bp deletion in the promoter region with no mutation in the coding sequence. The deleted sequence in the promoter region contains two LAG-1 consensus binding sites and therefore is likely to disrupt the positive feedback loop, which could in turn reduce the level of LIN-12/Notch signaling. In fact, the expression of the <italic>hlh-29</italic> transcription reporter was down-regulated in <italic>lin-12(e2621)</italic> (data not shown). Together, these data strongly argue that vulval morphogenesis requires a low level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activation, while vm2 postsynaptic specification requires a relatively high level of LIN-12/Notch activity. Consistent with this model, <italic>mir-61::gfp</italic>, another transcription reporter expressed in VPCs during its specification process, does not change in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the alternation of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity in <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> has little or no effect in VPC specification.</p><p>The function of LIN-12 in the AC/VU decision is a case of classic lateral inhibition. A small initial difference in LIN-12/Notch activity between two adjacent cells is amplified by reciprocal feedback mechanisms. The enhanced difference of LIN-12/Notch activity eventually leads to alternative cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seydoux and Greenwald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilkinson et al., 1994</xref>). However, in vm2 muscle arm development, the <italic>lin-12</italic> expression is down-regulated in the <italic>apx-1(wy755)</italic> mutant, while the <italic>apx-1</italic> expression does not change in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant.

Given the fact that <italic>lin-12</italic> is expressed and cell-autonomously required in the postsynaptic target cell vm2, and that the activity of canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway is involved, we speculate that the putative guidance receptors could be the downstream target genes of the canonical LIN-12/Notch pathway. While the canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling has been demonstrated to function in axon guidance and dendrite morphogenesis in fly and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berezovska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2007</xref>), its transcriptional targets remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giniger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>UNC-40/DCC is a good candidate of the putative guidance receptor. <italic>unc-40/DCC</italic> encodes a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of UNC-6/Netrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</xref>).

More recently, UNC-40, together with its cytoplasmic activator MADD-2, was shown to regulate body wall muscle arm extension and axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morikawa et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we found that <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>madd-2</italic> loss-of-function mutants showed vm2 muscle arm defects, similar to the phenotype found in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutants. Both UNC-40 and MADD-2 are expressed in the postsynaptic vm2 cells but show little or no expression in the non-target vm1 cells. Cell-autonomous rescue of UNC-40 and MADD-2 in the vm2 cells further supports the notion that these two proteins function in vm2 to direct muscle arm development. Interestingly, the expression of the translational reporters for both genes in vm2 is dramatically down-regulated in <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant, suggesting that both genes function downstream of LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway.</p><p>Consistent to the previous studies in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> body wall muscle arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon and Roy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>), we did not observe muscle arm defects in <italic>unc-6</italic> mutants (data not shown), suggesting the existence of a novel ligand of UNC-40 that functions in guiding the muscle arm extension. The putative ligand provided by vulval epithelial cells could be either a short-range cue that is associated on membrane or locally secreted, or a globally diffusive cue. We favor the former prediction based on the observation that the relative distance between the vulval muscles and the vulval opening is crucial. SM migration is affected in <italic>egl-15(n484)</italic> mutant, which causes posteriorly displaced vulval muscles descended from an SM that stops prematurely during the migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Goodman et al., 2003</xref>). Different phenotypes were observed, which appeared to correlate with the location of the vulval muscles. The muscle arms that were located far away from the vulva displayed severe morphogenesis defects, whereas when the vulval muscles did not reach but were still closed to the correct places, we observed muscle arms growing with longer shafts to reach the correct locations defined by HSN presynaptic regions (data not shown). These observations suggest that vulval epithelial cells might provide a membrane-associated or locally secreted cue to guide the vm2 muscle arm extension.</p><p>Our additional experiments showed that both <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>madd-2</italic> are regulated by LIN-12/Notch signaling at the level of gene transcription. The transcription of <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>madd-2</italic> are both specifically activated in vm2 and dependent on <italic>lin-12</italic>, indicating that they could be the direct transcriptional targets of LIN-12/Notch signaling.

Consistent to the previous observations, a <italic>madd-2</italic> null allele showed quantitatively less dramatic defects in vm2 muscle arm extension than did <italic>unc-40</italic> or <italic>lin-12</italic> mutants. In addition, we observed only marginally significant enhancement of these muscle arm defects in an <italic>unc-40; madd-2</italic> double mutant. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>unc-40</italic> significantly rescued the vm2 extension phenotype in <italic>madd-2</italic> mutant, while the expression of <italic>madd-2</italic> only showed slight rescue of the <italic>unc-40</italic> mutant.

Although many in vitro studies suggest that direct interactions between pre- and postsynaptic cells trigger the mutual differentiation processes leading to synaptogenesis, our experiments revealed a significantly different picture. First, the formation of pre- and postsynaptic specializations can occur at different times. The HSN presynaptic specializations form at the early L4 stage, significantly before the maturation of the postsynaptic targets. The extension of the postsynaptic muscle arms takes place 5–6 hr later. Second, the development of the pre- and postsynaptic specializations appears to be independent of each other. Eliminating the postsynaptic cells does not affect the timing and location of synaptic vesicle accumulation in HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>). Similarly, ablation of the presynaptic neurons has no obvious effect on the timing and direction of the muscle arm growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Third, pre- and postsynaptic differentiations are guided by two different but related guidepost cells. Through genetic analysis, we previously found that the primary vulval epithelial cells serve as guidepost cells for the HSN presynaptic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). These primary cells express a transmembrane IgSF protein SYG-2, which clusters and activates a related molecule, SYG-1 on the HSN axon. The intercellular interaction between SYG-1 and SYG-2 defines the location of HSN synapses and initiates the presynaptic formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, postsynaptic differentiation is likely guided by the secondary vulval epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). APX-1/DSL expressed in the secondary vulval epithelial cells and the non-target vm1 cells activates the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway in the vm2 cells. Subsequently, UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 are up-regulated leading to the selective muscle arm formation in vm2. The muscle arms appear to grow along the interface between the primary and the secondary vulval epithelial cells through possibly an UNC-40-dependent mechanism, which ensures that the pre- and postsynaptic compartments will contact each other. The epithelial cells not only function as the channel for egg-laying but also play organizational roles for the development of the entire vulval organ, coordinating multiple events including vulval muscle migration, axon guidance of HSN, VC axon branching and synapse formation. Our discoveries reveal that many of the principles of synaptic organization in vivo might involve cells other than the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Worms were maintained at 20°C on OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plates.

Single worms aged 24 hr after the L4 stage were picked with a small amount of OP50 bacteria to an unseeded NGM plate. From this plate, a ∼20 × 20-mm chunk was placed worms-side down onto a 24 × 60 mm #1 coverslip and overlaid with a 22 × 22 mm #1 coverslip. The worms were allowed to recover for 1–2 hr in a humidified chamber at 20°C before imaging. Two-channel confocal slices (18-µm-thick, 256 × 256 pixel, 16-bit) were collected for 6 min at 20 Hz through a 20× Plan-Apochromat objective (0.8NA) using the LIVE detector of an inverted Zeiss 710 Duo confocal microscope. The stage and focus were adjusted manually to keep the egg-laying system in view and focused during recording periods. Ratiometric analysis was performed in Volocity (version 5.4; Perkin Elmer). Briefly, separate GCaMP3/mCherry ratio and intensity-modulated ratio channels were calculated. Voxels with mCherry fluorescence intensities 2 standard deviations above background were selected as objects for measurement (typically ∼500 voxels per time point). The average ratio of these voxels were smoothened using a 150 ms (three time points) rolling average, and the lowest 10% of the GCaMP3/mCherry ratio values were averaged to establish a ΔR/R (change in GCaMP3/mCherry fluorescence ratio/absolute ratio) baseline. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were identified by visual inspection of intensity-modulated ratio movies and ratio traces, and ΔR/R peaks above 15% were analyzed. Transients were classified as single when the transient was evidently confined to the anterior or posterior vulval muscle and double when both anterior and posterior muscles had obvious transients. Double transients that resolved to a single peak in the ratiometric trace were defined as having no delay (0 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). When two or more transients within a single body bend were separable both spatially and temporally in the intensity-modulated ratio movies and had independent peaks separated by Δ250 ms in the ratiometric trace, the delay between the anterior and posterior peaks was determined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the international <italic>C. elegans</italic> Gene Knockout Consortium, the National Bioresourse Project (Japan), and the laboratories of P Roy, C Johnson, and K Liu for strains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revision.</p><p>1. The major concern of all three reviewers centers on the interpretation of the muscle arm phenotype as a defect in synapse specificity. The data do not address a “synaptic function” of Notch in this system (as, for example, in the studies of Alberi et al. or de Bivort et al.). However, the data do document an interesting muscle differentiation program that precedes postsynaptic differentiation and the participation of the muscle cell in synapse development through muscle arm formation. An appropriate interpretation should focus on the muscle arm phenotype, the developmental program for muscle arm formation controlled by Notch, and the involvement of these processes in synapse development. However, the concept of synapse specificity, highlighted in the title and throughout the text, is an interpretation that is not directly addressed by the data. The text and title should be substantially revised to address this issue.</p><p>2. There was discussion among the reviewers regarding whether the absence of Notch signaling in vm2 partially switches fate or has a more selective disruption of the muscle arm growth program. The analysis of more fate markers and a more detailed description of morphological features of the vm2 muscle (e.g., the positioning of its attachment sites) in <italic>lin-12</italic> mutants could clarify this issue. In any case, this needs to be more directly addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00378.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

However, the concept of synapse specificity, highlighted in the title and throughout the text, is an interpretation that is not directly addressed by the data. The text and title should be substantially revised to address this issue</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our data do not address the role of the Notch in synaptic function, similar to the reports by Alberi et al. and de Bivort et al. In those two studies, the authors documented the function of the Notch pathway in synaptic plasticity in the mature nervous system. In our manuscript, we are studying the role of Notch during the development of the neural circuit.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that we are studying a “muscle differentiation program that precedes postsynaptic differentiation and the participation of the muscle cell in synapse development through muscle arm formation”. We have made changes in the title and throughout the text to more precisely reflect the specific function in muscle arm development.</p><p>However, we do feel that our data strongly indicate that the Notch-mediated muscle arm formation is a critical determinant of target specificity in the egg-laying circuit. We started the project with a forward genetic screen on a marker that labeled the postsynaptic specializations on the muscle arms. In the partial loss-of-function mutant alleles of the Notch pathway that we isolated in this synaptic morphology screen, many aspects of the muscle differentiation remain intact, suggesting that high level of the Notch signaling activity is specifically required for the postsynaptic development. In other words, the vm2 cells absolutely require high level of Notch signaling to become the postsynaptic target of the presynaptic HSN neurons.</p><p>The next question is how LIN-12 affects muscle arm target selection. We found that LIN-12 activity is only found in vm2 but not vm1. Furthermore, LIN-12 acts cell-autonomously to activate the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 in vm2. These two molecules in turn are required for vm2 muscle arm formation and targeting. Most importantly, to demonstrate that the LIN-12/Notch-controlled molecular program is directly involved in target selection during neural circuit assembly, we showed that UNC-40 is sufficient to induce muscle arm-like membrane protrusions when misexpressed in vm1. Taken together, these data suggest that the high-level activity of LIN-12 distinguishes vm2 from vm1 in the process of forming muscle arms and becoming the postsynaptic targets in the egg-laying circuit.</p><p><italic>2. There was discussion among the reviewers regarding whether the absence of Notch signaling in vm2 partially switches fate or has a more selective disruption of the muscle arm growth program. The analysis of more fate markers and a more detailed description of morphological features of the vm2 muscle (e.g., the positioning of its attachment sites) in lin-12 mutants could clarify this issue. In any case, this needs to be more directly addressed in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestions. We have performed several additional experiments. In the revised manuscript, besides the vm1 specific marker <italic>egl-15::gfp</italic> (Figure 1–figure supplement 4C), we have included analyses of two additional cell-type specific markers (<italic>hlh-8::gfp</italic> and <italic>rgs-2::gfp)</italic> (Figure 1– figure supplement 4E and 4F). <italic>hlh-8::gfp</italic> labels the M lineage, which include vm1, vm2, and the uterine muscles. This marker is only present in differentiating muscles and is absent in mature muscles. <italic>rgs-2::gfp</italic> is a specific marker for the uterine muscle. In the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant animals, the expression of <italic>hlh-8::gfp</italic> is found in all three classes of muscles only during L3-L4, indistinguishable from the wild type controls. Similarly, in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant animals, the expression of <italic>rgs-2::gfp</italic> is found only in the uterine muscles, indistinguishable from the wild type controls. Together, we have examined three differentiation markers for the vm2 and related muscle lineage. We found no obvious gross cell fate changes in the <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> mutant. We want to remind the reviewers that this <italic>lin-12</italic> allele is a partial loss-of-function allele, which showed no vulval morphogenesis phenotypes (another cell fate phenotype). We think the lack of cell fate phenotype is likely due to the remaining LIN-12/Notch activity in this strain.</p><p>We have also followed the reviewers' suggestion and characterized the morphology of the vulval muscles quantitatively. The results are now presented in Figure 1–figure supplements 5 and 6. We show that the general vulval muscle morphology is not affected in <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> and <italic>unc-40(n324)</italic> mutants, further supporting the notion that the phenotype of <italic>lin-12(wy750)</italic> is restricted on the muscle arm structure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
