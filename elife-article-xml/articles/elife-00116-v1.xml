Little is known about the interaction between individual myofilaments and membrane-bound actin filaments. Here we reconstituted a minimal actin cortex to directly visualize the action of individual myofilaments on membrane-bound actin filaments using TIRF microscopy. We show that synthetic myofilaments fragment and compact membrane-bound actin while processively moving along actin filaments. We propose a mechanism by which tension builds up between the ends of myofilaments, resulting in compressive stress exerted to single actin filaments, causing their buckling and breakage. Modeling of this mechanism revealed that sufficient force (∼20 pN) can be generated by single myofilaments to buckle and break actin filaments. This mechanism of filament fragmentation and compaction may contribute to actin turnover and cortex reorganization during cytokinesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00116.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00116.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Actin is a multi-functional protein that is found in almost all eukaryotic cells. When polymerized, it forms robust filaments that participate in a variety of cellular processes. For example, actin filaments are involved in the contraction of muscles, and they are also a major component in the various structures that maintain and control the shape of cells as they move and divide. These structures include the cell cortex, a meshwork of actin filaments that is bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane by anchor proteins. However, both the cell cortex and the plasma membrane must undergo dramatic changes when a cell divides, and the forces that drive these changes are generated by another protein, myosin II.</p><p>Myosin II contains three domains: a head domain, also known as the motor domain, that binds to actin; a neck domain; and a tail domain. Like actin, myosin II proteins also form filaments, but these myofilaments have a distinctive structure: the tail domains of two Myosin II proteins join together, with the motor domains being found at both ends of the filament. When activated, the motor domains grab actin filaments and pull against them in a ‘powerstroke’. However, the details of the interactions between the myofilament motor domains and the actin filaments in the cell cortex, which are bound to the plasma membrane, are not fully understood.</p><p>Studying these processes in living cells is extremely challenging, so Vogel et al. have built an in vitro model of the cell cortex, and then used single-molecule imaging to watch the interactions between the myofilaments and the actin filaments in this model. They show that the myofilaments move along the actin in the cortex, breaking up the filaments and compressing them in the process. They propose that tension builds up between the ends of the myofilaments, leading to compressive stress being exerted on the actin filaments. Computer simulations confirm that the forces generated are high enough to cause the actin filaments to buckle and break. The in vitro model developed by Vogel et al. should allow researchers to clarify the basic biophysical principles that underpin the structure and function of the cell cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00116.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00116.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Myosin</kwd><kwd>Actin</kwd><kwd>Actin Cortex</kwd><kwd>Myofilament</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd><kwd>Membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz-Program of the DFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHW716/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Petrasek</surname><given-names>Zdenek</given-names></name><name><surname>Heinemann</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Daimler und Benz foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32-09/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Heinemann</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of single-molecule imaging and an in vitro model of the cell cortex has allowed the interactions between actin filaments and filaments made of myosin II to be studied in detail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cortex consists of a thin actin meshwork bound to the inner cytosolic face of the plasma membrane by various anchor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morone et al., 2006</xref>).

Myosin II in the actin cortex functions as assemblies of motor proteins forming anti-parallely arranged bipolar filaments (myofilaments) with motor domains on both filament ends ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verkhovsky and Borisy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Verkhovsky et al., 1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Besides being the force generator necessary for cell cortex remodeling and actomyosin ring constriction during cytokinesis, there is evidence that myofilaments also contribute to actin filament turnover during cyotkinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>). In all these processes, the microscopic mechanism of the interaction between individual myofilaments and membrane-bound actin filaments is not understood. Due to the vast complexity of cellular systems, much effort has been spent to investigate the consequences of actin-myosin interactions from the in vitro perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backouche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kohler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reymann et al., 2012</xref>) However, these studies focused on myosin-induced actin structure formation on a mesoscopic scale, rather than on the interaction between actin and individual myofilaments. In addition, membrane-bound minimal actin systems have only recently begun to be functionally reconstituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vogel and Schwille, 2012</xref>). To fill the gap in understanding individual myofilament–actin interactions, we directly visualized the action of myofilaments on membrane-bound actin filaments in a minimal in vitro system and complemented the experimental findings with a theoretical model.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>MAC composition and actin pattern formation by myofilaments.

If crosslinking of actin by myofilaments were the only prerequisite for pattern formation, we would expect no (fast) pattern formation in low density MACs, due to the long distances between the actin filaments in relation to the length of myofilaments. Strikingly, myofilament addition to low density MACs displayed breakage events and compaction of actin filaments, resulting in their shortening over time in all experiments (n = 21, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref>). After 20 min, the majority of the actin filaments have been shortened to, on average, half of their original length, and most of the fragments coalesced into single foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref>). Note that actin filaments remained intact when imaged in the absence of myofilaments (data not shown). Upon myofilament addition, actin filaments frequently showed deformations prior to actin filament breakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Movie 3</xref>), indicating that force is exerted by the myofilaments and stress along the actin filament may build up until the actin filament breaks. Similarly, recent evidence implied that exposure of actin/fascin bundles to myofilaments can induce their disassembling and severing by an unknown process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backouche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haviv et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thoresen et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Actin filament shortening and compaction by myofilaments.

Subsequently, the fluorescence signal of actin filaments proximal to the breakage site increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The detected increase in the fluorescence intensity of actin filaments implies that actin fragments are further dragged along the remaining actin filaments by the myofilaments during their movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Movie 4</xref>). We analyzed our TIRFM data in greater detail by tracking single myofilaments during their directed movement along an actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2007</xref>)) and determining the velocity from the trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red curve). Simultaneously, the fluorescence intensity in the green (actin) channel of the area occupied by the myofilament during its movement was measured, indicating breakage events as the dragged fragment leads to an increase of fluorescence proximal to the breakage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, blue and black curve). The velocity fluctuates during the movement of the myofilament along the actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red curve), whereby acceleration events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red arrowheads) are closely followed by an increase in the actin fluorescence, indicating that a breakage event occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, black arrows, blue and black curve). We hypothesize that phases of increasing tension between the ends of the myofilament lead to deformation of the actin filament and coincide with a decrease in velocity, while the phases of tension release immediately after actin filament breakage may result in acceleration of the myofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>In order to explain the buckling and eventual breakage of the actin filament, we propose the following model: The myosin filament aligns parallel to the actin filament and interacts with it via the myosin heads ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sellers and Kachar, 1990</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). One end of the myofilament, which we will refer to as the ‘leading end’, is oriented towards the actin plus end (barbed end), as the filaments in a muscle, and can therefore walk along the actin filament while hydrolyzing ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The other end of the myofilament, which we will refer to as the ‘trailing end’, separated from the leading end by the approximately 160 nm long bare zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khayat et al., 2010</xref>) without myosin heads, is oriented in the opposite direction. While the trailing end still interacts with the actin filament, its opposite orientation results in a much slower directed motion towards the actin plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spudich et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sellers and Kachar, 1990</xref>). Every myosin head independently follows the biochemical cycle consisting of ATP hydrolysis, binding to actin, powerstroke accompanied by phosphate dissociation, ADP dissociation, ATP binding, and finally detachment from actin ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We assume that the heads on the trailing end still interact with the actin filament and go through the same cycle, but either do not perform steps that would lead to a processive motion (probability of making a step p<sub>st</sub>=0), or make steps with a small probability (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1). When a myosin head makes a step (step size d = 5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>)) it tries to move the whole myosin filament towards the actin plus end, but other attached myosin heads are holding it back, thus generating friction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The myofilament trailing end functions mainly as a source of friction (an effective ‘brake’), but is also moved towards the plus end by the pulling force exerted by the leading end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Since mainly the leading end is actively moving and the trailing end is either passively pulled (p<sub>st</sub>=0) or contributes only weakly to its own motion (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1), tension builds up within the myofilament, and is transferred onto the actin filament as a compressive force. If sufficiently high, this compressive force can cause buckling, and finally breakage, of the actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). After the breakage, the leading end can move unhindered further towards the plus end, while dragging along the broken-off part of the actin filament attached to the trailing end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The trailing end can also attach again to the actin and further breakage events on the same filament can follow.</p><p>In order to estimate the force needed to break an actin filament, we model the filaments as flexible rods with bending rigidity EI = 60 nN μm<sup>2</sup>, determined from the persistence length of actin: l<sub>p</sub> = EI/(kT) = 15 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yanagida et al., 1984</xref>). The force needed to buckle and break a filament is F = π<sup>2</sup> EI/l<sup>2</sup>. With the length l of the myofilament bare zone of 160 nm, this gives a force of 23 pN. Can the tension within the myofilament reach up to this force? We performed simulations of this model, describing the attached myosin head as a spring with a spring constant equal to the myosin head stiffness κ = 1 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaya and Higuchi, 2010</xref>), and equilibrate all forces after every step and every detachment of a myosin head. From the AFM image of the myofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the known myofilament structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>), we estimated that there are n<sub>m</sub> = 30 interacting myosin heads per filament. The result is a net movement of the whole myofilament towards the actin plus end, with fluctuating tension force, velocity and number of attached myosin heads, the mean values of which depend on the ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4A,B and 6</xref>). We note that the tension force increases with decreasing ATP concentration, reaching forces necessary for breakage only at low (lesser than ∼3 µM) ATP concentrations, in agreement with the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). When the actin filament was allowed to bend in simulations at the point where the buckling force of 23 pN was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), thus releasing the excess tension, the filament curvature steadily increased at low ATP concentrations, reaching the critical curvature of breaking of 5.6 µm<sup>−1</sup> ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At intermediate ATP concentrations, the actin curvature fluctuated, at times exceeding the curvature threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4C and 7B</xref>). At higher ATP concentrations, the threshold force was reached for too short periods for the filament to be bent to the breakage point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4D and 7C</xref>). The results do not depend significantly on whether the myosin heads on the trailing end perform steps (p<sub>st</sub>=0.1) or not (p<sub>st</sub>=0). The simulations thus support the idea that in the ATP concentration range used in the experiments, the differences in the interactions of the trailing and leading ends of the myofilament with actin can generate compressive forces on the actin filament, and that these forces are sufficiently high to bend and break the actin filament.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Simulation of the interaction between myofilaments and an actin filament.

To bend and break the actin filament, the myofilament has to be attached to the actin for sufficient time, and sufficient force has to be generated, requiring a certain mean number of heads being attached to actin at any given time. Given the small number of interacting myosin heads this translates to a requirement that a large fraction of heads is in the bound state. In our assay this was achieved with low ATP concentrations. It is tempting to speculate that actin breakage by myofilaments in vivo is governed by the ATP level in the cell. Recent evidence exists that ATP levels indeed vary significantly inside living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). However, physiological ATP concentrations, derived from methods that provide averaged ATP levels with no high spatial and temporal resolution from cell extracts, are usually found in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beis and Newsholme, 1975</xref>). Here it is important to mention that skeletal muscle myosin II (used in this study) has a lower duty ratio and is therefore less processive than non-muscle myosin in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris and Warshaw, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). By lowering the ATP concentration in our assay, we increased the duty ratio of our myofilaments and thereby made them more processive (supplementary text in ‘Material and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Movie 5</xref>), similar to non-muscle myosin, which is in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Humphrey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, processivity of myofilaments in animal cells may be also controlled by phosphorylation of myosin light chains through other proteins that modify the kinetic rates of the biochemical cycle and thereby increase the duty ratio of the myosins shifting the observed behavior to a region of high physiological ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBiasio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsumura et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our simulations show that the model of interaction between the actin and myosin filaments described in the text is plausible given the quantitative parameter values known from literature (rate constants). Most importantly, it shows that sufficient force needed to bend and break the actin filament can be generated by a single myofilament, assuming only the difference in the interaction between the leading and trailing myofilament ends (making a step vs not making a step). This result implies that neither actin nor myosin attachment to a support or any other rigid structure is necessary for the observed process. The forces act within a single myofilament. Binding of the actin filaments to the membrane provides confinement of the filaments to a plane, without rigidly tethering the filaments to a support or a scaffold. The motion of actin is only restricted by the effectively higher viscosity of the membrane compared to the buffer solution. The simulation further yields quantitative details of the model, for example, the mean fractions of myosin heads in the six possible states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and describes the fluctuations of the actin filament curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Other parameters that can be derived from the simulations and could be compared with new experiments include the processivity of myosin, as a function of the ATP concentration, and the dependence of the overall behavior on the length of myofilaments.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>The biochemical cycle of the myosin heads with rates k<sub>1</sub>–k<sub>6</sub> assumed in the model and the simulations.

In our minimal system, myofilaments fragment and compact membrane-bound actin. We directly show that single myofilaments can interact with actin in such a way that sufficient force can be generated to break the filament, without either the myofilament or the actin being firmly attached to a solid support or scaffold. We suggest that fragmentation and compaction by myofilaments contributes to the observed large-scale pattern formation of actomyosin networks also in other in vitro systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backouche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soares e Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). In vivo breakage of actin bundles has been shown to occur in neuronal growth cones in a myosin II dependent manner, and is thought to be important for recycling actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Medeiros et al., 2006</xref>). We propose that the observed fragmentation and compaction of membrane-bound actin filaments by myosins in our in vitro system may serve as a possible general mechanism for actin turnover and actin cell cortex remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Details of the experiments</title><p>Traditionally, single muscle myosin II motors are described as non-processive motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>). By assembling myosin motors into filaments, the myofilaments become processive due to the coupling of a higher number of myosin heads that are in contact with the actin filament. In our minimal system directed movement accompanied by actin filament fragmentation only occurred at low ATP concentrations between 0.1–1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Movie 3</xref>). The lower ATP concentrations are expected to increase the duration of the actin-bound post-working stroke state of the myosin head, thus increasing the duty ratio and processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>). Extremely low ATP concentrations are on the other hand not sufficient for myosin motor activity. To check the effect of ATP concentration on processivity we added Alexa-647 labeled myofilaments to medium density MACs and tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2007</xref>) the movement of individual myofilaments at low (1 µM) and high (4 mM) ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Movie 5</xref>). (Note that fragmentation and compaction of actin filaments only occurred at low ATP concentrations). Comparison of the trajectories illustrates that low ATP trajectories are on average longer than high ATP trajectories indicating a higher processivity at low ATP conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Movie 5</xref>). Moreover the number of tracked myofilaments at low ATP concentration with a dwell time greater than 900 ms was more than six times higher than at high ATP concentration suggesting a higher duty ratio at low ATP levels (n = 681 at low ATP, n = 102 at high ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Movie 5</xref>). High ATP concentrations therefore lead to a faster detachment of myofilaments from actin filaments than at low ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Movie 5</xref>). We propose that the increase in processivity due to ATP deprivation is necessary for the processive movement and a prerequisite for fragmentation and compaction of actin filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Details of the model</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Biochemical cycle</title><p>In the model of the myofilament interaction with actin, we assume that each active myosin head goes through the following biochemical cycle consisting of six head states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>).

Unbound myosin head with ATP (state 1) hydrolyses ATP with the rate k<sub>1</sub> = 100 s<sup>−1</sup> (state 2), binds to the actin filament with the rate k<sub>2</sub> = 30 s<sup>−1</sup> (state 3), rapidly releases phosphate while performing a powerstroke with rate k<sub>3</sub> = 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (state 4), releases ADP with the rate k<sub>4</sub> = 1000 s<sup>−1</sup> (state 5), binds ATP with the rate k<sub>5</sub> = k<sub>t</sub> [ATP], where k<sub>t</sub> = 4 μM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, (state 6), and dissociates from the actin filament with the rate k<sub>6</sub> = 2000 s<sup>−1</sup> (state 1). These rates determine the average time the myosin heads spend in every state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this simple model the rates are assumed to be independent of the strain of the myosin head. The myosin step size is d = 5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard, 2001</xref>). The myosin heads of the leading myofilament end always perform a step as a result of the powerstroke between the states 3 and 4. The heads of the trailing end either do not make a step (the probability of making a step p<sub>st</sub>=0), or, in separate simulations, make a step with the probability p<sub>st</sub>=0.1. This value is based on the observations that the trailing myofilament end moves along actin with approximately ten-times slower speed than the leading end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sellers and Kachar, 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Mechanical equillibrium</title><p>Every myosin head attached to the actin filament is described as a spring with a spring constant equal to the myosin head stiffness κ = 1 pN nm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaya and Higuchi, 2010</xref>). After every step and after every detachment of a myosin head the forces are equilibrated by moving the myofilament along the actin filament.

Actin filaments break when the radius of curvature of a bent filament decreases below 0.18 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 1999</xref>) corresponding to the curvature 1/r = 5.6 μm<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Results of the simulations</title><p>In order to find out if the tension within the myofilament transferred onto the actin filament as a compressive force can become sufficiently high to bend and break the actin filament, we performed two types of simulations.</p><p>In the first case, bending of the filament was not allowed and no limit was imposed on the compression force within the actin filament. This allowed us to determine the forces that can be reached by this model. In the second case, the actin filament was allowed to bend when the force of 23 pN was exceeded. Actin bending was modeled by decreasing the distance between the leading and trailing ends of the myofilament, thus relaxing the stress and reducing the force down to 23 pN.</p><p>In case when bending was not allowed, the average force increased with decreasing ATP concentration, and also with the increasing number of myosin heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For 30 myosin heads, the force of 23 pN, neccessary to bend the filament, could be reached at ATP concentrations of approximately 3 µM or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>In the ATP concentration range used in the experiments here (&lt;100 µM, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) the average velocity of myofilament increased approximately linearly with ATP concentration, independently of the number of myosin heads, or of the fact whether actin bending was allowed or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The average fraction of myosin heads attached to actin increased with decreasing ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and since the myosin heads act independently of each other and of the forces involved, was also independent of number of myosin heads and actin bending.</p><p>When the actin filament was allowed to bend, the maximum force was not permitted to exceed 23 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). At low ATP concentration, the generated force was sufficiently high to continuously bend the actin filament, steadily increasing the curvature above the breakage threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At intermediate ATP concentrations, the force fluctuating near the threshold caused fluctuations in curvature, at times exceeding the curvature threshold and then relaxing again to a straight filament configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4C and 7B</xref>). At even higher ATP concentrations, the threshold force was reached for too short periods for sufficiently high curvature to develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4D and 7C</xref>).</p><p>The results for the scenario where the myosin heads of the trailing end can make a step towards the plus actin end with the probability p<sub>st</sub>=0.1 are very similar to those with p<sub>st</sub>=0. The differences are that the generated forces are slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) and the mean velocity slightly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Actin preparation and labeling</title><p>Rabbit skeletal muscle actin monomers (Molecular Probes) and biotinylated rabbit actin monomers (tebu-bio [Cytoskeleton Inc.]) were mixed in a 5:1 (actin:biotin-actin) ratio.

For planar, glass supported lipid bilayer formation molar ratios of the lipids (purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) Egg PC (99.99, 99.9 and 99 mol%) and DSPE-PEG(2000)-Biotin (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mol%) were dissolved in chloroform (total 10 mg/ml of lipids), dried under nitrogen flux for 30 min and subsequently put into vacuum for 30 min. Lipids were then rehydrated in reaction buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and resuspended by vigorous vortexing. To obtain SUVs (small unilamellar vesicles) the suspension was exposed to sonication in a water bath at room temperature. 10 µl of the suspension were mixed with 90 µl reaction buffer and placed onto the glass cover slip of the chamber. CaCl<sub>2</sub> to a final concentration of 0.1 mM was added to induce fusion of the SUVs and the formation of a lipid bilayer on the glass surface. The sample was washed several times with a total volume of approximately 2 ml reaction buffer in order to remove unfused vesicles. After washing, 2 µg of Neutravidin (Molecular Probes) dissolved in 200 µl reaction buffer was added to the sample and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The sample was washed several times with &gt;2 ml reaction buffer to remove unbound Neutravidin.

The AFM head was mounted on top of a stable cast-iron microscope stage and combined with a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Soft, rectangular silicon cantilevers (CSC38/noAl, Micromash, Tallin, Estonia) with a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N/m were used. The cantilever sensitivity in V/m was determined before each measurement. The spring constant was calibrated by using the thermal fluctuations method. Clean, circular glass cover slips (d = 24 mm, #1.5, Menzel Gläser, Thermo Fisher, Braunschweig, Germany) were hydrophilized by air plasma cleaning. The AFM fluid cell was assembled by using the glass slide and filled with 400 µl of the reaction buffer. Directly before AFM imaging, myofilaments were diluted with reaction buffer to a concentration of 10 nM. 5 µL of 10 nM myofilaments in reaction buffer were added to the fluid cell. In experiments with combined AFM and fluorescence imaging, Alexa-488 labeled myofilaments were used. After 15 min incubation most of the myofilaments adhered to the hydrophilic surface, residual non-adherent filaments were removed by washing with reaction buffer. AFM imaging was performed in contact mode with a scan rate of 1 Hz. The imaging forces were kept very low (&lt;0.5 nN) by continuously adjusting the deflection setpoint and using optimized feedback gains. Raw AFM images were line and plane fitted by using the open source software Gwyddion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gwyddion.net">www.gwyddion.net</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-12"><title>Myofilament length determination</title><p>Length histograms of myofilaments were obtained from confocal images of Alexa-488 labeled myofilaments prepared as described in the AFM imaging section. Confocal microscopy was performed using a LSM 510 Meta system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 40× water immersion objective (C-Apochromat, 40×/1.2, Carl Zeiss). The 488 nm line of an Argon-ion laser was used to excite the sample. Fluorescence excitation and emission were separated using a microscope build-in dichroic mirror (HFT 488/633) and band pass filter (BP 505–550) in front of the detector. Myofilament length measurement of the AFM images was manually performed with the software Gwyddion. Myofilament length distribution of the confocal images with xy-pixel size of 110 nm was obtained manually using Image J. The accuracy of the length determination based on confocal microscopy was verified by colocalization with AFM images. Identical lengths of the filaments were obtained using both methods (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.99, n = 47) and therefore justified bulk measurements using confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-13"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed with Image J (Rasband, W.S., National Institutes of Health, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>) and custom written scripts in Igor Pro 6.0 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, USA) and MatLab. Actin filament length measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) was performed using the NeuronJ Image J plugin, for details see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meijering et al., 2004</xref>). The fluorescence intensity profiles for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> (main text) were obtained using the segmented line tool and plot profile command in Image J. To determine the fluorescence intensity in the area occupied by a myofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> [main text]) a custom written macro in Image J was used. In brief, the image sequence in the 647 nm channel of the Alexa-647 labeled myofilament (red) was converted to 8-bit, binarized by using a threshold filter and an area selection (corresponding to the myofilament) for each binary image was created. The mean fluorescence intensity in the corresponding 488 nm channel images of the Alexa-488-phalloidin labeled actin filaments (green) was computed in the selected area. Smoothing of intensity profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> was conducted using a sliding-average smoothing algorithm (interval 2 s) implemented in Igor Pro.</p><p>Myofilaments for the velocity analysis were tracked using a custom written program by Rogers et al. (for details see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2007</xref>)). The radial velocity v<sub>t</sub> was computed from the myofilament trajectories x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>t</sub>, where t is the discrete sampling time with an interval Δt = 0.2 s. The radial change in position was computed by Δr<sub>t</sub> = ((x<sub>t+nΔt</sub> − x<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>t+nΔt</sub> − y<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>. The radial velocity was obtained from v<sub>t</sub> = Δr<sub>t</sub>/nΔt. Computation intervals nΔt with n = 20 were chosen to reduce the noise induced by small fluctuations in the positions.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>The referees agree that your work provides an interesting mechanism for compaction of actin filaments by myofilaments and how this might apply to actin organization at the cell cortex. We list the concerns below:</p><p>1. There is concern at the lack of quantification of the major experiment. There is a need to quantify these results. How many times were these experiments performed and how many times were the effects of myofilaments on actin filaments observed?</p><p>2. It is not clear how much the simulations have helped the paper. It would be more useful if the simulations lead to some testable hypothesis that then expand/strengthen/fine-tune the model. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>Below are a number of important points pertaining to the experiments, all of which seem to be on point and require resolution.</p><p>3. Most experiments (at least those employed to derive mechanism) were performed in near rigor conditions. Given that the km for myosin-II nucleotide-binding is in the tens of micro-molar, the use of ∼3 micro-molar ATP is a concern. With respect to muscle (the source of the myosin-II in these experiments), the ATP concentration is ∼5 mM and &gt;100 micro-molar in non-muscle cells.</p><p>The authors predict that 30 molecules of myosin-II (per mini-filament) are in contact with an actin filament. However, the force estimate (23 pN) for buckling only reflects that of 5–6 active heads. In other words, &gt;80% of the myosin heads are in rigor.</p><p>This type of tension/buckling is what is expected (and previously seen) in traditional motility assays when ATP is kept low. This point assumes the authors are using fully active myosin-II preparations (based on their testing of preparations).</p><p>4. The authors use myosin-II mini-filaments that are free in solution, which forces them to use rigor conditions. Given what the authors are aiming to reproduce, shouldn't myosin-II be tethered independently of actin in their assays (as it is presumably to some degree at the cell division site, given that myosin localization is often tail-dependent and actin-independent)? This approach would invoke tension (with actin and myosin tethered) reflecting the force-velocity relationship of myosin-II, an effect that is more likely seen in cells.</p><p>5. How closely does the actin and myosin concentration used reflect the in vivo actomyosin density at the cell cortex?</p><p>The choice of muscle myosin-II seems specialized; perhaps non-muscle myosin-II would be best for reconstituting general cellular behavior?</p><p>6. We generally felt that the conditions used in the experiments were not very physiological and hard to reconcile with what is probably found in cells. Two types are experiments need to be performed to further validate the conclusions: (a) perform the study with non-muscle myosin II at physiological ATP concentrations and (b) attempt to link myosin II, rather than F-actin, to the minimal cortex to observe effects on F-actin shortening, buckling, and turnover.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00116.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1. There is concern at the lack of quantification of the major experiment. There is a need to quantify these results. How many times were these experiments performed and how many times were the effects of myofilaments on actin filaments observed</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the comments of the referees and we have added a detailed quantification of the processes within the main text. The description of all experiments in the text was modified accordingly.</p><p>Quantitative data was added as follows: “… Actin pattern formation occurred at ATP concentrations between 0.1 - 1 µM in systems where ATP is enzymatically regenerated (Table S1) in 94 % of the experiments (n = 45 experiments).”</p><p>The following sentence was added: “…Strikingly, myofilament addition to low density MACs displayed breakage events and compaction of actin filaments, resulting in their shortening over time in all experiments (n = 21, Figure 2 A–C, Movie S2).”</p><p>And the following sentence was added: “…68 % of the individually observed myofilaments displayed directed movement and 50 % exhibited fragmentation and compaction of an actin filament (total number of myofilaments = 152; 7 experiments). In cases where both fragmentation and compaction occurred, 95% of the observed myofilaments showed directed movement along the actin filaments, while 5 % remained stationary at their original binding site (total number of fragmenting myofilaments = 75; 7 experiments).”</p><p><italic>2. It is not clear how much the simulations have helped the paper. It would be more useful if the simulations lead to some testable hypothesis that then expand/strengthen/fine-tune the model. This needs to be clarified</italic>.</p><p>The simulations are not supposed to lead to a new hypothesis, but rather (in first iteration) show that the already suggested model of interaction between the actin and myosin filaments is plausible, given the quantitative parameter values known from literature (rate constants). Most importantly, it shows that sufficient force needed to bend and break the actin filament can be generated by a single myofilament, assuming only the difference in the interaction between the leading and trailing myofilament ends (making a step vs. not making a step). This conclusion does not follow simply from the qualitative formulation of the model, as shown in Figure 3D.</p><p>In addition, the simulation yields quantitative details of the model, for example, the mean fractions of myosin heads in the 6 possible states (now included in the new Figure 9). The simulations also describe the fluctuations of the actin filament curvature (Figure 4C, D).</p><p>Thus, the simulations are an essential part of this work, as they provide quantitative support for our qualitative model (Figure 3D) and give detailed insight into the molecular mechanism.</p><p>To clarify this point, we added Figures 8 and 9. In Figure 9, we show the fractions of the myosin heads in the different states of the motor cycle illustrated in Figure 8, and we have included a new paragraph in the discussion.</p><p><italic>3. Most experiments (at least those employed to derive mechanism) were performed in near rigor conditions. Given that the km for myosin-II nucleotide-binding is in the tens of micro-molar, the use of ∼3 micro-molar ATP is a concern. With respect to muscle (the source of the myosin-II in these experiments), the ATP concentration is ∼5 mM and &gt;100 micro-molar in non-muscle cells</italic>.</p><p>To bend and break the actin filament, the myofilament has to be attached to the actin for sufficient time, and sufficient force has to be generated, requiring a certain mean number of heads being attached to actin at any given time. Given the small number of interacting myosin heads, this translates into a requirement that a large fraction of heads is in the bound state. In our assay, this was achieved at low ATP concentrations. Here, it is important to mention that skeletal muscle myosin has a lower duty ratio and is therefore less processive than non-muscle myosin in cells (Harris De at. al 1993; Wang et. al. 2003). By lowering the ATP concentration in our assay, we increased the duty ratio of our myofilaments and thereby made them more processive (Figure 5, Movie 5), similar to non-muscle myosin, which is in line with previous studies (Soares et. al. 2011; Smith et. al. 2007; Humphrey et. al. 2002).</p><p>Moreover, the modification of the kinetic rates of the motor cycle could be controlled <italic>in vivo</italic> through phosphorylation of the myosin light chains (Tan et. al. 1992; DeBiasio et. al. 1996; Matsumura et. al. 2001) and possibly allows the behavior observed <italic>in vitro</italic> to occur at the higher ATP concentrations found <italic>in vivo</italic>. We would like to emphasize that the aim of this study was to give insight into the individual myosin-actin interactions by using a minimal system. It is obvious that due to the simplicity of the system, parameters such as the ATP concentration may differ from the <italic>in vivo</italic> values. To clarify this point we extended the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The authors predict that 30 molecules of myosin-II (per mini-filament) are in contact with an actin filament. However, the force estimate (23 pN) for buckling only reflects that of 5–6 active heads. In other words, &gt;80% of the myosin heads are in rigor</italic>.</p><p>In our simulations, all myosin heads are active and constantly move through the six states of the motor cycle (now added for clarity of presentation as new Figure 8). Changing the ATP concentration will change the average residence time of the individual heads in the six states of the motor cycle. As stated by the reviewers, a low ATP concentration will increase the number of heads in the rigor state (corresponding to state 5 in Figure 8). However, this state is a part of the biochemical motor cycle, and a higher population of heads in state 5 does not indicate that these heads are ‘inactive’, but describes the fact that individual filaments populate the fifth (rigor) state longer (in temporal average) before proceeding to the next state. Hence, all heads are active and only the distribution of states in the motor cycle changes. To further illustrate this aspect, the mean fractions of heads in the individual states are now shown in the new Figure 9.</p><p><italic>This type of tension/buckling is what is expected (and previously seen) in traditional motility assays when ATP is kept low. This point assumes the authors are using fully active myosin-II preparations (based on their testing of preparations)</italic>.</p><p>The referees may refer to a study from Kron and Spudich (1986) where actin filaments move on synthetic myofilaments that were fixed to a glass surface. In this study, it was observed that some filaments broke into fragments after they bound to the myosin-coated surface. In contrast to our assay, in these experiments filaments broke at high (1 mM) ATP concentrations, and condensation into foci was not observed. Moreover, the surface density of bound myofilaments had to be high, as actin filaments break less frequently on a low-density myosin substratum. This suggests that breakage of actin filaments in their study occurred because of interaction with at least two or multiple myofilaments. Last, their myofilaments are fixed to a support, while our myofilaments are not tethered to a support.</p><p>In our study, we directly show that one myofilament is capable to fragment and compact actin filaments while it is directly moving along the actin filament. Fragmentation here is based on compressive stress generated within one myofilament, while in the motility assay it can not be distinguished whether pulling forces or compressive stresses play the dominant role, and how many myofilaments are involved.</p><p><italic>4. The authors use myosin-II mini-filaments that are free in solution, which forces them to use rigor conditions. Given what the authors are aiming to reproduce, shouldn't myosin-II be tethered independently of actin in their assays (as it is presumably to some degree at the cell division site, given that myosin localization is often tail-dependent and actin-independent)? This approach would invoke tension (with actin and myosin tethered) reflecting the force-velocity relationship of myosin-II, an effect that is more likely seen in cells</italic>.</p><p>Myofilaments also bind to actin filaments at high (non-rigor) ATP concentrations (Movie 5, Figure 5). Only the time that myofilaments stay attached to the actin filaments is much shorter due to the low processivity at higher ATP concentrations.</p><p>The aim in this work was not to reproduce exactly the situation in a cell (if this is ever applicable), but to study the actin–myofilament interaction in a simple, well-defined system, and to see how the observed behavior could be explained, and what consequences this could have for the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. We directly show that single myofilaments can interact with actin in such a way that sufficient force can be generated to break the filament, without either the myofilament or the actin being firmly attached to a solid support or scaffold. Note that membrane-anchored actin exhibits lateral diffusion on the membrane. <italic>In vivo</italic> myosin localization may indeed depend on certain domains of the myosin protein but does not necessarily imply that myosin is physically fixed to the cell membrane or any rigid scaffold. It is more likely that myosin interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with other cortical proteins that help to maintain their cortical (equatorial) localization in cells (Piekny et al., 2008). Typically protein–protein interactions are transient and can be best described by attachment and detachment rates. Therefore fixation of myosin to a support in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay would in our opinion represent a rather non-physiological situation.</p><p><italic>5. How closely does the actin and myosin concentration used reflect the in vivo actomyosin density at the cell cortex</italic>?</p><p>Cortical actin density varies in cells. Known median mesh diameters range from ∼ 40 to 230 nm (Morone et al., 2006). We can control actin density such that single actin filaments are visible or that the density of the actin mesh is so high that individual actin filaments can not be distinguished by TIRF microscopy, due to the diffraction limit of light (see Figure 1B). This density may be comparable to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation and we also observed actin pattern formation at higher actin densities. Nevertheless the prior aim was to investigate the interaction of individual myofilaments with single actin filaments, which required the use of a lower actin density for the main experiments.</p><p><italic>The choice of muscle myosin-II seems specialized; perhaps non-muscle myosin-II would be best for reconstituting general cellular behavior</italic>?</p><p>See response to comment 6, below.</p><p><italic>6. We generally felt that the conditions used in the experiments were not very physiological and hard to reconcile with what is probably found in cells. Two types are experiments need to be performed to further validate the conclusions: (a) perform the study with non-muscle myosin II at physiological ATP concentrations and (b) attempt to link myosin II, rather than F-actin, to the minimal cortex to observe effects on F-actin shortening, buckling, and turnover</italic>.</p><p>Muscle myosin II is a standard tool to mimic actomyosin contractility present in cells (Backouche, Haviv, Groswasser, &amp; Bernheim-Groswasser, 2006; Kohler, Schaller, &amp; Bausch, 2011; Smith et al., 2007; Soares e Silva et al., 2011). Our results now can be directly compared to these studies.</p><p>Our assay represents a specific minimal system to allow elucidating fundamental mechanisms of the actin myosin interaction. We strongly believe that the potential new insights by using non-muscle myosin II (i.e., redoing exactly the same work as reported, albeit with another protein system) would be limited, since also in this case, a minimal system is used and other interacting proteins are absent. It is therefore highly likely that the ATP dependency would also in this case deviate from physiological conditions.</p><p>Moreover, linking myosin II to a support is rather non-physiological, as discussed in greater detail in the answer to comment 4.</p><p>Besides these concerns, we agree with the reviewer that using our assay with non-muscle myosin II to compare the two proteins is definitely worth investigating and we will perform such studies in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
