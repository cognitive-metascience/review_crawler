Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20982.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20982.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Egr2</kwd><kwd>TEAD</kwd><kwd>Taz</kwd><kwd>demyelination</kwd><kwd>Schwann cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS079631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>86600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS076401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawaya</surname><given-names>Bassel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH093331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawaya</surname><given-names>Bassel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS095070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yap and Taz regulate proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells, driving radial sorting, myelination and myelin maintenance of peripheral nerves.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Normal motor and sensory functions depend on myelination of peripheral axons by myelin-forming Schwann cells (ie., myelinating SCs; mSCs) that enables fast neural transmission. Failure to generate or maintain mSCs leads to life-threatening peripheral neuropathy and myelinopathy. Research over the last few decades has made great progress in identifying extra- and intracellular signals that drive SC differentiation and myelination during development, but mechanisms that maintain mSCs and myelination in adults remain unclear (recent reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taveggia, 2016</xref>). Krox20 (also called Egr2) has been identified as the master transcription factor that drives myelin gene expression for both myelin formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Topilko et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). However, it remains unclear how extra- and intracellular signals regulate transcription of Krox20. A major gap in our knowledge concerns the nucleocytoplasmic mediator(s) that converge and deliver extra- and intracellular signals to the SC nucleus to drive Krox20. Although several transcription factors upstream of Krox20 have been identified, they either reside only in the nucleus or play uncertain roles in Krox20 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stolt and Wegner, 2016</xref>).</p><p>YAP (Yes-associated protein) and its paralogue, TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), are Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activators and potent oncoproteins that shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>). When activated, YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ) translocate to the nucleus, where they potently induce cell proliferation. Because YAP/TAZ lack DNA binding domains, they act indirectly by binding partner transcription factors, particularly members of the TEA domain (TEAD) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Following phosphorylation by activated Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ are inactivated through cytoplasmic retention and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ is critical for developmentally regulating cell proliferation that ensures normal tissue growth and organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>). YAP/TAZ shift to the cytoplasm concomitant with differentiation and the nuclear exclusion of YAP/TAZ is a requisite for adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>). Indeed, nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ in differentiated adult cells is essential for cancer initiation or growth of most solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, YAP/TAZ are emerging as attractive targets for cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>). YAP/TAZ also interact with other signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, GPCR, and mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rayon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heallen et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that nuclear YAP/TAZ have additional context-dependent functions besides their widely recognized role in promoting cellular proliferation and developmental differentiation.</p><p>Studies from three laboratories have recently implicated YAP/TAZ in myelination of developing peripheral nerve. Poitelon et al. showed that conditional knockout mice lacking YAP/TAZ in SCs are peripherally unmyelinated, as these SCs completely fail to sort out large-caliber axons. This is a pre-requisite step in developmental myelination known as radial or axon sorting. The authors observed no nuclear YAP/TAZ in cultured myelinating SCs, and modest, if any, regulation of Krox20 by YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>). Two subsequent studies raised the possibility that YAP/TAZ may regulate myelination more directly: these reports showed upregulation of myelin genes, including Krox20, by TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>) or YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Fernando et al. reported that viral inactivation of YAP in developing sciatic nerve reduces SC and myelin length, although myelin thickness remains unaltered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>). How YAP/TAZ regulate developmental myelination is therefore unclear, and whether they also play a role in maintenance of myelination in adulthood is completely unknown.</p><p>In this report we first show that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ are in fact capable of sorting axons, but the process is extensively delayed and incomplete, largely due to defective SC proliferation. Sorted axons never became myelinated, however, apparently due to the failure of these SCs to upregulate Krox20 and differentiate into mSCs. We also show that adult mSCs, but not non-myelinating SCs, express nuclear YAP/TAZ, and that induced ablation of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs results in Krox20 downregulation, overt demyelination and, notably, mouse death. Lastly, we report that a YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 complex regulates both developmental and adult myelination, presumably through transcriptional regulation of Krox20. Our results clarify a developmental function of SC YAP/TAZ, and newly establish YAP/TAZ as essential regulators of both developmental and adult myelination in the peripheral nervous system. Our study also calls for caution in targeting YAP/TAZ for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YAP and TAZ are expressed in proliferating, differentiating and mature myelinating Schwann cells</title><p>We began our study by testing a number of commercial antibodies for their specificity to YAP and its paralogue, TAZ.

Notably, YAP/TAZ continued to be expressed strongly in SC nuclei at P4, P18 and P60. YAP/TAZ have distinct functions when they are in the cytoplasm versus in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diepenbruck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>): YAP/TAZ actively regulate transcription when they are localized to the nucleus. In contrast, when YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated and in the cytoplasm, they are presumed to be transcriptionally inactive. This result suggest, therefore, that YAP/TAZ act as transcriptional regulators not only in proliferating and differentiating SCs, but also surprisingly in fully mature SCs.</p><p>Immunostaining of transcriptionally inactive, phosphorylated-YAP (p-YAP) was largely cytoplasmic, as expected, indicating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ in mature SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, not all postnatal SCs expressed YAP/TAZ: they were expressed byÂ ~60% at P4 andÂ ~75% at P60, approximately corresponding to the percentage of myelinating SCs (mSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore co-immunostained P60 teased sciatic nerve fibers for Sox10, Krox20 (to selectively label mSCs) and YAP. Strikingly, YAP was highly expressed in mSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; arrows), but virtually undetectable in Krox20-negative, non-myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; eg., arrowheads). We verified this result by co-immunostaining teased fibers for YAP/TAZ and for GFAP, which exclusively labels non-myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jessen et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results show that YAP/TAZ are actively regulating transcription in proliferating and differentiating SCs during development and then selectively in differentiated mSCs in the adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In stark contrast to controls, myelin basic protein (MBP) was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E1</xref>), except in the rare SCs which retained strong YAP/TAZ immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E1 and E</xref>, arrows). Those SCs exhibiting low or faint YAP/TAZ immunoreactivity did not express MBP (for example, #2 SC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E2</xref>). Semithin sections and electron microscopy provided additional evidence of the nearly complete absence of myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Notably, however, although we frequently observed small bundles of unsorted axons, many axons were singled out by promyelinating SCs with thick basal lamina in P60 cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and inset). Similarly, axons in forelimb nerves, dorsal roots and ventral roots in P60 cDKO exhibited complete amyelination, and frequently established a 1:1 relationship with promyelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). We frequently observed small bundles of unsorted axons and occasionally large axon bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>), but we did not observe polyaxonal myelination in which multiple axons were surrounded by a mSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>, arrows). These results demonstrate that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ arrest as promyelinating SCs (that is, fail to differentiate into mSCs), and are therefore unable to myelinate axons.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Yap</italic>/<italic>Taz</italic> cDKO, myelination appeared completely normal in the sciatic nerves of P60 <italic>Yap</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) and nearly so in those of P60 <italic>Taz</italic> cKO, except for rare small bundles of unsorted axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Sciatic nerves of P60 <italic>Yap</italic>-cKO/<italic>Taz</italic>-cHET appeared fully myelinated, whereas those of P60 <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET exhibited large bundles of unsorted axons, in addition to normal and polyaxonal myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These observations were consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of the mice. <italic>Yap</italic>-cKO/<italic>Taz</italic>-cHET mice appeared normal, whereas <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET showed mild tremor, wide gait and progressive paralysis in adulthood. Unlike P60 cDKO mice, however, <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET mice walked on their hindlimbs, and hindlimb paralysis never became complete (data not shown). These results show that YAP and TAZ are required for SC differentiation and myelination. They also suggest that YAP/TAZ are redundant in regulating SC differentiation and myelination, and that TAZ is the more potent regulator.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20982.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>YAP/TAZ are required for timely axon sorting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left nine panels: Semi-thin transverse sections of proximal control sciatic nerve and proximal and distal cDKO nerves at P4, P18 and P60.

This is an important issue because incomplete but extensive axon sorting would suggest direct regulation of SC myelination by YAP/TAZ, whereas the complete failure would suggest that regulation is indirect and consists of blocking radial sorting, a pre-requisite step in SC differentiation and myelination. We therefore analyzed developmental patterns of radial sorting and SC differentiation in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice.</p><p>At P4, cDKO sciatic nerves contained large bundles of unsorted, mixed-caliber axons, whereas many axons were already sorted and myelinating in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,P4</xref>). At P18, when myelination appeared complete in control nerves, proximal nerves of cDKO contained many large bundles of unsorted axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: P18 proximal). Notably, however, the unsorted axon bundles were appreciably smaller in distal nerves than in proximal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,P18</xref> distal), and axons 1:1 with promyelinating SCs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,P18</xref> EM). At P60, many axons were sorted but remained unmyelinated in proximal and distal nerves of cDKO, although small bundles of unsorted axons were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,P60</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>). We also observed small caliber axons fully surrounded by single non-myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; marked by âaâ and âSCâ). These results show that radial sorting is not blocked in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice, but that it proceeds abnormally and remarkably slowly.</p><p>The discrepancy between our and Poitelon et al.âs studies is likely due to the fact that Poitelon et al. examined <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice up to P20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>), whereas we analyzed them more thoroughly up to P60. Several considerations excluded the possibility that delayed axon sorting in our cDKO mice was due to incomplete deletion of <italic>Yap/Taz</italic>. First, we used the same <italic>P0 Cre</italic>-driver line as Poitelon et al. and observed a major block in radial sorting at P18. Second, if an allele of <italic>Yap</italic> or <italic>Taz</italic> remained undeleted, these SCs would have differentiated to mSCs and myelinated axons by P18, as in control nerves. However, we found mSCs to be rare in P18 and P60 cDKO (forÂ example, MBP+ and YAP/TAZ+ SCs in cDKO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Third, not more thanÂ ~20% SCs in cDKO were immunopositive for YAP/TAZ at P60, which is too few to explain the incomplete but extensive radial sorting and virtually complete amyelination (see below). Fourth, most of theseÂ ~20% SCs were only weakly immunopositive at P4 and did not increase at P60, indicating that they failed to proliferate vigorously. Notably, whereas an allele of <italic>Taz</italic> was sufficient to complete myelination in P60 <italic>Yap</italic>-cKO/<italic>Taz</italic>-cHET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; leftmost panels), an allele of <italic>Yap</italic> was insufficient as evidenced by defective sorting and myelination in P60 <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We therefore postulate that most of the weak <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> immunoreactivity in theseÂ ~20% SCs represents an undeleted allele of <italic>Yap</italic> or non-specific antibody binding.</p><p>We frequently observed promyelinating SCs that sorted but did not myelinate axons at P18 in <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These promyelinating SCs differentiated into mSCs, myelinated axons and disappeared by P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This transient block in progression from pro-myelination to myelination, in <italic>Taz</italic>-cKO/<italic>Yap</italic>-cHET, is additional evidence that YAP/TAZ directly regulate SC differentiation and myelination (independently of axon sorting).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>YAP/TAZ are required for proper proliferation of immature Schwann cells</title><p>Timely axon sorting requires generation of sufficient SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grove et al., 2007</xref>).

At E17.5, when SC proliferation peaks with active axon sorting, onlyÂ ~10% SCs were dividing in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO, compared toÂ ~30% SCs in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>), concomitant with the reduced SC numbers in cDKO sciatic nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). At P4, about the same number of SCs were EdU+, and therefore in S phase, in control and cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); however, there was weak YAP/TAZ immunoreactivity (ie., residual Yap/Taz) in most of these cDKO EdU+ SCs (forÂ example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, #1, #2). We found that less than 1% of SCs completely lacking YAP/TAZ were EdU+, whereasÂ ~15% of SCs with residual YAP/TAZ were dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). Taken together with the recent finding that YAP regulates S-phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shen and Stanger, 2015</xref>), this result suggests that entrance of SCs into S-phase might be markedly restricted without YAP/TAZ. Collectively, these results show that YAP/TAZ are required for proper proliferation of immature SCs, and that the subsequent reduction in SCs resulted in the failure of timely axon sorting in cDKO.</p><p>Laminin receptors, such as integrin Î±6Î²1 and dystroglycan, regulate radial sorting, in part by controlling SC number and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pellegatta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). An earlier analysis attributed defective radial sorting in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO largely to downregulation of laminin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore examined expression of laminin receptors in our cDKO mice, particularly at P60, and focused on integrin Î±6 because of its obvious downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>). Our immunohistochemical analysis revealed no integrin Î±6 in SCs in P60 cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis of cDKO sciatic nerves also showed markedly reduced protein and mRNA expression of integrin Î±6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>). This result therefore confirms the earlier report of Poitelon et al. that YAP/TAZ regulate the expression of integrin Î±6 and presumably other laminin receptors. This result also suggests that radial sorting proceeds, albeit abnormally and remarkably slowly, in the absence of laminin receptors.</p><p>Failure of generated SCs to survive could also account for the reduced number in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO. Electron microscopy, caspase-3 and TUNEL assays of sciatic nerves taken from cDKO at P4, P18 and P60 did not reveal apoptotic SCs (data not shown). In addition, intramuscular axons and axon terminals showed no axonal degeneration and we observed no denervated muscle fibers at P55 in cDKO (nÂ &gt;Â 6 muscles,Â &gt;400 NMJs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). All pre-terminal axons were associated with SC processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3Bâ</xref>, inset). Peri-synaptic terminal SCs, a type of non-myelinating SC, appeared normal and were tightly associated with axon terminals. The axon terminals of P55 <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice frequently extended nerve terminal and SC sprouts, and formed satellite extrasynaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3Bâ</xref>, arrows), a normal response of axon terminals to muscle paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Son and Thompson, 1995</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>YAP/TAZ are required for Krox20 upregulation</title><p>Our findings thus far indicate that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ enter S-phase with difficulty and fail to proliferate in a timely fashion, markedly delaying radial sorting in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice. These SCs gradually, albeit abnormally slowly, progress through axon sorting, but arrest at the promyelinating stage and fail to initiate myelination. Sequential expression of two core transcription factors is critical for promyelinating SCs to differentiate into mSCs: Oct6 (also known as Scip, Pou3f1) upregulates Krox20/Egr2 in promyelinating SCs and Krox20 upregulates myelin genes and feeds back to turn off Oct6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</xref>). To investigate the mechanism by which SCs lacking YAP/TAZ arrest as promyelinating SCs, we examined expression of Oct6 and Krox20 in developing and adult cDKO SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâD</xref>). In control nerves, the number of Oct6+ SCs peaked at P4, and then sharply declined. In striking contrast, an abnormally high number of cDKO SCs expressed Oct6 from P0 to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Notably, cDKO SCs failed to upregulate Krox20: in control mice,Â ~30% of SCs were Krox20+ at P0, increasing toÂ ~70% from P18 onwards, whereas in cDKO,Â ~15% of SCs were Krox20+ throughout development and adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). Western blotting of P4 and P60 cDKO sciatic nerves confirmed abnormal upregulation of Oct6, in parallel with concomitant reduction in YAP/TAZ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected, Krox20 mRNA expression was also greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that YAP/TAZ initiate SC differentiation and myelination, presumably by upregulating Krox20 expression in promyelinating SCs.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20982.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>YAP/TAZ are required for Krox20 upregulation in differentiating Schwann cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Identification of Oct6+ SC nuclei at P4 and P60 in WT and <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO, as determined by co-staining for Oct6 (red), Sox10 (SC nuclei; green) and DAPI (all cell nuclei; blue).

Sox10, YY1, NFAT3, NFAT4 and TEADs 1 and 4 were robustly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C1</xref>). Notably, only TEAD1 was detectable in YAP/TAZ immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The direct association of TEAD1 particularly with TAZ was confirmed by counter immunoprecipitation with anti-TEAD1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C1</xref>). To investigate whether TEAD3 could be associated with YAP/TAZ, we immunoprecipitated with anti-TEAD1 and anti-TEAD3 and doubled the amount of the input. TEAD1 was present robustly in the immunoprecipitates, but TEAD3 was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C2</xref>). Therefore, TEAD1 is a partner TF of TAZ for developmental myelination.</p><p>We then investigated binding of TEAD1 to the Krox20 MSE. We designed 6 MSE primer setsÂ encompassing the potential TEAD1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>; E1âE6), and used them to carry out TEAD1 ChIP-qPCR on P12-15 sciatic nerves. To increase the specificity of our assay, we sonicated nerve lysates to produce chromatin fragments of 300â400 bp (data not shown). MSE regions encompassing primer sets E3, E4, and E5 showed strong association with TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; &gt;50 fold more binding than control). This region included two non-canonical TEAD binding sites and abundant binding sites for Sox10, Oct6, NFAT3/4 and YY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 binds to <italic>Krox20</italic> MSE, in order to upregulate <italic>Krox20</italic> for SC differentiation and myelination, and are consistent with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 continues to promote Krox20 transcription for myelin maintenance</title><p>Krox20 is also required for myelin maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>), but whether the MSE is obligatory for Krox20 transcription in adult mSCs remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glenn and Talbot, 2013</xref>). We therefore investigated whether TEAD1 is associated with the MSE in adult SCs. We sonicated P70 sciatic nerve lysates to generate chromatin fragments of 300â400 bp, and immunoprecipitated with anti-TEAD1 or control Rabbit IgG antibody. Purified chromatin was used for qPCR; primers were for regions E3, E4 and E5, as these regions were strongly positive for TEAD1 binding at P12âP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, we used a primer set encompassing a potential TEAD binding site in the Krox20 promoter, reasoning that TEAD1 may bind to the Krox20 promoter even if the MSE were inactive in adult SCs. Notably, TEAD1 specifically bound to regions encompassing E3, E4 and E5 (&gt;50 fold enriched compared to control IgG), as well as the promoter region (&gt;10 fold enriched). Similarly to P12, the E4 region bound strongly to TEAD1. In contrast to P12-P15, however, binding to the E5 region was much reduced (~20% of E4, compared to 100% of E4 at P12), suggesting differential regulation of the MSE in adult SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These results are the first to demonstrate that the MSE is active in adult mSCs, and suggest that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 continues to act on the MSE to drive <italic>Krox20</italic> transcription for adult myelination.</p><p>Lastly, we investigated TEAD1 expression in SCs at various stages. TEAD1 was strongly expressed by proliferating, differentiating, and mature SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>; P4 and P18 data not shown), suggesting that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 drives SC proliferation, differentiation and maintenance. Non-myelinating SCs (data not shown) and cDKO SCs lacking YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) also expressed TEAD1, suggesting that it is the presence or absence of YAP/TAZ which determines transcriptional regulation of Krox20 by TEAD1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we identify YAP/TAZ as essential regulators of SC proliferation and myelination. YAP/TAZ are required for 1) SC proliferation important for timely axon sorting, 2) SC differentiation critical for myelination, and 3) maintenance of differentiated myelinating SCs essential for myelin maintenance. Notably, transcriptionally active, nuclear YAP/TAZ have not been detected in fully differentiated cells in adult tissues, and nuclear exclusion (thatÂ is, cytoplasmic retention) of YAP/TAZ is widely regarded as requisite for maintaining homeostasis in differentiated cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>). It was therefore surprising to find that YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed in nuclei of myelinating SCs, and that eliminating them in adulthood evokes demyelination and is rapidly fatal. Our findings are the first to show that YAP/TAZ can be required for adult tissue homeostasis and suggest caution in targeting them for cancer therapy.</p><p>We found that proliferation of SCs lacking both YAP/TAZ was markedly inhibited due to repressed entry into S-phase. To match the number of SCs with that of large axons, radial sorting requires a sustained and timely increase in SC proliferation between E16.5 andÂ ~P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Webster et al., 1973</xref>). <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO, however, contained only 1/3 of the normal number of SCs at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This number gradually increased but remained substantially below normal. These data therefore strongly suggest that the markedly delayed radial sorting in cDKO mice was primarily due to the failure of SCs lacking YAP/TAZ to generate sufficient SCs at the appropriate time.</p><p>SCs lacking both YAP and TAZ were completely arrested at the promyelination stage, like SCs lacking Krox20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Topilko et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, mRNA and protein levels of Krox20 were concomitantly reduced in SCs of <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO mice. These results suggest that YAP/TAZ directly regulate SC myelination primarily by activating transcription of <italic>Krox20</italic>. In addition, in our ChIP protocol, we increased specificity by preparing chromatin fragmentsÂ ~300 bp. in length. This protocol allowed us to pinpoint binding of TEAD1 to specific Krox20 MSE regions. It also allowed us to show much stronger binding of TEAD1 to the MSE in developing SCs (&gt;50 fold increase compared to control) than that recently reported in P15 rat sciatic nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>). Our preliminary data also showed that YAP/TAZ bind to the same region of the MSE as TEAD1 (data not shown). Our evidence therefore strongly suggests that a YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 complex initiates SC differentiation and myelination by directly binding to the <italic>Krox20</italic> MSE.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting finding of the present study is that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 mediate <italic>Krox20</italic> transcription selectively in myelinating SCs. The mechanisms by which adult SCs maintain <italic>Krox20</italic> transcription and thus myelination remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzer, 2015</xref>). It has been suggested that, once developmental myelination is completed, the <italic>Krox20</italic> MSE becomes inactive, and regulation of TFs that maintain myelination, including Krox20, becomes cell-autonomous, presumably via a feedforward cascade that does not depend on extra- and intracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghislain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glenn and Talbot, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzer, 2015</xref>). Our findings, however, strongly imply that signals in adult mSCs regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ to maintain activation of <italic>Krox20</italic> via its MSE. The MSE region to which TEAD1 binds is enriched with binding sites for TFs, including Sox10, Oct6, NFAT3/4 and YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reiprich et al., 2010</xref>). Although our assays indicated no direct interaction between YAP/TAZ and these factors, it is possible that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 synergize with them by binding to the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vogl et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, these TFs are expressed in oligodendrocytes as well as SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schreiber et al., 1997</xref>), whereas YAP/TAZ and Krox20 are exclusively expressed in myelinating SCs, consistent with a critical requirement for YAP/TAZ in <italic>Krox20</italic> expression. It is also interesting that non-myelinating SCs and <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO SCs express TEAD1, despite absence of YAP/TAZ. TEADs can repress transcription in the absence of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It is conceivable, therefore, that TEAD1 actively represses <italic>Krox20</italic> transcription in these SCs, consequently maintaining amyelination.</p><p>It is also possible that YAP/TAZ regulate myelination by additional pathways unrelated to Krox20. For example, YAP/TAZ might positively regulate Zeb2 transcription, which was recently shown to promote SC differentiation by inactivating repressors of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quintes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Against this possibility, however, <italic>Zeb2</italic> is downregulated when SCs initiate myelination and it is absent in adult SCs. Another possibility is that YAP/TAZ may activate the mTORC1 pathway to promote myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">NorrmÃ©n et al., 2014</xref>). In light of the reports that YAP/TAZ are required for Dicer expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaulk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori et al., 2014</xref>) and that Dicer ablation blocks SC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>), it is also plausible that YAP/TAZ regulate myelination, at least in part, by regulating miRNA expression.</p><p><italic>Yap/Taz</italic> iDKO mice died as early as 20 days after the first tamoxifen injection, which was unexpected because inducible deletion of neither <italic>Krox20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>) nor <italic>Sox10</italic> in SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer et al., 2011</xref>) was lethal. Respiratory failure was the apparent cause of death, which coincided with progressively more shallow and rapid breathing. One speculative explanation is that YAP/TAZ have other transcriptional targets in iDKO mice and/or a cytoplasmic function in adult SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), which, when lost, increases the deficits of the iDKO. Alternatively, inducible ablation of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs might have been more successful than that of Krox20 or Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our findings show that YAP/TAZ regulate not only proliferation but also differentiation of SCs, driving radial sorting, developmental myelination and myelin maintenance. Notably, YAP/TAZ are present in both nucleus and cytoplasm throughout the stages observed, suggesting that nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ is both inhibited and promoted and, therefore, both positive and negative regulators tightly control their transcriptional activity. In other cell types, Hippo-kinase pathway and F-actin cytoskeleton strongly regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ and their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>). Cell stretching or stiff ECM promotes F-actin- or actomyosin-mediated nuclear entry of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupont, 2016</xref>). Similarly, in SCs in vitro, high ECM stiffness (to levels seen in adult sciatic nerve in vivo) or cell stretching, in combination with high concentrations of laminin, promotes nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and SC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Urbanski et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, actin polymerization or actomyosin contractility could conceivably promote transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ that leads to SC differentiation and myelination. In contradiction to this idea, inhibition of actomyosin contractility promotes SC differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove and Brophy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leitman et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, our results show that YAP/TAZ are localized to the nucleus during radial sorting, when ECM stiffness and laminin concentration are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove and Brophy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Urbanski et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore it is likely that additional pathways are also involved in YAP/TAZ regulation. An intriguing possibility is that YAP/TAZ are downstream of regulators of developmental myelination, including Neuregulin 1-type III, integrin Î±6Î²1, G-protein coupled receptor Gpr126 and Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feltri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azzolin et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and five reviewers, one of whom, Klaus-Armin Nave (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Wehr (Reviewer #5).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Grove et al. study Schwann cell-specific Yap and Taz cKO and DKO mice and show that these Hippo signaling transcriptional coactivators factors are essential regulators for PNS myelination. Overall, this study is important as it further reveals a key function of the Yap/Taz signaling system in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. The paper extends and partly corrects findings by the Swaren and Feltri labs that reported a block of axonal sorting in essentially the same double mutant mice. The authors identify a strong delay (but not a block) of axonal sorting. Instead the authors make a subsequent failure of Krox20 upregulation in the &quot;promyelinating&quot; SC responsible for the myelination defect. They discover TEAD1 as a critical cofactor of Taz to directly regulate Krox20 transcription. The authors also report the requirement of continued Yap/Taz expression in adult Schwann cells to maintain myelin. The overall technical quality of the data is high, and presentation is clear and convincing. Although the concept of Yap/Taz regulation is not entirely novel, they provide additional Yap/Taz functions in Schwann cell development and myelin maintenance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important point in the paper is the efficient recombination achieved in all generated mutants. Nevertheless, both western blotting analyses and immunohistochemistry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, have residual Yap/Taz expression in the cDKO. They should perform qPCR analyses for Yap/Taz mRNA to confirm efficient ablation in cDKO.</p><p>2) The paper by Poitelon et al. presented convincing data that the axonal sorting defects in the Yap/Taz conditional mutants are primarily caused by downregulation of laminin receptors Î±6Î²1 integrin and dystroglycan (with minor differences in proliferation), whereas Grove et al. argue equally convincingly that delayed S phase entry and reduced proliferation are the main reasons. It would be important to know whether Grove et al. also see the downregulation of laminin receptors.</p><p>3) Radial sorting impairment is present at all time points analyzed and to corroborate the delay the authors should calculate the number of SC in 1:1 association with axons at all time points analyzed.</p><p>4)Subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, third paragraph: It is troubling to read that some 20% of DKO SC remain Yap/Taz positive, although &quot;weakly&quot;, with this staining remaining constant between P4 and P20 (the data are not shown, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> which shows a lot of residual non-nuclear Yap/Taz). This suggests that even after successful recombination these proteins remain quite stable, possibly due to their physical anchorage in the cells (yet at a different level than the compensatory expression in heterozygous mice). It also brings up the question how early both genes are expressed (i.e. prior to P0-Cre expression) and could different turnover rates of Yap/Taz (possibly related to environmental/nutritional/stress factors) relate to phenotypical differences of DKO mice in different labs.</p><p>Related issues raised:</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection âYap/Taz are required for myelination of sorted axonsâ, the authors claim (with reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that the remaining MBP staining in Yap/Taz cDKO is from &quot;rare SCs which retained strong Yap/Taz immunoreactivity&quot;.</p><p>Subsection âYap/Taz are required for myelination of sorted axonsâ, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>: what could be the reason for &quot;faint signals&quot; in 20% of cells at that adult age? Cre â recombination is early and should be all or none.</p><p>Also, the IHC of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows SC expressing low levels of Yap/Taz.</p><p>5) The authors conclude that the reduction of Krox20 expression (see title) causes the myelination delay, but also report that ~15% of SCs are Krox20+ throughout development and adulthood (subsection âYap/Taz are required for Krox20 upregulationâ). If failing Krox20 expression were the only problem, shouldn't these SC proceed to myelination? Here also the conclusions should be more precise.</p><p>6) The fact that tamoxifen-dependent Yap/Taz deletion in the adult by Sox10-CreERT2 or Plp-CreERT2 leads to an astonishingly rapid death is attributed to the observed changes in peripheral myelin and the PNS. The PNS defects are clearly shown, and it is equally obvious that there is no major structural alteration in CNS myelin. Nevertheless, one should be more cautious in claiming that the PNS defects are the cause of death.</p><p>Given that Sox10 is expressed in other neural crest-derived cell types, does Yap/Taz deletion in other Sox10-expressing cells in Sox10- creERT2-driven iDKO mice cause acute mouse death? The authors mentioned as data-not-shown that Plp-creERT2-driven iDKO mice gave a similar phenotype in demyelination, it would be important to show the data to confirm the demyelination or axonal loss phenotype.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>: why is Yap localized in nuclei of Taz KO samples, unlike the control? This is an important point as validation of these antibodies is crucial for the entire study.</p><p>8) The authors claim that at P60 the majority of fibers reach a 1:1 association (subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, first paragraph), despite the significant impairments in overall SC number and proliferation. Is there an effect on axon numbers in mutant nerves?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: cDKO nerves have an important reduction in SCs number throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Surprisingly this reduction is not corroborated by a substantial defect in SCs proliferation. The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows a significant decrease in SC proliferation at P0, but normal or even increased levels at P4, P18 and P60. How do the authors reconcile these results given that there is no effect on apoptosis? The experiments supporting these conclusions, in particular the IHC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref> at P18 do not show colocalization between Sox10 and Ki67.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> the staining for Yap/Taz is not clear. It seems that all SC are Yap/Taz positive, but this is in sharp contrast with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, where only 60% of cells are Yap/Taz+.</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Yap/Taz iDKO mice exhibit a strong slowing of nerve conduction from ~50 m/s to ~15 m/s, which would suggest the loss of many large diameter axons. However, this phenomenon does not match the morphological features of the mutant nerves where many large diameter axons remain present. The authors should provide quantification data showing the degree of demyelination, axonal loss and reduction of Krox20 in SCs to reflect the remarkable decrease in conduction velocity. Is it possible that the phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is due to a reduced numberof SC as in development? Have the authors checked for SC numbers, survival and proliferation in iDKO?</p><p>12) The authors show that Tead1 binds the MSE element of the Krox20 gene by ChIP-PCR, and claim that Yap/Taz interaction of Tead1 regulates Krox20 gene expression. However, Tead1 transcription factor can bind to many elements and its binding may not necessarily alter Krox20 gene expression. The Yap/Taz regulation of Krox20 may not even be direct. The authors should mutate the putative Tead1 binding sites to demonstrate that Krox20 transcription is inhibited. It would be also important to know whether Yap/Taz interaction with Tead1 is required for activating Krox20 expression and/or the MSE element activity.</p><p>13) The authors do not present any mechanisms of upstream Hippo signalling, independent or dependent on Lats and Mst kinases, mechanical forces, involvement of actin cytoskeleton, etc.. Therefore, the authors should at least discuss these aspects and reference relevant work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Yap/Taz initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination by upregulating Krox20&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and five reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The authors have carefully addressed all comments and questions that were raised by the referees. We acknowledge that this was a relatively long list that was contributed by several experts in the field, who now had a chance to study the revised manuscript. Before <italic>eLife</italic> can accept the paper, the authors should address a few remaining points that mainly require rewording of text.</p><p>1) While it has been clearly stated in the rebuttal letter that the main discrepancy between the present study and that of Poitelon et al. is due to a more thorough analysis of YAP/TAZ in adulthood, this is less evident in the manuscript itself (Results section, subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, third paragraph). Please adjust.</p><p>2) We are not convinced that there is &quot;better axon sorting in distal nerves of cDKO at P18&quot; (subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, third paragraph), a conclusion based merely on low magnification semi-thin sections. Please be more cautious.</p><p>3) The correlation of &quot;weak staining in YAP/TAZ&quot; and the failure of mutant SC to enter S phase is too speculative. Unless the expression of cyclins is provided, this conclusion should be softened (subsection âYap/Taz are required for S-phase entry and proper proliferation of immature Schwann cellsâ, second paragraph).</p><p>4) There is no strong evidence of TAZ/YAP directly activating Krox20 in Schwann cells and the authors themselves stated &quot;These results suggest that Yap/Taz directly regulate Schwann cell myelination most likely by activating transcription of Krox20&quot; (Discussion, third paragraph). Thus, the paper's title (&quot;Yap/Taz initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination by upregulating Krox20&quot;) appears too strong of a statement. YAP/TAZ may regulate many other factors required for Schwann cell myelination. In the absence of evidence demonstrating the ability of TAZ/YAP to upregulate Krox20, e.g. by overexpression studies, the title should be adjusted.</p><p>5) The authors added &quot;new data&quot; for the iDKO/PlpCreERT phenotype as a single image in Figure 6E5.

Nevertheless, both western blotting analyses and immunohistochemistry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, have residual Yap/Taz expression in the cDKO. They should perform qPCR analyses for Yap/Taz mRNA to confirm efficient ablation in cDKO.</italic> </p><p>We observed that, in addition to myelinating SCs, fibroblasts, perineurial cells and presumably also vascular cells strongly express Yap/Taz both in developing and mature sciatic nerves (e.g., asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, we primarily used immunohistochemistry with a SC specific Sox10 antibody to evaluate SC-selective deletion of Yap/Taz in cDKO mice (see also our response to #4). Nonetheless, as suggested, we have carried out RT-qPCR for Yap/Taz mRNA. Total RNA was extracted from P60 sciatic nerves of 3 WT and 3 cDKO mice and used for RT-qPCR with primers in exons 2 and 3 of Yap or exons 3 and 4 of Taz, because exon 3 is deleted in both Yap and Taz knockout mice (Xin et al., 2011). We detected ~22% of Yap mRNA and ~48% of Taz mRNA in the cDKO, compared to WT. These results are now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>. These results are comparable to those we obtained with Western blotting of Yap and Taz at P60 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The reason for the apparently small decrease in Taz mRNA at P60 is not inefficient recombination; Taz recombination is efficient, as evident from the large decrease in Taz protein levels at P4 in cDKO compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Please note that there is residual background Taz protein at P4 in cDKO, which is maintained at similar levels at P60 in cDKO. Please also note that at P60, WT Taz protein levels are much reduced compared to P4, and are only ~2-fold higher than background; hence it is not surprising that at P60, WT Taz mRNA is similarly only ~2-fold over background. We attribute the background levels of Yap mRNA, Taz mRNA and protein to a combination of perineurial cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells and residual partially recombined SCs (i.e., &lt;20% SCs; see our response to #4).</p><p><italic>2) The paper by Poitelon et al. presented convincing data that the axonal sorting defects in the Yap/Taz conditional mutants are primarily caused by downregulation of laminin receptors Î±6Î²1 integrin and dystroglycan (with minor differences in proliferation), whereas Grove et al. argue equally convincingly that delayed S phase entry and reduced proliferation are the main reasons. It would be important to know whether Grove et al. also see the downregulation of laminin receptors.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. First, it is important to note that Poitelon et al. analyzed mainly Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET mice, whereas we used Yap/Taz cDKO mice. Although Poitelon et al. reported no reduction in total SCs in Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET (despite the much reduced SC proliferation at P3 that they observed), they commented that ââ¦by P20 the total number of SCs was decreased in double-cKO mice, which were not used in subsequent studiesâ¦â. Thus, Poitelon et al. also observed a reduction in number of SCs in Yap/Taz cDKO mice.</p><p>Second, as suggested, we have now examined laminin receptor expression in Yap/Taz cDKO sciatic nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We concentrated on integrin Î±6, which appeared most strongly downregulated in Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET, whereas downregulation of dystroglycan or other laminin receptors seemed less obvious (Poitelon et al., 2016). We used immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR to show that integrin Î±6 is indeed strongly downregulated in Yap/Taz cDKO sciatic nerves at P4 and P60; this new data appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>. Residual integrin Î±6 observed in cDKO in Westerns and RT-qPCR is likely due to strong expression of integrin Î±6 in perineurial cells (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, and Poitelon et al., 2016). Notably, in the P60 cDKO, no integrin Î±6 is associated with single axons or with axons in small bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>); i.e., radial sorting is able to proceed (abnormally slowly) in the absence of integrin Î±6 in Yap/Taz cDKO SCs.</p><p>Lastly, earlier studies showed that integrin Î±6Î²1 and dystroglycan synergize to increase SC number and proliferation, thereby regulating radial sorting, and that ablation of laminin prevents radial sorting due to reduced SC number and proliferation (Pellegatta et al., 2013, Berti et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2005). It is therefore possible that downregulation of laminin receptors in Yap/Taz cDKO SCs <italic>contributes</italic> to reducing SC proliferation, thereby <italic>contributing</italic> to delaying, but not preventing, radial sorting.</p><p><italic>3) Radial sorting impairment is present at all time points analyzed and to corroborate the delay the authors should calculate the number of SC in 1:1 association with axons at all time points analyzed.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have calculated the number of SCs in 1:1 association with axons at P18 and P60. We calculated the number of 1:1s per field of view in 3 WT, 3 Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET and 3 Yap/Taz cDKO mice; we counted the number of promyelinating- and the number of myelinating 1:1s at each time point. The data is newly presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. This shows that at P18, there is a significant delay at the promyelination stage in Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET sciatic nerves, as we described in the original submission. Furthermore, while WT and Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET sciatic nerves have no promyelinating SCs at P60, Yap/Taz cDKO sciatic nerves have a significant number, ~210 promyelinating SCs per FOV. Hence, Yap/Taz cDKO SCs gradually (abnormally slowly) sort large-caliber axons, but there is a block in progression from promyelination to myelination.</p><p><italic>4) Subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, third paragraph: It is troubling to read that some 20% of DKO SC remain Yap/Taz positive, although &quot;weakly&quot;, with this staining remaining constant between P4 and P20 (the data are not shown, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> which shows a lot of residual non-nuclear Yap/Taz). This suggests that even after successful recombination these proteins remain quite stable, possibly due to their physical anchorage in the cells (yet at a different level than the compensatory expression in heterozygous mice). It also brings up the question how early both genes are expressed (i.e. prior to P0-Cre expression) and could different turnover rates of Yap/Taz (possibly related to environmental/nutritional/stress factors) relate to phenotypical differences of DKO mice in different labs.</italic> </p><p><italic>Related issues raised:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the subsection âYap/Taz are required for myelination of sorted axonsâ, the authors claim (with reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that the remaining MBP staining in Yap/Taz cDKO is from &quot;rare SCs which retained strong Yap/Taz immunoreactivity&quot;.</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection âYap/Taz are required for myelination of sorted axonsâ, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>: what could be the reason for &quot;faint signals&quot; in 20% of cells at that adult age? Cre â recombination is early and should be all or none.</italic> </p><p><italic>Also, the IHC of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows SC expressing low levels of Yap/Taz.</italic> </p><p>We understand the concerns of the reviewer regarding the ~20% SCs that we counted as Yap/Taz positive in Yap/Taz cDKO. We have carried out additional analyses to confirm efficient recombination/deletion in our Yap/Taz cDKO and iDKO mice. These include new qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), counting axon bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>), counting SC profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), additional immunostaining (Figure 2E2, 4F), additional Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), counting Yap/Taz+, Krox20+ SCs and SC profiles in iDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>). We also strengthen our statements in the text about the reasons for excluding the possibility that the delayed radial sorting that we report is due to incomplete deletion of Yap/Taz in our cDKO mice.</p><p>First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, to which the reviewer refers, was adjusted for greater overall brightness with the intention of making these small magnification images more visible. In addition, the buffer in the Click-It kit that we used to identify EdU+ nuclei seemed to increase background in subsequent immunostaining with other antibodies. We have now replaced these images with images in which brightness has not been adjusted. Yap/Taz immunoreactivity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cDKO SCs is either completely undetectable (e.g., #3 SC) or low (e.g., #1, 2) compared to WT SCs. Please also note that the newly provided Figure 2E2 shows two types of SCs that we counted as Yap/Taz positive in cDKO: #1 SC, which retains âstrong Yap/Taz immunoreactivityâ and is also MBP+; and #2 SC, which is MBP-negative and only weakly immunopositive for Yap/Taz. Because we also observed many more SCs (e.g., #3, 4, 5, 6 SCs) that exhibit absolutely no Yap/Taz immunoreactivity in cDKO, we counted #2 type SCs as Yap/Taz-positive although they exhibit very low or âfaint signalsâ. These weakly labeled SCs represent most of the ~20% SCs that we considered to have âresidual Yap/Tazâ in our rigorous quantitative analysis.</p><p>We are not certain, however, of the specificity of this residual Yap/Taz immunoreactivity and we speculate that the weak immunoreactivity at least in part may be non-specific background labeling of some SC nuclei. We have screened more commercial antibodies but cannot find additional antibodies that specifically recognize both Yap and Taz (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Please also note that, because non-SCs (presumably perineurial cells and fibroblasts) strongly express Yap/Taz both in developing and mature sciatic nerves, we primarily rely on SC-selective immunohistochemistry, rather than Western blotting or qRT-PCR to evaluate recombination/deletion in our cDKO and iDKO mouse lines. Another speculative explanation, which we have now described better in the result section, is that most of the residual Yap/Taz immunoreactivity in ~20% SCs may represent an undeleted allele of Yap, which we found to be insufficient to complete myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B; P60</xref> Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET).</p><p>Another possibility, which the reviewer raised, is that these âresidual Yap/Tazâ are proteins that remain stably in the SC nuclei, even after extended periods. Yap/Taz are expressed in Sox10+ neural crest derived cells at E10.5 (Serinagaoglu et al., 2015); hence Yap/Taz are indeed expressed prior to when P0-Cre drives SC-selective deletion of Yap/Taz. However, we think it unlikely that residual Yap/Taz would remain in cDKO SCs even at P60. This is based on our finding that most adult SCs lack Yap/Taz 3 weeks after inducible ablation; i.e., nuclear Yap/Taz does not appear to be exceptionally stable in adult Schwann cells.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to consider whether different turnover rates of Yap/Taz could explain phenotypic differences between cDKO mice in our study and that of Poitelon et al., but we do not think that there is a phenotypic difference. Poitelon et al. examined cDKO mice up to P20, and most of their data was from Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET mice. The phenotypes of our and Poitelon et al.âs Yap-cKO, Taz-cKO, Yap-cKO/Taz-cHET and Taz-cKO/Yap-cHET mice are all quite similar up to ~P20. For example, Poitelon et al. reported that cDKO mice had a complete block in radial sorting at P20. Similarly, we observed a major block in radial sorting at P18 in the proximal sciatic nerves. Notably, however, we found that more sorting had occurred at P18 in distal nerves. Poitelon et al. did not examine cDKO mice after P20, whereas we examined them up to P60, when we observed more advanced radial sorting.</p><p>Lastly, regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, we now provide new quantification data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) to show that our iDKO mice lines effectively induced deletion of Yap and Taz.</p><p><italic>5) The authors conclude that the reduction of Krox20 expression (see title) causes the myelination delay, but also report that ~15% of SCs are Krox20+ throughout development and adulthood (subsection âYap/Taz are required for Krox20 upregulationâ). If failing Krox20 expression were the only problem, shouldn't these SC proceed to myelination? Here also the conclusions should be more precise.</italic> </p><p>Please note that the percentage of Krox20+ SCs (~15%) is similar to that of Yap/Taz+ SCs (~20%) in Yap/Taz-cDKO sciatic nerves. Moreover, similar to our procedure for counting of Yap/Taz+ SCs in the cDKO, we included those SCs that were only weakly immunopositive as Krox20+ SCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that few SCs have high levels of Krox20, and that most have lower levels or do not express it. Notably, Le et al., (Le et al., 2005) have generated hypomorphic Krox20 mice (Egr2lo/lo) that express mRNA and protein levels of Krox20 that are reduced 3-fold compared to WT sciatic nerves. SCs in these Egr2lo/lo mice are arrested at the promyelination stage, similar to Krox20-KO SCs. Therefore, we would not anticipate that Yap/Taz cDKO SCs expressing low levels of Krox20 would proceed to myelination. As suggested, we have modified conclusive statements.</p><p><italic>6) The fact that tamoxifen-dependent Yap/Taz deletion in the adult by Sox10-CreERT2 or Plp-CreERT2 leads to an astonishingly rapid death is attributed to the observed changes in peripheral myelin and the PNS. The PNS defects are clearly shown, and it is equally obvious that there is no major structural alteration in CNS myelin. Nevertheless, one should be more cautious in claiming that the PNS defects are the cause of death.</italic> </p><p><italic>Given that Sox10 is expressed in other neural crest-derived cell types, does Yap/Taz deletion in other Sox10-expressing cells in Sox10- creERT2-driven iDKO mice cause acute mouse death? The authors mentioned as data-not-shown that Plp-creERT2-driven iDKO mice gave a similar phenotype in demyelination, it would be important to show the data to confirm the demyelination or axonal loss phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the causes of Yap/Taz iDKO mouse death should be interpreted cautiously and analyzed further. We have amended related statements. Our response to #11 comment offers one possible explanation (see below). We were also surprised that both lines of Yap/Taz iDKO mice driven by Sox10-creERT2 or Plp-creERT2 died within a month after the 1<sup>st</sup> tamoxifen injection, exhibiting similar segmental demyelination phenotypes in the peripheral nerve. We are currently examining whether induced deletion of Yap/Taz in SCs has more detrimental effects besides segmental demyelination and whether it acutely paralyzes neuromuscular functions. We also plan to examine other cell types potentially affected in both lines of iDKO mice. As suggested, we now provide a semi-thin image of Plp-creERT2 driven iDKO sciatic nerve (Figure 6E5), which shows a demyelination phenotype similar to that in Sox10-creER iDKO nerves (Figure 6E1-E4).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>: why is Yap localized in nuclei of Taz KO samples, unlike the control? This is an important point as validation of these antibodies is crucial for the entire study.</italic> </p><p>Yap is localized in the nuclei of both control and Taz cKO sciatic nerves. Arrows in the figure now mark examples of SC nuclei in the control. It is also noteworthy that Yap is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, but not in all nuclei, in the control. Other figures show that Yap is expressed in myelinating, but not in non-myelinating, SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The authors claim that at P60 the majority of fibers reach a 1:1 association (subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, first paragraph), despite the significant impairments in overall SC number and proliferation. Is there an effect on axon numbers in mutant nerves?</italic> </p><p>We regret the confusing statements. We did not mean that radial sorting was almost complete in cDKO at P60 and now corrected this misconception in the Results section. We also provide new data consisting of counts of axon bundles of unsorted axons and promyelinating SCs in P60 cDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although we observed many sorted axons in Yap/Taz cDKO at P60, we frequently observed small bundles of unsorted axons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and occasionally large axon bundles (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3D</xref>; low magnification image of ventral root). More specifically, at P60, while there are no bundles of unsorted axons in WT, cDKO sciatic nerves contain 86.1 small bundles (2-5 axons; ****P&lt;0.0001) and 5.3 large axon bundles (&gt;5 axons) per field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>). This compares to 210 promyelinating SCs per field of view in the cDKO at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, a considerable number of axons remained unsorted in cDKO mice at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with their markedly reduced number of SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>There are several reasons why we did not count axon numbers in P60 cDKO nerve, for which extensive quantitative EM analysis would be required for accurate counting of amyelinated atrophied axons, including unsorted axons tightly packed in small bundles. First, our finding that a considerable number of axons remained unsorted precludes having to postulate that substantial axon death occurred in cDKO nerves. Second, our EM analysis of cDKO nerves revealed no signs of axon degeneration. This result is consistent with earlier studies of developmental amyelination that reported no axon loss. Third, our comprehensive analysis of muscle innervation in P55 cDKO mice did not show degeneration of intramuscular axons or axon terminals; all muscle fibers remained innervated by single axons, exhibiting no abnormal patterns of innervation or denervation (n&gt;6 muscles, &gt;400 NMJs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In summary, we are quite confident suggesting that axons in cDKO do not degenerate at least up to P60.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: cDKO nerves have an important reduction in SCs number throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Surprisingly this reduction is not corroborated by a substantial defect in SCs proliferation. The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows a significant decrease in SC proliferation at P0, but normal or even increased levels at P4, P18 and P60. How do the authors reconcile these results given that there is no effect on apoptosis? The experiments supporting these conclusions, in particular the IHC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref> at P18 do not show colocalization between Sox10 and Ki67.</italic> </p><p>Because non-SCs, in addition to Sox10+ SCs, proliferate, there are Ki67+ but Sox10- cells in P4 WT, P4 cDKO and P18 cDKO. These proliferating non-SCs might have given the erroneous impression to the reviewer that there is no Sox10/ Ki67 colocalization in the figure. We have now specifically marked Sox10+ and Ki67+ cells in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. The unique strength of our studies of Yap/Taz cDKO and iDKO mice is in our use of SC-specific Sox10 antibody, which enabled us to exclude the responses of non-SCs in our analyses.</p><p>In WT sciatic nerves, SC proliferation peaks between E16.5 and P0, and then decreases as radial sorting comes to an end and SCs initiate myelination (Jessen and Mirsky, Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2005). Our data show markedly impaired SC proliferation in cDKO during the peak period (E17.5 and P0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we observed markedly reduced numbers of SCs in P4 cDKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We believe that the ââ¦normal or even increased levels of SC proliferationâ in P4 cDKO is largely due to residual Yap/Taz in cDKO SC nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The ââ¦normal or even increased levels of proliferationâ in P18 and P60 cDKO is highly likely because radial sorting continues abnormally and SCs fail to differentiate (i.e., to initiate myelination) in Yap/Taz cDKO mice. It is important to note, however, that, although cDKO SCs continue to proliferate, their proliferation sharply decreases to insignificant levels by P18. Consistent with this result, we observed only a slight increase in SC number in cDKO after P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we consider cDKO SC proliferation after P4 to be only minimal and think that there is no discrepancy in SC proliferation and number in our analysis of cDKO mice, which showed no SC apoptosis at least up to P60.</p><p><italic>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> the staining for Yap/Taz is not clear. It seems that all SC are Yap/Taz positive, but this is in sharp contrast with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, where only 60% of cells are Yap/Taz+.</italic> </p><p>In addition to myelinating SCs, we frequently observed non-SCs (presumably fibroblasts, perineurial and vascular cells) that strongly express Yap/Taz both in developing and mature sciatic nerves (e.g., asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These Yap/Taz+ non-SCs often give the mistaken impression, particularly at low magnifications such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, that all SCs are Yap/Taz positive. In addition, the buffer in the Click-It kit that we used to identify EdU+ nuclei seemed to increase background in subsequent immunostaining, which might have caused some background-stained SC nuclei to appear Yap/Taz positive. We have now replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> with an image that better displays SCs not expressing Yap/Taz (i.e., non-myelinating SCs) even at low magnifications. We used high magnifications and a SC specific, Sox10 antibody, to count Yap/Taz+ SCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>. The Click-It kit was not used in this analysis.</p><p><italic>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Yap/Taz iDKO mice exhibit a strong slowing of nerve conduction from ~50 m/s to ~15 m/s, which would suggest the loss of many large diameter axons. However, this phenomenon does not match the morphological features of the mutant nerves where many large diameter axons remain present. The authors should provide quantification data showing the degree of demyelination, axonal loss and reduction of Krox20 in SCs to reflect the remarkable decrease in conduction velocity. Is it possible that the phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is due to a reduced number of SC as in development? Have the authors checked for SC numbers, survival and proliferation in iDKO?</italic> </p><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that demyelination alone cannot explain markedly decreased nerve conduction velocity and that it is necessary to postulate additional massive loss of large-caliber axons. It is our understanding that demyelination of an axon <italic>at the level of one internode</italic> may even cause conduction block along the axon: âIn paranodal demyelination, the initial outward current at the next node is dissipated over a larger area. If the next node can be depolarized to threshold after a larger duration current, saltatory conduction is slowed but preserved; with more severe demyelination insufficient current is available to depolarize the next node to threshold and the action potential will extinguishâ (Franssen and van den Bergh, 2006). In addition, earlier studies have commonly reported slow components (&lt;5 m/s) of dispersed nerve conduction, as we observed in iDKO mice, and attributed them to unmyelinated large-caliber axons (e.g., Bremer et al., 2011).</p><p>As suggested, we have examined more semithin and EM sections of both lines of iDKO mice at 20 days after 1<sup>st</sup> tamoxifen injection, and observed no evidence of substantial axon loss (data not shown, see below). We have also quantified Yap/Taz+ SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), demyelinating profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and Krox20+ SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), as requested by the reviewer. Notably, we found that ~22% of axons were demyelinating or demyelinated on analyses of transverse sections (i.e., at the level of one internode). Although demyelination seems only partial (i.e., ~22%), axons that appear normal at one internode may have multiple demyelinated internodes at other locations along the entire length of sciatic nerve. This notion is strongly supported by our images of <italic>longitudinal</italic> sections of both lines of iDKO mice, wherein along a single axon, demyelinated internodes are adjacent to myelinated internodes (e.g., demyelinated internodes marked by red âaâ in Figure 6E4, 6E5). Therefore, it is quite possible, in our opinion, that segmental (not uniform) demyelination that is widespread among the axons of iDKO mice can markedly reduce nerve conduction and be fatal.</p><p>Nonetheless, as mentioned above in comment #6, we do not exclude the possibility that induced ablation of Yap/Taz not only causes demyelination but also affects myelinating SCs in additional harmful ways. This is the focus of our ongoing study, which we hope will soon provide additional insights into the robust phenotype and acute death of Yap/Taz iDKO mice. Lastly, as suggested by the reviewer, we have carried out a small number of additional experiments to check SC numbers and proliferation in iDKO: We have found that SCs are not reduced and that proliferation appears only marginally above background. We plan to provide these data when we report the results of our ongoing study.</p><p><italic>12) The authors show that Tead1 binds the MSE element of the Krox20 gene by ChIP-PCR, and claim that Yap/Taz interaction of Tead1 regulates Krox20 gene expression. However, Tead1 transcription factor can bind to many elements and its binding may not necessarily alter Krox20 gene expression. The Yap/Taz regulation of Krox20 may not even be direct. The authors should mutate the putative Tead1 binding sites to demonstrate that Krox20 transcription is inhibited. It would be also important to know whether Yap/Taz interaction with Tead1 is required for activating Krox20 expression and/or the MSE element activity.</italic> </p><p>The fact that TEAD1 binds to the MSE in vivo makes it highly unlikely that TEAD1 may have no role in regulating Krox20 expression. TEADs bind two families of transcriptional cofactors: Yap/Taz and Vgll proteins; interestingly, Yap/Taz and Vgll compete for binding to TEAD, but regulate different sets of genes (Pobbati et al., 2012); hence, as we found that Yap/Taz are required for Krox20 expression, it suggests that Yap/Taz complex with TEAD1 to regulate Krox20. In support of this, Svarenâs group recently reported that TEAD1 siRNA led to downregulation of Krox20 expression in primary rat SCs (Lopez-Anido et al., 2016). Also, Tricaudâs group reported that co-expressing Yap and TEAD1 constructs induced maximal Krox20 promoter activity in primary rat SCs (Fernando et al., 2016), strongly suggesting that Yap directly regulates Krox20 transcription, through TEAD1. Notably, our ChIP analysis also shows that TEAD1 binds to the Krox20 promoter 10-fold over control levels, and our preliminary ChIP data shows Yap/Taz binding to the same region of the Krox20 MSE as TEAD1. These data therefore provide additional support for the notion that TEAD1 mediates Krox20 upregulation by Yap/Taz.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer, however, that TEAD1 is highly unlikely to be the sole transcriptional factor with which Yap/Taz interacts, and that more direct evidence is required to establish Yap/Taz-TEAD1 regulation of Krox20. We have begun comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies to learn how Yap/Taz regulates Krox20 transcription, which will include mutating putative TEAD1 binding sites in the Krox20 MSE and promoter and use of TEAD binding mutants of Yap/Taz, as the reviewer suggested. In addition, we plan in vivo pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting TEAD1 (Liu-Chittenden et al., 2012). We appreciate the reviewerâs valuable comments. We have now toned down our statements related to the claim.</p><p><italic>13) The authors do not present any mechanisms of upstream Hippo signalling, independent or dependent on Lats and Mst kinases, mechanical forces, involvement of actin cytoskeleton, etc.. Therefore, the authors should at least discuss these aspects and reference relevant work.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we now provide the following paragraph as a discussion of potential upstream signals regulating Yap/Taz in SCs.</p><p>âOur findings show that Yap/Taz regulate not only proliferation but also differentiation of SCs, driving radial sorting, developmental myelination and myelin maintenance. [â¦] Therefore, it is likely that additional pathways are also involved in Yap/Taz regulation. An intriguing possibility is that Yap/Taz are downstream of regulators of developmental myelination, including Neuregulin 1-type III, integrin Î±6Î²1, G-protein coupled receptor Gpr126 and Wnt (Feltri et al., 2002, Monk et al., 2011, Pereira et al., 2009, Petersen et al., 2015, Taveggia et al., 2005, Azzolin et al., 2014)â¦â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The authors have carefully addressed all comments and questions that were raised by the referees.

Please adjust.</italic> </p><p>We now explicitly stated in the third paragraph of the subsection âYAP/TAZ are required for timely axon sortingâ that âThe discrepancy â¦ due to the fact that Poitelon et al. examined <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> cDKO up to P20 â¦whereas we analyzed them more thoroughly up to P60.â.</p><p><italic>2) We are not convinced that there is &quot;better axon sorting in distal nerves of cDKO at P18&quot; (subsection âYap/Taz are required for timely axon sortingâ, third paragraph), a conclusion based merely on low magnification semi-thin sections. Please be more cautious.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the statement.</p><p><italic>3) The correlation of &quot;weak staining in YAP/TAZ&quot; and the failure of mutant SC to enter S phase is too speculative. Unless the expression of cyclins is provided, this conclusion should be softened (subsection âYap/Taz are required for S-phase entry and proper proliferation of immature Schwann cellsâ, second paragraph).</italic> </p><p>We have softened the statement referred by the reviewer and also amended title of the subsection (âYAP/TAZ are required for proper proliferation of immature Schwann cellsâ, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) There is no strong evidence of TAZ/YAP directly activating Krox20 in Schwann cells and the authors themselves stated &quot;These results suggest that Yap/Taz directly regulate Schwann cell myelination most likely by activating transcription of Krox20&quot; (Discussion, third paragraph). Thus, the paper's title (&quot;Yap/Taz initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination by upregulating Krox20&quot;) appears too strong of a statement. YAP/TAZ may regulate many other factors required for Schwann cell myelination. In the absence of evidence demonstrating the ability of TAZ/YAP to upregulate Krox20, e.g. by overexpression studies, the title should be adjusted.</italic> </p><p>â[â¦]by upregulating Krox20â is removed in the new title.</p><p><italic>5) The authors added &quot;new data&quot; for the iDKO/PlpCreERT phenotype as a single image in Figure 6E5.
