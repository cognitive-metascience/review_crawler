H2A.Z is deposited by the SWR1 chromatin remodeler and evicted by unclear mechanisms. We tracked H2A.Z in living yeast at single-molecule resolution, and found that H2A.Z eviction is dependent on RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and the Kin28/Cdk7 kinase, which phosphorylates Serine 5 of heptapeptide repeats on the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest Pol II subunit Rpb1. These findings link H2A.Z eviction to transcription initiation, promoter escape and early elongation activities of Pol II. Because passage of Pol II through +1 nucleosomes genome-wide would obligate H2A.Z turnover, we propose that global transcription at yeast promoters is responsible for eviction of H2A.Z. Such usage of yeast Pol II suggests a general mechanism coupling eukaryotic transcription to erasure of the H2A.Z epigenetic signal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone variant</kwd><kwd>H2A.Z</kwd><kwd>gene promoters</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA Polymerase II</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM125831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM127538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lionnet</surname><given-names>Timothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luk</surname><given-names>Ed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>HHMI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transcription Imaging Consortium, Janelia Research Campus</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lionnet</surname><given-names>Timothee</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Vu Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007880</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bloomberg Distinguished Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone variant H2A.Z is deposited near transcription start sites by the chromatin remodeler SWR1 and seems to be removed by RNA polymerase II at an early stage of transcription elongation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The H2A.Z variant of canonical histone H2A serves as a key chromatin constituent of the epigenome, providing a unique nucleosome architecture and molecular signature for eukaryotic gene transcription and other chromosome activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>). H2A.Z is enriched at most promoters and enhancers genome-wide, and plays a role in establishing a permissive chromatin state for regulated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>). H2A.Z is incorporated in nucleosomes flanking DNase hypersensitive, nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs), especially at the so-called ‘+1 nucleosome’ overlapping with or immediately downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>). The deposition of H2A.Z in budding yeast is catalyzed by the conserved SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex in an ATP-dependent reaction involving exchange of nucleosomal H2A-H2B for H2A.Z-H2B dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide studies have shown that compared to nucleosomes in the gene body, the +1 nucleosome undergoes higher turnover, which is not correlated with the level of mRNA transcription by Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dion et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grimaldi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rufiange et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the disruptive passage of Pol II through +1 nucleosomes during infrequent mRNA transcription is unlikely to account for H2A.Z eviction on a global scale. Biochemical studies have suggested that yeast H2A.Z eviction could be due to chromatin remodeling in reverse mediated by SWR1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) or the related INO80 remodeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2011</xref>), but other biochemical studies found no supporting evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, genome-wide assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been proposed to evict H2A.Z, but the key event in this multistep process remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). To determine the dominant mechanism of H2A.Z turnover after incorporation, we took an independent approach using single-particle tracking that directly measures the levels of chromatin-free and bound H2A.Z in the physiological environment of living yeast cells, in wild type and conditional mutants for histone eviction.</p><p>Single-particle tracking (SPT) of fluorescently tagged proteins in live cells has emerged as a robust imaging technique to determine kinetic behaviors of protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elf and Barkefors, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Tjian, 2018</xref>). For chromatin-interacting proteins, SPT is complementary to genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing technologies (ChIP-seq) without the general caveats of chemical fixation and chromatin manipulations. SPT directly measures the fast-diffusing, chromatin-free population as well as the quasi-immobile, chromatin-bound fraction tracking with macroscopic chromosome movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Tjian, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taddei and Gasser, 2012</xref>). Here, we combine SPT in yeast with conditional depletion of candidate regulators to study the dynamic deposition and eviction of histone H2A.Z. Our results indicate a prominent role of RNA Polymerase II in the removal of H2A.Z from chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tracking single molecules of histones and remodeler SWR1</title><p>We fused the self-labeling HaloTag to H2A.Z, H2B, and Swr1 (the catalytic subunit of the SWR1 complex) for sole source expression under native promoter control and validated the function of these fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Cells were washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer and digested with RNase (1 mg/ml) and RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) overnight at 37<sup>◦</sup>C on a rotator. Proteins were digested with Proteinase K (1 µg/µl) at 50<sup>◦</sup>C for 30 min. Cells were stained with 2 µM SYTOX (Tris buffer) at 4<sup>◦</sup>C for 4 hr and sonicated on Diagenode Biorupter 300 for 10 s at high setting. Cells were scanned on LSR II FACS instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture and labeling</title><p>Cells were grown and imaged in CSM media (Complete Supplement Mixture) supplemented with 40 mg/L adenine hemisulfate. The JF646-HaloTag ligand was synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). The new JF552 dye has a higher signal to noise ratio and is more photostable than JF646. The JF552 dye is a modification of JF549, with similar brightness, but enhanced cell permeability that allows its use for SPT in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). For in vivo labeling, early log phase cells (O.D<sub>600</sub> 0.2) were labeled with JF-HaloTag ligand (10 nM for JF646 and 20 nM for JF552) for two hours at 30 degrees in suspension culture. Cells were washed four times with CSM to remove free dye.</p><p>Prior to use, 0.17 mm coverslips (Ø 25 mm, Electron Microscopy Services) were flamed to remove punctuated surface auto-fluorescence and to suppress dye binding, and coated with Concanvalin A (2 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, and air-dried for one hour. Coverslips were assembled in a Ø 35 mm Attofluor chamber (Invitrogen). A 1 ml cell suspension was immobilized for 10 min and live cells were imaged in CSM media at room temperature. For anchor away experiments, rapamycin (1 µg/ml) was added one hour prior to imaging, and cells were imaged in the presence of rapamycin. Two biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell cycle synchronization</title><p>Cells were synchronized in G1 by adding α factor for 2 hr (3 µg/ml at 0 min and additional 2 and 1 µg/ml at 60 and 90 min respectively). High autofluorescence did not allow SMT in presence of α factor, which was removed by replacing culture medium. Cells released from G1 at room temperature took 40 min to enter S phase. Both for Pre-S and S phase SMT, cells were stained and synchronized in suspension culture and immobilized right before SMT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Wide-field single molecule imaging with epi-Illumination microscope</title><p>Single-molecule imaging was conducted on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 150X/1.35 glycerin-immersion objective. Cells of interest were identified under infrared illumination (750 nm, 10 nm FWHM) using a near IR-CCD camera (IDS UI-3370CP-NIR-GL) and Semrock 743 nm/25 nm FWHM filter. A 555 nm (Crystalaser) or 637 nm (Vortran) laser was used for dye excitation, typically at 100 mW total power (TTL pulsed). All laser beams were spectrally filtered and combined using a custom beam combiner (by J.W., details available upon request). A Semrock FF01-750/SP filter was included at the output to remove any residual near infrared emission from lasers. Combined laser beams were collimated into a 2m-long Qioptic fiber (kineFLEX-P-2-S-405.640–0.7-APC-P2) with output through a 12 mm EFL reflective collimator (Thorlabs). The resulting Ø6mm Gaussian beam was introduced into the back port of the microscope. The following cubes were utilized in the microscope turret to direct excitation light towards the sample and filter fluorescence: 1) for JF646 - 648 beamsplitter and 676/29 nm filter, 2) for JF552 - 561 beamsplitter and 612/69 nm filter. Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu C9100-13 back-illuminated EM-CCD camera through additional FF01-750/SP and NF03-405/488/561/635E quad-notch filters. The camera was operated at −80°C with a typical EM gain of 1200 and directly controlled by laser emission via the TTL signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Images were obtained using either 637 nm laser (JF646) or 555 nm laser (JF552), of excitation intensity ~1KW/cm<sup>2</sup> and for each field of view ~7000 frames were captured. Single molecules were tracked using DiaTrack Version 3.05 software, with the following settings; remove blur 0.1, remove dim 70–100, maximum jump six pixels. Single molecule images were collected after pre-bleach of initial intense fluorescence (glow). While imaging with JF646, a 405 nm laser excitation (1–10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, TTL pulses 2–5 ms per frame) was triggered to maintain single fluorophore detection density. Immobilized cells in CSM media were imaged over a 90 min imaging session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of single-molecule images</title><p>Movies with two dimensional single molecule data were analyzed by DiaTrack Version 3.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vallotton and Olivier, 2013</xref>), which determines the precise position of single molecules by Gaussian intensity fitting and assembles particle trajectories over multiple frames. In Diatrack remove blur was set to 0.1, remove dim set at 70 and max jump set at five pixels, where each pixel was 107 nm. Trajectory data exported from Diatrack was further analyzed by a custom computational package ‘Sojourner’ (by S.L.). The package is available on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdrr.io/github/sheng-liu/sojourner/">https://rdrr.io/github/sheng-liu/sojourner/</ext-link>). The Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) was calculated for all trajectories six frames or longer. Diffusion coefficients for individual molecules were calculated by unconstrained linear fit (R<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.8) of the MSD values computed for time lags ranging from 2 dt to 5 dt, where dt = 10 ms is the time interval between frames, and slope of linear fit was divided by 4 (pre-factor for 2-dimensional Brownian motion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qian et al., 1991</xref>). The histogram of log converted diffusion coefficients was fitted with double gaussian function from the ‘mixtools’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benaglia et al., 2009</xref>) to estimate the fraction of chromatin-bound molecules (mean range between 0.050–0.112 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). Standard error on the mean of each gaussian fit parameter was estimated using a bootstrap resampling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Efron, 1979</xref>).</p><p>The Spot-On analysis was performed on trajectories three frames or longer using the web-interface <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spoton.berkeley.edu/">https://spoton.berkeley.edu/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). The bound fractions and diffusion coefficients were extracted from the CDF of observed displacements over different time intervals.

after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Live-cell single particle imaging reveals the role of RNA polymerase II in histone H2A.Z eviction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John T Lis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As you will see from the individual reviews attached below all the reviewers found that the single-molecule experiments were carefully carried out and that the data is of high quality. However, in the discussion amongst the reviewers it was also agreed that the findings do not go sufficiently beyond the work in Tramantano et al., 2016. The reviewers felt that if additional experiments can be carried out to identify where in the transcription cycle H2A.Z is evicted, then the results would contribute both important and novel insights. These experiments as suggested by reviewers 2 and 3, could involve looking at RRP6 and XRN1 mutants and inhibitors of Cdk9. Such experiments would not only provide an important technologically distinct confirmation of previous conclusions from Tramantano et al., 2016 but provide sufficient new mechanistic insight to pass the bar for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p>As it is unclear how long it would take to acquire the necessary data, the reviewers concluded that the current manuscript should be rejected. We would however welcome a resubmission should additional data become available that addresses the reviewer concerns. Please feel free to communicate with us if you would like any clarification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>The histone variant H2AZ is often present near transcription start sites in yeast. How the steady state levels of this variant are maintained and the consequences of regulating H2AZ dynamics are areas of active study. While some in vitro studies have suggested that IN080 plays a role in evicting H2AZ, others have not. Further, previous work using ChIP-based methods (Tramantano et al., 2016) has indicated that rather than INO80, the Pol II transcription machinery plays a major role in evicting H2AZ histones from the +1 position at transcription start sites. Here the authors use live cell single particle tracking microscopy to directly study the effects of depleting different transcription regulators on H2AZ dynamics. Using the anchor-away (AA) method they find that H2AZ retention on chromatin (as assessed by the slower diffusing fraction) is decreased upon Swc5-AA and restored by simultaneous Rpb1-AA. In contrast, Ino80-AA does not substantially restore the H2AZ chromatin bound levels that are depleted by Swc5-AA. They further find that inhibition of Kin28 also restores a substantial portion chromatin bound H2AZ that is lost upon Swc5-AA. The authors interpret these results to suggest that H2AZ eviction is driven by the early elongating Pol II and therefore could reflect the consequences of nascent transcription of non-coding RNAs.</p><p>Overall the studies are technically of high quality and the experiments are carried out in a well-controlled manner. The main conclusion that H2AZ eviction depends on both Pol II and its Ser5 phosphorylated state would be of interest to the chromatin community. However, as is, the work does not go substantially beyond the insights obtained from Tramantano et al. At the same time, the hypothesis of non-coding RNA transcription driving H2AZ turnover is attractive and novel. If the authors could provide some test of this hypothesis, this would substantially raise the significance of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript described the role of Pol2 in H2A.Z dynamics by using single-molecule tracking. Authors measure H2A.Z bound fractions in various depletion conditions, concluding that H2A.Z eviction is dependent on Pol2-CTD serine-5p rather than INO80 complex. Although single-molecule tracking for H2A.Z in the various conditions is informative to the field, the biological significance seems to be a large repetition of the results in Tramantano, 2016, with different aspects of technique.

Their correlations tell them that both Pol II and PIC are important for H2A.Z turnover at the +1 nucleosome, but the mechanism is unknown and which part of the PIC is necessary is unclear.

Going back to the paper from which the Wu lab got the Kin28is mutant puts a question mark on their proposed mechanism of H2A.Z turnover.

The H2A.Z variant is highly conserved across species and is known to be a critical: mutants produce slow growth phenotypes in yeast and are lethal in higher organisms. Understanding H2Az is important to evaluate of mechanisms of interplay of chromatin and promoters during gene expression.</p><p>This paper begins by emphasizing that the conserved SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex is responsible for exchanging nucleosomal H2A-H2B for H2A.Z-H2B dimers onto the +1 nucleosome in budding yeast. The +1 nucleosome undergoes much higher turnover than other nucleosomes and the mechanism by which H2A.Z is evicted and replaced by H2A had not been resolved. The authors point out that H2A.Z eviction could be due to chromatin remodeling in reverse mediated by SWR1 itself or the related INO80 remodeler, but a study (Wang et al., 2016) found no supporting evidence for either model. Pol II activity itself is an attractive candidate for H2A.Z eviction, as Pol II transcription can disrupt nucleosome structure, but the amount of H2A.Z eviction from genes does not correlate with the level of mRNA accumulation.</p><p>To assess what is the dominant mechanism of H2A.Z turnover after incorporation, the authors used single particle tracking (SPT) to directly measure the levels of chromatin-free and bound H2A.Z in living yeast cells, in WT and conditional mutants (or in cells treated with a specific Cdk7 inhibitor) of candidates/processes that are hypothesized to be involved in H2A.Z eviction. &quot;SPT measures the fast diffusing, chromatin-free population as well as the quasi-immobile, chromatin-bound fraction tracking with macroscopic chromosome movements&quot;. From these studies, the authors conclude that &quot;H2A.Z eviction is dependent on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) bearing Serine-5 phosphorylation of carboxy-terminal repeats, linking H2A.Z eviction to transcription initiation, promoter escape and early elongation&quot; in yeast, suggesting a</p><p>general mechanism by which noncoding transcription at promoters can lead to H2A.Z erasure.</p><p>The paper is clearly written, the experiments appear to be well performed, and the results are intelligently and clearly presented. A few concerns are cited below, but in my opinion this paper is suited for publication once the points are addressed or an additional experiment is performed using the authors established methods.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the results of tracking &gt;1000 molecules as 2D projections are presented as histograms. Unfortunately, the expected two populations, chromatin-bound and unbound, are not cleanly resolved. Nonetheless, the peak of diffusion coefficients is best fit computationally by a model that is comprised of two populations (chromatin-bound and unbound). This is not completely satisfying, but I do point out that the authors go on to makes a fairly compelling case that their modeling is correct. First, videos are provided to allow the reader to appreciate the high quality of the single-particle tracking. Second, the authors argue that the amount of H2AZ bound is consistent with previous estimates by in vivo crosslinking, and D values are consistent with previous SPT measurements of H2B. The authors could calculate the diffusion coefficients expected based on size of the free H2A.Z and SWR1 complex and perhaps estimate the values for bound forms based on binding constants. In any case, some additional discussion of this limitation of the resolution is warranted, and perhaps some acknowledgement that there could be additional states that are also not resolved. This should require only minor editing.</p><p>2) The amount of mRNA accumulation does not correlate H2A.Z eviction, so the authors evoke the idea that early elongation in terms of short non-coding RNAs at yeast promoters may be responsible for the eviction. Can the authors take existing estimates of this short transcription genome-wide and assess if it correlates with H2A.Z eviction?</p><p>3) Does the eviction of H2A.Z happen in the presence of inhibitors of transcription that act further downstream of Cdk7, for example of the yeast equivalent of Cdk9 (Bur1)? This could serve to pinpoint the eviction at very early steps in the transcription cycle. (These inhibitors may not stop Pol II elongation, but are likely to decrease elongation rates given recently published results in Pombe (Booth et al. 2018 PMID:29416031).</p><p>4) In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;At metazoan enhancers and promoters, turnover of H2A.Z enriched in +1 nucleosomes may be similarly coupled to pervasive ncRNA transcription likely after release from sites of Pol II pausing (Tome et al., 2018).&quot; However, there may not be a lot of ncRNA transcription in paused regions of metazoans, as many estimates of paused Pol II half-life are relatively long and there is not much actual ncRNA transcription that goes through the first nucleosome not destined for pre-mRNA production. Perhaps the presence of a nearby transcriptionally-engaged Pol II (promoter-proximal paused Pol II) is sufficient to lead to the destabilization of the adjacent nucleosome – especially considering there is some forward motion, backtracking and TFIIS RNA realignment cleavage taking place (Nechaev et al. 2010, PMID:20007866). Also, there are factors associated with Pol II at this stage that might somehow stimulate eviction activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55667.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Accordingly, besides Kin28/Cdk7 and Ctk1/Cdk12, we have tested whether H2A.Z eviction is inhibited by 3 additional enzymes acting at different transcription stages (Bur1/Cdk9 kinase for Pol II, Cet1 RNA capping enzyme, and Rrp6 the 3’-5’ exonuclease for noncoding RNA degradation). We have found that among the 5 candidates, only Kin28 affects removal of H2A.Z. Thus, H2A.Z eviction is independent of RNA modifying and metabolizing activities just downstream of CTD Ser5 phosphorylation.

We also wrestled with the published model for the Kin28is mutant, and recognized that the presented model highlighting Pol II accumulation between +1 and +2 nucleosomes after CMK inhibition of Kin28 kinase does not entirely reflect the actual data in the publication, which shows Pol II accumulation in a broader region at the promoter from approx. -150 to + 170 (Figure 5A, C) (Rodriguez-Molina et al., 2016)). Irrespective, we have performed a further control analyzing effects of CMK-treated Kin28is without Swc5-AA. This revealed that Kin28is actually affects H2A.Z deposition (reason unclear), thus limiting the utility of this mutant for testing H2A.Z eviction. Hence, we used an alternative Kin28-AA mutant in a double Kin28-AA; Swc5-AA experiment to unveil the eviction pathway in the new experiment shown in Figure 4. (Importantly, the single Kin28-AA depletion did not adversely affect H2A.Z deposition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C).
