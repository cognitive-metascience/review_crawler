patterned spatiotemporal expression of genes during development. One mode of regulation of signaling-responsive genes is at the level of transcription. Single-cell quantitative studies of transcription have revealed that transcription occurs intermittently, in bursts. Although the effects of many gene regulatory mechanisms on transcriptional bursting have been studied, it remains unclear how morphogen gradients affect this dynamic property of downstream genes. Here we have adapted single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) for use in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc in order to measure nascent and mature mRNA of genes downstream of the Wg and Dpp morphogen gradients. We compared our experimental results with predictions from stochastic models of transcription, which indicated that the transcription levels of these genes appear to share a common method of control via burst frequency modulation. Our data help further elucidate the link between developmental gene regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional bursting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>burst frequency</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>wing disc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carthew</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA080621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakker</surname><given-names>Rachael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1764421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>Madhav</given-names></name><name><surname>Carthew</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>597491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>Madhav</given-names></name><name><surname>Carthew</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental results in Drosophila support a model in which gene expression is fundamentally controlled by morphogens tuning the same transcription parameter for genes that are expressed in highly diverse patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paracrine signaling is a highly conserved means for cells within a tissue to communicate with one another to regulate diverse activities including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and movement. Many of these activities are mediated by changes in gene transcription that are brought about by reception of the signals. Paracrine factors acting as morphogens are a particularly important class of gene regulators. Morphogens form spatially-extended gradients from the source of their synthesis, and elicit different transcription outputs from target genes, depending on local concentration of the morphogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata and Takei, 2004</xref>). Many paracrine signals regulate gene transcription via control of the availability or activity of sequence-specific transcription factors. Some transcription factors regulate assembly of the preinitiation complex composed of Pol II and general factors at the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esnault et al., 2008</xref>). Other factors recruit coregulators that modify nucleosomes or remodel the chromatin architecture of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, transcription is a dynamic process, and thus, molecular models of regulation via PIC assembly or chromatin structure, do not adequately capture what kinetic steps in transcription initiation are being regulated. Recently developed methods have uncovered greater complexity in the transcription initiation process than previously imagined. Genes that are constitutively expressed rarely show uniform and continuous mRNA synthesis. Rather, mRNA synthesis occurs in bursts that are interrupted by periods of dormant output. This phenomenon is known as transcriptional bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suter et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Various studies have explored how mechanisms of gene regulation affect the size and frequency of transcriptional bursts, and thereby affect transcription output. The availability of transcription factors has been shown to affect burst frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ezer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Senecal et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors Bicoid and Dorsal have been studied in great detail with respect to their effects on transcription burst frequency in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holloway and Spirov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Enhancer strength and enhancer-promoter contact correlate with burst frequency of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>). These studies altogether suggest that bursting frequency is potentiated by enhancer-promoter contact and is mediated by transcription factors binding to DNA.</p><p>In this study, we have explored how the Wnt protein Wingless (Wg) and BMP protein Decapentaplegic (Dpp) regulate transcription dynamics of genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc. The Wnt and BMP families of proteins are two highly conserved paracrine factors that can act as morphogens. In canonical Wnt signaling, the binding of extracellular Wnt protein to its transmembrane receptor Frizzled causes Î²-catenin to be stabilized and free to enter the nucleus, where it relieves repression of Wnt-responsive genes by binding to the sequence-specific transcription factor TCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swarup and Verheyen, 2012</xref>). In canonical BMP signaling, ligand binding to receptor triggers phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, which translocate to the nucleus along with co-SMADs, bind to responsive genes, and activate their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamaratoglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi and MassaguÃ©, 2003</xref>).</p><p>To explore the effects of Dpp and Wg signaling on transcription dynamics, we have adapted single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) for use in imaginal disc tissues. We use smFISH to quantify nascent and mature mRNAs for several genes expressed in highly diverse spatial patterns within the wing disc. Taken together, our data suggest that all of the genes investigated are regulated by modulation of their transcription burst frequency by Dpp and Wg even though their mean expression patterns are distinct from one another.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we have explored how the Wg and Dpp morphogens regulate transcription dynamics in the wing disc. Each morphogen is synthesized in a narrow stripe of cells within the disc. Wg is produced in cells at the boundary between Dorsal and Ventral (DV) compartments of the wing pouch, while Dpp is produced in cells at the boundary between Anterior and Posterior (AP) compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These factors form concentration gradients across the disc, and in the case of Dpp, it regulates gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>smFISH analysis of sfGFP-sens mRNA levels in wing imaginal discs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a wing disc outlining different regional domains, and the positions of boundaries between Dorsal (D) - Ventral (V) and Anterior (A) - Posterior (P) compartments of the disc.

RNA spots are segmented by using a pixel intensity value as a cutoff, above which lie true RNA fluorescent spots, and below which lies the background. To select the optimal cutoff for each image stack, a broad range of potential cutoff values are systematically tested, and the number of segmented objects (objectÂ &gt;7 contiguous pixels) is counted for each cutoff tested. Object number plateaus over a range of cutoff values (red arrow). This plateau corresponds to the cutoff levels that correctly identify RNA spots (&lt;5% error from ground truth). 3. Such a cutoff value is then applied as a threshold to identify 2D objects in each section. 4. 2D objects must satisfy two criteria in order to be counted as an RNA spot. One, they must have a corresponding object at least one neighboring z-plane within a diffraction limited radius of 4 pixels. Two, they must be larger (contain more pixels) than corresponding objects in neighboring z-planes. This criterion prevents RNA spots from being counted in multiple z-planes.

With smFISH, a tandem array of fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to a given mRNA are hybridized to fixed and permeabilized tissue. When a sufficient number of oligo probes anneal to one mRNA molecule, the aggregate fluorescence can be detected by standard confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). This method has been developed and applied to many systems, including cell culture, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji and van Oudenaarden, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Little and Gregor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Youk et al., 2010</xref>). We developed a robust smFISH method applicable for imaginal discs (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>We first probed for expression of the <italic>senseless</italic> (<italic>sens</italic>) gene in the wing disc. <italic>Sens</italic> is required for cells to adopt a sensory organ fate, and the gene is expressed in two stripes of cells adjacent to and on either side of the DV boundary in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nolo et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Sens</italic> expression in the wing pouch is induced by Wg, which is expressed by cells located at the DV boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jafar-Nejad et al., 2006</xref>). We probed for <italic>sens</italic> mRNAs expressed from a transgenic version of the <italic>sens</italic> gene. We did so for a number of reasons. First, the genomic transgene rescues the endogenous gene based on function and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2013</xref>). Second, the transgene is tagged such that the amino-terminal coding sequence corresponds to super-fold GFP (sfGFP). By using oligo probes directed against sfGFP, we could easily determine the specificity of detection.</p><p>Discs from <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> animals were probed and imaged by confocal microscopy, revealing the expected pattern of fluorescence localized to two stripes adjacent to the DV midline in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The fluorescence signal was specific for <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> since wing discs from larvae not carrying the transgene gave a low background fluorescence pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The fluorescence signal from <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> discs was sufficiently bright that spots were readily detected in optical sections when imaged under higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The size of each 2D spot was approximately the expected diffraction limit ofÂ ~600 nm for smFISH probes emitting at 633 nm wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipson et al., 1995</xref>). A custom image-analysis pipeline was developed to segment and analyze all of the 3D fluorescent spots in an entire stack of optical sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Details of the segmentation and analysis are provided in the Materials and methods.</p><p>We tested the ability of the pipeline to correctly identify RNA spots by several means. First we expected <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> mRNA molecules to generate fluorescence spots with a homogeneous composition since the mRNAs could equivalently anneal to the probes. The distribution of fluorescence intensity for the identified 3D spots was unimodal, suggesting that the spots had a homogeneous composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Second, we incubated wing discs in medium containing actinomycin-D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis. The number of fluorescence spots was greatly diminished, as would be expected if they were localized to mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Third, if the method is accurate, almost all spots would correspond to <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> mRNAs. We compared the number of identified spots in discs expressing the <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> transgene versus discs lacking the transgene. From this, we estimated that 0.5% of identified spots are false-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, we estimated the number of sfGFP-sens mRNAs that fail to be identified as fluorescent spots. We simultaneously hybridized <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> wing discs with two sets of non-overlapping probes - one set recognized <italic>sfGFP</italic> and the other set recognized <italic>sens</italic> sequences. Each probe-set was labeled with a different fluor. If a spot identified using the <italic>sfGFP</italic> probe set was not identified by the <italic>sens</italic> probe-set, we classified that spot as a false-negative. The analysis indicated that a maximum of 6% of mRNAs (232 out of 3842 spots scored) were not identified by both probe-sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). This rate of false-negative identification is comparable to smFISH methods in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raj et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We next looked to partition identified mRNAs into the cells from which they were expressed. Since the smFISH method denatured the epitopes of all tested antibodies and it also denatured sfGFP, we were unable to segment cells using standard approaches. In the absence of a direct approach, we adopted a computational approach to resolving the smFISH signal at single-cell resolution. Using the fluorescent dye DAPI to visualize cell nuclei in the imaged samples, we segmented nuclei into 3D objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2CâE</xref>), which are located throughout the apical-basal axis of the pseudostratified epithelium of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldaz and Escudero, 2010</xref>). Based on segmented nuclei, we were able to construct effective cell boundaries by performing a 3D Voronoi tessellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>). RNAs were then partitioned into the distinct Voronoi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2G</xref>). Despite the local inaccuracies in our protocol for assigning transcripts to single cells, the Voronoi based tessellation of the three-dimensional tissue is a democratic prescription, lacking any hyperparameters, that is able to reveal the global quantitative trends in the data. The same democratic approach has been used by others in assigning mRNA transcripts to early embryonic nuclei when cell boundaries are unseen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little et al., 2013</xref>).

The former population corresponded to those described earlier, and they were primarily located in the cytoplasm - these are the mature mRNAs.

One explanation is that transcription is infrequent enough that 85% of the time only one allele is actively transcribing. Another explanation is that two alleles are physically co-localized, and their nascent transcripts cannot be resolved by confocal microscopy. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other animals have extensive physical pairing of homologous chromosomes in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKee, 2004</xref>). Consequently, alleles on paired chromosomes are often spatially juxtaposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szabo et al., 2018</xref>). For genes such as <italic>omb</italic> that we probed far upstream of the transcription termination site, it is likely that we were observing transcription from both alleles at once, given that a detectable nascent RNA would stay at the transcription site for a long time (~50 min). Even for these very bright transcription spots, only one transcription site per nucleus was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

Between 50â80% of all cells had this feature, and it was observed for all genes. This observation is not an artifact of segmentation erroneously assigning mature mRNAs to cells that do not express the genes. For all genes, the number of transcription sites strongly correlated with mRNA number when discs were binned but not segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, although assignment errors occur at the local scale, they cannot account for the quantitative global trends where 2â5 fold more cells lack a transcription site than lack any mature mRNAs.</p><p>Why do cells with mature mRNAs lack detectable transcription sites? One explanation is that each gene's promoter is always open, but since transcription is stochastic, there would be times when zero or just a few Pol II molecules are presently transcribing the gene. In this scenario, the birth and death of mRNAs can be described as a Poisson process, where the ratio of the variance of the distribution of number of mRNAs to its mean is expected to be one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Munsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). Since mRNA number per cell varied systematically across the wing disc because of Wg and Dpp signaling, we binned cells according to their position in the disc, as had been described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>), and empirically estimated the ratio of a bin's variance to its mean. The ratio of variance to mean mature mRNA number per cell was between 5 and 10 for all genes, and was fairly independent of mRNA output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This indicated that a Poisson process could not explain why we failed to detect transcription sites in every cell expressing mRNA.</p><p>To determine if our observations were possibly caused by transcription bursting, we invoked a two-state model of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A promoter exists in one of two possible states - ON and OFF. The promoter switches between states at particular rates <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>. When the promoter is in the ON state, Pol II is permitted to initiate transcription that is subject to a rate constant <italic>k<sub>ini</sub></italic>. When the promoter is in the OFF state, Pol II is unable to initiate transcription. The model also includes a transcription elongation step, which is assumed to be 100% processive, and whose timescale depends on the gene length and the rate of elongation. The latter is assumed to be 1100 nucleotides/min, which is a value that has been experimentally determined in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardehali et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modeling transcription sites using bursting dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model framework showing the three rate parameters affecting transcription initiation. Two parameters affect the promoter state, while the third parameter only affects how many initiation events occur when the promoter is ON. (<bold>B</bold>) Pol II molecules in elongation mode are distributed along the transcription unit. If Pol II is upstream of the probe binding sites, the nascent transcript will not be detected. If Pol II is downstream, the nascent transcript will be detected as 100% signal. If Pol II is transcribing within the binding sites, the nascent transcript will be detected as a partial signal. These three different scenarios are explicitly accounted for in our mathematical model. For example in the simulation result shown here, four Pol II's are situated such that a total of 12 virtual probe-binding sites are present. Since each mRNA has six binding sites, it means that this simulated transcription site has 12/6 or 2 units of normalized signal. Applying our filter cutoff for identifying a transcription site as two or more units, this simulated site would be scored as a positive. (<bold>C</bold>) The phase diagram of transcription site detection as a function of burst size and frequency in the model. Both burst size and frequency impact the likelihood of detecting a transcription site. When burst size increases at low burst frequency, the likelihood of detecting a transcription site remains fairly constant. When burst size increases at high burst frequency (horizontal red arrow), the likelihood of detecting a transcription site is ultrasensitive to burst size. Likewise, when burst frequency increases at low burst size, the likelihood of detecting a transcription site remains fairly constant. When burst frequency increases at high burst size (vertical red arrow), the likelihood of detecting a transcription site is ultrasensitive to burst size. The phase diagram makes manifest that a range of combinations of burst frequency and size could explain observed transcription site frequency data.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56076-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the model, transcriptional bursts have a characteristic size (number of transcripts per burst) and frequency (rate at which bursts occur).

For each parameter set, we ran 1000 simulations of the model. To capture the stochastic nature of gene expression, reactions in the model were treated as probabilistic events, with the exception of the transcript elongation time.</p><p>To directly relate the results of model simulations to experimental data, we performed the following treatment of simulation data. First, we transformed output of each simulation to mimic the experimentally detected fluorescence at a single gene allele. Fluorescence intensity depends on how many probe-binding sites are present in nascent RNAs on a gene allele at a given time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This varies with the number of elongating Pol II molecules on the allele, and the position of the probe-binding sites relative to the transcription start and stop sites. We normalized the output of simulated nascent RNAs by calculating the number of Pol II molecules upstream, within, and downstream of the binding region at the completion of a simulation. This normalization provided an approximation of fluorescence intensity from one gene allele. Second, we randomly paired two independent simulations to mimic the transcription site fluorescence of paired alleles within a nucleus. If simulated transcription site fluorescence fell below a cutoff of twice the fluorescence of a single RNA, we counted that simulation as having no âdetectableâ transcription site. This mimicked the cutoff that was applied to experimental data for identifying a transcription site.</p><p>We then asked what combination of burst size and frequency could theoretically account for the observed frequency of finding cells with a transcription site (this ranged from 20% to 50% of cells). A phase diagram revealed that a broad range of burst size and frequency could explain our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

This suggests that Dpp and Wg regulation of genes in the wing disc primarily occurs by modulation of transcriptional burst frequency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Morphogens elicit different transcriptional outputs from target genes, depending on local concentration of the morphogen. The targets of Dpp signaling in the wing offer a well-studied example of this concept. Transcription of the gene <italic>brk</italic> is directly regulated by the Dpp effector protein Mothers-against-dpp (Mad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minami et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moser and Campbell, 2005</xref>). Mad, in complex with Medea and Schnurri, represses <italic>brk</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai and Laughon, 2009</xref>). This generates a gradient of Brk protein expression that is inverted to the Dpp gradient. In turn, the level of Brk protein is instrumental in repressing the expression of <italic>omb</italic> and <italic>salm</italic>, which are induced by Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</xref>). Thus, opposing gradients of activation and repression determine the expression domains of <italic>omb</italic> and <italic>salm</italic>. Since <italic>omb</italic> is less sensitive to Brk repression than <italic>salm</italic>, its expression domain is broader. <italic>salm</italic> transcription is directly activated by Dpp without participation of Schnurri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moser and Campbell, 2005</xref>). Curiously, <italic>omb</italic> transcription does not directly depend on Dpp signaling, and its transcriptional activation is brought about by unknown factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sivasankaran et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Given the diverse molecular mechanisms by which genes such as <italic>omb</italic>, <italic>brk</italic>, and <italic>salm</italic> are regulated, it is illuminating that regulation of transcription burst frequency occurs for all of them. In the two-state view of promoter kinetics, the on-rate, <italic>k<sub>on</sub>,</italic> then is the most likely rate constant being regulated since it specifically affects burst frequency alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dar et al., 2012</xref>). It determines the average rate at which a promoter will switch from its OFF to its ON state. When a promoter is in the OFF state, the next burst will only occur when it switches ON, which is controlled by <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and not <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>. When a promoter is in the ON state, the size of its burst depends on when it switches OFF, which is controlled by <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> and not <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dar et al., 2012</xref>). However, <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> also affects burst frequency because the longer a promoter is ON, the longer the time it takes before a new burst can occur. If Dpp regulates <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>, then we would have seen modulation of both size and frequency of bursts. However, burst size appears to be independent of Dpp signaling.</p><p>If <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> is the kinetic rate constant under regulation for all of these genes, how does this occur given such diverse enhancer architectures and transcription factor inputs? It has been found that burst frequency correlates with enhancer strength and enhancer-promoter contact, suggesting that <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> is potentiated by enhancer-promoter contact and is mediated by transcription factor binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that occupancy of Dpp effectors on target enhancers varies the <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> rate for their linked promoters, and this modulation is negative for repressors such as Brk and positive for activators such as Mad.</p><p>Burst frequency regulation is also observed for developmental genes in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holloway and Spirov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a common mechanism to regulate patterned gene expression is by control of burst frequency. However, burst size can also be regulated by cell-cell signaling, as is the case for Notch target genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, <italic>eve</italic> gene expression in the embryo is regulated by transcription factors that modulate burst frequency, plus there is an orthogonal mechanism that controls the window of time over which a nucleus can transcribe the <italic>eve</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>). This distinct mechanism appears to be regulated by repressors, perhaps acting on nucleosome organization. Modeling of various embryonic genes suggests that they transition through several intermediate transcriptionally-silent states before their transcription can begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desponds et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dufourt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eck et al., 2020</xref>). Chromatin remodeling factors appear to modulate these transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eck et al., 2020</xref>). Although a two-state model explains much of our experimental results, likely there are other factors that also help determine the expression domains of Dpp-responsive genes.</p><p>Our results challenge the view that <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> expression domains have sharp boundaries due to transcription thresholds set by Brk and Dpp. We find that <italic>omb</italic> and <italic>salm</italic> mRNA numbers per cell drop gradually with distance from the source of Dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As well, their gradients in mRNA number are inversely correlated with the gradient in <italic>brk</italic> mRNA number. <italic>Salm</italic> has relatively constant mRNA number in cells near the AP boundary, and those numbers gradually diminish in cells located more laterally. A similar pattern is seen with <italic>omb</italic>, except the domain with constant <italic>omb</italic> mRNA number is smaller than for <italic>salm</italic>. However, the <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> enhancer trap reporters as well as anti-Salm immunohistochemistry have reported expression domains with sharp boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayer et al., 2013</xref>). Possibly, the discrepancy hints at some threshold of mRNA expression below which protein output drops sharply. It is also possible that the previously characterized expression domains for <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> were distorted by non-linear detection of antibodies that recognize Salm and the protein product of lacZ, Î²-galactosidase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>white<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td>Bloomington<italic>Drosophila</italic>Stock Center</td><td><italic>BDSC</italic>: 3605 <italic>Flybase</italic>: FBst0003605 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_3605">BDSC_3605</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>sens<sup>E1</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nolo et al., 2000</xref></td><td><italic>Flybase</italic>: FBal0098024</td><td>From Hugo Bellen</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>sfGFP-sens [VK37]</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venken et al., 2006</xref>.

We modeled each z-section like a plane of width 345 nm for analysis, but in reality the edges of the z point spread function (PSF) overlap between sections.

Diffraction-limited fluorescent spots captured with a 63X objective at 633 nm wavelength are estimated to be approximately 600 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipson et al., 1995</xref>). This corresponds to a diameter of 8 x-y pixels in our images. Therefore, we classify a 2D object in each transformed section whenÂ â¥Â 8 white pixels are connected with one another.</p><p>It is important to select a cutoff where true RNA fluorescent spots are identified as 2D objects in a section, and background is not. Therefore, a broad range of cutoff values is systematically applied to an image stack, and 2D object number is summed for each cutoff value. The distribution of 2D object number exhibits a plateau across a range of cutoff values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), and thresholds applied at this plateau accurately identify true RNA spots. To demonstrate this, we manually curated 347 RNA spots from sub-regions of four independent image stacks, and found that when a cutoff is selected within the plateau, the number of 2D objects identified by threshold segmentation is no more than +/-Â 5% different than the ground truth. Furthermore, the centroids of identified objects have an average displacement of only two pixels from the manually identified centroids. Therefore, this plateau, a regime of relative insensitivity to user-specified hyperparameters, is an appropriate threshold for accurate segmentation of RNA spots.</p><p>The position of the plateau varies from image stack to image stack. Therefore, for each image stack, a range of cutoffs is tested, and a cutoff is selected within the plateau to perform segmentation. As a result, each image stack has a unique threshold, allowing robust segmentation of spots despite variation in raw fluorescence between image stacks. In practice, replicate samples from the same experiment captured in the same imaging session did not require thresholds for segmentation more than 15 pixel intensity units apart. If image stacks did not show an identifiable plateau, the signal-to-background of that sample was determined to be insufficient and it was not used for analysis. The smFISH protocol and imaging is robust enough that in our hands, this occurs in less than 10% of image stacks collected. Once a threshold is selected, the following properties of each 2D object are recorded: x-y centroid position, z-section, and a list of the connected pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Connecting 2D Objects into 3D mRNA Spots</title><p>As each z-section is 340 nm in depth, it is assumed that genuine diffraction-limited RNA spots will appear in 2 or three consecutive z-sections, depending on the spotâs position along the z-axis. Therefore, a 2D object must satisfy two criteria in order to be counted as an RNA spot: 1) A 2D object must be linked to one or more 2D objects in at least one neighboring z-section. Linkage is defined when the centroids of all objects are within a diffraction-limited radius of 4 pixels from one another in the x-y plane; 2) A 2D object must be larger (contain more pixels) than linked objects in neighboring z-sections. This criterion prevents RNA fluorescence spots from being counted in multiple z-sections. A candidate that satisfies these criteria is recorded as an mRNA spot, and only the largest 2D object is recorded.</p><p>The pipeline allows the images to be overlaid with markers indicating recorded spots so that each image stack can be manually inspected for any significant errors or inconsistencies. The most common problem detected at this stage results from images taken of discs that were âdriftingâ or moving significantly, which can cause a large number of identified spots to be filtered out during processing for not meeting criterion 1. Excessive bleaching across the stack can also cause clear inconsistencies. In this study, such problems were rare enough that any sample experiencing these problems was considered to have failed quality control and was simply not included for further analysis.</p><p>Intensity measurements are recorded from a circle of pixels of radius four about the centroid of each recorded RNA spot. By keeping the area of each intensity measurement fixed, we uncouple user-generated variation in selection of segmentation thresholds from spot intensity measurements. A 2D circle was used instead of a 3D sphere to extract intensity measurements because the spots only appear in 2 or 3 z-sections. This makes their 3D geometry variable from spot to spot, and they cannot be consistently described using a sphere or ellipse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Segmentation of Transcription Sites</title><p>In our images, transcription sites tend to contain pixels that are many times brighter than mature RNA spots. As a result, the brightest transcription sites are frequently misidentified during segmentation of mature RNA spots because the second criterion for spot identification only records the largest object within the diffraction limit in z. For transcription sites, this is not always the brightest plane. Therefore, we segment transcription sites independent of mature RNAs using a higher cutoff. The objective in cutoff selection for transcription sites is to select one that includes objects with a total fluorescence intensity of twice the average mature RNA, and excludes mature RNA spots. We define the âaverageâ intensity for a spot containing a single mRNA to be the median of the distribution of all identified mature RNA spot objects. We empirically determined that merely doubling the cutoff for segmentation does not achieve this, because mature mRNAs may contain a few pixels above the cutoff, enough to still be identified as objects and included in analysis. Therefore, we use a threshold cutoff by multiplying the median mature RNA intensity by a factor of 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To test the accuracy of this segmentation procedure, we manually inspected three particularly RNA-dense regions in independent images where automated segmentation found a total of 103 transcription sites and 4066 mature RNAs. We determined that only 7 of 4066 mature RNAs were misidentified as transcription sites, and found no examples of transcription sites that had been missed by automated segmentation. After identification, object intensity measurements are recorded from a circle of pixels of radius 4 (the diffraction limit) about the centroid of each identified transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The average transcription site threshold selected for replicates in a dataset show no correlation with the average intensity of transcription sites in that dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, the differences in transcription site intensity between genes cannot be explained merely by differences in threshold selection or variability in image fluorescence between datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Estimation of Nascent RNA Number per Transcription Site</title><p>The intensity measurement of each identified transcription site in an image stack is divided by the median intensity of identified mature RNAs in that sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This serves two purposes. First, it serves to normalize these measurements within each sample so transcription site intensity measurements can be pooled across replicates without the effects of image-to- image variability in fluorescence. Secondly, each transcription site object is presumed to be the sum of intensities of multiple nascent RNA molecules elongating at the transcription site. By dividing each transcription site intensity by the average intensity of a single RNA, we obtain an estimate of the number of nascent RNAs present at the transcription site. Because some transcripts are partially elongated, this number cannot be completely accurate, and we attempt to compensate for this in our computational model when interpreting results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Nuclei Segmentation</title><p>DAPI fluorescence images are output as labeled 16-bit images, where each nuclear object corresponds to a âlevelâ in the 16-bit image. These images are input to a nuclei segmentation pipeline, which flattens the images to white nuclei objects and black background. Nuclei images are segmented in 2D using the NucleAIzer platform maskRCNN Network, trained as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hollandi et al., 2020</xref>. We trained the neural network with an expected nuclear radius of 32 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). To ascertain the accuracy of segmentation, we compared results to manually labeled nuclei in four randomly selected disc images. The automated method identified at least 85% of nuclei objects identified manually for each image.</p><p>The segmented black and white images are then processed using a custom Matlab script in order to join overlapping 2D objects into 3D. Each nucleus object in each z-slice is assigned an identity index. For each object in the first z-slice, the object with the highest number of overlapping pixels in the next z-slice is identified, and this objectâs identity index is altered to be identical to its overlap partner. This proceeds through the entire z-stack of images, creating objects that resemble âpancake stacksâ of linked 2D objects in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). The 3D-centroid and list of included pixels of these new objects is then recorded. Objects not incorporated into a 3-D object are disregarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Generation of Voronoi Diagrams</title><p>A Voronoi tessellation is built from a grid of points in either 2D or 3D. In our case, each point is the centroid of a segmented 3D nucleus. The Voronoi cells delineate regions consisting of all voxels that are closer to that centroid than to any other centroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voronoi, 1908</xref>). The boundaries between Voronoi cells represent points that are equidistant between two centroids. These are taken to represent virtual cell boundaries. It is important to be clear that the Voronoi cells do not accurately describe the pseudostratified epithelial nature of wing disc cells. However, note that 3D segmentation of pseudostratified epithelial cells is still something no one working in any system has achieved.</p><p>The 3D Voronoi tessellation used a polytope-bounded Voronoi diagram available for Matlab, which uses the DeLaunay triangulation to calculate the Voronoi diagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park, 2020</xref>). The result of this tessellation is a list of 3D vertices of each Voronoi âcellâ in space, which is recorded along with the associated nuclear centroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-7"><title>Assignment of RNA to cells</title><p>3D Voronoi tessellation is a way to democratically assign mature transcripts to cells based on vicinity to the nucleus. Clearly we get the transcript assignment incorrect at a local level. However, being the most democratic approach, the trends of mRNAs/cell assigned to 100's of cell across the wing disc are trustworthy. The same logic has been used by others assigning mRNA transcripts to early embryonic nuclei when cell boundaries are unseen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To assign spot objects to cells, a 3D convex hull of the each Voronoi cell is constructed from the vertices data for that cell. An entire set of image points, either the mRNA or transcription spot centroids, are tested to determine whether they fall inside or outside of each hull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). This is performed using a Matlab function called inhull, which uses dot products to shorten calculation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DâErrico, 2020</xref>). Spots that fall inside a given cellâs Voronoi hull are assigned to that cellâs nuclear centroid, and the number of assigned spots, as well as their centroid and z- plane information are recorded. This is then repeated for every Voronoi cell in the image stack. The final result is a list of cells, their nuclear centroids, the total number of RNA spots assigned, and a list of each assigned spotâs centroids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-8"><title>Data Analysis Binning of data</title><p>Each disc is imaged with the DV boundary located at the y-coordinate midline of the image. Therefore the x-coordinate of the image corresponds to position along the disc's AP axis, and the y-coordinate corresponds to position along the DV axis. In order to analyze data across developmental axes, each image is divided into spatial bins of 64 pixels each, approximately equal to the diameter of one cell nucleus. RNA spots are assigned to a bin according to the position of their associated nuclear centroid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-9"><title>Sample size and replicates</title><p>We analyzed image stacks from three independent discs for each experiment. Each image stack contains approximately 1,700 identified nuclei. Therefore, the total sample size is approximately 5,000 cells per experiment. Similar trends in RNA and transcription spots feature are observed in each disc individually, and hence, the analysis is not distorted by artifacts in pooling and cell segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-10"><title>Alignment of replicates along developmental axes</title><p>While each disc is imaged roughly in the same region, there is not an unambiguous landmark that precisely registers different disc images with one another. To pool data across space as accurately as possible, we register discs to each other based on their mRNA spot distributions over space. For each image data set, the number of RNAs per spatial bin is summed, and the distributions across bins are compared. Bins are then manually registered such that the distribution profiles of the three datasets line up with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâE</xref>). The overlapping bins from the three datasets are then assigned to a pooled bin. Pooling includes the nuclei centroids as well as the transcription and RNA spots. This is repeated for all bins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-11"><title>Calculations</title><p>Median mature mRNAs per cell is calculated from total number of mature mRNA spots for each cell within a spatial bin of pooled data. As the distribution of mRNAs per cell is not normally distributed and has a long tail, we ascertained that the median was a more robust descriptor of the âcenterâ of the distribution than mean. <italic>Median nascent RNAs per cell</italic> is calculated from normalized intensity measurements for each transcription spot within a spatial bin of pooled data. All nascent RNA spots are included. As the distribution of RNA per cell is not normally distributed and has a long tail, we ascertained that the median was a more robust descriptor of the âcenterâ of the distribution than mean. Because the number of transcription sites varies over space, sample sizes vary for calculating median nascent RNAs per cell. For bins where fewer than 5% of cells contain a transcription site, median nascent RNAs per cell was not calculated, as the sample size was determined to be too small (&lt;15). <italic>Fraction of cells with a transcription site</italic> is calculated by dividing the number of cells in a pooled spatial bin with at least one transcription site assigned to them by the total number of cells in that spatial bin. <italic>Fano factor</italic> is calculated for each spatial bin by dividing the variance in the mRNA per cell distribution by the mean mRNA per cell for all cells assigned to that pooled spatial bin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Linear models are produced by unweighted least squares linear regression. LOESS fits are performed using the loess fitter in R, with an optimized span to minimize residuals. Confidence intervals are calculated by bootstrap resampling analysis using the bias-corrected and accelerated method. We resample data within each bin of pooled data and calculate the statistic of interest 10,000 times. The mean value of the statistic and a 95% confidence interval are calculated from these resampled values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stochastic simulation model</title><p>We model the various steps of gene expression, based on central dogma, as linear first order reactions. To simulate the stochastic nature of reactions, we implement the model as a Markov process using Gillespieâs Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie, 1977</xref>).

We also use the same simulations to approximate the number of nascent RNAs per gene. After 10,000 iterative events are completed in a simulation, the number of nascent RNAs is counted. A single nascent RNA is counted if a single transcription initiation event has occurred within an interval of time (Ï<sub>elong</sub>) equal to the time it is estimated that RNA polymerase takes to elongate from the binding site for the 5â-most oligo probe to the 3' end of the RNA. To calculate Ï<sub>elong</sub> for each gene, we divide the number of nucleotides from 5' probe-binding site to 3' end by the transcription elongation rate.

We define Ï<sub>probe</sub> to be the time interval for RNA polymerase to elongate from the 5â-most probe-binding site to the 3â-most probe-binding site. If a nascent RNA had been initiated in a time less than Ï<sub>probe</sub>, then we weight the counting of that nascent RNA as 0.5 rather than 1. We do this because the probe-binding region of the nascent RNA is partially transcribed at this point. For simplicity, the exact locations of probes and RNA polymerase are not taken into account to calculate the weighting, and instead we assign the overall probability of fluorescence for an ensemble of such partially transcribed RNAs. If a nascent RNA had been initiated in a time greater than or equal to Ï<sub>probe</sub> and less than Ï<sub>elong</sub>, then we weight the counting of that nascent RNA as 1. These RNAs are assumed to produce 100% of the fluorescence of a mature RNA spot, since all probe-binding sites are transcribed at this point.</p><p>We randomly pair two simulations and sum the number of weighted nascent transcripts. This mimics the experimental conditions where the two gene alleles are physically paired and thus their nascent RNAs are co-localized in space. We collate 1000 paired simulations for each parameter set and calculate the following statistics:</p><p>Fraction of virtual cells with a transcription site is calculated by counting how many paired simulations have a total number of weighted nascent RNAs of 2.0 or more. This is done in order to be consistent with the limitations of the experimental data; only nuclear spots with fluorescence greater or equal to two mature mRNA spots were called as transcription sites. When this number of paired simulations is divided by the total of 1000 paired simulations, it is the fraction of virtual cells with a transcription site.</p><p>Median number of nascent RNAs per virtual cell is calculated from those paired simulations with a total number of weighted nascent RNAs of 2.0 or more.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>Experimental analysis code is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bakkerra/smfish_pipeline">https://github.com/bakkerra/smfish_pipeline</ext-link>.</p><p>All raw smFISH data after spot and nuclei segmentation is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-rfax-bk36">https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-rfax-bk36</ext-link>.

They used Wg and Dpp morphogens to examine kinetic steps during transcriptional initiation that they regulate. They first established single-molecule FISH (smFISH) for some of Wg and Dpp target genes and showed that it has a low false negative and false positive rate. They then performed segmentation and image analysis to assign each smFISH signal to a specific cell, and this allowed them to quantify the number of mRNA molecules per cell. They also showed that the intensity of the smFISH signal can be used to determine whether a given mRNA molecule is nascent or mature and used it to quantify the nascent and mature mRNAs for these genes in each cell. These results suggested that transcription downstream of Wg and Dpp occurs in bursts. To ascertain this notion and to determine which aspect of bursting might be regulated by these morphogens, the authors performed mathematical modeling. Comparison of various simulations with the actual smFISH data allowed the authors to conclude that Wg and Dpp morphogens share a common method for the transcriptional control of their downstream genes, despite the different expression patterns of these targets. The data suggested that these morphogens regulate their targets by modulating the burst frequency not the burst size. Hence, this study connects a specific aspect of transcriptional bursting (i.e. burst frequency) to developmental gene regulatory mechanisms downstream of evolutionarily conserved morphogens.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although linking morphogens to transcriptional burst frequency is exciting, the authors have not made any attempts to find how morphogens regulate burst frequency but not burst size.</p><p>The idea championed in this work â that graded expression of targets of morphogen signaling proteins is a product of transcription &quot;burst frequency modulation&quot; â is intriguing and important, and is consistent with recent findings in other contexts. The results and analysis are impressive, and the reviewers advocate for its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However a better understanding of how the data was analyzed needs to be provided.</p><p>Given that the conclusions the authors draw are likely the predicted outcomes, it is especially important to show a control hybridization experiment that analyzes a gene that does not vary in expression across the disc â one that is regulated by Gal4 perhaps?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the results section, &quot;These factors diffuse from their sources forming concentration gradients across the disc, and regulate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner.&quot; The claim that the morphogens diffuse across the disc is inconsistent with recent reports of other mechanisms (filopodia), and as the mechanism of dispersion is irrelevant, this statement is unnecessary.</p><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B: The sens control (B) is uniformly black in the pdf that was provided, but presumably has background spots?

Comparable genetic tools will need to be built and tested for the wing disc, conditions for culturing wing discs ex vivo that retain normal development will need to be worked out, and an analytical pipeline will need to be built before experimentation in those directions can begin.

We have rewritten the section text and figure legend to make it clearer. We had already described in detail the method to calculate the objects in the Materials and methods but this has also been rewritten to improve clarity. The cutoff is chosen based on a characteristic plateau from a parameter sweep of cutoff values performed on each image stack (see Figure 1C). This method of cutoff choice is based on two QC criteria: (1) it IDs spots with &lt;5% error compared to a manually curated ground truth; (2) it identified 200-fold fewer spots in GFP null control discs when compared to GFP-sens discs. There are so few background control spots (~40) that an intensity graph is not helpful. Background for the intron probe is comparable to the exonic probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E: I do not understand how this image was generated or what it's meaning might be.</p></disp-quote><p>This is 5 contiguous z-sections of segmented nuclei colored and viewed laterally using the ImageJ 3D viewer plugin.

Please at least provide a better description of what &quot;Voronoi tessellation&quot; calculates.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously tried to use membrane dyes to visualize cell boundaries but these failed to give adequate results. Exhaustive attempts using many experimental means of visualizing membranes were failures.</p><p>A Voronoi tessellation takes a grid of some finite number of points in either 2D or 3D. In our case, each point is the centroid of an imaged 3D nucleus. For each centroid, there is a corresponding region consisting of all other points of the plane that are closer to that centroid than to any other centroid. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The boundaries between Voronoi cells represent points that are equidistant between two centroids. These are taken to represent virtual cell boundaries. It is important to be clear that the Voronoi cells do not accurately describe the pseudostratified epithelial nature of wing disc cells. However, note that 3D segmentation of pseudostratified epithelial cells is still something no one working in <italic>any</italic> system has achieved.</p><p>Tessellation is just a way to democratically assign mature transcripts to cells based on vicinity to the nucleus. Clearly we get the transcript assignment incorrect at a local level. However, being the most democratic approach, the trends of mRNAs/cell assigned to 100s of cell across the wing disc are trustworthy. The same logic has been used by Gregor and others assigning mRNA transcripts to early embryonic nuclei when cell boundaries are unseen (e.g., Little et al., 2013). We have now added a clearer description of the tessellation and its meaning in the text and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detecting only one fluorescent spot per nucleus is interesting, especially as it is not what has been observed for the embryo.

If we predict that the number of nuclei with &gt;1 transcription spot will not be observed, what is the prediction for frequency, for intensity of the single spots?</p></disp-quote><p>Although there are no haploid cells in imaginal disc tissue, we did compare transcription sites with one copy versus two copies of the <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> transgene. We used probes specific for sfGFP RNA.</p><p>Animals with 1 copy also bear one fully functional copy of the endogenous <italic>sens</italic> gene. When only one copy of the transgene is present, the likelihood of detected transcription sites is decreased across the disc (roughly by half) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). The median number of nascent RNAs detected per transcription site is statistically unchanged (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals overlap, and we did a permutation test for significance which gave a p-value of 0.3. These observations are consistent with an interpretation that in cells with two <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> copies, the observed nascent RNAs represent transcription from a single allele at any given time. Halving the number of alleles decreases the likelihood of observing a transcription burst, but does not strongly affect the number of RNAs observed per burst. Given that the likelihood of observing a site for a single <italic>sfGFP-sens</italic> allele is maximally 10%, the likelihood of observing two sites at the same time would be at most 1%, assuming independent firing.</p><p>However, for genes probed far upstream of the transcription termination site, it is very likely that we are seeing transcription from both alleles at once, given that a detectable nascent RNA would stay at the transcription site for a long time (~50 minutes). Even for these very bright transcription spots, only one transcription site per nucleus is observed (clearly visible in Figure 3 B and C). This observation, and the literature suggesting that allelic pairing occurs extensively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue, argues that we still need to assume that transcription from a second allele would not appear as a second transcription site.</p><p>We have added this commentary to the revised manuscript text.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56076-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Permutation test methods: Data from two experimental groups was pooled and repeatedly randomly shuffled into two new groups. The median of each random group was calculated and the difference between these two groups recorded.

Summarizing, we are able to make 3 measurements at single-cell resolution from our smFISH measurements: (1) the number of mature transcripts in the cytoplasm of cells, (2) the presence/absence of nascent sites of transcription in cell nuclei, and (3) the intensity of nascent RNAs. These 3 empirical observables are downstream of the kinetics of the promoter, which is what we wish to have insight into. The model forms a bridge from promoter kinetics to these three observables. The simulations of the model make manifest that the mapping from promoter kinetics to our observables is sufficiently complex, making intuitive rationalizing of the trends challenging.</p></body></sub-article></article>
