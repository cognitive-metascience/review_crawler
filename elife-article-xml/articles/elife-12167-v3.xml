Here we show that the expression of the Notch ligand Dll4 fluctuates in individual endothelial cells within sprouting vessels in the mouse retina in vivo and in correlation with dynamic cell movement in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived sprouting assays. We also find that sprout elongation and branching associates with a highly differential phase pattern of Dll4 between endothelial cells. Stimulation with pathologically high levels of Vegf, or overexpression of Dll4, leads to Notch dependent synchronization of Dll4 fluctuations within clusters, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback system normally operates to generate heterogeneity between endothelial cells driving branching, whilst synchronization drives vessel expansion. We propose that this sensitive phase transition in the behaviour of the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback loop underlies the morphogen function of Vegfa in vascular patterning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12167.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12167.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Throughout life, blood vessels are constantly remodelled to ensure that oxygen and nutrients reach every part of the body where they are needed. If a tissue is not receiving an adequate blood flow, existing blood vessels may widen or new blood vessels may sprout from their walls. In certain diseases, such as cancer, blood vessels may grow excessively to form disorganized networks, and preventing this growth may help to treat these conditions. However, we do not fully understand how the body controls the size, shape and branching pattern of blood vessels.</p><p>For a new blood vessel to sprout out of an existing vessel, the tip of the new branch must first develop. The tip forms when the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel are activated by a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), which is produced by the surrounding tissue. The activated endothelial cells respond to Vegfa stimulation by producing the protein Dll4, which talks to neighboring endothelial cells to prevent them from also forming new tips. In a way, this process bears all the signs of a competition between cells, as they fight for which one is allowed to take the lead. The losers of this competition, when forced into subordination by the tips, also serve an important function, as they will help to form and elongate the base of the new sprout.</p><p>Although it is known that changes in the levels of Vegfa in tissues can cause blood vessel branching to alter dramatically, the mechanisms that enable this to occur are not well understood. Computer simulations of the process predicted that an unexpected synchronization of Dll4 dynamics would be triggered when Vegfa levels increased; however, this remained to be observed in real cells.</p><p>Ubezio, Blanco et al. have now used fluorescent markers to observe the Dll4 production in lab-grown mouse endothelial cells as they formed new vessel sprouts in response to Vegfa. This revealed that the levels of Dll4 fluctuate widely in individual cells. Time-lapse movies of the cells showed that as a new sprout forms, the levels of Dll4 in neighbouring cells fluctuate in an uncoordinated manner. However, increasing the amount of Vegfa in the cells indeed synchronizes these fluctuations. This causes the new sprout to retract and allows the original blood vessel to widen. Increasing the levels of Dll4 had the same effect.</p><p>Further experiments confirmed that increasing the amount of Vegfa also reduces blood vessel branching in tumours in mice by synchronizing the fluctuations in the levels of Dll4 in neighbouring endothelial cells. In the future, these results could help refine anti-cancer treatments that work by blocking the activity of Vegfa and Dll4.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation and maintenance of adequately branched and hierarchically organised networks of blood vessels is critical for all aspects of tissue growth and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Potente et al., 2011</xref>). How the endothelial cells lining blood vessels collectively determine whether to form a new vessel branch or expand existing vessels is currently not understood. Similarly, the morphogenic and cellular principles underlying the chaotic vascular network formation in disease scenarios remain unclear. Recent work established that Dll4/Notch signalling between the activated endothelial cells functions to amplify stochastic differences in expression levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (Vegfr), ultimately establishing tip cells bearing high Vegfr expression, and inhibited stalk cells, bearing lower levels of signalling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobov et al., 2007</xref>). The Dll4/Notch pathway thereby establishes a lateral-inhibition feedback loop with the Vegf-Vegfr pathway, controlling branching frequency by balancing the number of new tip cells with the number of stabilizing stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>). Genetic mosaic experiments in 3D embryoid body sprouting assays and in vivo illustrated tip and stalk cells regularly change position as endothelial cells dynamically compete for the tip position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>). Every 3–5 hr, the tip cell is exchanged, leading to continuously changing cellular neighbourhood relationships. Computational modelling of the feedback loop illustrated that it should suffice to pattern new sprouts, and comprise a robust mechanism for the establishment of a regular branching pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2009</xref>). Recently integrated modelling and experiments further identified that this Notch/VEGF feedback drives differential VE-cadherin dynamics at individual endothelial junctions contributing to cell rearrangement behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley et al., 2014a</xref>). The meeting of new neighbours itself propagates iterative lateral-inhibition. Whether and how this activity might affect Notch signalling in individual cells over time remains unclear. In other cell systems, Notch signalling is highly dynamic, and Notch target genes oscillate both in single cells through autonomous feedback regulation, as well as in cell collectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masamizu et al., 2006</xref>). The latter is best studied during formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm, in which Notch activity synchronizes intrinsic oscillatory gene regulation between neighbouring mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kageyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2013</xref>). In the absence of Notch signalling, cells eventually drift out of synchrony, finally leading to loss of somite patterning.</p><p>Dll4 over-expression in tumour cells in a glioblastoma model caused substantial vessel enlargement at the expense of branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Constitutive genetic endothelial activation of Notch4 leads to embryonic vessel diameter increase and arterio-venous shunt formation, further suggesting that controlled Notch activity plays a role in vessel diameter regulation and adequate network remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uyttendaele et al., 2001</xref>). Collectively, existing studies show that reduced Notch signalling in endothelial cells promotes a highly branched network with small calibre vessels whereas increased Notch activity promotes a sparse network of large calibre vessels. Similarly, Vegfa shows strong dosage dependent effects on vascular patterning. Like <italic>Dll4, Vegfa</italic> is genetically haplo-insufficient, and overexpression causes embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miquerol et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmeliet et al., 1996</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the extensive body of work on Vegf and Dll4/Notch, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underlie these exquisitely dose sensitive effects on vascular patterning have hardly progressed beyond phenomenology. This may in part be because of the difficulties in analysing Vegf and Dll4/Notch signalling in a quantitative and dynamic manner, especially in vivo.</p><p>Here, we developed in vitro and in vivo analysis of Dll4 mRNA, protein and gene expression reporter dynamics under normal and pathological Vegfa stimulation, identifying a phase transition in the Dll4 dynamics that determines whether new vessels branch or expand. Computational modelling previously predicted that the Vegf-Dll4/Notch-Vegfr feedback loop normally establishes salt-and-pepper patterning between endothelial cells to regulate tip/stalk specification, but under elevated Vegfa levels, simulations predicted that this feedback loop would switch to drive the cells to collectively fluctuate their Dll4 levels in contiguous clusters, unable to stabilize into a heterogeneous pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2009</xref>). This highlights how the non-linear feedback involved in Vegf/Notch signalling can make it extremely hard to intuit how perturbation conditions, such as elevated Vegf, will impact on dynamics. Importantly, clear experimental evidence for the predicted dynamics and changing behaviours has been difficult to obtain. Further more, the computational models contain a limited parameter set, thus simplifying the complexity, potentially missing critical modifiers. Such modifiers may not only be molecular components, but also effects that originate from differences in cell shape and geometries, as these can trigger changes to signalling pathway dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014b</xref>). In the present study, we therefore chose to combine and compare refined computational models that reflect the experimental assays and their endothelial geometries and integrate specific experimental assays and computational modelling throughout. Using high Vegfa levels in embryoid body assays, intraocular injection of Vegfa, the oxygen induced retinopathy model of ischemia driven ocular neovascularization, and finally syngenic mouse glioblastoma tumours, we present evidence for local Notch-dependent synchronization of Dll4 dynamics leading to vessel expansion whilst disrupting branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Dll4</italic> levels fluctuate collectively rather than differentially under high Vegf in silico and in vitro</title><p>In order to gain first experimental insight into the dynamic behaviour of Dll4/Notch signalling under normal versus elevated Vegf conditions, we performed a time course experiment on endothelial monolayers. We collected mRNA from endothelial monolayers treated with either 50 ng/ml Vegfa 164 (normal) or 1 µg/ml Vegfa 164 (high) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–i</xref>). We monitored <italic>dll4</italic> mRNA levels by qPCR over a period of 9 and 24 hr post-stimulation. High Vegfa consistently induced fluctuations with high amplitude and several peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,i</xref>), which given the population based measurement indicates the cells are fluctuating in relative synchrony. Lomb-Scargle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dequéant et al., 2006</xref>) showed that the dominant periodicity in each dataset was 5–6 hr. The modest and varying degree of confidence in this analysis however suggests that these dynamic patterns in vitro are inherently noisy. Under normal Vegfa levels, <italic>dll4</italic> mRNA showed an unexpected low-amplitude rise and decline, but then remained relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We had hypothesized these conditions should permit a stabilized salt and pepper pattern, manifested as a stable population level of <italic>dll4</italic>. To investigate whether this observation contests our current working model of Vegf/Notch feedback or if it can be explained simply by the different geometric nature of cells in a monolayer compared to a sprouting system impacting on the ensuing signalling dynamics, we simulated the Vegf/Notch feedback in a 2D monolayer geometry (see Materials and methods). This model revealed that the restricted ability of cells to change shape in a monolayer (without filopodia extensions and Vegf gradients) destabilizes the salt and pepper pattern; they instead fluctuate between salt-and-pepper pattern-like states and then near-uniform Notch activation across the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Simulation of higher levels of Vegfa in this simple model led to high amplitude, synchronized oscillations of Dll4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endothelial Dll4 mRNA levels fluctuate dynamically in a Vegfa and Notch dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Simulation of Dll4 dynamics in a monolayer of 20×20 cells using the memAgent-Spring model under normal Vegfa and high Vegfa (20x normal level).

However, unlike dVenus, the distribution of Emerald protein was more widespread than Dll4 protein or <italic>dll4</italic> mRNA. Both in the embryoid body ES cell sprouting assay (EB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jakobsson et al., 2007</xref>) and in the postnatal mouse retina, staining for dVenus showed the typical salt-and-pepper distribution pattern, with high levels in tip cells, and low levels in neighbouring stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>). The long sprouts in EBs showed strong expression at the tip, followed by one or two cells with low expression, and then again single cells with high expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This pattern matches the principles of lateral inhibition thought to govern Dll4/Notch signalling in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobov et al., 2007</xref>). Emerald however was present at high levels in both Dll4 protein positive and Dll4 protein negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), suggesting that Dll4 protein half-life is considerably shorter than that of Emerald. Also in the retina, Emerald protein highlighted large stretches of the vascular front with little difference between neighbouring cells, illustrating that most cells at the front experienced a phase of <italic>Dll4</italic> expression, and that the reporter accumulates over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,l</xref>). The salt-and-pepper distribution of dVenus and widespread distribution of Emerald provide the first evidence for dynamic phases of <italic>Dll4</italic> expression in sprouting angiogenesis in vivo. Remarkably, these results indicate that the salt-and-pepper distribution is not fixed, but dynamic, consistent with the idea of continued and iterative competition for the tip position via Dll4/Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual Dll4 dynamics synchronise under high Vegf and high Dll4 conditions</title><p>Given the known haplo-insufficiency in <italic>Dll4</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gale et al., 2004</xref>), the homozygous viability and lack of vascular defects in mice and ES cells carrying the <italic>Dll4</italic>-P2A-dVenus or <italic>Dll4</italic>-P2A-Emerald alleles indicate that the targeted <italic>Dll4</italic> allele is fully functional.

Dll4 protein and dVenus showed the typical salt-and-pepper distribution correlating with normal sprouting patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d</xref>). However, high Vegfa conditions led to conspicuously short and stunted sprouts, with much wider diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Interestingly, this morphological change from elongation to expansion invariably correlated with altered Dll4 and dVenus distribution. Although still most strongly expressed at the tip, Dll4 and dVenus were expressed at very high levels in clusters of neighbouring cells close to the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Thus, as predicted by computational modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), high Vegfa levels appear to disrupt the typical lateral-inhibition salt-and-pepper pattern and instead lead to more synchronized fluctuations of Dll4 levels in contiguous cells, thereby disrupting branching. Also the 3<italic>Dll4</italic>-Emerald ES cells responded to high Vegfa with stunted sprouting, reduced branching and increased sprout diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Emerald expression was also strongest in clusters of cells at the front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Computational modelling further predicted that raising Dll4 levels should also lead to synchronized fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>).

We observed that the impact of elevated vegf is strong enough alone to drive a full shift in patterning dynamics matching the observed phenotypic changes in vascular patterning of the retina plexus. Simulations of collagen matrix deposition of advancing sprouts in this model further predicted that the iterative synchronized sprouting and retraction movement generated by the synchronized fluctations in Notch signaling should lead to accumulation of empty collagen sleeves ahead of the vascular front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>). Testing this prediction, we assessed the pattern of collagen IV basement membrane deposition at the vascular sprouting front 3 hr (P4 retinas) and 20 hr (P5 retinas) after Vegfa injection. Retinas injected with Vegfa showed a dramatic mismatch between the vasculature and collagen IV deposition in the blunted regions of the sprouting front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j,k</xref>). In these areas, already 3 hr after Vegfa injection, collagen IV sleeves protruded ahead of the blunted vasculature, and further increased in number and length over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l–o</xref>). The observed radial expansion delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5p</xref>) is thus likely a result of unproductive and iterative sprouting and retraction.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media16" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-12167-media16.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.032</object-id><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>Collagen IV sleeve simulation.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12167.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12167.032</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>High Vegfa can drive vessel expansion in the absence of proliferation</title><p>A plausible alternative explanation for the observed enlargement in vessel diameter upon high Vegfa levels is cell proliferation. Indeed, injecting Vegfa into the vitreous leads to widespread endothelial proliferation throughout the plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,c</xref>). To discriminate between proliferation and collective endothelial cell synchronization effects, we inhibited proliferation by systemic treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) 24 hr prior to and again concomitant with intraocular mVegfa 165 injection, and analysed proliferation and retinal patterning 24 hr post Vegfa treatment. EdU incorporation revealed a complete block in proliferation in the MMC treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–d</xref>). Blocking proliferation alone without Vegfa treatment lead to reduced vascular density in particular in the peripheral zone that developed over the duration of MMC treatment, in line with the proliferation zone in normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Interestingly however, the diameter increase at expense of branching complexity after Vegfa treatment was equally evident in samples from MMC plus Vegfa treated pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k,l</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for the morphogenic effects of quantitative changes in Vegfa to be independent of proliferation. Although proliferation will likely contribute to vessel size increase under high Vegfa, surprisingly, it is not required. Instead we propose that the increased coupling of cells through elevated Dll4/Notch signaling, drives clustering of cells through synchronization of cellular dynamics that interfere with branching, but promote vessel diameter increase.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.033</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>High levels of Vegfa induce vessel expansion even in absence of EC proliferation.</title><p>Representative image of a tile scan showing IsoB4 (red) and EdU staining (green) in non treated (control; <bold>a–a’</bold>), MMC (<bold>bb’</bold>), Vegfa 165 (<bold>cc’</bold>) and MMC_Vegfa 165 (<bold>d–d’</bold>) treated retinas.

At normal physiological levels, that typically correspond with developmental angiogenesis, Dll4 fluctuates dynamically in individual cells; the lateral-inhibition feedback with the Vegfr system functions to generate differences between neighbouring cells that manifest themselves as a salt-and-pepper distribution of <italic>Dll4</italic> high and low cells. As a consequence, the salt-and-pepper distribution of tip and stalk cell phenotypes, although individually transient, support the differential behaviour of neighbouring cells at any given time. Dynamic observations in embryoid body sprouting assays indicate that the differential behaviour is critical for branching and continuous elongation. At higher Vegfa levels however, the dynamic fluctuations between neighbouring cells become synchronized, corresponding with a loss of salt-and-pepper patterning. This synchronization, and thus local clustering of cells with high or low Dll4 levels, is dependent on Notch activity, as dampening or inhibiting Notch activity disrupts synchronization. Observations of dynamic behaviour in EBs stimulated with high Vegfa demonstrate that synchronization of <italic>Dll4</italic> levels coincides with synchronized sprouting activity. As a consequence, sprouting and branching is disrupted and the vessel instead expands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The finding of clustered <italic>Dll4</italic> expression by in situ hybridisation, <italic>Dll4</italic> reporter and protein staining in the vessel expansions in the OIR model and in dilated vessels after Vegfa injection and in mouse glioblastomas together indicate that synchronization is an important principle of vessel malformation in disease.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.037</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustrating the important role of dynamic dll4 fluctuations in driving vessel expansion.</title><p>Individual cells Dll4 levels fluctuate asynchronously during normal vessel growth. Under high VEGF or high Dll4 these fluctuations become more synchronized leading to homogenous cellular dll4 levels that fluctuate between high and low levels together, driving vessel expansion rather than branching. In contrast, when Dll4 levels are homogeneous, but not fluctuating (termed 'static dll4' scenarios here for simplicity) the result is that cells either all remain activated and behave as tip cells (hypersprouting phenotype) or are all constantly inhibited, prohibiting vessel extension and driving a sparse branching phenotype. Thus the expansion phenotype is specifically driven by the dynamic fluctuations between homogeneous Dll4 high/low levels, rather than by the homogeneity of the Dll4 levels alone.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12167.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12167.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12167-fig9-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>Dll4</italic> overexpression, despite under the normal regulatory control, in the absence of altered Vegfa levels, also leads to the same synchronization and thus clustering and loss of branching. Together with the observed up-regulation of <italic>Dll4</italic> under Vegfa control, this suggests that Vegfa-induced <italic>Dll4</italic> up-regulation is the key to synchronization. The observed clustering, stunted sprouting and expansion upon <italic>Dll4</italic> overexpression in the absence of an altered Vegfa environment further suggests that synchronization itself is the major driver of the switch from branching to expansion. When injecting Vegfa in vivo or raising the concentration in vitro, not only the concentration of Vegfa, but also its spatial distribution changes. We previously proposed that Vegfa injection disrupts the Vegfa gradient, thereby reducing tip cell migration, while driving stalk cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruhrberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</xref>). Based on static images, we concluded that this shift in the balance between tip migration and stalk proliferation reduces branching while driving expansion. Our new dynamic data, the transient nature of tip and stalk cell phenotypes, and the new insights from blocking proliferation under this condition and from computational modelling give rise to a different interpretation. Computational modelling previously predicted that reduced Vegfa gradients interfere with tip/stalk specification as the reduced differences in the local environment make it more difficult for the lateral-inhibition feedback loop to establish differences between neighboring endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2009</xref>). A loss in gradient already pushes the system towards synchronization, an effect that is dramatically aggravated by higher Vegfa levels. Our present findings indicate that the underlying mechanism driving expansion and clustering, instead of branching and elongation, in situations of reduced Vegfa gradients and high Vegfa levels lies in Dll4/Notch mediated synchronization of adjacent cells as they fail to establish a dynamic salt and pepper pattern.</p><p>Intriguingly, overexpression of <italic>Dll4</italic> in tumour cells has been shown to lead to reduced vessel branching and dramatically increased tumour vessel diameter, with evidence that tumour cell Dll4 activates endothelial Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Why and how this leads to tumour vessel expansion has since remained unclear. In the light of our current results it is tempting to speculate that overexpression of <italic>Dll4</italic> in tumour cells adjacent to the endothelium will cause synchronization of endothelial Notch dynamics, similar to the situation of overexpressed endothelial <italic>Dll4</italic>. Conversely, inhibition of Dll4 by antibody, genetic haploinsufficiency or Notch inhibition by DAPT all lead to a dramatic increase in vessel branching, but reduced vessel diameter in tumour vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ridgway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noguera-Troise et al., 2006</xref>). We propose that this switch in tumour vessel patterning is driven by the loss of synchronization, and thus a switch from collectively synchronized cell behaviour to differential individual behaviour. Given our recent identification of Notch-regulated differential VE-cadherin adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley et al., 2014</xref>), it is conceivable that synchronization leads to vessel expansion through the loss of adhesion differences. According to this concept, differential adhesion drives intercalation and thus vessel elongation, whereas synchronization disrupts intercalation, thus causing cells to cluster and thereby enlarge vessel diameter. As endothelial cell migration as opposed to endothelial cell apoptosis appears to present the key mechanism in vessel remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franco et al., 2015</xref>), our current finding of Vegfa-induced vessel enlargement and loss of branching in the absence of proliferation further supports the idea that synchronization disrupts the normal differential migration/intercalation behaviour of endothelial cells and thereby leads to the observed morphological changes. Our observations in EBs overexpressing <italic>Dll4</italic> or treated with high Vegfa levels demonstrate that Notch inhibition is sufficient to break the synchronisation and restore branching morphogenesis.</p><p>Other developmental morphogenesis systems make use of Notch driven synchronization, a phenomenon first described and best understood in somitogenesis, the formation of mesodermal tissue blocks that form the segmental pattern of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tajbakhsh and Spörle, 1998</xref>). The presomitic mesoderm close to the tip of the tail bud shows dynamic activity of Dll/Notch and Notch target genes of <italic>hes/hey</italic> family. Intriguingly, the zone closest to the tip shows unsynchronized salt-and-pepper patterning of this activity, whilst temporal waves of synchronized activity emerge just rostral of this zone. Although many genes and components of the Notch, Fgf and Wnt-signaling pathway oscillate in the presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldbeter and Pourquié, 2008</xref>) and single cells oscillate autonomously through feedback loops in the regulation of the hes family of transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kageyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Webb et al., 2016</xref>), it has become clear that Dll/Notch activity between the cells is the driver of synchronization. In the absence of Notch activity or Dll expression cells gradually drift out of synchrony, leading to loss of somite pattern and thus vertebrae defects. Recent work by Oates and colleagues using mathematical modelling and experimentation identified that the levels of Dll expression not only critically influence synchronization, but also affect the periodicity of the synchronized oscillations by changing the strength of coupling between the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrgen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Whether cell-autonomous hes-driven oscillations occur in endothelial cells remains unclear, but speculations on waves of activity of the Bmp and Notch pathway in angiogenesis have recently been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beets et al., 2013</xref>). Our computational model does not simulate cell-intrinsic oscillations that are coupled via Dll4/Notch. Yet, the ultimate behaviour of the Vegfa-Dll4-Notch-Vegfr feedback loop shows highly similar elements when Dll4 levels change. Thus, although the precise wiring of the signalling circuit is different, there is a striking analogy in that rising Dll4 levels under the influence of Vegfa stimulation will increase the coupling strength between neighbouring endothelial cells. This will ultimately drive the cells to switch from differential to synchronized behaviour and thus to iterative sprouting and retraction, disrupting branching morphogenesis.</p><p>Although Vegfa has long been known to have different effects at different concentrations, akin to a morphogen, the underlying mechanism has not been understood. Our current results provide a mechanistic explanation for the dosage effects of Vegfa. Further, the identified switch in behaviour from differential to synchronized by changing Dll4/Notch coupling strength between endothelial cells under the influence of rising Vegfa concentrations identifies a novel, and to date unique, mechanism of action for a morphogen.</p><p>From an applied perspective, the identified mechanism has wide reaching implications for our understanding of the effects of anti-Vegfa therapy in cancer, and will hopefully stimulate new research into dosing regimes of both Vegfa and Dll4/Notch inhibitors, separate and in combination, and effects on vessel normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and treatments</title><p>Mice were maintained at London Research Institute under standard husbandry conditions.

(2009)</xref> in order to see the effects of more detailed filopodia and cell shape changes than in the coarse grained model defined above. Cells are initialised around a pre-existing vascular tube, with periodic boundary conditions, two cells per cross section. New tip cells can be selected from it by stimulation with Vegf, which is adhered to a square lattice of collagen extending above the vessel in the y axis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al. [2009</xref>] for more details).</p><p>The following extensions were made to this model here: 1) Collagen is deposited by the cell by creating a blue square in every lattice site that the cell body (excluding filopodia) touches. Collagen here does not currently change the Vegf signalling but merely shows where the cell body has been located. 2) The cell body was allowed to randomly move forward along filopodia tracks with a small probability (0.001 per filopodia/per timestep) whereas previously only contact with another tip cell’s filopodia would trigger this migratory behaviour (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al. [2009</xref>] for more details). This was added to improve realism to the model such that tip cells can migrate slowly before they meet another tip cell when this behaviour would then be enhanced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Simulating high Vegf injection</title><p>After the salt and pepper pattern has been established and cells are close to anastamosing (representing a normal developing retinal vasculature) an injection of high Vegf (100x the normal level) was simulated which was also assumed to eradicate any gradient of Vegf above the vessel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Cancer Research UK, the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, the Leducq Transatlantic Network ARTEMIS, and an ERC starting grant Reshape (311719).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Collective endothelial Dll4/Notch dynamics switch between vessel branching and expansion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tanya Whitfield as Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an outstanding paper from a world-leading group presenting a new paradigm for consideration of how the vessels choose to branch or expand their diameter, which seem to be reciprocal processes. Through a series of new models, elegant microscopy and video microscopy, plus predictive computational modelling, this paper shows that Δ-like 4 fluctuates in individual endothelial cells in sprouting vessels. The authors propose a model by which the synchronisation (or lack thereof) of Dll4 expression between ECs governs their collective cell behaviour during vessel branching and expansion. The study proposes that under normal conditions, lateral inhibitory effects of Notch promote a salt and pepper expression of Dll4 that co-ordinates endothelial migratory dynamics to regulate angiogenesis, while under high VEGF conditions, Dll4 expression becomes synchronised in ECs, which disrupts normal sprouting leading to reduced branching and elongation. The switch between branching and expansion is a potentially critical phase in the development of blood vessels, highly relevant to understanding pathological angiogenesis and indeed, in the future, therapies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 3 has commented that the length of the manuscript and the sheer volume of data presented make it unwieldy for the reader. The format of <italic>eLife</italic> allows flexibility in publishing longer manuscripts, but it would be helpful if the authors could ensure that the manuscript is written as concisely as possible.</p><p>2) The zebrafish model, although elegant, would need further analysis for demonstration that branching behaviour is due to altered Dll4 signalling. This is perhaps an area that could be cut from the current MS and used to form the basis of a separate study, with further experiments as suggested by Reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>3) If Dll4-blocking antibodies and the LLC lung carcinoma model are available, the experiments suggested by Reviewer 3 should be attempted.</p><p>The full reviews are appended for your information.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>It is clear the GBM staining data is of interest, showing the extensive empty collagen 4 sleeves, supporting the evidence for sprouting and retraction. Such sleeves have been seen before, however, with other extra-cellular proteins secreted by endothelial cells the work of Donald McDonald has shown empty sleeves of collagen after regression of vessels and then regrowth down these sleeves.</p><p>Also, whether the vessels that show little or no signal have full flow, needs to be considered.</p><p>It would have been useful to have an injection of antibody staining vessels to show perfusion to match the expression patterns of Δ-like 4, and to consider the possibilities that poor flow or vessel shutdown and shunting has caused some of these changes as opposed to dynamic fluctuations of Δ-like 4.</p><p>The zebrafish model is elegant and extremely well filmed. However, the retraction and sprouting, although clearly demonstrated, is not proven to be related to the Δ-like 4 signalling in this model. Is it blocked by notch inhibition and is it possible to do ISH in these experiments to look at the pattern of Δ-like 4 RNA expression?</p><p>The retinal experiments are highly convincing but it would be useful to have more validation in the brain tumour and zebrafish as these are perhaps the two most critical relevant to human therapy currently.</p><p>It would be useful to consider what the mechanism actually is that leads from the switch from branching to expansion. Is it possible, although obviously well beyond the scope of this article, it might be useful to discuss how this might be occuring. What might be downstream of Δ-like 4 involved in this pathway?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors present strong evidence for local Notch-dependent synchronisation of Dll4 dynamics in vitro and in vivo by comparison of stabilised and destabilised fluorescent Dll4 reporters. The authors nicely demonstrate that the mitogenic functions of VEGF are not responsible for vessel expansion, which is surprising and lends further support to their hypothesis. The authors also highlight the existence of synchronous Dll4 dynamics during particular pathological angiogenic situations, (retinopathy and tumour angiogenesis) suggesting that Dll4 synchronisation may be central to EC pathology in these. However, the link between Dll4 dynamics and promotion of vessel expansion/disruption of branching is correlative and the authors do not formally demonstrate that Dll4 synchronisation causes the phenotypic changes. These experiments however, would be exceptionally technically demanding, if at all possible, and it is not the intention of this reviewer to request them. However, the authors may want to tone down statements implying evidence of a causal link between the phenomenon and the phenotype.</p><p>That said, these studies have important implications for the field by stimulating a reinterpretation of the idea that VEGF levels, rather than shifting the balance between tip cell migration and stalk cell proliferation to reduce branching and drive vessel expansion, may in fact act to control synchronisation of adjacent cells via Dll4.</p><p>The difficulties in defining individual cell boundaries during timelapses of embryoid body cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) could have been circumvented by performing complementary experiments in zebrafish embryos e.g. by employing CRISPR-mediated knock in or established dll4 enhancers to drive destabilised reporters (Sacilotto et al., 2013). This may have also helped formalise the concept of Dll4 dynamics as the driver in this process because it would facilitate mosaic analysis of adjacent ECs with different competencies for receiving VEGF and inducing Dll4. That said, these experiments are technically challenging and may only serve to 're-invent the wheel'. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is also particularly intractable and given its importance in the manuscript would benefit from some simplification to make the observations clearer.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript is a technological tour de force that is very heavy for the reader. Interesting and important transgenic reporters are introduced and there a respectable effort to create a refined computational model to describe the endothelial responses to VEGF-Dll4/Notch synchronization. The data fits to the mechanistic explanation of the sprouting/branching and loss of polarization/expansion that started to evolve after the 2003 JCB paper of Dr. Gerhardt. The manuscript contains a wealth of data.</p><p>I have the following brief comments:</p><p>The manuscript should be shortened by at least one third.</p><p>The authors do not show that Dll4 is directly responsible for the pathological angiogenesis in the retina. This could be done by injection of Dll4 blocking antibodies. Would this inhibit the clustering of cells with high and low Dll4 expression?</p><p>It is somewhat disappointing the reporter mice did not work for the tumor transplants, and instead the tumor experiment employed a mouse-zebrafish hybrid model. It is not clear to what extent the results can be generalized. The architecture of tumor vessels is known to differ greatly between for example B16 melanomas and LLC lung carcinomas in mice. I would like to suggest that the authors include analysis of the LLC model, which is a simple experiment. Some discussion should also be included on Dll4-Notch signaling in vessel co-option, which is a common invasive growth pattern in the brain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12167.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Reviewer 3 has commented that the length of the manuscript and the sheer volume of data presented make it unwieldy for the reader.

However, although these experiments would in principle be possible, we are not convinced they provide important additional information. We clearly show in the EB model that the clustering effect and synchronization is Notch dependent. The requested Dll4 antibody experiment in the retinopathy model has been performed (although with g-secretase inhibition) in previous work, cited below. It is well established that inhibiting Notch signaling in this context promotes branching. However, the underlying mechanism was not understood. At our new location in Berlin, after moving from London, we still don’t have the licence to perform the retinopathy and injection experiment.</p><p>Please also see our detailed response to the tumour model below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>It is clear the GBM staining data is of interest, showing the extensive empty collagen 4 sleeves, supporting the evidence for sprouting and retraction.

In the context of our present work, it is clear that the mechanism of differential dynamics versus synchronized dynamics are principally flow independent, as they occur in the EB sprouts that do not carry flow.</p><p>Also the retinal model illustrates that the morphogenic changes upon VEGF injection occur in perfused vascular networks. Similarly, it is well established that the tufts in OIR are perfused. Therefore it is clear that the observed mechanisms can occur in both unperfused systems including endothelial monolayers and perfused systems such as in vivo vascular networks. The tumour condition in particular is more tricky as our new dynamic imaging shows that flow patterns are not only diverse across the tumour but also change dynamically within given vessels. Therefore a true correlative analysis of flow changes and dll4 patterns would require the attempted but unsuccessful dynamic monitoring of both flow and dll4 expression changes with genetic reporters in vivo.</p><p>Whilst we would anticipate that such data give additional insights, and we assume that flow will have some impact on the dynamics, the present work identifies a basic mechanism that in its essence can function also independently of flow. This is essential for the understanding and any future discussion on flow influences should await new models and solid data.</p><p><italic>The zebrafish model is elegant and extremely well filmed.

In light of the overall comments and recommendations by the referees and editors, we have removed the zebrafish data and will follow up on this in a full new study in the future to further investigate the details. We are currently working on a new dynamic dll4 reporter in fish that should enable more detailed insights in this model. The omission of the current fish data allows shortening of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The retinal experiments are highly convincing but it would be useful to have more validation in the brain tumour and zebrafish as these are perhaps the two most critical relevant to human therapy currently.</italic></p><p>We agree that more validation in the tumour and fish would be desirable, but this requires a set of new tools not currently available and satisfactory.

Is it possible, although obviously well beyond the scope of this article, it might be useful to discuss how this might be occuring. What might be downstream of Δ-like 4 involved in this pathway?</italic></p><p>At this point we can only speculate. Future work will address this aspect in detail. However, our work on the role of VE-cadherin differential adhesion in angiogenesis (Bentley Nature Cell Biology 2014) identified differential VE-cadherin dynamics to operate downstream of differential Notch activity. The computational analysis of such a mechanism indicated that any loss of heterogeneous activity in Notch signaling would disrupt vessel elongation by synchronizing the cells and thus rendering them all equally adhesive. The idea from these studies would be that differential adhesion drives intercalation and thus vessel elongation, whereas synchronization disrupts intercalation, thus causing cells to cluster and thereby enlarge vessel diameter. We have now added a sentence in the Discussion of the revised version.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2: The authors present strong evidence for local Notch-dependent synchronisation of Dll4 dynamics</italic> in vitro <italic>and</italic> in vivo <italic>by comparison of stabilised and destabilised fluorescent Dll4 reporters.

We also agree with the stated limitations, in particular that we do not directly show a causal link between synchronization of Dll4 and vessel expansion. However, we do demonstrate, at least in the EB system, that Notch signaling is required for the phenomenon of synchronization and vessel expansion. Together with the mechanistic studies on the differential adhesion and endothelial cell intercalation published previously (Bentley et al. NCB 2014), we feel there is sufficient evidence to suggest a causal link between synchronization and the expansion phenotype. We have taken care to avoid overstatements and hope this will be appropriately interpreted by the reader.</p><p><italic>That said, these studies have important implications for the field by stimulating a reinterpretation of the idea that VEGF levels, rather than shifting the balance between tip cell migration and stalk cell proliferation to reduce branching and drive vessel expansion, may in fact act to control synchronisation of adjacent cells via Dll4.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The difficulties in defining individual cell boundaries during timelapses of embryoid body cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) could have been circumvented by performing complementary experiments in zebrafish embryos e.g. by employing CRISPR-mediated knock in or established dll4 enhancers to drive destabilised reporters (Sacilotto</italic> et al.<italic>, 2013).

That said, these experiments are technically challenging and may only serve to 're-invent the wheel'.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this comment and have been pursuing this goal also from the start. In fact, over long periods we discussed and collaborated with Sarah De Val to see whether the enhancers would be helpful. However, to date the dynamic response of these enhancers is not fully clear and we preferred to use the full BAC approach to be sure that we have the essential regulatory elements included. Our efforts to duplicate this approach in fish however were not successful. We are now working intensely on the CRISPR-mediated knock in but it will be some time before this is at a stage for analysis. We were hoping we may get somewhere during this revision period, but the knock-in is proving to be difficult (knock-out works well). Given the large amount of data already in this manuscript, and the editorial recommendation to take out our fish data to shorten, we suggest that the full dynamic analysis in vivo in fish is kept for a follow up study. As noted by the referee, it is not clear whether this will provide deeper insight or simply a confirmation.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is also particularly intractable and given its importance in the manuscript would benefit from some simplification to make the observations clearer.</italic></p><p>We share the desire to keep this important figure simple. However, we also feel it is important to show original data rather than a schematic summary of the observations. We therefore chose to show representative examples of the three experimental situations, control, high Dll4 and high VEGF. The simplifications we came up with for ease of visualization are to show first all spheres for tracking, then just two at the front, and to show the tracking intensity profiles together, and separately on the right. We apologize for the small fonts and thin lines that have made it too difficult to read. We have now enlarged the fonts and lines to improve this figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript is a technological tour de force that is very heavy for the reader. Interesting and important transgenic reporters are introduced and there a respectable effort to create a refined computational model to describe the endothelial responses to VEGF-Dll4/Notch synchronization. The data fits to the mechanistic explanation of the sprouting/branching and loss of polarization/expansion that started to evolve after the 2003 JCB paper of Dr. Gerhardt. The manuscript contains a wealth of data.</italic></p><p><italic>I have the following brief comments:</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript should be shortened by at least one third.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for the enthusiastic and positive comments, and we appreciate the manuscript is rather dense and lengthy. We have worked very hard to make this complex topic and the diverse methodology used here understandable for a broad audience, and have continued this effort in the revision. Following the editorial advice and the comment by this referee, we shortened the text, although not quite by a third. All attempts to achieve this led to omission of critical information and loss of congruence. We feel the revised version is sufficiently concise but comprehensive.</p><p><italic>The authors do not show that Dll4 is directly responsible for the pathological angiogenesis in the retina. This could be done by injection of Dll4 blocking antibodies. Would this inhibit the clustering of cells with high and low Dll4 expression?</italic></p><p>We agree, we would have liked to do this, but Dll4 blocking antibodies were not available to use at the time. Also during our revision period, we did not have access to Dll4 blocking antibodies, but more importantly we did not have the license to perform this experiment at our new location in Berlin. This licence is pending. In any case, it is clear that blocking Notch signaling in the oxygen induced retinopathy model leads to increased branching and less tuft formation. This was already published in supplementary material in our original Nature paper on the role of Dll4 in tip cell biology in 2007 (Hellström et al. Nature 2007). However, the mechanisms we identify now, and the dynamic understanding was missing at that time.</p><p> <italic>It is somewhat disappointing the reporter mice did not work for the tumor transplants, and instead the tumor experiment employed a mouse-zebrafish hybrid model. It is not clear to what extent the results can be generalized. The architecture of tumor vessels is known to differ greatly between for example B16 melanomas and LLC lung carcinomas in mice. I would like to suggest that the authors include analysis of the LLC model, which is a simple experiment. Some discussion should also be included on Dll4-Notch signaling in vessel co-option, which is a common invasive growth pattern in the brain.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee. For more than a year we have now continuously invested heavily into getting the reporter mice working for live imaging in the tumour model. We invested 1.2M Euro into a 2P-LSM with the most sensitive detectors available, and optimized together with physicists and the company every aspect to get highest possible sensitivity. We can study angiogenesis in the tumour with great precision (manuscript without any Dll4/Notch data is currently in revision in science translational medicine, can be provided if requested) but sadly have not succeeded in detecting the destabilized reporter signal. At this time we cannot be sure about the reason. One confounding factor is the wavelength profile of Venus, which falls right in the middle of the autofluorescence spectrum. We get quite some signal in the expected Spectrum, but this is unfortunately not derived from the reporter. The attempts to separate any signal from autofluorescence that were successful in the ES cells, failed in the in vivo setting in the brain. Secondly, it is possible, that the overall levels in the brain are not as high as in the retina where we can clearly detect the signal when studying fresh material. This has been frustratingly tricky, but cannot be helped. Therefore the best direct data to date remain from the ES cell model. We hope that future work with new reporters including in the fish model will allow live imaging in living species including tumours. Importantly, we do not believe the lack of this in vivo data at this time invalidates our novel conclusions.</p><p>As for the tumour models, we disagree that comparing different tumour models, would provide new insight. Even if the architecture is different in different tumour models, how would this help? The important question is to see whether the different tumour vessel architecture that forms in different regions within a tumour correlates with evidence for altered Dll4 spatial patterns that would indicate possible breakdown of salt-and-pepper patterns. The combined Dll4 protein staining and ISH on tumour material is very challenging and lengthy procedure, which requires optimization for every new tissue type. We strongly feel that this investment is not justified given questionable insight prospects. In addition, confirming data in models that are intrinsically more variable and not orthotopic seems difficult to justify. Given that we are asked to reduce and shorten, we hope this referee will agree that we do not follow this avenue.</p><p>Concerning cooption, we agree this is a common mode in invasive tumours including glioblastoma. However, the model we are using is based on implantation of pre-aggregate tumour cell spheres. This model shows less invasive behavior at the borders and grows much more as a solid mass that attracts blood vessels. Having said that, there is some invasion at the borders, and we assume also some cooption. We would be happy to discuss this in relation to dll4/Notch if we had a good way to distinguish these modes in fixed tissues. At this time, any such discussion would be purely speculative and we don’t have any indication of specific differences or commonalities between coopted or sprouting-derived vessels. We suggest this is left out for future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
