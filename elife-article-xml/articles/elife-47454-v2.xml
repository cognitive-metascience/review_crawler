the development, growth, and maintenance of bone. However, the molecular mechanism by which mechanical stimuli are converted into osteogenesis and bone formation remains unclear. Here we report that Piezo1, a bona fide mechanotransducer that is critical for various biological processes, plays a critical role in bone formation. Knockout of Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells disrupts the osteogenesis of osteoblasts and severely impairs bone structure and strength. Bone loss that is induced by mechanical unloading is blunted in knockout mice. Intriguingly, simulated microgravity treatment reduced the function of osteoblasts by suppressing the expression of Piezo1. Furthermore, osteoporosis patients show reduced expression of Piezo1, which is closely correlated with osteoblast dysfunction. These data collectively suggest that Piezo1 functions as a key mechanotransducer for conferring mechanosensitivity to osteoblasts and determining mechanical-load-dependent bone formation, and represents a novel therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis or mechanical unloading-induced severe bone loss.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47454.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bones in our skeletons are constantly exposed to mechanical forces, including those exerted by our muscles and also Earth’s gravity. These forces normally help osteoblasts, the cells which build new bone tissue, ensure that bones grow correctly and remain strong. Removing mechanical loads from bones, however, disrupts this process, leading to rapid loss of bone tissue. This is why both astronauts in space (where gravity is much weaker) and bed-ridden patients often go on to develop brittle bones.</p><p>To detect and respond to mechanical forces, cells use specialized sensor proteins. One such ‘mechanosensor’ is a protein called Piezo1, which is found on the surface of many different types of cells in our bodies. It helps cells respond to touch, pressure, or stretching of the surrounding tissue. For example, Piezo1 in nerve cells underpins our sense of touch, while in the cells lining our blood vessels it senses the force exerted by blood flow.</p><p>Although osteoblasts clearly respond to mechanical stimuli, exactly how they do so has remained unknown. Sun et al. therefore wanted to find out if Piezo1 also acted as a mechanosensor in osteoblasts, and if so, what role it might play in the loss or formation of bone tissue after changes in the amount of force the bone is exposed to.</p><p>Experiments using mouse cells grown in the laboratory revealed that Piezo1 was present in osteoblasts and did indeed help the cells respond to mechanical impact of being poked by a microscopic probe. Mice that had been genetically engineered to remove Piezo1 from their osteoblasts did not grow properly, appearing stunted in adulthood. In these mice, the bones supporting most of the body’s weight were also shorter and weaker.</p><p>Crucially, putting normal bone cells in a low-gravity simulator – therefore mimicking space flight – or exposing mice to conditions mimicking bed-rest was enough to reduce the level of Piezo1 in osteoblasts. In human patients with osteoporosis, where bones become brittle with age, a decrease in levels of Piezo1 is correlated with increasing bone loss. These results show that Piezo1 is required to make healthy bone tissue, and that its loss is probably involved in the increasing fragility that occurs when mechanical forces applied to bones are reduced.</p><p>This work is an important step towards understanding how our bones are built and maintained. In the future, increasing Piezo1 activity within osteoblasts may lead to treatments for bone loss, whether in hospital patients or astronauts.</p></abstract><kwd-group

adapts to changes in mechanical loads associated with body weight, movement and gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iwaniec and Turner, 2016</xref>). Such a mechanical-load-induced remodeling process is determined through the functional interaction between the bone-forming osteoblasts and the bone-absorbing osteoclasts. Perturbation of this remodeling process can lead to the well-documented bone-loss phenomenon that occurs upon mechanical unloading during long-term confinement in bed or spaceflight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagaraja and Risin, 2013</xref>). Impaired osteoblast function might contribute to reduced bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carmeliet and Bouillon, 2001</xref>). However, the mechanical response properties and the underlying mechanotransduction molecules that are active during bone formation remain poorly understood.</p><p>The mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) mediates mechanical responses in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>), including vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>), smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Retailleau et al., 2015</xref>), red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>), epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>), neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>) and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>). Constitutive knockout of Piezo1 results in embryonic lethality in mice, mainly because of defects in vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>). Piezo1 senses shear stress in vascular endothelial cells and red blood cells, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and of red blood cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. Piezo1 can also sense the local cellular environment and thus has a role in epithelial cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>), the lineage choice of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>), axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koser et al., 2016</xref>) and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given its widespread function in various cell types and biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>), we have reasoned that Piezo1 might play important roles in mechanical-load-dependent bone formation and remodeling. In line with this, expression data obtained from the BioGPS database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=234839">http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=234839</ext-link>) indicate that Piezo1 is highly expressed in osteoblasts. Furthermore, a previous study has shown that the expression level of Piezo1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was correlated to the promotion of osteoblast differentiation and to the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>). Although Piezo1 was proposed to function as a mechanoreceptor that initiates the response to hydrostatic pressure (HP) in MSCs, the channel activities and the in vivo contribution to bone formation of Piezo1 expressed in MSCs and MSC-derived cell lineages such as osteoblasts have not been directly examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we set out to address whether Piezo1 might function as a key mechanotransducer that confers mechanosensitivity to the bone-forming osteoblasts and that consequently determines mechanical-load-induced bone formation and remodeling. Toward this goal, we systematically examined the role of Piezo1 in bone formation using Ocn-Cre-dependent Piezo1 knockout mice, mechanical-unloading-induced mouse and cellular models, and human osteoporosis samples. We have found that Piezo1 plays a key role in determining the mechanical response of osteoblasts and the in vivo formation and remodeling of bone in mice and humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and function of Piezo1 in the osteoblast cell line</title><p>To explore the role of Piezo1 in bone cell types, we initially examined the mechanical response of the commonly used pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 and the pre-osteoclast cell line RAW264.7. To this end, we directly measured the mechanically evoked cationic currents using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology coupled with mechanical poking of the cell membrane with a piezo-driven blunt glass pipette. MC3T3-E1 displayed mechanically activated currents in a step-dependent manner with a maximal current of 87.7 ± 11.6 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). By contrast, much smaller mechanically activated currents were recorded in cell of the pre-osteoclast cell line RAW264.7 (24.0 ± 5.0 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). In line with the recorded mechanically activated currents, the mRNA of Piezo1 was significantly higher in MC3T3-E1 cells than in RAW264.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Furthermore, either siRNA-mediated knockdown of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>) or the application of GsMTX4, a relatively specific blocker of the Piezo channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2011</xref>), significantly reduced the mechanically activated currents in MC3T3-E1 cells (from 68.6 ± 7.0 pA to 17.3 ± 2.9 pA or 21.7 ± 5.6 pA, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). These data suggest that Piezo1 is expressed and mediates the mechanically activated currents in MC3T3-E1 cells. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Piezo1 in MC3T3-E1 cells decreased the expression of the functional marker genes of osteoblasts revealed by QRT-PCR, including alkaline phosphatase (<italic>Alp</italic>), osteocalcin (<italic>Bglap</italic>) and collagen 1 (<italic>Col1α1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), and reduced the Alp staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).

In line with the study of MC3T3-E1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we detected mRNA and protein expression of Piezo1 in the bone tissue and primary osteoblasts derived from littermate Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–e</xref>). The Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice show significantly reduced expression of Piezo1 specifically in the bone, but not other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>), consistent with the specific knockout of Piezo1 in the bone. Furthermore, osteoblasts that were derived from Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice also had drastically reduced expression of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). Notably, the reduction of Piezo1 was more complete in the osteoblasts than in the whole bone tissue, indicating the possible expression of Piezo1 in non-osteoblast-lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–e</xref>), which could not be ablated by using Ocn-Cre mice. We quantitatively compared the mechanically evoked currents of primary osteoblasts isolated from Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice. Consistent with the recordings from MC3T3-E1 cells, Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> osteoblasts displayed poking-induced currents in a step-dependent manner with a maximal current of 152.3 ± 21.6 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref>). The inactivation Tau of the current is 32.8 ± 4.1 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,h</xref>). The maximal currents of the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> osteoblasts were significantly reduced to 66.0 ± 14.8 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref>), while the inactivation Tau was unchanged (27.8 ± 3.9 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,h</xref>). The remaining mechanically evoked currents could be due to incomplete knockout of Piezo1, as residual Piezo1 proteins were detected in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and the excision rate in osteoblasts of Ocn-Cre mice was estimated to be ~88% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>).

However, it remains unclear how the bone tissue directly senses mechanical changes. In the present study, we have focused on characterizing the expression and function of the mechanically activated Piezo1 channel in bone-forming osteoblasts. Piezo1 is characteristically activated by various forms of mechanical stimulation, including poking, stretching, shear stress and substrate deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poole et al., 2014</xref>), and mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon opening to initiate downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, such as the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2014</xref>), eNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Piezo1 was directly activated by asymmetric membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>) and lateral membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>). In line with being an exquisite mechanosensitive cation channel, the full-length 2547-residue mouse Piezo1 forms a remarkable homo-trimeric three-bladed, propeller-like architecture, comprising a central ion-conducting pore module and three highly curved and non-planar blades, each of which is composed of nine transmembrane helical units (THUs) each of four transmembrane helices (TM) that are connected to the pore by a 9 nm-long beam-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). The blade-beam structure might form a lever-like intramolecular transduction pathway for long-distance mechanical gating of the central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Bone-residing osteoblasts might constantly experience mechanical forces such as shear stress and gravity changes. Here, we have found that Piezo1 is expressed in primary osteoblasts and osteocytes, mediates mechanically activated cationic currents and Yoda1 (a Piezo1 chemical activator)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and controls the osteogenesis process via downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, Piezo1 plays an important role in converting mechanical stimuli into osteogenesis of osteoblasts.</p><p>Strikingly, either loss of Piezo1 in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice or HS-treatment of the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice led to severely impaired osteogenesis and bone formation, integrity and strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between mechanical loading and the Piezo1 channel in determining the mechanotransduction process during bone formation and remodeling. A further highlight of this relationship is the influence of mechanical loading on the expression level of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Both microgravity treatment of osteoblasts and mechanical unloading of the mice reduced the expression level of Piezo1. By contrast, fluid shear stress treatment osteoblasts and mechanical loading of mice increased the expression level of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistently, previous studies have shown that hydrostatic pressure enhanced the expression of Piezo1 in mesenchymal stem cells and promoted osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a stiffer mechanical microenvironment increased the expression of Piezo1 in glioma cells, which in turn enhanced tissue stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these data are consistent with a positive feedback loop between the Piezo1 mechanosensor and the mechanical loading experienced by the mechanosensitive cells and organs.</p><p>Bone is highly sensitive to changes of daily mechanical loading and gravity. It has been documented that bone mineral density decreased at 1% per month at the lumbar spine and 1–1.6% per month at the hip in the crew members of the international space station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LeBlanc et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vico and Hargens, 2018</xref>). Thus, bone loss is one of the most serious problems induced by long-term weightlessness during space flight or in bedridden individuals. The revelation of the positive feedback relationship between Piezo1 and mechanical loading in bone remodeling provides a mechanistic explanation for mechanical-unloading-induced bone loss. On the basis of the results from the simulated microgravity experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the lack of gravitational force or mechanical loading during long-term spaceflight or in bedridden individuals might decrease the expression and function of Piezo1 in osteoblasts, which in turn leads to impaired osteogenesis and bone loss. In line with this, we found an apparent correlation between the expression level of Piezo1 and the bone loss in osteoporosis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, both the mechanical-unloading-induced bone loss and the mechanical-loading-induced osteogenesis were blunted in Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting a causal involvement of Piezo1 in bone remodeling. Thus, activating Piezo1 in the bone might represent a novel strategy for preventing or treating mechanical-unloading-induced bone loss. The success in identifying Piezo1 chemical activators such as Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>), Jedi1 and Jedi2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) appears to show the promise to be fulfilled in developing Piezo1-based therapeutics.</p><p>Given that the Ocn-Cre mice used in the study could also drive Cre expression in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), which are derived from osteoblasts and also considered to be mechanosensitive cells in the bone, the observed defects in the bone formation of the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice could also be contributed by the expression of Piezo1 in osteocytes. Indeed, we have found that Piezo1 also functions in the osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The specific contribution of osteocyte-expressing Piezo1 in bone formation remains to be determined by using osteocyte-specific Cre lines in future studies. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that Piezo1 plays a critical role in controlling the formation and mechanical-loading-dependent remodeling of the bone in mouse models and it is closely related with the occurrence of osteoporosis in human patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

For pCAG-Cre-IRES2-GFP-mediated knockout experiments, the primary osteoblasts derived from Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were transfected with pIRES-EGFP and pCAG-Cre-IRES2-GFP plasmid for 48 hr, and cells with green fluorescence were isolated for electrophysiological recording. For simulated microgravity treatment, cells were cultured on coverslips in a six-well plate for 24 hr. Next, the coverslips were transferred to a cell cabinet, which was filled up with medium and sealed to prevent air bubbles. The cell cabinet was incubated in the clinostat system, with the clinostat being continuously rotated at 30 rpm/min, at 37°C for 16 hr. The control group was cultured in the same manner without clinorotation. Cells that were grown on coverslips were directly subjected to electrophysiological recording. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25°C). Mechanical stimulation was delivered to the cell during the patch-clamp recording at an angle of 80° using a fire-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 3–4 μm) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). The downward movement of the probe toward the cell was driven by a Clampex controlled piezo-electric crystal micro-stage (E625 LVPZT Controller/Amplifier; Physik Instrument). The probe had a velocity of 1 μm/ms during the downward and upward motion, and the stimulus was maintained for 150 ms. A series of mechanical steps in 1 μm increments was applied every 20 s, and the currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV. GsMTx4 (Tocris Bioscience) at a concentration of 4 μM was added to the recording chamber for 30 min before the recording. For siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, the MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 4 to 6 hr, the medium was replaced with fresh α-MEM medium. 48 hr after transfection, the cells were dissociated with trypsin EDTA (GIBCO) and triturated in α-MEM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% bovine serum.

In addition, loss of this channel abolishes mechanical-induced bone loss, suggesting that Piezo1 is a key factor in regulating this aspect of bone homeostasis.

This is a well-written manuscript that presents novel insights in bone homeostasis that are supported by convincing data. In my opinion, it will provide a significant advance to the field after having answered the below questions.</p><p>I have no major concerns</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have clearly shown an effect of deleting Piezo1 in osteoblasts using the Osteocalcin-Cre mice as these mice have reduced bone and shown that reducing Piezo1 in MC3T3 osteoblasts reduces the expression of osteogenic markers. The authors conclude this is due to the channels acting as mechanosensors.

As osteocytes are thought to be more mechanically sensitive than osteoblasts, why not test this bone cell type? Why not also look at the levels of Piezo1 in osteocytes?</p><p>2) The authors show that reducing expression of Piezo1 in MC3T3 cells reduced markers of osteogenesis such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and collagen type 1. Can any form of mechanical loading such as shear stress or substrate stretching or 'poking induced currents' increase these markers in osteoblasts? An ideal experiment would be to show that 'poking' induced currents induce osteogenesis and this can be blocked by a Piezo1 antagonist.</p><p>3) For the mice with the targeted deletion of Piezo1 in osteoblasts, it looks like the skeletons are similar in size. Is this correct? It would be important to show this-for example the bone length, morphology etc. What is the weight of these animals? The calvaria in Figure 3A look very different. Is there a deformity in addition to the open suture? A more careful analysis should be performed.</p><p>4) One may not see an effect of unloading on the mice with the targeted deletion of Piezo1 because the bone mass and properties are already at the same level as unloaded wild-type mice. There is a baseline where additional unloading does not result in more bone loss. Therefore, one cannot infer from these studies that these bones are not sensing a lack of loading.</p><p>5) In Figure 5 is appears that something upregulated with unloading that is regulating Piezo1 gene expression. This would suggest another mechanosensor, not Piezo1.</p><p>I would have thought that it would be more important to show that these channels are responsible for bone formation due to loading instead of focusing on a lack of channels are responsible for bone loss due to unloading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47454.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors show the effect of Piezo1 deletion in osteoblasts it would be essential to identify it also as being relevant to osteocytes; so this would entail showing that these channels are operative in osteocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks so much for the suggestion. Osteocytes are also important mechanosensory cells in bone. To explore the role of Piezo1 in osteocytes, we have isolated osteocytes from the bone tissues and examined its mechanical response. Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> osteocytes displayed poking-induced currents in a step-dependent manner with a maximal current of 64.93 ± 13.69 pA. The osteocytes from Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice exhibited significantly reduced Piezo1 protein levels and currents (34.22 ± 4.1 pA) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-D). In contrast, the expression of osteocyte marker gene Sost was increased in bone tissue from Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice.</p><p>We have included these new data in the revised version of the manuscript and clearly stated in the Discussion section that “Given that the Ocn-Cre mice used in the study could also drive Cre expression in osteocytes (Zhang et al., 2002), which are derived from osteoblasts and also considered as mechanosensitive cells in the bone, the observed defects in bone formation of the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice could also be contributed by the expression of Piezo1 in osteocytes. […] Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that Piezo1 plays a critical role in controlling the formation and mechanical loading-dependent remodeling of the bone in mouse models and it is closely related with the occurrence of osteoporosis in human patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be useful to show that LOADING induces Piezo1 and osteogenesis and that blocking this prevents osteogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks so much for the suggestion. To further examine whether Piezo1 is involved in loading induced osteogenesis, we used treadmill running model for mouse and fluid shear stress (FSS) treatment for osteoblasts, two commonly used for assessing the role of mechanical loading on skeleton and cell, respectively. The results showed that exercise treatment led to a significant increase in the expression of Piezo1 as well as the differentiation marker genes of osteoblasts in the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, but not in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice (Figure 6A-C). Similarly, FSS treatment led to significantly increased expression of Piezo1 and osteoblast marker genes (Figure 6D-F) and Alp activity (Figure 6G) in the osteoblasts isolated from Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells, but not in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> cells. These results suggest that Piezo1 plays a critical role in mediating loading induced osteogenesis. We have included these exciting new data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There should be more complete phenotyping of the conditional mice including calvariae which are not load sensitive yet may be abnormal; as well as length and morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have provided the whole phenotype for the newborn and adult mice. The newborn Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice showed incomplete closure of the cranial structure in Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice (Figure 3A). The 2-month-old Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice showed shorter stature (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) and lower body weight (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). The length of the femur and tibia of the 2-month-old Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice was apparently shorter than that of the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> control mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The purpose of this study was to test the role of Piezo1 in conferring mechanosensitivity in osteoblasts using MC3T3 cells, primary osteoblasts from Piezo1Ocn/Ocn and Piezo1fl/fl mice, and human bone samples.

Can any form of mechanical loading such as shear stress or substrate stretching or 'poking induced currents' increase these markers in osteoblasts? An ideal experiment would be to show that 'poking' induced currents induce osteogenesis and this can be blocked by a Piezo1 antagonist.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reviewer’s suggestion, we have treated primary osteoblasts with fluid shear stress (FSS). FSS treatment led to significantly increased expression of Piezo1 and osteoblast marker genes (Figure 6D-F) and Alp activity (Figure 6G) in the osteoblasts isolated from Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells, but not in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> cells. These results suggest that Piezo1 mediated mechanical force induced osteogenesis. Given that we cannot get sufficient amount of the Piezo1 antagonist GsMTX4, we did not performed the blocking experiment as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the mice with the targeted deletion of Piezo1 in osteoblasts, it looks like the skeletons are similar in size. Is this correct? It would be important to show this-for example the bone length, morphology etc. What is the weight of these animals? The calvaria in Figure 3A look very different. Is there a deformity in addition to the open suture? A more careful analysis should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The newborn Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice had similar skeletal size as their Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> littermates. However, at 8 weeks of age, the male Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice showed shorter stature (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) and lower body weight (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). The length of the femur and tibia of the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice was apparently shorter than that of the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> control mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). The Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice exhibited incomplete closure of the cranial structure, but we didn’t find other deformities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One may not see an effect of unloading on the mice with the targeted deletion of Piezo1 because the bone mass and properties are already at the same level as unloaded wild-type mice. There is a baseline where additional unloading does not result in more bone loss. Therefore, one cannot infer from these studies that these bones are not sensing a lack of loading.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reviewer’s concern, we have used treadmill running model for mouse, which is a common used exercise model to assess the role of mechanical loading on skeleton. Interestingly, we have found that exercise treatment led to a significant increase in expression of Piezo1 and the differentiation marker genes in osteoblasts derived from the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, but not from the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice (Figure 6A-C). We have included the new data in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5 is appears that something upregulated with unloading that is regulating Piezo1 gene expression. This would suggest another mechanosensor, not Piezo1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described the positive feedback relationship between Piezo1 mechano-sensing and expression in the Discussion section. “Either loss of Piezo1 in the Piezo1<sup>Ocn/Ocn</sup> mice or HS-treatment of the Piezo1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice led to severely impaired osteogenesis and bone formation, integrity and strength (Figure 3 and Figure 4), demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between mechanical loading and the Piezo1 channel in determining the mechanotransduction process during bone formation and remodeling. […] Collectively, these data are consistent with a positive feedback loop between the Piezo1 mechanosensor and the mechanical loading experienced by the mechanosensitive cells and organs.”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer how the expression of Piezo1 is regulated remains unclear, which clearly merits future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would have thought that it would be more important to show that these channels are responsible for bone formation due to loading instead of focusing on a lack of channels are responsible for bone loss due to unloading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comment. In the revised manuscript, we have carried additional experiments to analyze the role of Piezo1 channel in response to the mechanical loading in osteoblasts in vivo and in vitro. We have included the new data in Figure 6 in the revised version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
