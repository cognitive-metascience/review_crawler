Growth cones are attracted to intermediate targets, but they must switch their response upon arrival so that they can move away and complete the next stage of growth. Here, we show that KPC-1, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> Furin homolog, regulates the level of the branching receptor DMA-1 on dendrites by targeting it to late endosomes. In <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants, the level of DMA-1 is abnormally high on dendrites, resulting in trapping of dendrites at locations where a high level of the cognate ligand, the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1, is present. The misregulation of DMA-1 also causes dendritic self-avoidance defects. Thus, precise regulation of guidance receptors creates flexibility of responses to guidance signals and is critical for neuronal morphogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11008.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11008.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11008.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons are the principal cells in the nervous system that send and receive information. A vast network of neurons helps transmit information throughout the brain and body. The end of the neuron that receives messages forms branched structures called dendrites, the shapes of which determine the signals the neuron receives. Therefore, establishing the correct shape of the dendrites is critical for the neurons to work correctly.</p><p>As dendrites grow during development, signals from the environment tell them where to branch and where to stop. For example, the neurons that transmit information about touch respond to signals from skin cells to guide the growth of their dendrites. These signals bind to receptor proteins on the surface of the neuron. However, the environment around the neurons also contains many guidance signals that the neurons must ignore.</p><p>Dong et al. now show that touch neurons control how they respond to signals by adjusting the abundance of the receptors on their surface. First, genetic mutations were identified that distort the shape of the dendrites of touch-sensing neurons in a simple worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. These neurons lacked the equivalent of an enzyme called Furin and had abnormally high amounts of a receptor protein called DMA-1 on their surfaces. This suggests that controlling the receptor level on dendrites creates flexibility in the guidance choices of dendrites.</p><p>Furin usually cuts up proteins. However, Dong et al. found that Furin prevents DMA-1 from inserting into the membrane of neurons by binding to the receptors and sending them to the lysosomes, cellular compartments where proteins are destroyed. Reducing the number of receptors at the surface of the cell in this way prevents the neuron from responding to the guidance signals at wrong locations. In the future, more studies are needed to understand how the neuron checks and balances this process and how it eventually is turned off.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11008.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11008.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>dendritic branching</kwd><kwd>furin</kwd><kwd>receptor ligand interaction</kwd><kwd>skin neuron interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xintong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS082208-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xintong</given-names></name><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM111320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chieh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chieh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Yeonhee Jenny</given-names></name><name><surname>Özkan</surname><given-names>Engin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enzyme KPC-1/Furin down-regulates the DMA-1 receptor in neurons, allowing growing dendrites to migrate away from intermediate targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developing neuronal dendrites and axons navigate through complex environments before establishing their final morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>). Extracellular cues provide neurites with instructive spatial signals to guide their growth, turning and branching decisions. Different neurons can interpret the same cue differently based on the receptors they express. Many guidance cues support both attractive and repulsive responses, which are mediated by different classes of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>). Axon guidance is achieved not only through cell-specific expression of receptors but also by dynamic regulation of those receptors during neural development.</p><p>A classical example of spatial and temporal regulation of guidance receptors is midline crossing in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> central nervous system (CNS). In the fly nerve cord, many neurons extend their axons across the midline to the contralateral side while others remain on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolodziej et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>). This process critically depends on the midline repellent Slit, its receptor Roundabout (Robo) and another protein Commissureless (Comm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kidd et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). Slit is secreted by midline cells and repels growth cones expressing the Robo receptor. Longitudinal axons that do not cross contain high levels of Robo and are kept away from the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>). Comm, on the other hand, functions in the contralaterally projecting commissural neurons to keep the level of Robo low before commissural axons cross the midline, during which the growth cones need to ignore the repellent Slit. The expression of Comm diminishes after growth cones cross the midline, allowing the Robo receptors to localize onto the plasma membrane of postcrossing growth cones so that the axons can be repelled away from the midline and prevented from recrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). It has been shown that Comm sorts the Robo receptors to endosomal pathways before they reach the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2005</xref>). Similarly, in the vertebrate spinal cord, where no Comm homologue is found, differential responses to the midline repellant Slit is achieved by regulated expression and alternative splicing of the Robo3 receptor isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Pre-crossing axons contain high levels of Robo3.1, which prevents the activation of the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors, thereby allowing axons to grow toward the highly repulsive midline. Upon crossing, Robo3.2 expression is switched on, and it acts in concert with Robo1 and Robo2 to keep axons from recrossing the midline. It remains unknown, however, how neurons achieve such spatiotemporal specificity, and the mechanisms by which Comm and Robo3 are regulated remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ypsilanti et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported that dendrites of the PVD neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans</italic>) follow precisely localized guidance signals SAX-7 and MNR-1 to form highly organized dendritic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). SAX-7 is the ortholog of the vertebrate neuronal adhesion molecule L1CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zallen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). PVD neurons first grow two longitudinally extending 1° dendrites, from which numerous 2° dendrites emerge roughly perpendicular to the 1° dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>). Upon reaching two sublateral lines where the guidance molecule SAX-7 is highly enriched (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the PVD dendrites form stereotyped 'T'-shaped 3° branches. SAX-7 and MNR-1 are both necessary and sufficient to instruct dendrite morphogenesis through direct interactions with the PVD receptor DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Shen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>). SAX-7, MNR-1 and DMA-1 form a tripartite ligand-receptor signaling complex that enables stereotyped dendritic branch formation and stabilization. A close examination of SAX-7 localization revealed that, in addition to the sublateral stripes where 3° branches form, SAX-7 was also enriched in a zone that roughly lined up with the 1° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). Since SAX-7 is expressed and localized well before PVD dendrite morphogenesis begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>), the 2° dendrites encounter the SAX-7 domain as they emerge from the 1° dendrite. In wild-type animals, the vast majority of 2° dendrites grow out of the SAX-7 domain to reach the sublateral line and form 3° branches there. How emerging 2° dendrites 'escape' one attractive SAX-7 domain but grow along another SAX-7 domain is conceptually similar to how the commissural neurons dynamically adjust their axon guidance response to Slit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse during midline crossing.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11008.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants showed severe trapping of PVD dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent images showing (red) morphology of the PVD neuron, (green) localization of SAX-7 in the hypodermal cell, (blue) seam cells and overlay between the three in wild-type worms.

KPC-1 is a member of the paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE) family of proprotein convertases and is shown to be required autonomously in the PVD neurons for menorah formation. Genetic analyses showed that mutations in the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 complex were epistatic to <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salzberg et al., 2014</xref>). However, the functional mechanism of KPC-1 and its relationship with the receptor-ligand complex remain elusive. It is also unclear why weak hypomorphic alleles of <italic>kpc-1</italic> exhibit defects in self-avoidance of the 3° branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salzberg et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that KPC-1, instead of promoting branch outgrowth as proposed in the previous papers, enables the dendrites to move away from the high level of SAX-7 at intermediate targets. Our genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analyses indicate that KPC-1 supports dendrite pathfinding by maintaining a proper level of the DMA-1 receptor on the plasma membrane of dendrites. Loss of KPC-1 causes unregulated and excessive DMA-1, leading to erroneous dendrite guidance choices. These findings present a new mechanism that modulates the neuronal dendrites’ response to extracellular adhesion molecules through controlling the trafficking of dendrite guidance receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of KPC-1 caused PVD dendrites to be trapped around the 1° dendrite</title><p>We reported previously that one component of the PVD dendrite guidance complex, SAX-7, was enriched at specific sub-cellular locations in hypodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, YFP tagged SAX-7 expressed in the hypodermal cell was highly enriched in two longitudinal sublateral stripes (arrows) which precisely co-localized with the PVD 3° branches labeled by mCherry. In addition to these lines, SAX-7 also showed strong enrichment at ring-shaped structures that likely represented the junctions between seam cells (labeled by CFP using a seam cell-specific promoter P<italic>nhr-81</italic>) and the major hypodermal syncytium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead). The seam cells are two rows of specialized hypodermal cells that line up along the lateral midlines of the worms and cover a region in which longitudinal PVD 1° dendrites extend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). The location of this SAX-7 zone dictated that PVD 2° branches would encounter an area with a high level of the adhesion molecule SAX-7 as they grow away from the 1° dendrite.</p><p>Since PVD 2° dendrites do not elaborate extensive branches in this SAX-7-rich 'trap zone', developing PVD dendrites appear to ignore SAX-7 here. We reasoned that disabling the normal escaping mechanism would lead to trapping of PVD dendrites within the zone. Indeed, in our forward genetic screen for mutants with defects in PVD morphology, we isolated three mutants, <italic>wy916, wy920</italic> and <italic>wy936</italic>, which showed a dramatic phenotype in which PVD dendrites were completely trapped near the 1° dendrites.

Co-labeling of the PVD neuron, hypodermal SAX-7-YFP and the seam cells revealed that the 2° dendrites in <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants were trapped inside the area with enriched SAX-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

These results agreed with a previous report using temporal RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salzberg et al., 2014</xref>) and demonstrated that KPC-1 was required during a stringent time window when the 2° branches synchronously bypassed the high level SAX-7 region to allow proper outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling complex mediated dendritic trapping in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants</title><p>If the 2° dendrites in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants were indeed 'trapped' in the region by the locally enriched SAX-7, we expected that removing the SAX-7 ligand, its cofactor MNR-1, or their cognate receptor DMA-1, would release the dendrites from the trap zone. Alternatively, if KPC-1 was required for dendritic outgrowth per se, double mutants between <italic>kpc-1</italic> and any member of the ligand-receptor complex would show a PVD dendritic phenotype that was similar to that of the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salzberg et al., 2014</xref>), we observed that the <italic>kpc-1; sax-7, kpc-1; mnr-1</italic> and <italic>kpc-1; dma-1</italic> double mutants showed PVD morphologies indistinguishable from those of the <italic>sax-7, mnr-1</italic> or <italic>dma-1</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We next directly tested this hypothesis by ectopically expressing SAX-7 in seam cells in <italic>kpc-1; sax-7</italic> double mutants. In striking contrast to the double mutants themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the PVD dendrites in the <italic>kpc-1; sax-7</italic> double mutants expressing SAX-7 in seam cells were trapped in the seam cell area, with very few 2° branches reaching far from the 1° dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,G</xref>). These results further supported the notion that the dendritic trapping phenotype in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants was due to the excessive activity of the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 complex near the seam cells. We also ectopically expressed SAX-7 and MNR-1 in the ALM and PLM neurons in the <italic>sax-7; kpc-1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). ALM and PLM neurons have long neurites that extend in the dorsal and ventral sublateral nerve cords and overlap with the locations where PVD 3° branches form and grow. This ectopic expression converted the <italic>sax-7</italic> mutant-like dendritic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to a striking new pattern: the entire PVD dendritic arbor followed the PLM and ALM neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Similar to <italic>sax-7; kpc-1</italic>, PVD morphologies of the double mutants between <italic>dma-1</italic> and <italic>kpc-1</italic> also clearly resembled the <italic>dma-1</italic> but not <italic>kpc-1</italic> single mutants, with disrupted organization and complete loss of menorahs but no trapping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C and H</xref>). The trapping model also predicted that resupplying DMA-1 to <italic>dma-1; kpc-1</italic> double mutants during the outgrowth of 2° branches within the trapping zone would restore the trapping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, middle panel) while expression after the 2° branches reached beyond the trapping zone would not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). To test this, we utilized the heat shock promoter to express DMA-1 at different time points in <italic>dma-1; kpc-1</italic> mutants. Consistent with our hypothesis, providing DMA-1 during early L3 when the 2° branches grew within the trap zone led to robust restoration of the trapping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>). On the contrary, expressing DMA-1 at later time points, when most of the branches in <italic>dma-1</italic> mutants had already extended beyond the trapping zone, led to a striking rescue of 3° and 4° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,H</xref>), again demonstrating strongly that dendrites in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants did not lack outgrowth capability and maintained intact SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling. Instead, the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutant PVD dendrites responded excessively to the guidance cues SAX-7 and MNR-1 near the seam cells, which limited their growth to the 'trap zone'.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Partial loss of KPC-1 caused defects in self-avoidance of 3° branches and outgrowth of 4° branches</title><p>In an independent genetic screen for mutants with PVD dendrite self-avoidance defects, we isolated another allele of <italic>kpc-1, xr58,</italic> which resulted in an amino acid substitution P440S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Injecting a mutated version of <italic>kpc-1</italic> cDNA containing the P440S mutation into the null <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> deletion mutants produced a dendritic phenotype that was milder than <italic>gk8</italic> but indistinguishable from that of <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic>, suggesting that the <italic>xr58</italic> allele was a hypomorphic allele (data not shown). Second, expressing the wild-type <italic>kpc-1</italic> cDNA at a very low concentration in the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> null allele resulted in a PVD morphology that was similar to that of the <italic>xr58</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Third, RNAi against <italic>kpc-1</italic> also gave rise to a similar PVD dendritic phenotype to that of <italic>xr58</italic> (data not shown). Since RNAi was often inefficient in worm neurons, this result further supported the notion that the <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> phenotype represented a partial loss of KPC-1 activity in the PVD neuron.</p><p>Despite the seemingly different phenotypes between the null allele and partial loss-of-function allele of <italic>kpc-1</italic>, both phenotypes could be regarded as trapping of the dendritic branches. High levels of SAX-7 were present both around the primary dendrite and along the 3° branch sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2015</xref>), where dendritic branches preferentially grew in <italic>kpc-1</italic> null and partial loss-of-function alleles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In other words, in wild-type animals, the growth of both the 2° and 4° dendrites required them to move away from the high SAX-7 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Insufficient KPC-1 function led to failures of dendrites to leave the high SAX-7 intermediate targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Full activation of KPC-1 required self-cleavage and removal of the Pro domain</title><p>The full activation of mammalian Furin requires proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal Pro domain by its own catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomas, 2002</xref>). Indeed, when the worm KPC-1 was expressed in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, we found two protein products that corresponded to full-length and Pro domain-cleaved KPC-1 based on size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). With sequence analysis, we identified two adjacent putative cleavage sites in the N-terminus of KPC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel). We mutated both sites with R to A mutations and found that the resulting mutant protein completely lacked the self-cleavage product when expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that these two sites were indeed responsible for the self-cleavage of KPC-1. To assess the physiological function of these cleavage sites, we introduced these two mutations into the endogenous <italic>kpc-1</italic> locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paix et al., 2014</xref>). The mutants exhibited a PVD dendritic phenotype indistinguishable from that of the <italic>gk8</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), demonstrating the necessity of Pro domain cleavage for the activation of KPC-1. Furthermore, we artificially deleted the Pro domain and expressed this mutant form in the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> null allele to test if this truncated version of KPC-1 still retained its activity. Consistent with our hypothesis, KPC-1 lacking the Pro domain could fully rescue the <italic>gk8</italic> mutants. Both secondary trapping and menorah outgrowth phenotypes were restored to wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,D and E</xref>). Since the <italic>xr58</italic> mutation was in the protease domain, we hypothesized that the partial loss of function might be due to inefficient self-cleavage. To test this, we engineered the same P440S mutation into the Pro domain deleted version of KPC-1 and expressed this construct in <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, right panel). Since it was no longer necessary to remove the Pro domain and self-activate, we expected this mutant form to bypass the catalytic defect of <italic>xr58</italic> and restore normal dendritic morphology. KPC-1ΔProP440S fully rescued the 2° branch trapping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and partially restored the number of 4° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>). This was consistent with our model that, similar to mammalian Furin, KPC-1 also needed to cleave its own Pro domain to be fully activated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DMA-1 receptor level was increased in <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants</title><p>The dendritic morphology of the <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> mutant was reminiscent of the phenotype caused by overexpression of DMA-1 in PVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Shen, 2012</xref>): First, neurons overexpressing DMA-1 had severe self-avoidance defects. Their 3° dendrites often failed to avoid each other and formed a continuous fascicle that covered the entire sublateral line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, many 2° dendrites were trapped around the 1° dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the total number of 4° branches was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, star, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). All three aspects of the DMA-1 overexpression phenotype were similar to those of the <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> mutants, suggesting that having too much DMA-1 led to similar consequences as insufficient KPC-1 activity. Since both KPC-1 and DMA-1 functioned autonomously in the PVD neuron, we hypothesized that KPC-1 might affect the PVD dendrites through regulating DMA-1.</p><p>We utilized several approaches to directly examine DMA-1 in <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants. First, we visualized the DMA-1 protein with an integrated reporter expressing <italic>gfp</italic>-tagged <italic>dma-1</italic> genomic DNA driven by the PVD-specific <italic>ser2prom3</italic> promoter. This transgenic reporter allowed us to monitor the amount of DMA-1 receptors at precise locations in the entire PVD dendritic arbor. In wild-type animals, diffuse DMA-1-GFP fluorescence was localized to all dendritic compartments including the higher order branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Discrete GFP puncta could also be found in the cell body and 1° dendrites, which were likely secretory or endocytic vesicles that carry DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). In wild-type neurons, DMA-1-GFP intensity in the discrete puncta was significantly higher than the diffuse staining in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutants, we observed a striking increase in the diffuse DMA-1-GFP intensity in the entire dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Quantification of the brightness of diffuse DMA-1-GFP on the dendrite, which was likely membrane-localized DMA-1-GFP, showed a dramatic increase in the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> allele compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A similar but less dramatic increase in DMA-1-GFP intensity was observed for the weak allele <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Such up-regulation could be completely rescued by PVD autonomous expression of KPC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To quantify the total DMA-1-GFP protein level, we performed Western blot analysis using an antibody against GFP and confirmed that there was indeed an overall increase in DMA-1 protein level in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we monitored endogenous DMA-1 by engineering a YFP into the <italic>dma-1</italic> genomic locus using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paix et al., 2014</xref>). Despite dim fluorescence intensity, we were able to visualize the endogenous expression and observed a DMA-1 localization pattern similar to what we saw using high copy transgenes, with both membrane and vesicular distribution of the protein (data not shown). When we crossed the <italic>dma-1::yfp</italic> knockin strain into <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic>, we again observed dramatic increase in DMA-1-YFP intensity in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, a 2xFLAG tag was inserted in frame into the endogenous locus of <italic>dma-1</italic> using CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paix et al., 2014</xref>), and we again measured significant up-regulation of DMA-1 protein level in <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). As a control, we examined the fluorescent intensity and localization of HPO-30, another transmembrane protein important for PVD development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), and observed no significant change in its dendritic levels in the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutants despite severe morphology defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We also performed qPCR and found that there was no difference in <italic>dma-1</italic> transcript level between wild-type and <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results further supported the notion that KPC-1 specifically down-regulated the DMA-1 protein level without affecting transcription.</p><p>We noticed an increase in branching in the proximal region when we overexpressed DMA-1 in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although most dendrites were still trapped around the 1° neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, right panel), some 2° dendrites close to the soma extended away to form 3° branches. We suspected that the very high level of DMA-1 on the dendritic membrane caused by both the lack of KPC-1 and the DMA-1 overexpression transgene might saturate the SAX-7/MNR-1 ligands in the region, allowing the dendrites to escape. To test this hypothesis, we further overexpressed SAX-7 and MNR-1 in the hypodermal cells in this genetic background, and indeed saw that the dendrites were trapped near the seam cells again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Genetic interactions between <italic>kpc-1</italic> and <italic>dma-1</italic> were also in support of this model. First, overexpressing DMA-1 in the <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> allele further enhanced the dendritic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The 3° branches in these animals showed an even more severe self-avoidance defect than the <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> worms, and the number of 4° branches was further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Second, we found that overexpression of a truncated version of DMA-1 lacking its entire cytosolic domain generated a dramatic trapping phenotype that mimicked that of the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In these animals, 2° dendrites were short and trapped around the 1° dendrite. We suspected that the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 may contain signaling motifs that were important for its endocytosis, so overexpressing a DMA-1 construct which lacked these motifs led to higher level of DMA-1 on the dendritic membrane than overexpression of the full length DMA-1 did, thereby produced a more severe trapping phenotype. The same construct, when expressed at a much lower level could partially rescue the <italic>dma-1</italic> mutant phenotype by allowing the formation of 3° and a small number of 4° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also generated a similar mutant allele of <italic>dma-1</italic> lacking its cytosolic domain using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedland et al., 2013</xref>) and observed a similar phenotype. 2° and 3° branches of these mutants developed normally, suggesting that this truncated protein was partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Interestingly, removing KPC-1 in this genetic background resulted in a severe trapping phenotype, indicating that KPC-1 did not regulate DMA-1 through its cytosolic domain and that the extracellular domain of DMA-1 was sufficient to respond to SAX-7/MNR-1 and to generate trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The striking similarity between the <italic>kpc-1</italic> null and the strain overexpressing the truncated DMA-1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, together with the observation that the loss of DMA-1 suppressed the trapping phenotype of the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutant allele, argued strongly that the overabundance of the DMA-1 receptor was responsible for the phenotypes in the loss-of-function alleles of <italic>kpc-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>KPC-1 reduced the binding between DMA-1 and SAX-7/MNR-1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To test whether KPC-1 directly affected the interaction between DMA-1 and its ligands SAX-7 and MNR-1, we co-expressed KPC-1 and DMA-1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and asked whether these cells could still form aggregates with cells expressing SAX-7/MNR-1. As we have reported previously, when DMA-1-RFP expressing cells were mixed with cells co-expressing SAX-7-GFP and MNR-1-GFP, the red and green cells formed clusters that indicated direct interaction between the DMA-1 receptor and the SAX-7/MNR-1 complex <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2013</xref>).

Another type I transmembrane protein mCD8 was co-transfected in the same cell cultures and was not affected, showing that the effect of KPC-1 on DMA-1 was specific.

We first asked whether DMA-1 was targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes in wild-type worms. An extrachromosomal array expressing mCherry-RAB-7 marker which labeled the late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>) was co-expressed with the integrated DMA-1-GFP line to visualize DMA-1 and the late endosomes simultaneously. Indeed, the intracellular DMA-1-GFP puncta showed a high degree of co-localization with mCherry-RAB-7 in wild-type PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Around 80% of RAB-7 vesicles co-localized with DMA-1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This result indicated that DMA-1 was indeed targeted to late endosomes in wild-type animals. In contrast, in <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutant animals, concomitant with the increased DMA-1-GFP level on the dendritic membrane, there was reduced co-localization between DMA-1-GFP and RAB-7 vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>). We hypothesized that surface DMA-1 could be down-regulated via two distinct mechanisms: One that required the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 but was independent of KPC-1, and the KPC-1 pathway. The fact that overexpression of cytosolic truncated DMA-1 produced a much stronger gain-of-function phenotype than full length DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) argued that cytosolic region-mediated endocytosis of DMA-1 might help to down-regulate its level on the plasma membrane. Indeed, DMA-1Δcyto-GFP exhibited much stronger membrane localization when expressed at comparable levels as the full length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We then quantified the co-localization between mCherry-RAB-7 and DMA-1Δcyto-GFP and observed a reduction in the percentage of RAB-7 vesicles containing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and E</xref>). Furthermore, when we crossed the integrated transgene expressing DMA-1Δcyto-GFP into <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutants, the GFP signal appeared almost exclusively on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Very few vesicles were seen throughout the dendritic arbor and only 10% of late endosomes labeled by mCherry-RAB-7 contained DMA-1Δcyto-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Since both DMA-1 and KPC-1 were predicted to be type I transmembrane proteins, and since the down-regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 did not require the cytosolic domain, we reasoned that KPC-1 might target DMA-1 for degradation through directly interacting with its extracellular domain. To test this hypothesis, DMA-1 and KPC-1 ectodomains were expressed using baculoviruses in High Five cells and purified.

In <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants, the level of DMA-1 was increased on the dendritic plasma membrane, leading to excessive responsiveness to the guidance signals SAX-7 and MNR-1.

It has been shown by the classic studies on axon guidance that the same ligand can trigger a variety of responses in different neuronal types depending on the membrane receptor contents of their growth cones. Netrin functions as a chemoattractant when binding to the UNC-40/DCC receptor but repels axons containing an UNC-5 and UNC-40/DCC receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Powell et al., 2008</xref>). In regions of the nervous system that are wired in a topographic fashion such as the superior colliculus in the visual system, the relative level of Eph receptors dictates where in the Ephrin gradient an axon stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mann et al., 2002</xref>). Even the same neuron can respond to a ligand differently at different decision points during development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Comm functions in pre-crossing commissural axons to keep the Robo receptor level low by sorting the receptors into endosomes, whereas Comm is turned off after the axon has crossed the midline and the Robo receptor is restored on the surface of growth cones to gain responsiveness to the midline repellent Slit and prevent axons from recrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</xref>). Similarly, commissural axons in the mammalian spinal cord change their responses to Slit by altering their expression of the Robo3 splicing isoforms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, the temporal and spatial regulation of receptors is critical to achieving precise neural development.</p><p>We present a new case in neurite morphogenesis in which dynamic regulation of the guidance receptor is required for proper development. Like axons, dendrites face the challenge of ignoring and escaping from intermediate targets with high affinity guidance cues after reaching them. We show that KPC-1/Furin is responsible for down-regulation of the DMA-1 receptor to allow dendrites to move away from an area with enriched SAX-7/MNR-1 ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KPC-1 functions in the PVD neuron to down-regulate the DMA-1 receptor</title><p>KPC-1 is a worm proprotein convertase known to process and activate proteins and peptides by proteolytic cleavage at a conserved consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomas, 2002</xref>). For example, KPC-1 was shown to be a major convertase to cleave and activate insulin peptides in neurons for the activation of the dauer formation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hung et al., 2014</xref>). Our results, like previous studies, indicate that KPC-1 functions in multi-dendritic neurons to assist dendritic morphogenesis and is in the same genetic pathway as the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salzberg et al., 2014</xref>). However, our results provide strong genetic and cell biological evidence that the morphological defects of the PVD dendrites in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants are due to enhanced, rather than decreased, response to the SAX-7/MNR-1 ligands.</p><p>First, we showed a causal relationship between the presence of the SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 tripartite complex and the dendritic trapping phenotype of the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants. Dendrites of the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants were trapped in regions with high levels of SAX-7. In the null allele of <italic>kpc-1</italic>, almost all 2° dendrites were unable to extend away from the hypodermal-seam cell junction region where SAX-7 was highly enriched. Removal of SAX-7 or other components of the tripartite complex completely suppressed the trapping phenotype in the <italic>kpc-1</italic> null mutants. Dendritic morphologies of the <italic>kpc-1; sax-7/mnr-1/dma-1</italic> double mutants were indistinguishable from the <italic>sax-7, mnr-1</italic> or <italic>dma-1</italic> single mutants but were drastically different from the <italic>kpc-1</italic> null mutants. Thus, the outgrowth defect of <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants was due to the trapping of dendrites caused by excessive response to SAX-7 and MNR-1. To further confirm this model, we used ectopic expression of SAX-7 to manipulate ligand distribution and tested if that was sufficient to cause a predictable trapping pattern. Indeed, we could trap the <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutant dendrites ectopically by expressing SAX-7 and MNR-1 in seam cells or PLM and ALM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, when we expressed the DMA-1 receptor at a late developmental stage in <italic>dma-1; kpc-1</italic> double mutants when dendrites had 'escaped' from the trap zone, menorah structures could be largely rescued, showing that PVD’s ability to extend dendrites and respond to the ligand complex was intact in <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Second, we showed that the DMA-1 receptor was down-regulated by KPC-1 both endogenously in PVD neurons and in heterologous cell systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Overexpression of a cytoplasmic domain deleted version of DMA-1 mimicked the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), showing that the dendritic defects of <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants could be attributed to excessive amounts of DMA-1 on the membrane. In the weak <italic>kpc-1(xr58)</italic> allele, overexpression of DMA-1 enhanced the 3° self-avoidance and the 4° outgrowth phenotypes, which further supported the notion that the phenotypes arose as a result of elevation in DMA-1 level.</p><p>How does KPC-1 down-regulate DMA-1? Both proteins are predicted to be type I transmembrane proteins, with KPC-1 having a C-terminal transmembrane domain but no cytosolic domain. The topology of these proteins suggested that KPC-1 could cleave DMA-1’s ectodomain at specific sites and inactivate DMA-1. We could not, however, identify any consensus Furin cleavage sites in the DMA-1 protein sequence. Likewise, we did not observe any truncated product of DMA-1 in the presence of KPC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Instead, we observed a reduction in the total amount of DMA-1 when KPC-1 was co-expressed in systems that we examined. These results suggested that KPC-1 did not cleave DMA-1 but rather down-regulated DMA-1 via a different mechanism. We also found that, consistent with the proteins’ topologies, the regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 did not require its cytosolic domain, since double mutants between a <italic>dma-1</italic> allele lacking its cytosolic domain <italic>dma-1(wy908)</italic> and <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> still showed strong trapping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that KPC-1 functioned similarly to another member of the mammalian convertase family, PCSK9, which down-regulated the LDL receptor through directly binding to its extracellular EGF domain and targeting the receptor to the endocytic pathway for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagace et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poirier and Mayer, 2013</xref>). Consistent with this model, we detected direct interaction between the ectodomains of DMA-1 and KPC-1 and observed that KPC-1 localized to the late endosomes and lysosomes when expressed in S2R+ cells.</p><p>In summary, we show that KPC-1 down-regulates the DMA-1 receptor through direct interaction with its extracellular domain in PVD neurons. This function is necessary to allow developing dendrites to move away from the intermediate targets where the guidance cues SAX-7 and MNR-1 are highly enriched before reaching their final destinations. These results demonstrate that precise regulation of receptor levels is critical for dendrite branching and patterning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>N2 Bristol was used as the wild-type strain.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Hugo Bellen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> furin protein KPC-1 has recently been shown to regulate dendrite morphogenesis in multiple sensory neurons, including PVD, as well as processing insulins. Dong et al. now show that KPC-1 regulates the levels of the LRR receptor DMA-1 via late endosomal pathway to guide PVD dendrites. Although their findings that <italic>kpc-1</italic> acts cell autonomously at L3 stage for PVD dendrite morphogenesis are consistent with the published work by Salzberg et al., they present a different interpretation for the mutant phenotype, described as dendrite trapping, due to high signaling of the DMA-1 receptor in <italic><underline>kpc-1</underline></italic> mutants. Supporting their conclusion, they show that <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants increase expression levels of DMA-1 and overexpression of <italic>kpc-1</italic> can prevent DMA-1 from interacting with its ligands SAX-7 and MNR-1. DMA-1 can be found in RAB-7 containing endosomes in PVD neurons. <italic>kpc-1</italic> appears to colocalize with RAB-7 in S2 cells, and promotes DMA-1 localization to late endosomes in PVD. Yet, the regulation of DMA-1 by KPC-1 does not require the intracellular domain of DMA-1. Overall, the data linking <italic>kpc-1</italic> to <italic>dma-1</italic> are strong, and offer new insights to dendrite morphogenesis and regulation of DMA-1. An issue is that the temporal regulation of DMA-1 by <italic>kpc-1</italic> during PVD dendrite outgrowth is mainly inferred through transgenic overexpression studies. The presentation of some data needs further clarification. Several figures lack quantification or controls.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>An issue that was raised by two reviewers relates to the model that you propose. The work lacks any mechanistic insights into how KPC-1 targets DMA-1 to endosomes/lysosomes; and it does not convincingly show that this is the correct model. We find out that this targeting cannot be demonstrated to occur through cleavage of DMA-1 by KPC-1, which would be the obvious model. But this is negative evidence based on the lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product. But, no experiments are done to prove that KPC-1 does not cleave DMA-1, or to validate the idea that KPC-1 might bind directly to DMA-1 without cleaving it. The lack of a detectable DMA-1 cleavage product might occur because the product is highly unstable.</p><p>Furthermore, the idea that the regulation of DMA-1 does not involve cleavage seems inconsistent with the finding that mutating the self-cleavage sequence in KPC-1 in a rescue construct (which we would assume is necessary to activate a preprotein to make an active protease?) rescues the null phenotype to a partial loss-of-function phenotype.</p><p>In addition, it should be relatively simple to use the tagged proteins that have been made, express them in S2 cells and show that they physically interact. Obviously, if the proteins are internalized and degraded too quickly, this may not be feasible. A time course experiment may then be needed. Alternatively, If the interaction is too weak, the method developed by Chris Garcia and colleagues on their campus could be used.</p><p>In the subsection “Partial loss of KPC-1 causes defects in self-avoidance of 3° branches and outgrowth of 4° branches” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the <italic>kpc-1(xr58</italic>) partial loss of function mutation led them to test the idea of incomplete cleavage of <italic>kpc-1</italic>.

Alternatively, If the interaction is too weak, the method developed by Chris Garcia and colleagues on their campus could be used.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for these critical suggestions. We have collaborated with Dr Engin Özkan, former postdoc in the Garcia lab and now assistant professor at the University of Chicago, to specifically test the hypothesis that KPC-1 may target DMA-1 for degradation through directly binding to its ectodomain, a mechanism similar to how PCSK9 down-regulates LDLR. We have successfully expressed and purified predicted extracellular domains of DMA-1 and KPC-1. We have detected direct interaction between these ectodomains using biolayer interferometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The dissociation constant (KD) measured is 33μM, which explains why it has been difficult for us to detect this weak interaction using low amounts of non-purified proteins on Western blots.</p><p>We are also developing a new assay to study in detail the cell biological aspects of DMA-1 trafficking. In these experiments, we try to label the plasma membrane fraction of DMA-1 with Fluorogen activating protein (FAP) and follow its endocytosis with live cell imaging. Due to technical difficulties, we are still troubleshooting these experiments. Meanwhile, we show unambiguously <italic>in vivo</italic> that KPC-1, which interacts with the ectodomain of DMA-1, functions synergistically with other endocytic mechanisms that utilize the cytosolic domain of DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-E</xref>). We thus hope that we have provided sufficient evidence that KPC-1 down-regulates DMA-1 by targeting it to endocytic compartments.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the idea that the regulation of DMA-1 does not involve cleavage seems inconsistent with the finding that mutating the self-cleavage sequence in KPC-1 in a rescue construct (which we would assume is necessary to activate a preprotein to make an active protease?) rescues the null phenotype to a partial loss-of-function phenotype.</italic></p><p><italic>In the subsection “Partial loss of KPC-1 causes defects in self-avoidance of 3° branches and outgrowth of 4° branches” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the kpc-1(xr58) partial loss of function mutation led them to test the idea of incomplete cleavage of kpc-1. They show that KPC-1 expressed in S2 cells can be cleaved. They should test if KPC-1(R136A) blocks this cleavage.</italic> </p><p>We want to thank the reviewers for this insightful suggestion. We identified two self-cleavage sites very close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mutating both sites completely eliminates the self-cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We have introduced these two mutations in the endogenous <italic>kpc-1</italic> locus using CRISPR. This mutant shows a full loss-of-function <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutant phenotype in the PVD neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results show that removal of the N-terminal Pro domain is required for the activation of KPC-1.</p><p>Furthermore, we made a Pro domain deleted KPC-1 construct and expressed it in the <italic>kpc-1(gk8)</italic> mutant. This truncated protein fully rescues the PVD morphology phenotype of <italic>gk8</italic> mutants. Together, these data strongly suggest that KPC-1 activates itself through autocleavage.</p><p> <italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection “DMA-1 receptor level is increased in kpc-1 mutants” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>: the genetic analysis on wy908 allele is a nice addition. It would be good to see if cytoplasmic deleted dma-1 is still targeted to late endosomes.</italic></p><p>We again followed this constructive suggestion. We expressed DMA-1△cyto-GFP in PVD. Compared to full length DMA-1-GFP, DMA-1△cyto-GFP shows reduced localization to the endosomes and increased localization to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, when we crossed this marker into <italic>kpc-1</italic> mutants, we observed that GFP signal is almost exclusively on the plasma membrane and very little in endocytic vesicles. Together, these results seem to be consistent with a model that KPC-1 and other endocytic mechanisms function synergistically to down-regulate plasma membrane DMA-1. KPC-1 interacts with the extracellular domain of DMA-1, while other endocytic machineries function through the cytosolic domain of DMA-1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
