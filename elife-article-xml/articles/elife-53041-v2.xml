New approaches are thus necessary. Here, we introduce a method for refined neuronal targeting that can be applied iteratively. Restriction achieved at the first step can be further refined in a second step, if necessary. The method relies on first isolating neurons within a targeted group (i.e. Gal4 pattern) according to their developmental lineages, and then intersectionally limiting the number of lineages by selecting only those in which two distinct neuroblast enhancers are active. The neuroblast enhancers drive expression of split Cre recombinase fragments. These are fused to non-interacting pairs of split inteins, which ensure reconstitution of active Cre when all fragments are expressed in the same neuroblast. Active Cre renders all neuroblast-derived cells in a lineage permissive for Gal4 activity. We demonstrate how this system can facilitate neural circuit-mapping in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans – as well as flies and most other animals – the brain controls how we move and behave, and regulates heartbeat, breathing and other core processes. To perform these different roles, cells known as neurons form large networks that quickly carry messages around the brain and to other parts of the body. In order to fully understand how the brain works, it is important to first understand how individual neurons connect to each other and operate within these networks.</p><p>Fruit flies and other animals with small brains are often used as models to study how the brain works. There are several methods currently available that allow researchers to manipulate small groups of fruit fly neurons for study, and in some cases it is even possible to target individual neurons. However, it remains an aspirational goal to be able to target every neuron in the fly brain individually.</p><p>The Gal4-UAS system is a way of manipulating gene activity widely used to study neurons in fruit flies. The system consists of two parts: a protein that can bind DNA and control the activity of genes (Gal4); and a genetic sequence (the UAS) that tells Gal4 where to bind and therefore which genes to activate. Fruit flies can be genetically engineered so that only specific cells make Gal4. This makes it possible, for example, to limit the activity of a gene under the control of the UAS to a specific set of neurons and therefore to identify or target these neurons. Luan et al. developed a new technique named SpaRCLIn that allows the targeting of a subset of neurons within a group already identified with the Gal4-UAS system.</p><p>During embryonic development, all neurons originate from a small pool of cells called neuroblasts, and it is possible to target the descendants of particular neuroblasts. SpaRCLIn exploits this strategy to limit the activity of Gal4 to smaller and smaller numbers of neuroblast descendants. In this way, Luan et al. found that SpaRCLIn was routinely capable of limiting patterns of Gal4 activity to one, or a few, neurons at a time. Further experiments used SpaRCLIn to identify two pairs of neurons that trigger a well-known feeding behavior in fruit flies. Luan et al. also developed a SpaRCLIn toolkit that will form the basis of a community resource other researchers can use to study neurons in fruit flies. These findings could also benefit researchers developing similar tools in mice and other animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circuit mapping</kwd><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>Gal4-UAS</kwd><kwd>proboscis extension</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>expression system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-MH002800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-NS002820-26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odenwald</surname><given-names>Ward F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic method allows neurons to be individually identified and characterized by combining information about both their developmental origins and their mature patterns of gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An essential step in mapping brain circuits is identifying the function of the individual neurons that comprise them. This is commonly achieved by manipulating neuronal function using effectors encoded by transgenes whose expression is targeted to small subsets of cells using the regulatory elements of neurally-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gohl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). While it has proved relatively easy to target large groups of neurons for cellular manipulation by this means in genetic model organisms using binary expression systems, such as the Cre-lox system of mice or the Gal4-UAS system of fruit flies, highly-specific targeting of neurons requires combinatorial methods. Genetic combinatorial methods typically use either the regulatory elements of two neurally-expressed genes or exploit stochastic events to limit transgene targeting to a subpopulation of a larger group of neurons. In fruit flies, both types of method have been used to target single cells under optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pool et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), and combinatorial approaches using three regulatory elements have achieved some success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pankova and Borst, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shirangi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). However, general limitations apply to all such approaches: stochastic methods are, by nature, poorly reproducible, while combinatorial methods are labor-intensive, often requiring the characterization of many neurally active enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tirian et al., 2017</xref>). Simpler methods of targeting small populations of brain cells are therefore desirable in the effort to comprehensively map neural function.</p><p>An attractive approach to increase the specificity of neuronal targeting is to identify neurons based not only on the genes they express in the terminally differentiated state (i.e. terminal effector genes, TEG), but also on their developmental history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dymecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang, 2014</xref>). Most neuronal lineages produce diverse neuron types, and while some striking correspondences have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacin et al., 2019</xref>), lineage identity, in general, correlates poorly with neuronal identity as defined by gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hobert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). Conversely, gene expression is often correlated across neurons that differ in identity as defined by their function, morphology, and neuroanatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>). This is because neuronal identities are defined not by single genes, but by the expression of often overlapping batteries of TEGs. An intersection of lineage with the expression of a specific TEG may thus, in general, include fewer neurons than an intersection of the expression patterns of two TEGs. In addition, because neurons from a given lineage typically remain regionally localized, intersections made using lineage information will tend to restrict neuronal targeting anatomically.</p><p>Recombinase-based intersectional methods that combine information about lineage and cell type have been developed in both mice and fruit flies and have been shown to substantially restrict targeting to cell groups of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brust et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). However, the use of such methods has remained largely limited to specific cases—in mice, sublineages of brainstem serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okaty et al., 2015</xref>), and in flies, subtypes of Type II transit-amplifying neural stem cells (i.e. neuroblasts, NBs) of the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). This is because of the paucity of lineage-restricted enhancers. Just as there are few TEG enhancers that are active in small numbers of mature neurons, there are also few identified enhancers that exhibit lineage-specific activity. In the fly, a systematic analysis of some 5000 neural enhancer domains identified 761 with activity in embryonic NBs, but 99 of these expressed in most or all lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manning et al., 2012</xref>). A separate analysis indicates that the remainder are at best active in 5–20 lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>). The routine use of lineage-cell type intersections for neural circuit mapping will thus require more refined methods of isolating neuronal lineages or sub-lineages.</p><p>To achieve such lineage refinement, we introduce here a combinatorial method analogous to the Split Gal4 technique used to restrict neuronal targeting to the intersection of two TEG expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luan et al., 2006</xref>). We restrict reconstitution of a Split Cre recombinase to the expression patterns of two independent NB-active enhancers (i.e. NBEs). Only NBs in which both enhancers are active thus make full-length Cre. Cre is then used to selectively promote activity of the Gal4 transcription factor—expressed under the control of a TEG enhancer—in the mature progeny of these NBs, thus implementing a second intersection. Our method (i.e. ‘<underline>Sp</underline>lit Cre-<underline>a</underline>ssisted <underline>R</underline>estriction of <underline>C</underline>ell Class-<underline>Li</underline>neage <underline>In</underline>tersections,’ or SpaRCLIn) generalizes the capabilities of the CLIn technique introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al. (2016)</xref> by expanding the range of possible intersections to most <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages while maintaining compatibility with all existing <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gal4 driver lines. To facilitate SpaRCLIn’s use, we have generated a variety of tools, including two libraries of transgenic fly lines, each of which expresses distinct Split Cre components under the control of 134 different NBEs. We characterize the efficacy of these SpaRCLIn reagents and provide examples of their use in restricted neuronal targeting and circuit-mapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of bipartite and tripartite split cre recombinases</title><p>SpaRCLIn was developed to refine the expression pattern of a Gal4 driver using the basic strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In common with other existing methodologies, SpaRCLIn uses a recombinase (i.e. Cre) to excise an otherwise ubiquitously expressed construct encoding Gal80, a suppressor of the Gal4 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). As in the CLIn technique, recombinase expression—and thus the excision of Gal80—occurs only in targeted NBs, rendering the progeny of these NBs permissive to Gal4 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Those progeny that lie within the expression pattern of the Gal4 driver will be competent to drive UAS-reporters and effectors, such as UAS-GFP. In the SpaRCLIn technique, distinct NBEs are used to express components of a bipartite Split Cre molecule in restricted subsets of NBs. In lineages of these NBs that contain mature neurons within the Gal4 expression pattern, Gal4 will be active. This population of neurons can be additionally parsed using a tripartite Split Cre to further restrict the subset of NBs that make active Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Restriction of NB targeting using split Cre components fused to split inteins.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Components and genetic logic of the SpaRCLIn system.

Because our system requires use of a tripartite Cre to achieve the most refined targeting it was also desirable to use a method of splitting Cre that would permit reconstitution of the intact molecule to obtain the highest activity levels. Split inteins, which are capable of autocatalytically joining two proteins to which they are fused, are well-suited to this purpose and distinct split inteins have been previously shown to support reconstitution of recombinase activity from complementary Cre fragments fused to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows the primary structure of Cre, indicating the location of the breakpoints (green highlight) at which we introduced split intein moieties into the molecule. These breakpoints separate the amino acid residues in the primary structure that form the DNA-binding sites (blue) and the active site (yellow highlight), thus insuring that none of the fragments retains catalytic activity. Two Split Cre fragments, Cre<sub>AB</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub>, were generated by the breakpoint between amino acids P250 and S251 to implement the bipartite Split Cre system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), while dividing the Cre<sub>AB</sub> fragment at the breakpoint between amino acids D109 and S110 was used to create two further fragments (i.e. Cre<sub>A</sub> and Cre<sub>B</sub>) which together with Cre<sub>C</sub> form the basis of the tripartite Split Cre system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). The split intein pairs used to generate these fragments, gp41-1 and NrdJ-1, were chosen based on their trans-splicing efficiency and their lack of cross-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvajal-Vallejos et al., 2012</xref>). The latter criterion was critical for avoiding the generation of unproductive fusion products of the Cre fragments.</p><p>After confirming the ability of the bi- and tripartite constructs to reconstitute Cre activity when co-expressed in transfected S2 cells (data not shown), we used them to generate transgenic fly lines in which they were expressed in patterns dictated by individual enhancers that exhibited activity in neuroblasts. Most of the NBEs selected for this purpose were taken from the large collection of enhancer fragments with fully defined sequences created by the Rubin lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref> #43). Most of the NBEs selected were from a previously characterized collection of embryonically active NB enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manning et al., 2012</xref>), with the remainder characterized as indicated in the Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. A total of 134 NBEs were used to make two libraries of transgenic fly lines, one expressing the Cre<sub>B</sub> fragment under the control of each of the 134 NBEs and the other similarly expressing the Cre<sub>C</sub> fragment. These lines thus collectively express Cre<sub>B</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> in a large number of distinct and often overlapping subsets of NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, because the 134 enhancers are also typically active in mature neurons, the production of full-length Cre is not necessarily restricted to NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To ensure NB-specific reconstitution of Cre activity, we placed the Cre<sub>A</sub> and Cre<sub>AB</sub> fragments under the control of a compound enhancer formed by fusing individual enhancer elements of the NB-specific genes, <italic>deadpan (dpn)</italic> and <italic>nervous fingers-1 (nerfin-1</italic>; see Materials and methods). This synthetic <italic>dpn-nerfin-1</italic> enhancer (i.e. DNE) combines the complementary temporal characteristics of both component enhancers, maintaining strong, broad, and specific activity throughout embryonic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Use of the DNE thus ensured that full-length, active Cre would be generated only in NBs where expression of the Cre fragments overlapped, and not in fully-differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,I</xref>). This enhancer also expresses in most of the NBs that give rise to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS with the exception of those found in the late-developing optic lobes, and thus guarantees substantial coverage of the mature neurons found within the expression patterns of Gal4 lines.</p><p>To detect activity of the Split Cre constructs in vivo, we created transgenic flies carrying a reporter construct in which the floxed Gal80 gene, the expression of which is driven by a ubiquitously active Actin 5C promoter, is followed by the gene encoding the red fluorescent protein, tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Expression of tdTomato from this construct, which we call Cre80Tom, thus identifies neurons in which Gal80 has been excised. Gal80 excision, identified by the appearance of tdTomato expression, is identifiable as early as embryonic stage eight when the Cre<sub>AB</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> fragments are driven by the DNE and it is widespread in the developing CNS by stage 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The onset of Cre activity is sufficiently early to label many of the progeny of a defined NB lineage targetable by the R59E09-Gal4 line, previously identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacin and Truman (2016)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data suggest that Gal80 excision occurs relatively early.</p><p>The bipartite system, using the DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> fragments expressed under the control of two different neuroblast enhancers (NBE<sub>43H02</sub> and NBE<sub>44F03</sub>), also generated expression patterns in neuronal lineages of third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). The expression patterns include not only the NBs in which Cre activity is reconstituted, but also the progeny of these NBs, since tdTomato expression is activated in all cells born within these lineages after Gal80 is excised. Although the expression patterns differ in the two cases, they share a small number of common NB lineages as is revealed by application of the tripartite Cre system using the NBE<sub>44F03</sub> and NBE<sub>43H02</sub> enhancers to drive Cre<sub>B</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub>, respectively, together with DNE-Cre<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Expression in this case is limited to approximately three bilateral lineages in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and two in the brain. These examples illustrate how the bi- and tripartite Split Cre constructs selectively reconstitute Cre activity in NBs targeted by individual NBEs, and demonstrate that the tripartite Split Cre system can be used to restrict Cre activity to only those NBs in which two distinct NBEs are active.</p><p>As this example illustrates, the tripartite system generates intersections of two NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> expression patterns by substituting one Cre<sub>C</sub> fragment with a Cre<sub>B</sub> fragment driven by the identical NBE. To facilitate such substitutions, all NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> insertions were made on Chromosome III and all NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> insertions were made on Chromosome II. To evaluate the reproducibility of expression driven by individual NBEs, we examined NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub>∩DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> &gt;CreTom crosses for all 134 NBEs in multiple preparations (on average four per NBE) and compared these patterns with expression observed in all NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub>∩DNE-Cre<sub>A</sub>∩ DNE-Cre<sub>C</sub> &gt;CreTom crosses. The large size of the patterns and the inability to reliably identify identical neurons and lineages across preparations prevented a systematic analysis, but in general the patterns were similar across preparations for any given cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) In most cases, patterns obtained with a given NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> line also resembled the pattern obtained with the NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> line made with the same enhancer (compare panels A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, for 24 NBEs overt differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> vs 3D). Apart from these NBEs, which have been marked with an asterisk in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> along with guidance as to their use, the tripartite system represents a reliable intersectional method for restricting Cre activity to subsets of NBs. The progeny of these NBs that are generated after Cre activation will not only express the reporter tdTomato, but will also fail to express the Gal80 transgene, thus permitting Gal4 to function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Using the bipartite and tripartite cre systems to restrict expression of TH-Gal4</title><p>The selective disinhibition of Gal4 activity in targeted lineages permits UAS-transgenes to be expressed in cells of those lineages whenever they lie within the expression pattern of a Gal4 driver. This allows targeted lineages to be parsed according to the properties of the mature neurons to which they give rise using cell-type specific Gal4 drivers. Such so-called ‘cell class-lineage intersections’ have been previously performed to identify subsets of neurons generated by Type II NBs of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, which can be selectively targeted using a Type II-specific enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). Among the neurons generated by Type II NBs are several populations of dopaminergic neurons, identified by a Tyrosine Hydroxylase-specific Gal4 driver (TH-Gal4). Dopaminergic neurons are of considerable interest because of their roles in a variety of important neurobiological processes, including learning, sleep, and locomotion (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kasture et al., 2018</xref>). The approximately 120–130 dopaminergic neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS are produced by diverse NBs and numerous reagents have been generated to selectively target them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As a first test of the SpaRCLIn system, we therefore asked whether it could restrict expression of the TH-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to small numbers of distinct dopaminergic neurons based on their different lineages of origin. Using a small subset of the NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines in combination with DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub>, we examined the expression patterns produced by intersection with TH-Gal4. The expression patterns produced by these intersections were noticeably reduced compared with the full pattern of the TH-Gal4 driver, but they typically still contained 10’s of dopaminergic neurons distributed broadly across the neuraxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). In cases where the expression patterns produced by the bipartite crosses shared a neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, arrows), combining the relevant NBEs using the tripartite system succeeded in isolating these neurons from most others in the two original crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In general, restricting NB expression using the tripartite system—by pairing the NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> constructs with NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> constructs made with different enhancers—produced significantly reduced expression patterns, sometimes consisting of one to two cells or bilateral cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Parsing the TH-Gal4 expression pattern using SpaRCLIn.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression pattern of the TH-Gal4 driver revealed by UAS-mCD8GFP (green).

We found that the average number of labeled neurons per preparation did not exceed 8.5 (±3.8, n = 16) for any intersection and was less than 4.3 (±2.3, n = 17) for two-thirds of them. This sparseness of expression suggests that the NBEs tested do not overlap extensively in their NB expression patterns. Stereotypy of expression was also generally present despite considerable variability. Only in one extreme case, did there appear to be a complete absence of stereotypy, with all CNS preparations that had expression displaying a distinct pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For all other intersections, at least one principal neuron was found that was shared by multiple preparations, based on cell position and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, black bars). For over half of the intersections, this principal common neuron was shared by 50% or more of preparations. In most cases, other neurons were also found, though preparations containing only such neurons typically occurred at lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, gray bars). Consistent with this variability of expression, neurons that recurred across preparations were not necessarily found in the same combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The sparseness of labeling combined with the variability of expression likely accounts for why half of the intersections yielded at least one preparation without any expression. Interestingly, four of the seven intersections that yielded preparations devoid of expression shared an enhancer (R14E10), suggesting that particular enhancers may strongly influence the extent of labeling. Variability of labeling also appeared to be enhancer-dependent in that use of the same enhancer (i.e. R17A10) to drive both Cre<sub>B</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> components did not necessarily reduce stochasticity. Indeed, although all preparations that had expression shared a common identifiable neuron in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), their expression in other neurons varied considerably. A possible source of this variability of expression is weak NBE activity that results in lowered expression of Cre components and consequently more sporadic reconstitution of Cre activity. More work will be required to examine this hypothesis. Regardless, our results demonstrate SpaRCLIn’s ability to substantially restrict expression of a Gal4 driver with sufficient stereotypy in single neurons to be useful for the neuronal manipulations employed in neural circuit mapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional circuit-mapping using SpaRCLIn</title><p>To examine SpaRCLIn’s efficacy for circuit mapping, we used it to identify neural substrates of proboscis extension (PE), a motor pattern normally elicited by gustatory stimuli, but also by the hormone Bursicon in newly eclosed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peabody et al., 2009</xref>).

The example given illustrates the strategy to be used when the Gal4 driver is on chromosome III, but reagents for use when the driver is on chromosome II are also provided (see Key Resources Table). An initial set of crosses brings the Gal4 driver together with two essential components of SpaRCLIn: an X chromosome containing the combined Actin 5C-loxP-Gal80-loxP-tdTomato and UAS-mCD8GFP constructs (abbreviated here as Cre80Tom-GFP) and a 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome containing the DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub>. If a functional screen is being performed, an effector—such as UAS-dTrpA1—can also be recombined with the DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> or Gal4 driver on an autosome, as illustrated here. Alternatively, we have made variants of the Cre80Tom-GFP (on X) that contain UAS-dTrpA1 (Cre80-dTrpA1) or Kir2.1 (Cre80-Kir2.1) that can be used instead of Cre80Tom-GFP. Flies bearing the Gal4 driver and essential SpaRCLIn components, are then crossed in a final step to flies of the Cre<sub>C</sub> library to generate the desired progeny for testing.

Two closely apposed neurons of this type were observed, sometimes as bilateral pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and sometimes on only one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These neurons, which we call the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons, were notably prominent in the 16H11-Cre<sub>B</sub>∩44F09-Cre<sub>C</sub> intersection, where they constituted the entire expression pattern of 16 animals (n = 78 total), all of which exhibited PE induction upon heating. Indeed, all 36 animals from this intersection that tested positive for the PE phenotype and were successfully dissected showed expression in the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons, while none of the animals (n = 38) that tested negative had such expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Most of the latter, in fact, had little to no expression. Similar results were obtained with a second intersection (44F09-Cre<sub>B</sub>∩10G07-Cre<sub>C</sub>). All 19 animals that exhibited induced PE in this intersection had expression in the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons, and in three animals these were the only neurons present. A third intersection that yielded the PE phenotype in all animals likewise showed consistent expression in the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons, but the correlation between the PE phenotype and expression in these neurons was somewhat less readily established because of expression in other neurons (5.6 ± 1.8; n = 14 preparations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-53041-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Neuroanatomical location and projection pattern of the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons.</title><p>GFP-labeled PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons (green) were imaged by confocal microscopy to show the location of their somata and their arborization.

One challenge to using this system, however, is the large number of transgenes required to implement it. This is especially true for Step two screening with the tripartite system. To mitigate this burden, we have created several reagents that will facilitate use of the system. In addition to the Cre80Tom-GFP construct described above, we have developed other dicistronic constructs to facilitate manipulating neuronal activity in SpaRCLIn screens (see Key Resources Table). These include constructs and fly lines for Cre80-Kir2.1 and Cre80-dTrpA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we have developed an alternate Step one strategy that may avert the need for Step two screening in favorable cases.</p><p>The alternate strategy uses a transiently expressed DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> designed to be active only during early stages of neurogenesis. This construct, which we call ‘FRTerminator,’ is self-excising in that it is flanked by Flp Recombination Target (FRT) sites and encodes a Flp recombinase gene that is co-expressed with Cre<sub>AB</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Upon expression under control of the DNE enhancer, this construct will remove the Cre<sub>AB</sub> gene and thus limit its expression to early (embryonic) neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cre<sub>AB</sub> will thus be available to reconstitute Cre activity only with complimentary Cre<sub>C</sub> fragments that are also expressed at this time. Cre<sub>C</sub>s whose expression is driven by NBEs that become active only after the elimination of Cre<sub>AB</sub> from neuroblasts, will not lead to the generation of Gal4-competent neurons. Expression patterns resulting from the combination of FRTerminator with NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub>s will thus, in general, be reduced relative to those produced by DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Limiting Cre activity to early NBs using FRTerminator.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The FRTerminator construct: a DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> that terminates its own expression.

The entire cassette is flanked by FRT sites. Upon expression of the cassette—which will occur in NBs at the onset of neurogenesis—Flp will excise the cassette, thus terminating any further expression of both Flp and Cre<sub>AB</sub>-NrdJ-1<sup>N</sup>.

In NB<sub>1</sub> the NBE is active early in neurogenesis and Cre<sub>C</sub> will therefore be expressed in the young neuroblast. In contrast, the NBE becomes active only late in neurogenesis in NB<sub>2</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> is therefore only present in the older NB. Because DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> is expressed throughout neurogenesis, it will be available to reconstitute full-length Cre whenever Cre<sub>C</sub> is expressed. This means that Gal80 will be excised and tdTomato expression turned on (red) early in NB<sub>1</sub>—leading to the labeling of all progeny—and late in NB<sub>2</sub>—leading to labeling of only late-generated progeny. In contrast, FRTerminator is present only early in neurogenesis and Cre reconstitution (and tdTomato expression) will therefore occur only in NB<sub>1</sub>. No progeny of the NB<sub>2</sub> clone will be labeled and the overall pattern of labeling will thus be diminished.

We focused on the 23 NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines that yielded flies with PE phenotypes, combining each with the FRTerminator, rk<sup>pan</sup>-Gal4 and Cre80-GFP. Progeny were tested for PE upon dTrpA1 activation. We found that three NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines (44F09, 57B09, and 14E10) produced progeny with PE phenotypes at frequencies ranging from 9–17%. Although these frequencies were considerably lower than those obtained using DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub>, the resulting expression patterns were substantially sparser compared with those of progeny from DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). All animals examined that had PE phenotypes also included in their expression patterns the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons (n = 40). In contrast, only one of the animals examined that lacked the phenotype had these neurons (n = 39). A strong correlation between PE and the presence of the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons was thus observed, again permitting the conclusion that these neurons are substrates for the behavioral phenotype. We conclude that FRTerminator-based Step one screens may serve as a useful shortcut to serial Step one and Step two screens for restricting Gal4 expression and identifying functionally important neuronal subsets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SpaRCLIn system introduced here permits the refined targeting of neurons within a group of interest based on both their developmental origins and their patterns of gene expression in the terminally differentiated state. By permitting the combinatorial targeting of many, if not most, of the neuroblasts that generate the mature CNS, the SpaRCLIn system provides end-users with a comprehensive, ‘off-the-shelf’ set of reagents for systematically isolating and characterizing the anatomy and function of specific neurons. The reagents that we have created include extensive lineage-selective Split Cre lines for bipartite (Step 1) and tripartite (Step 2) neuronal screens, in addition to a range of tools that facilitate application of the system. Dual effector and reporter constructs reduce the number of transgenes required to implement the system, and a self-terminating Split Cre component (i.e. FRTerminator) can be used to expedite screening in favorable circumstances. The system is compatible with existing Gal4 driver lines and the examples provided here indicate that it is capable of routinely parsing Gal4 expression patterns into subsets of neurons numbering in the single digits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Utility of SpaRCLIn to circuit mapping</title><p>Our use of SpaRCLIn to identify the RK-expressing neurons that trigger robust proboscis extension demonstrates SpaRCLIn’s ability to systematically parse a neuronal group and identify the functionally relevant subset. Just over 200 crosses—134 crosses for the Step 1 screen of NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines and 70 NBE-Cre<sub>B∩C</sub> Step two crosses—were required to identify two pairs of command-like neurons capable of inducing PE upon activation (i.e. the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons). Importantly, we discontinued the Step two screen after testing 70 of the 253 possible intersections because of evident redundancy of the command-like neurons. The latter were prominent in the expression patterns of numerous independent Step two intersections and were readily correlated with PE induction in three that produced particularly reduced expression patterns. In the intersection with the sparsest expression, the two pairs of PE-inducing neurons often comprised the entire observable pattern in flies that had the PE phenotype, illustrating the extreme reduction in expression achievable with SpaRCLIn. The demonstration that the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons can be isolated in single crosses using the FRTerminator indicates that this reduction in expression can be attained without the labor of Step two screening. However, the lower frequency of the PE phenotype in FRTerminator crosses in our example also suggests that FRTerminator-based screens may require testing more animals for each intersection than a standard Step one screen in order to reliably identify positives.</p><p>Activation of the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons elicits rhythmic proboscis extension, rather than the tonic PE elicited by activation of all rk<sup>pan</sup>-Gal4 neurons. This suggests that additional RK-expressing neurons—perhaps lacking command capability—modulate the effects of activating the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons. Based on their induction of rhythmic extension and their apparent lack of a projection to the proboscis muscles, we conjecture that the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons identified here are not motor neurons, the activation of which results in tonic and often partial PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the anatomy of the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons differs from that of other identified neurons that can drive PE when activated, including second-order projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>), modulatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marella et al., 2012</xref>), and a local SEZ interneuron called the Fdg-neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flood et al., 2013</xref>). Like the Fdg-neuron, however, the neurons identified here seem to function in a premotor capacity, perhaps as part of the central pattern generator for PE that regulates fly feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). Further work will be required to determine the precise role of the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons in the feeding circuitry and their relationship to other identified neurons involved in PE.</p><p>It also remains to be determined whether activation of both PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons is required to induce the PE phenotype. Indeed, from the standpoint of the efficacy of the SpaRCLIn system it is important to ask why SpaRCLIn failed to separate these two pairs of neurons. The similarity of the two PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons in both soma position and projection pattern is consistent with their being part of the same lineage. Such neurons will necessarily be more difficult to parse using SpaRCLIn, which can separate neurons within the same lineage only based on their birth order. What would be required to do so is having two NBEs that are active in the same lineage but at different times so that they separate earlier- from later-born neurons. Such NBEs, by generating Cre only in older neuroblasts, will generate sublineages of Gal4-competent neurons. Although many of the NBE’s used to make our Cre<sub>B</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> libraries clearly generate such sublineages—based on the patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>—it is doubtful that they cover more than a fraction of all temporal windows of neurogenesis in all neuronal lineages. A method for systematically isolating sublineages of later born neurons using SpaRCLIn may become possible if neuroblast-specific enhancers can be found that are selectively active at later stages of neurogenesis. These could then be used in lieu of the DNE used here. Candidates for such enhancers are those that determine expression of the so-called ‘temporal transcription factors’ that regulate the progressive divisions of many neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doe, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Variability of SpaRCLIN expression</title><p>Although stochasticity is not an uncommon feature of many expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tastekin and Louis, 2017</xref>), the variability of expression generated by SpaRCLIn was notable. Even for intersections that reliably produce very similar expression across animals, it is not common to get exactly the same pattern twice. The infidelity of expression may derive, at least in part, from intrinsic stochasticity of NBE activity. However, our results indicate that individual NBEs drive expression in broadly reproducible patterns. Other factors that may contribute to expression variability include the strength and/or temporal properties of NBE activity. If a Cre component is only weakly expressed, or expressed late during neurogenesis, a limited amount of active, full-length Cre may be produced and excision of Gal80 may be sporadic in the expressing neuroblasts. Also, the success of Cre reconstitution may vary, and may be particularly low when the religation of three fragments is required. Although the two split inteins used in the SpaRCLIn system were chosen based on their favorable reaction kinetics as determined in vitro, the speed, efficiency, and variability with which they react in different types of cells remain unknown. Finally, because the efficacy of Cre-mediated excision depends on the distance between the loxP sites flanking the excised fragment, it may prove possible to increase the efficacy of excision—and thus reduce variability of expression—using strategies that decrease the distance between the loxP sites flanking the fragment to be excised.</p><p>While further work will be required to identify the sources of variable expression within the system, the observed stochasticity is not necessarily a disadvantage for circuit-mapping applications, as illustrated by the examples presented here. By providing partially ‘randomized’ expression patterns, SpaRCLIn permits causative relationships to be inferred between groups of manipulated neurons and the effects produced by their manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017</xref>). Such randomization has been commonly exploited in so-called ‘Flp-out’ methods that rely on stochastically induced recombinase activity to remove an FRT-flanked gene or transcription stop cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>). This logic is naturally implemented in SpaRCLIn, but because randomness of expression is considerably more constrained than that observed in systems that rely on strictly stochastic methods, and because the size of the expression patterns is typically small, correlations can be readily established.</p><p>One consequence of SpaRCLIn’s stochasticity that must be considered in circuit mapping applications, however, is the lowered frequency of bilateral labeling. Most neurons occur as members of bilateral pairs and we observed numerous instances in which SpaRCLIn-derived expression patterns contained only a single member of each pair in a given preparation—presumably due to the variable success of Gal80 excision in both NBs giving rise to the pair. The reduced bilateral representation of neurons may likewise reduce the frequency of phenotypes observed as a consequence of a particular manipulation if, for example, both neurons in a pair must be affected to produce a phenotype. This is often the case for suppression of function, where both neurons in the pair must be inhibited. It is therefore possible that SpaRCLIn will be most effective in applications that involve neuronal activation where unilateral manipulations are often sufficient to generate an effect as they are for proboscis extension.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other considerations in the use of SpaRCLIn</title><p>The ability of SpaRCLIn to isolate a given set of neurons of interest in a Gal4 pattern depends critically on the extent to which the various Split Cre components are expressed in the neuroblast lineages of the fly. This will be determined both by the breadth of NB expression of the DNE enhancer used here to delimit Cre activity and by the collective coverage of NB expression provided by the NBEs represented in the libraries of Cre<sub>B</sub> and Cre<sub>C</sub> lines. Our analysis of 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval expression in DNE∩NBE intersections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and data not shown) indicates that many, if not most, NB lineages of the ventral nerve cord and central brain are likely represented within the libraries. Indeed, many lineages are clearly represented multiple times in that different intersections repeatedly isolated the same neurons (e.g. the PE<sup>rk</sup> neurons) for both the rk<sup>pan</sup>-Gal4 and TH-Gal4 drivers. It is less clear, however, that all members of each lineage are represented as not all NBE’s are active during early NB divisions. This is evident from the restriction in NB expression observed when the FRTerminator construct is used, since this construct acts by eliminating lineages or sublineages in which Cre activity is initiated sometime after neurogenesis has begun. It is also clear that the DNE does not express efficiently in NB lineages in the optic lobe (data not shown). To extend the capability of the system to include these lineages will require either the development of a more general neuroblast-specific enhancer or augmenting the system to include an enhancer that specifically targets optic lobe NBs.</p><p>The effectiveness of SpaRCLIn also depends critically on the success of Cre reconstitution by the system, which is effected by two pairs of split inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah and Muir, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shah and Muir, 2014</xref>). These trans-splicing protein fragments function naturally in protein religation and are an emerging technology for use in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Their advantages are that they lend themselves readily to intersectional methods, are genetically encoded, and in numerous cases display rapid reaction kinetics and low cross-reactivity. A disadvantage, on which some recent progress has been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>), is that most split inteins require specific flanking amino acid residues in the proteins to which they are fused, in particular a cysteine or serine residue immediately downstream of the N-intein. We were able to create self-ligating split Cre fragments capable of reconstituting full-length, active Cre enzyme in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs by choosing breakpoints in the Cre sequence preceded by a serine residue—the native condition of the NrdJ-1 and gp41-1 split inteins used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvajal-Vallejos et al., 2012</xref>). Orthogonal (i.e. non-interacting) split inteins thus represent attractive tools for reconstituting the function of multiply split proteins, a methodology that should be applicable in other model organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions and future development</title><p>Although sophisticated methods for neuronal targeting have been a hallmark of neurobiological studies on the fly, and single cell manipulations are being leveraged in a growing number of cases to elucidate <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain circuits, targeting every cell in the fly CNS remains an aspirational goal. Recent progress towards this goal has been made using the Split Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tirian et al., 2017</xref>), and innovative methods continue to be developed using emerging tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Marques et al., 2019</xref>). An advantage of SpaRCLIn is that it represents a relatively small set of stand-alone reagents for high-specificity neuronal targeting that can be used with the many existing components of the Gal4-UAS system. Importantly, SpaRCLIn also represents an open resource that can readily be augmented by end-users. As methods improve for rationally identifying NB lineages based on gene expression and enhancer activity, the existing SpaRCLIn libraries can be supplemented with lines that together permit the selective targeting of an increasing number of neuroblast lineages. The NB-specific enhancers recently identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacin and Truman (2016)</xref> and used here to characterize our split Cre components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) provide good examples of reagents that can be used to improve the SpaRCLIn libraries. By combining these libraries with an optimized set of Gal4 drivers that express in distinct subsets of brain cells (distinguished, for example, by transcription factor expression), one can imagine having a set of 3 libraries that in combination can selectively target most neurons in CNS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

For neuronal activation using dTrpA1, the chambers were placed on the surface of the Echotherm Chilling/Heating Dry Bath IC25 (Torrey Pines Scientific, Inc, Carlsbad, CA) at 31°C. For the Step 1 SpaRCLIn screen, approximately a dozen adult flies (3–10 d old) of each genotype were placed in glass TriKinetics tubes (3 mm inner diameter; TriKinetics Inc, Waltham, MA) and videorecorded at 31°C for 3 min using a Sony NEX-VG10 videocamera. Proboscis extension behavior was analyzed from these recordings. If two or more flies exhibited robust, full-length extension, the cross was scored as positive. For the Step two tripartite SpaRCLIn screen, two flies at a time (one male and one female) were videorecorded together in glass minichambers (0.3 cm diameter X 0.7 cm length) for 3 min at 18°C followed by 3 min at 31°C. Flies were subjected to these temperature transitions twice and proboscis extension behavior was analyzed following the recording. The criteria for positive proboscis extension was three or more bouts of full proboscis extension in both tests. For the FRTerminator behavior experiments flies were subjected to only one test. Flies used to make the videos included in the manuscript were back-mounted on a 200 uL pipette tip with 5-Minute-Rapid-Curing, General Purpose Adhesive Epoxy (ITW polymers Adhesive, Danvers, MA) and placed just above the heating plate, which was adjusted to apply temperature changes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matthew Roberts, Andrew Laczarchik, and Ana Cardenas for technical help in generating the NBE-Split Cre lines described in this study.

So, it is with great anticipation that one approaches their creative new method for further refining GAL4 expression patterns. Of course, several methods of refinement already exist, such as intersecting split-GAL4 patterns with FLP, GAL80, or killer-Zip constructs. The novelty in the method they report here is in using neuroblast-specific enhancers as the third intersecting component, rather than additional enhancers expressed in differentiated neurons. This idea is not new but has proven difficult to implement because of the lack of well-defined neuroblast enhancers. Luan and colleagues partially solve this problem by making neuroblast enhancers out of bi- and tri-partite intersections of multiple enhancers, one of which is a synthetic pan-neuroblast enhancer. To do this, they exploit the split intein system to reconstruct a functional Cre recombinase, which in turn excises a ubiquitous GAL80 cassette to allow GAL4 expression within the progeny of the targeted lineage. The method is perhaps somewhat cumbersome, given the large number of transgenes involved, but this should be manageable, particularly if one could generate a panel of stocks, each of which containing all of the split-Cre components needed to target a specific lineage.</p><p>The practical utility of this method will depend principally on (a) the coverage and specificity of the collection of neuroblast Cre lines, and (b) the reproducibility of the resulting expression patterns. With respect to coverage and specificity, the collection of lines here is a good starting point, though as the authors acknowledge, it needs some improvement. They envision, not unreasonably, that this will become a community effort over time, as users identify new neuroblast enhancers and gradually improve the collection. The question is whether, as the reagents currently stand, a sufficient utility threshold is reached so that the community will indeed enthusiastically take up this approach and gradually improve the reagents. The first split-GAL4 system was not perfect and few useful lines were initially generated. But it clearly filled a void and was effective enough that it was rapidly embraced and continuously improved. It is hard to see the split-Cre system catching on in a similar way. Partly this is because of the success of split-GAL4, and the existence of alternative methods for further refinement. The need is simply not as great as it was for split-GAL4. But it is also because of the problem of poor reproducibility of the split-Cre system.</p><p>Because of the variable expression patterns obtained with the split-Cre system, circuit mapping using this system functions similarly to the existing stochastic methods for restricting expression, i.e. large numbers of individuals need to be tested behaviorally and then analysed histologically to determine which cells were targeted, fly-by-fly. This is how the authors use it in the examples they provide here. One would need to consider on a case-by-case basis which is the more suitable approach. Split-Cre likely involves more crosses but fewer flies in order to get a convincing correlation, but may be more prone to failure due to coverage issues or the inability to discriminate between cells in the same lineage. A simple hs-FLP approach would be easier genetically, requiring fewer stocks and crosses, but perhaps require examining more individuals. The best choice will likely depend on the complexity of the initial pattern, but often standard hs-FLP approach is likely to still be the easiest and most reliable.</p><p>The strengths of the work are also notable. One is the clearly demonstrated ability to narrow a Gal4 pattern by intersecting it with two or three Cre patterns. Another is using the sparse patterns to identify neurons that can induce a specific behavior; leveraging the stochasticity of the expression to correlate expression with behavioral phenotype is really turning lemons (variability) into lemonade (stronger neuron-behavior correlations). Yet another strength is the creation of new transgenics to simplify use of the system (for the authors and all who follow). Very thoughtful.</p><p>Overall, there are some very important concerns that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the above reasons, our enthusiasm for the split-Cre approach is somewhat muted. It is clever and potentially very useful, but we think it still needs further development before it will be enthusiastically taken up by the community. We suggest, reluctantly, that the authors delve further into the reasons for the variability. It might be easier to do this using a simple Cre-dependent reporter (which they have), rather than indirectly by dissecting some GAL4 expression pattern (as they do with TH-GAL4 here). A more robust method, even with only a limited initial set of neuroblast-specific Cre lines, would certainly be a useful tool for the community.</p><p>2) It is not clear that the NBEs are really neuroblast-specific. Data supporting this conclusion could be readily obtained by staining the NBE-Gal4 UAS-GFP lines with GFP (for the gal4 pattern) and Dpn or Wor (for neuroblasts); there should be only one double positive cell in each hemisegment of the VNC or brain lobe.</p><p>3) It is unclear how reproducible the NBE pattern is when a NBE-Cre(AB) is inserted at different landing sites other than attP2.

You raised concerns that we had not previously appreciated and alerted us to unintended omissions. To meet the reviewers’ requests for essential changes, we have made numerous changes, which we believe strengthen the manuscript considerably. These changes and our point-by-point responses are detailed below, but we wished to start by addressing the two overarching reservations raised about the SpaRCLIn technique. The first of these relates to its efficacy, and second to its ease of use relative to existing methods, particularly Split Gal4.</p><p>With regard to efficacy, major concerns were raised about “(a) the coverage and specificity of the collection of neuroblast Cre lines, and (b) the reproducibility of the resulting expression patterns.” Prompted by these concerns we have introduced new data regarding the spatiotemporal expression of our NB enhancers and its variability. With regard to the neuroblast-specific DNE: we show that DNE-driven Cre activity is evident as early as embryonic stage 8 and is widespread in the developing CNS by stage 13 (subsection “Development of Bipartite and Tripartite Split Cre Recombinases”, fifth paragraph; Figure 1—figure supplement 2C in the revised manuscript). As requested by the reviewers, we also demonstrate that the DNE drives Cre fragment expression early enough to label progeny of a defined NB lineage identified by Lacin and Truman, 2016 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D in the revised manuscript). Although we cannot rule out the absence of Cre activity in the earliest born neurons, these new data suggest that Gal80 excision occurs relatively early. We anticipate that coverage of adult neurons, most of which are born during larval neurogenesis is much better, except for those in the optic lobe where the DNE is not active as previously noted.</p><p>The reviewers point out that the best possible coverage is likely afforded by standard hs-Flp methods and that such methods are easier to use. The downside of these methods, however, is their very limited reproducibility. The reproducibility achieved with almost all NBE lines of SpaRCLIn is at least an order of magnitude better than that of Flp-out Gal80 methods (approximately 3% for expression in a neuron of interest in a study in which we participated, Flood et al., 2013). As our dissection of both the TH- and Rk-Gal4 lines shows, the NBE lines with the best reproducibility will express in a given neuron in upwards of 80% of progeny. Although this falls short of complete reproducibility, it does allow an end-user to identify a neuron of interest in a screen and repeatedly return to it for further characterization with some confidence. In contrast, with hs-Flp methods, one is forced to search the entire haystack (i.e. Gal4 expression pattern) again for the desired needle (i.e. neuron) for every new manipulation (i.e. UAS effector) one uses. The utility of hs-Flp methods thus steeply declines if one wants to do more than simply identify a neuron based on one criterion. As the reviewers point out, end users will want to decide which method to choose depending on their needs, but we believe that SpaRCLIn offers sufficient advantages to be an attractive option in several contexts.</p><p>Under what circumstances might an end-user choose to use SpaRCLIn over Split Gal4? We recommend using it when Split Gal4 can’t (or seems unlikely to) deliver the desired refinement in expression. We agree with the reviewers that Split Gal4 and other existing tools have revolutionized <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurobiology and we appreciate their kind comments regarding our contributions to this effort. However, in many cases even the best available tools don’t restrict expression sufficiently to permit assignment of functional identities to particular neurons. This is reflected in the question we most frequently get from potential end-users regarding SpaRCLIn: Does it work with Split Gal4? The coverage of Split Gal4—using the thousands of lines generously generated, characterized, and made available by the Rubin and Dickson labs—is, like that of SpaRCLIn, incomplete (estimated at 75% by Dionne et al., 2018), and finding useful combinations – while facilitated by fine registration tools developed by several labs – still generates “no more that 5%” of intersections without ectopic expression (Dionne et al., 2018). Under these circumstances, end-users will benefit from additional strategies and SpaRCLIn – with its distinct differences from other commonly used strategies – should prove useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the above reasons, our enthusiasm for the split-Cre approach is somewhat muted. It is clever and potentially very useful, but we think it still needs further development before it will be enthusiastically taken up by the community.

It might be easier to do this using a simple Cre-dependent reporter (which they have), rather than indirectly by dissecting some GAL4 expression pattern (as they do with TH-GAL4 here). A more robust method, even with only a limited initial set of neuroblast-specific Cre lines, would certainly be a useful tool for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewers’ interest in the cause(s) of variability and have added new information (subsection “Development of Bipartite and Tripartite Split Cre Recombinases”, last paragraph) and a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) to the revised manuscript regarding this point. As noted in the Discussion of the original manuscript, erratic expression may derive in part from intrinsic stochasticity of the individual NB enhancers. As the reviewers pointed out, this possibility can be investigated using our Cre-dependent Act5C^Gal80^tdTomato (i.e. CreStop) reporter. We had previously confirmed NBE-driven expression in larval CNS preparations using this reporter (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and we have now examined multiple preparations (n= 4 on average) for each of the 134 NBEs to assess their variability in DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub>∩NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> &gt; CreStop crosses (in addition to several similar DNE-Cre<sub>A</sub>∩DNE-Cre<sub>C</sub>∩NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> crosses, see Essential revision 3 below). In general, we find that patterns for any given NBE are similar across preparations, with examples presented in a new figure (i.e. Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-D). Although some variation is almost certainly present, the large size of the patterns and our inability to reliably identify identical neurons and lineages across preparations prevented a more detailed analysis. As noted in the revised Discussion (subsection “Variability of SpaRCLIN expression”, first paragraph), our results suggest that large-scale variability in the activity of individual NBEs is unlikely to explain all of SpaRCLIn’s stochasticity in Step 2 crosses and that further analysis will be required to determine its source. We also now provide a somewhat more extended discussion of the possible sources with addition of the following material: “If a Cre component is only weakly expressed, or expressed late during neurogenesis, a limited amount of active, full-length Cre may be produced and excision of Gal80 may be sporadic in the expressing neuroblasts. […] Finally, because the efficacy of Cre-mediated excision depends on the distance between the loxP sites flanking the excised fragment, it may prove possible to increase the efficacy of excision – and thus reduce stochasticity of expression – using strategies that decrease the distance between the loxP sites flanking the excised fragment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear that the NBEs are really neuroblast-specific. Data supporting this conclusion could be readily obtained by staining the NBE-Gal4 UAS-GFP lines with GFP (for the gal4 pattern) and Dpn or Wor (for neuroblasts); there should be only one double positive cell in each hemisegment of the VNC or brain lobe.</p></disp-quote><p>We realized in reading this comment that we had provided too little information about the sources and properties of our NBEs. Few (perhaps none) of them are “neuroblast-specific.” This is why the Split Cre approach was required. Expression of one Cre component had to be driven by a bona fide NB-specific enhancer (viz. the “DNE”) to delimit Cre activity to NBs. Importantly, however, all of our NBEs are <underline>active</underline> in neuroblasts (in addition to other cell types). This may have been unclear because we described the procedure for selecting and testing previously unpublished NBEs only in the Materials and methods and not in the body of the paper. While the majority of our NBEs were selected from previously published sets (88 of the 134 NBEs are from Manning et al., 2012), approximately one-quarter (38) were identified by a method similar to that suggested by the reviewers. We used NBE-Gal4 lines from the Janelia FlyLight collection with probable expression in larval NBs to drive a UAS-Cre<sub>C</sub> construct together with Cre<sub>A</sub> and Cre<sub>B</sub> fragments driven by DNE. Expression in NB clones was evaluated using the CreStop reporter. The main text of the revised manuscript now clearly indicates the origin of the NBEs (subsection “Development of Bipartite and Tripartite Split Cre Recombinases”, third paragraph), with all sources cited in a new column in the revised Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear how reproducible the NBE pattern is when a NBE-Cre(AB) is inserted at different landing sites other than attP2. Are there data on this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We are somewhat confused by this point. We do not describe an NBE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> construct/line in our paper. The only Cre<sub>AB</sub> line is the one used for Step 1 screening where expression of the Cre<sub>AB</sub> fragment is driven by the DNE. The DNE-Cre<sub>AB</sub> insertion in this case is into the JK22C attP landing site on Chromosome II. This site was chosen because of its previously demonstrated fidelity of expression compared with attP2 (Knapp et al. Genetics. 2015, 199: 919–934, see Figure 2E).</p><p>We wonder, however, if the reviewer isn’t referring to the reproducibility of expression produced by NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> and NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> lines. The former (with insertions on Chromosome III: attP VK00033 or VK00027) are used in Step 1 screens to select suitable NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> lines (with insertions on Chromosome II: attP40) for use in Step 2 screening. Ensuring the similarity of expression between NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> and NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines made with identical NBEs is thus important. This is an issue that we had investigated, but did not explicitly address in the original manuscript. The revised manuscript, however, incorporates some of our previous findings together with more recent results (subsection “Development of Bipartite and Tripartite Split Cre Recombinases”, last paragraph).</p><p>The larval CNS expression patterns produced by all NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> lines had been visually inspected by fluorescence microscopy and compared to the corresponding patterns obtained for NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines (characterized as described in Essential Revision 1). The patterns for a given enhancer inserted at the two different attP landing sites were generally similar, although differences in expression levels between the two types of lines made detailed comparison difficult. (This is because the NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines were tested using the bipartite system, while NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> lines were necessarily tested using the tripartite system, which yields lower expression.) Nevertheless, we flagged 24 NBE-Cre<sub>B</sub> lines whose expression pattern differed overtly in one or more respects from the corresponding NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines. We have now tested several of these lines more systematically and provide an example of one such NBE in the revised manuscript in Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, D where it is compared with an example of an NBE that produced similar patterns (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B). The revised manuscript also now alerts readers to the 24 potentially problematic lines, which are marked with asterisks in Supplementary file 1. A footnote in the table of Supplementary file 1 states that users who identify one of these NBE-Cre<sub>C</sub> lines as a “positive hit” in a Step 1 screen may want to continue using this line in the subsequent Step 2 screen (if possible) to preserve its expression pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How early does the Cre reconstitution start to work? Staining for temporal factor expression may help to reveal the onset time.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we now present data in the revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C) that suggests a relatively early onset of Cre reconstitution. Since we assayed Cre-mediated tdTomato expression and because this expression depends on multiple time-dependent steps (i.e. expression of the split Cre fragments, their reconstitution into functional recombinase, excision of Gal80 by the recombinase, and expression of sufficient tdTomato reporter to see a signal) our data set an upper bound on the time of Cre reconstitution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
