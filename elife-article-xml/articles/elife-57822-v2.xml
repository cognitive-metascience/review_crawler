ERGIC/Golgi (Raote et al., 2018). TANGO1 corrals retrograde membranes at ER exit sites to create an export conduit. Here the retrograde membrane is, in itself, an anterograde carrier. This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape. We have also shown that the helices align TANGO1 around an ER exit site. We suggest this is a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing during TANGO1-mediated transfer of bulky secretory cargos from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi via a tunnel.</p></abstract><kwd-group

homeostatic regulation of compositional gradients of proteins and lipids, required to maintain organelle identity along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Blume and Hausser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Meer and Lisman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). These gradients are established by the formation and transport of highly curved transport intermediaries; a key question is whether (and how) membrane curvature plays a major role in lipid and protein sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campelo and Malhotra, 2012</xref>). While it is clear that lipid sorting occurs during the biogenesis of transport intermediates, current evidence suggests that curvature-mediated lipid sorting is not based on curvature alone, but requires additional protein-lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brügger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callan-Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gruenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klemm et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sorre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Baumgart, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Protein and lipid sorting during export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) utilises ER export machinery including the multisubunit COPII complex, which controls the formation of cargo-containing transport intermediates. In vitro preparations of COPII vesicles show a differential lipidomic profile from the ER, including an enrichment in lysolipids such as lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and a decrease in phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melero et al., 2018</xref>). COPII vesicles form at ER exit sites (ERES), which are semi-stable specialized subdomains of the ER with structures of a pleomorphic organization of diverse curvatures, including cup-like shapes and beaded tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>). How ERES morphology is established and maintained, and how these structures contribute to cargo export and protein/lipid sorting between the ER and subsequent secretory compartments, are still open questions.</p><p>A unique challenge during ERES-mediated lipid sorting arises during the export of bulky and complex cargoes such as procollagens from the ER. During procollagen export, the ER and the post-ER compartment (ERGIC/Golgi) are transiently connected, yet there is a controlled transfer of proteins and lipids between the two compartments. Procollagens in the ER fold and trimerize into rigid, rod-like elements that are considered too large for conventional COPII coated vesicle-mediated transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgeson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kadler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCaughey and Stephens, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Omari et al., 2018</xref>). Due to large cargo size, it has been hypothesized that large COPII-coated carriers mediate procollagen export from the ER to the Golgi. Outsize COPII carriers were reported in cells overexpressing KLHL12, which generates large procollagen-containing structures that co-label with Sec31A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). A subsequent report suggested that these structures are destined for degradation and not <italic>bona fide</italic> transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Omari et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, it has been proposed that coordinated assembly of inner and outer COPII coats can mediate the biogenesis of vesicles ranging from small spheres to large tubular carriers, commensurate with the size of bulky cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutchings and Zanetti, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hutchings et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stagg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zanetti et al., 2013</xref>). However, ER-to-Golgi procollagen carriers appear pleomorphic and do not seem to contain any detectable COPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mironov et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>More recent evidence suggests an entirely different mechanism is at play. Procollagen export from the ER requires the assembly of a functional machine centred on the transmembrane ERES-resident protein TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lekszas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). As a master regulator of ERES assembly, TANGO1 acts as a filamentous linactant to recruit, constrain, and scaffold ERES machinery and post-ER (ERGIC) membranes for procollagen export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raote et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raote et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raote et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saito and Maeda, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santos et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have proposed that a procollagen carrier is not formed by sculpting a vesicle from ER membrane as in the conventional model of COPII coated vesicle formation. Instead, TANGO1 utilises a retrograde membrane tether complex (NRZ complex) to tether post-ER membranes (ERGIC/Golgi), which fuse at the ERES to create an export route for procollagens. The membrane fusion creates a pore or tunnel between the ER and the ERGIC which is stabilised and constrains by TANGO1, as cargo is transferred for anterograde transport. Thus retrograde membrane (the ERGIC) is the anterograde carrier. During the process of cargo transfer, we propose the ERGIC and the ER are maintained as two distinct compartments, but how are their membrane lipids and proteins prevented from mixing completely?</p><p>Using super-resolution (STED) microscopy to visualise TANGO1, its interactors, and associated machinery we have described its assembly into a filament-like ring to organise the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raote and Malhotra, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raote et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raote et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raote et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reynolds et al., 2019</xref>). By assembling into a ring around an ERES, TANGO1 corrals COPII machinery and generates a semi-stable sub-domain across multiple compartments. Could TANGO1 also participate in preventing lipid mixing between the ERGIC and the ER? A ring of TANGO1 is ideally spatially organised to partially separate membrane inside the ring from the rest of the ER. Retrograde ERGIC membranes fuse within the ring, serving as an anterograde conduit for collagen. In other words, how are ERGIC membranes effectively partitioned from the rest of the ER, by a diffusion barrier created around the site of REGIC retrograde fusion at an ERES?</p><p>TANGO1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with two adjacent hydrophobic helices; amino acid residues 1177–1197 of human TANGO1 are predicted to form a transmembrane helix, while residues 1145–1165 form a helix that penetrates the lumenal leaflet of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these helices could mediate membrane partitioning. We have reconstituted the two hydrophobic helices in model membrane and show that they create a diffusion barrier for lipids, at a region of defined membrane curvature and shape. The diffusion barrier should occur at the base of the tube, paralleling the neck of a growing transport carrier/tunnel at an ERES. Finally, using super resolution (STED) microscopy, we show that the functions mediated by the helices are incorporated into TANGO1 assembly into a ring around an ERES. We propose that such a barrier could sub-compartmentalise ER membrane, allowing retrograde ERGIC/Golgi membrane to be constrained during cargo transfer out of the ER, while maintaining the compositional identities of the individual compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TANGO1 membrane helices partition lipids</title><p>In order to investigate whether the membrane-associated helices of TANGO1 can contribute to the organisation of the ER-ERES boundary, we employed recombinant minimal transmembrane proteins that were reconstituted in model membranes. In order to mimic the marked changes in curvature that are encountered at this boundary, we employed micro-manipulation of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV). Here, a tube with a diameter of 50–200 nm is pulled from the surface of the GUV, providing an ideal proxy to characterise membrane reorganisation and the role of membrane curvature and shape during transport intermediate biogenesis at the ER.</p><p>We purified the intramembrane (IM) and transmembrane (TM) helices, tagged with monomeric superfolder enhanced GFP (IM-TM_GFP).

The lipid intensities are also the same, 191 ± 61 a.u. and 178 ± 37 a.u. for IM-TM and TM respectively. All values are mean ± standard deviation.</p><p>These fluorescence intensities can be used to arrive at an approximation of the ratio of protein to lipids. Under our conditions, we estimate 1 IM-TM protein per 18,000 lipids, that is a typical inter-protein distance of 80 nm (see Materials and methods section for a more detailed description of this quantification).</p><p>A micropipette was used to grab the GUV, and a streptavidin-coated silica bead was brought in contact with the GUV for a few seconds to form streptavidin-biotin bonds. Separation of the bead from the GUV led to a ~ 100 µm long membrane tube, thereby generating a site of saddle-like curvature at the junction of tube and the flat GUV membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The aspiration pressure in the GUV micropipette was varied between 5 Pa and 100 Pa, which in our geometry corresponds to tube diameters between 200 nm and 50 nm. We did not observe any dependency in our experiments on the aspiration pressure; hence this is not discussed further.</p><p>To observe lipid diffusion across the region of saddle-like curvature between the tube and the GUV, we photobleached Atto647N in the tube membrane and quantified its recovery after photobleaching. Fluorescence recovery in the tube was due to the diffusion of labelled lipids from the GUV into the tube. This experiment was carried out in GUVs under three conditions: with no protein (no protein), with TM_GFP (TM), and with IM-TM_GFP (IM-TM) as depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Images of Atto647N in the tube were acquired before bleaching (prebleach), immediately after the photobleach (0 min) and six minutes later (6 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The recovery of fluorescence was plotted six minutes after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This single time point was chosen such that fluorescence recovery in the tube had plateaued (see Materials and methods section for details). Fluorescence recovered to 60 ± 6% (mean ±s.d.) of the prebleach intensity in tubes from GUVs with no protein. Similarly, in tubes pulled from GUVs with the transmembrane helix alone (TM), fluorescence recovered to 56 ± 12%. However, the two helices together (IM-TM), considerably inhibited fluorescence recovery. Now, the recovery was only 35 ± 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), showing that TANGO1 membrane helices together inhibited the exchange of lipids between the tube and the rest of the GUV.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TANGO1 helices are a barrier to diffusion of lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the three conditions (no protein, TM, IM-TM) with protein reconstitution into a GUV showing a tube pulled from the GUV; (<bold>B</bold>) Atto647N-labelled lipids visualised in the pulled tube in all three conditions, before bleaching (prebleach), then immediately after bleaching (0 min) and six minutes later (6 min).

The two treatments, no protein and TM, are grouped as control, and compared with the trials with ‘IM-TM’. Results from the trials with IM-TM (blue bars) appear to divide into two peaks, one with a lower recovery rate and a second peak that looks like control trials. Most trials with low recovery rates were those observed in tubes pulled from GUVs with IM-TM. There were almost no trials in control conditions (either no protein, or TM alone) with slowed recovery. We expect that those trials that showed no effect might have been affected by one or more of the confounds described above.</p><p>To make sure the low recovery in the tube is not due to a global reduced fluidity of the membrane of GUV with IM-TM, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on the EGFP-labeled protein in the GUV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found a diffusion coefficient (0.7 ± 0.3 µm²/s), consistent with a protein that is monomeric or in the form of small oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data show that the membrane (protein and lipid) is fully fluid without hindered diffusion, confirming that the low recovery in the tube is due to reduced crossing at the junction between the GUV and the tube.</p><p>In treatments where lipid flux between the GUV and the tube is slowed or blocked, we expect a similar or even more pronounced behavior for transmembrane proteins. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to use the same photobleaching and recovery assay to estimate the flux of GFP-associated fluorescence between the GUV and the tube. Unfortunately, we were unable to accurately quantify the GFP-associated fluorescence in the tube, as the protein levels in the tube are too low to be clearly distinguished from the background and are rapidly bleached during imaging.</p><p>Such a diffusion barrier could most likely form if the membrane helices are concentrated and retained at the base of the pulled tube. We were unable to test this prediction and visualise an immobile pool of protein at the base of the tube under our experimental conditions, as the diameter of the tube is 50–200 nm and a stable pool of GFP fluorescence is indistinguishable from the fluorescence in the rest of the GUV, even after photobleaching the bulk of the GUV and attempting to visualise GFP signal retained at the base of the tube. Visualising such a cluster of a few molecules might be possible using total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy. Our procedure does not permit this type of single-molecule measurements; we used a confocal microscope with a dry objective resulting in a relatively high background from the surrounding membrane. Additionally the dyes used are neither bright nor photostable enough for such analyses.</p><p>These results showed that the two TANGO1 helices were sufficient to partially restrict lipid exchange between the tube and the rest of the GUV. What role do the two helices play in how TANGO1 interacts with the ER membrane?</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The intramembrane helix is not required to target TANGO1 to ERES</title><p>Proteins that insert into the lipid bilayer can bend membranes by changing the local spontaneous curvature of the monolayer or, by being retained at a location, they can stabilise a specific shape of membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kozlov et al., 2014</xref>). We envisage that TANGO1 helices together are retained at, and/or stabilise, the saddle-shape membrane at the junction of the tube and the GUV, as at the junction of the ERES and a transport intermediate. Thus, we propose that the pair of helices act as a membrane shape-sensing module.</p><p>What could TANGO1 use this shape sensor for, in vivo? A first possibility we could test is that it promotes the correct localisation of TANGO1 in the ER. The ability to detect defined membrane shapes and curvatures could be utilised by TANGO1 to localise to the site of defined shape at an ERES, particularly the junction of the ER and an export intermediate. We have previously shown that TANGO1 is recruited to ERES via an interaction between its C-terminal proline rich domain (PRD) and ERES proteins Sec23A and Sec16A. Perhaps the membrane shape-sensitivity of TANGO1 would play an additional role in its localisation as well. To test the role of the putative shape sensor in targeting TANGO1 to an ERES, we deleted the IM helix (amino acids 1145–1165, TANGO1ΔIM) or the TM (amino acids 1177–1197, TANGO1ΔTM) from full length TANGO1 (schematic representation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and assayed for the ability of the resulting proteins to localise to ERES. We transfected these constructs in HeLa cells from which endogenous TANGO1 has been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology (named 2H5 cells), as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raote et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santos et al., 2015</xref>), and observed their pattern of expression. Deletion of the IM helix had no discernible effect on the ability of TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, green) to localise to ERES as visualised by its localisation to puncta of the ERES marker Sec16A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Deletion of the intramembrane helix has no effect on TANGO1 recruitment to ERES.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of TANGO1 constructs used in this study, showing the sequence of the transmembrane and intramembrane helices.

Under these conditions there was a clear separation of the signal from antibodies directed against the two different epitopes and we could identify two distinct configurations of the ring of TANGO1.

Initially, the C termini of TANGO1 lie within the ring, overlying the site of the formation of a carrier. As the carrier grows, the C termini are gradually pushed apart (for a schematic, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We used STED microscopy to monitor the organisation of TANGO1 into rings by imaging samples stained for both the TANGO1 and HA epitopes. Qualitatively, we observed that abrogating the intramembrane helix reduced the frequency with which we observed rings, but this observation could not be quantified given the subjective nature of the selection of fields to image. Interestingly, in several of the rings that did form, the C termini (HA epitope) and lumenal portions of TANGO1 were now misaligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Now, the C termini were often randomly oriented with respect to the ring formed by the lumenal epitope.</p><p>Alternatively, we mutated two hydrophobic residues in the IM helix to charged residues (phenylalanine 1152 and 1154 to arginine – TANGO1-FMF-RMR), such that it would no longer form a hydrophobic helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here too, many rings of TANGO1 showed altered alignment of the two epitopes.</p><p>In such a ring, a nascent bud will be encircled by the ring and serve to recruit and stabilise a membrane-shape-sensitive TANGO1 to the site. In other words, ring formation could create a feedback loop through orientation/shape sensing to further reinforce rings.</p><p>Regulating lipid sorting and trafficking is key in organelle homoeostasis, to control all membrane traffic, and spatiotemporal modulation of membrane curvature is essential in this control. We showed that the transmembrane organisation of TANGO1 is sufficient to act as a diffusion barrier for membrane lipids. In doing so, our data suggest that TANGO1 is concentrated at the neck of a budding membrane and can act as a fence, constraining the flow of lipids.</p><p>We have proposed that cargo transport through the secretory pathway can be mediated by transient tunnels or pores between successive compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raote and Malhotra, 2019</xref>). We have shown that retrograde fusion of ERGIC membrane to the ER could create a tunnel between the two compartments for procollagen export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>). How are two compartments, joined by a transient tunnel, kept biochemically distinct? How do COP coats, conventional cargo receptors, cargo proteins, and TANGO1 function as gatekeepers between the ER and the ERGIC? Lipids such as PI4P are required at the ERGIC-ERES interface to assist in the assembly of COPII‐coated vesicles at ERES and hence traffic from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumental-Perry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farhan et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, if lipids like PI4P are largely restricted to the ERGIC/Golgi, how are they prevented from flowing from the ERGIC/Golgi into the bulk ER membrane?</p><p>The lipid flux through the partial barrier between the GUV and the tube is proportional to the effective perimeter of the saddle. From the recovery rates observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, then 50–75% of the saddle is blocked by the membrane helices.</p><p>To what extent might these numbers recapitulate events at an ERES? There are ~172,000 molecules of TANGO1 and 250–500 exit sites per cell or 350–700 TANGO1 molecules per exit site, surrounding transport intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammond and Glick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). Further reconstitution and modeling will be informative in delineating how this number of proteins generates the perimeter block. In vivo, there will be further effects from other associated ERES proteins including the TANGO1 family protein cTAGE5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data presented here suggest that by assembling into a ring at an ERES, TANGO1 can act to reduce lipid flow at the boundary between the two compartments, delaying lipid and most likely transmembrane protein mixing between them.</p><p>We envisage that the recruitment of TANGO1 to membrane regions of specific shape and curvature will make for greater efficiency in generating a bud at an ERES. Neighbouring TANGO1 molecules in the ER membrane will align along curved membrane - found at an ERES. This process, whereby a TANGO1 fence limiting the coat polymerisation zone, could be homologous to the roles played by proteins which contribute to the initiation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis FCHO1/2 and EPS15/EPSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avinoam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Hundreds of TANGO1 molecules, at each site, will have an additive or even synergistic effect in stabilising the bud. As the site of budding is defined, the increased membrane curvature will promote the recruitment and localisation of curvature-sensitive components including Sar1 and COPII coat proteins. These proteins will serve to reinforce the curvature stabilisation, in effect setting up a positive feedback loop, where exit site machinery and TANGO1 mutually recruit and constrain each other through their membrane sculpting capabilities. Aligned TANGO1 molecules will be constrained into a configuration in which it is more likely for them to participate in lateral interactions with each other, promoting their assembly into a filament, further reinforcing the organisation of TANGO1 and its interactors at the site.</p><p>These reinforcing activities are evident from our data, showing that only half of the rings of TANGO1ΔIM show detectable signal outside the ring from the C-terminal epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Each ring is likely comprised of hundreds, of TANGO1ΔIM molecules. For signal from the two different epitopes to appear normal, most molecules must be constrained in the correct orientation, probably by the combined effects of other proteins at the site including COPII components and other TANGO1 family proteins.</p><p>It is possible that the recruitment/stabilisation of TANGO1 at a region of defined saddle-like shape will contribute partially to the retention of TANGO1 in the ER instead of accompanying cargo to the next secretory compartment.</p><p>Do other proteins exhibit a similar pair of helices, and could this combination of helices represent a general mechanism to sense or stabilise membrane curvature and modulate lipid diffusion at sites of contact between two compartments? Proteins related to TANGO1 also have two adjacent membrane helices; an alternatively spliced short variant of TANGO1 (TANGO1-short) lacks lumenal domains, but still has two helices though its IM helix has a different sequence. The TANGO1-like protein TALI (or MIA2) also has two membrane helices and it too is a single-pass transmembrane protein. Interestingly, a recent study described another single-pass transmembrane protein TMEM131 with two adjacent predicted membrane helices, which functions at the interface of two compartments. Again one of these helices must span the membrane, while the other is likely inserted into one leaflet of a compartment membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In sum, TANGO1 through its various parts select and bind cargoes like the procollagens in the lumen, and interacts with coats and other cytoplasmic components that tether and transiently fuse ERES to ERGIC or the cis-Golgi (in cells that lack an ERGIC). The transmembrane helices in TANGO1 assist in its alignment into a ring to prevent membrane protein and lipid mixing during the transient coupling of these two secretory compartments. This transient pore or tunnel thus allows cargo movement while retaining compartmental specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2 in complete DMEM with 10% FBS unless otherwise stated.

The osmotic difference between the inside of the proteo-liposomes and the water drop immediately popped them and they resealed in a larger structure. The drying/rehydration cycle was repeated three more times to produce larger and more unilamellar proteo-GUVs (hereinafter called GUVs). The water drop was 6 µl for the third and fourth rehydration. After the last rehydration, water drops were deposited at the edge of the dish that was subsequently closed.

It corresponds to an average of one protein per 6300 nm², that is a typical inter protein distance of 80 nm. With our experimental conditions and parameters, this density corresponds to one protein per pixel at the pole of the GUVs, and 10 proteins per pixel at the equator of the GUV (because of the vertical projection). This rough estimate seems realistic with regard to the low intensity observed in our GUV experiments (see for instance the FRAP experiments described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Calculation of the protein density:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>92</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1250</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>500</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>10768</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.00056</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Note that we needed to go through Atto488 intermediate because this is a bright dye, commercially available on lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Tube formation, bleaching and recovery</title><p>MatTek dishes were modified to have two diametrically opposed openings in the wall so that quasi-horizontal micropipettes can move downward and reach the bottom coverslip. After GUV formation, the MatTek dish was placed on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and ~10,000 streptavidin coated silica beads (2 µm, Bangs Laboratories) were added. A first micropipette (inner diameter ~4 µm) was used to grab a proteo-GUV. A second one (inner diameter 1–2 µm) grabbed a bead. The aspiration in both micropipettes was controlled by a standard hydrostatic pressure system (relative accuracy: 1 Pa, absolute accuracy: 5 Pa, aspiration range: 5 Pa to 3,000 Pa). The GUV were then placed facing each other ~50 µm above the coverslip. The aspiration in the GUV was reduced to 5 Pa to lower the surface tension. Then, the bead was brought in contact with the GUV for a few seconds to ensure the formation of several streptavidin-biotin bonds. Upon separation of the bead from the GUV, a ~ 100 µm long tube of membrane was pulled, setting two connecting regions of very different curvature: the high curvature tube and the flat GUV membrane. The aspiration in the GUV micropipette was increased to the desired value and the system was left alone to relax for a couple of minutes. We varied the aspiration between 5 Pa and 100 Pa, which in our geometry corresponds to tube diameters between 200 nm and 50 nm. We did not observe any dependency of the fluorescence recovery on the aspiration; hence this is not discussed in the results section.</p><p>A first picture of the tube was acquired to obtain the initial tube fluorescence intensity (<italic>i<sub>0</sub></italic>). Then, fluorescent lipids in the tube alone (not the GUV) were almost completely bleached by illumination with a 647 He-Ne laser at maximum power for a few seconds. A second picture was immediately acquired and the tube fluorescence intensity after bleaching was measured (<italic>i<sub>b</sub></italic>). Finally, a third picture was taken after 6 min, which provided the final tube fluorescence intensity (<italic>i<sub>6</sub></italic>). The recovery was established as (<italic>i<sub>6</sub> - i<sub>b</sub></italic>)/(<italic>i<sub>0</sub> - i<sub>b</sub></italic>). We chose not to continuously monitor the fluorescence to avoid bleaching the fluorescent lipids as they migrate from the GUV to the tube.</p><p>We used 6 min because we wanted to be close to the fluorescence recovery plateau. We also wished to avoid spontaneous bleaching to have as accurate a measurement as possible and therefore acquired only one data point.</p><p>Diffusion time varies with the square of the typical dimension. Here we are working with 30 µm tubes, hence it takes about 10 times longer to reach the recovery plateau compared to a 10 µm experiment (size of a cell). Thus a recovery time of 30 s for 10 µm would take 5 min here.</p><p>Being more quantitative requires a better modeling of the geometry. Namely, the system of a tube blocked by a bead is equivalent to two mirror images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). With boundary conditions at t = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>):</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Time scales of lipid diffusion in the GUV-tube system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the system. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of system under boundary conditions at time t = 0.

The typical diffusion coefficient of a lipid in free membrane is ~5 µm²/s for which t<sub>1/2</sub> is slightly more than 1 min. Even if the diffusion coefficient of the lipid is reduced five times (unlikely), 6 min would be sufficient to be close to the recovery plateau. Hence, the choice of 6 min is a good compromise between an optimum recovery and a minimal experimental risk (drift of the pipettes, rupture of the GUV, etc.).</p><p>FRAP-based quantification of protein diffusion in the GUV membrane:</p><p>Experiments were carried out using the protocol we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pincet et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, a GUV is micromanipulated and positioned slightly above the coverslip so that lower pole is positioned in the focal plane of the confocal microscope. A disk-shaped region of interest (ROI) with a known diameter <italic>d</italic> is chosen at the pole of the GUV. A couple of ‘prebleach’ images are acquired with the laser power adjusted at the minimum value providing an above-noise fluorescence signal from the ROI with minimal intrinsic bleaching. The EGFP signal from the GUV is dim, attesting the low protein concentration. This forced us to use high laser power, 20% of the maximum value and maximum gain. One image with 100% power was sufficient to completely bleach the fluorescence from the ROI. Then, recovery was recorded, typically at two images per second, at 20% of the laser power. The recovery phase was monitored over ~15–20 s. The raw data are very noisy (blue data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) but still display significant intrinsic bleaching, showing the difficulty to adjust the laser power and obtain quantifiable measurements. To resolve this issue, we performed the rolling average over three successive images (orange data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data were normalized to one before bleach and 0 right after bleach.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin S Glick (Reviewer #3); Jose Rizo-Rey (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this &quot;Research Advance&quot; the authors build on their previous characterization of how the transmembrane protein TANGO1 resides at ER exit sites and mediates linkage to nearby ERGIC compartments. There are two key observations that together suggest a potentially novel and important role for TANGO1 in tubule-mediated transport- the prevention of intermixing of the membranes of donor and acceptor compartments. The first observation is that the TANGO1 membrane binding intramembrane helix called IM impedes lipid flux between a GUV and a tubule protruding from it. The second observation is that IM localizes TANGO1's cytoplasmic domain into clustered ring-like structures presumed to reflect targeting to the neck of budding ER export structures. There was agreement among the reviewers that these results will be of interest to the audience of e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>However, there were issues that need to be addressed. The first two will require additional experiments that should be straightforward, and it is agreed that they will significantly strengthen the conclusion that TANGO1 forms a membrane diffusion barrier that prevents the mixing of contents when ERGIC membranes fuse with the ER.</p><p>If performing one or both is not feasible because of the pandemic, the authors could try to address this with a textual revision, but it may be advisable to delay submission of a revised version until such experiments are possible again. There will be no deadline for completion.</p><p>1) How much of the IM-TM construct is present in the GUV relative to the lipids? Could it be so much that lipids fail to diffuse rapidly in the entire GUV? To show that a diffusion barrier exists specifically at the junction between the tube and the spherical portion, a suitable control would be to bleach half of the spherical portion of the GUV and confirm that fluorescence recovery within the spherical portion is unaffected by the IM-TM construct. This is a major concern that needs to be addressed, as it casts doubt on the main conclusion of the paper.</p><p>2) There is a need for a functional test. The authors analyze cells expressing Tango1∆IM-HA but do not report any tests for defects in compartmentalization. Their model predicts these cells should have loss of ERGIC-to-ER barrier function (e.g. ERGIC components redistributed to the ER among other changes).</p><p>3) The authors state that during procollagen export, the ER and ERGIC are transiently connected by a tunnel that keeps the two membranes distinct. Arguably, this an interesting hypothesis rather than an established fact. Such connections have not been directly visualized, and there is a diversity of views about how a large cargo traffics out of the ER.

The first two will require additional experiments that should be straightforward, and it is agreed that they will significantly strengthen the conclusion that TANGO1 forms a membrane diffusion barrier that prevents the mixing of contents when ERGIC membranes fuse with the ER.</p><p>If performing one or both is not feasible because of the pandemic, the authors could try to address this with a textual revision, but it may be advisable to delay submission of a revised version until such experiments are possible again. There will be no deadline for completion.</p><p>1) How much of the IM-TM construct is present in the GUV relative to the lipids? Could it be so much that lipids fail to diffuse rapidly in the entire GUV? To show that a diffusion barrier exists specifically at the junction between the tube and the spherical portion, a suitable control would be to bleach half of the spherical portion of the GUV and confirm that fluorescence recovery within the spherical portion is unaffected by the IM-TM construct. This is a major concern that needs to be addressed, as it casts doubt on the main conclusion of the paper.</p><p>“How much of the IM-TM construct is present in the GUV relative to the lipids?” We have included a quantification of the protein content of the GUVs, relative to their lipid content. We show that the protein and lipid contents are similar across experimental treatments. We have also added an extensive description of this quantification, in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“… is fluorescence recovery within the spherical portion unaffected by the IM-TM construct?” To confirm that diffusion can occur freely, we quantify the rates of diffusion of IM-TM protein in the spherical portion of the GUV and show that the protein is predominantly monomeric and freely diffusing. These data have been added as Figure 2—figure supplement 1) with a detailed description of our approach, in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) There is a need for a functional test. The authors analyze cells expressing Tango1∆IM-HA but do not report any tests for defects in compartmentalization. Their model predicts these cells should have loss of ERGIC-to-ER barrier function (e.g. ERGIC components redistributed to the ER among other changes).</p></disp-quote><p>A functional demonstration of the diffusion barrier in vivo would be wonderful. Unfortunately, we do not think it can be achieved at this stage.</p><p>Since TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes to the ER exit site, the mixing of ER and ERGIC material will itself depend on TANGO1. We have previously shown that depleting TANGO1 partially abrogates ERGIC recruitment to ER exit sites at collagen accumulations. It is unclear what effect the IM helix will have on TANGO1 retrograde recruitment of ERGIC membrane.</p><p>in vivo, an ER-ERGIC barrier will be affected by a number of components, including other TANGO1-family proteins and their isoforms, all of which are still present in cells after full-length TANGO1 is depleted. There are several possible explanations for any changes in the distribution of ER and ERGIC components under our experimental conditions, identifying each and their relative contributions to a barrier are not feasible, making it virtually impossible to interpret any observations.</p><p>Our data present a novel insight into the existence of a barrier, delineating the mechanisms involved in vivo will be an exciting avenue of research, but beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that during procollagen export, the ER and ERGIC are transiently connected by a tunnel that keeps the two membranes distinct. Arguably, this an interesting hypothesis rather than an established fact. Such connections have not been directly visualized, and there is a diversity of views about how a large cargo traffics out of the ER. The language here should be modified to accurately reflect the current state of knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a paragraph in the Introduction, describing alternate models of procollagen export.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please explain the rationale for choosing the single 6-minute time point for the fluorescence recovery assay. It seems like a long time for a lipid diffusion experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a single data point at 6 minutes because we wanted to be close to the fluorescence recovery plateau and we also wished to avoid spontaneous bleaching to have measurement as accurate as possible. We have stated this explicitly in the text and included detailed reasoning in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2D is hard to process and lacks a statistical test. Because it's apparently important to the argument, a fuller explanation would help.</p></disp-quote><p>To convey the information better, we have replaced the cumulative frequency plot with a frequency histogram. We now include a paragraph to describe this plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is some uncertainty about the relevance of the experiments in Figures 3 and 4. This section could be strengthened with a clearer explanation of the questions that were being asked.</p></disp-quote><p>We presume the reviewers are referring to Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. In this experiment we test one potential way that TANGO1 could utilize the membrane shape-sensing module of two adjacent membrane helices. A first possibility we could test is that it promotes the correct localisation of TANGO1 to an ERES, as a site of appropriately shaped membrane. We show that deleting the IM helix has little effect on targeting TANGO1 to an ERES, discard this proposal, and move to another possibility in the next section. We have altered the text to make this explanation clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is a concern regarding how the images of Figure 3—figure supplement 1 support the conclusion that TANGO1 and TANGO1ΔIM form small, discrete puncta, while TANGO1ΔTM does not.</p></disp-quote><p>The key observations we made in this section are that TANGO1 proteins lacking either the IM or TM helices behave slightly differently, but both are still targeted to ERES and collagen accumulations. We have changed the text to clarify that these are controls to show the TANGO1 proteins we express retain some of their functions and are not entirely dysfunctional</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The protein concentrations for the two constructs in the GUVs need to be shown equivalent after GUV formation (GFP intensity should suffice).</p></disp-quote><p>As described above (point 1), we quantified GFP expression in the GUVs and show that the different conditions have similar levels of protein incorporated into GUVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The conclusion &quot;The two membrane helices together are not required to target TANGO1 to ERES&quot; is confusing because the authors show the ∆TM construct is not localized to ERES. This construct contains the PRD and uses IM as a cryptic transmembrane domain and yet it is mislocalized. This seems to argue that both membrane domains are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>See point 6 above, we have changed the text and title of the section to clarify our statements and avoid confusion. The model proposed is that the two helices act as a membrane-shape sensor of sorts. In this section, we asked whether the shape-sensitivity (provided by the two helices <italic>together</italic>) contributed to targeting TANGO1 to an appropriate site, such as an ERES, based on membrane shape/curvature. Deleting the IM helix would abrogate the membrane-shape sensitivity, yet it had no discernible effect on targeting TANGO1 to an ERES. Therefore, we conclude the membrane-shape sensor is not a major determinant of TANGO1 localisation to an ERES.</p></body></sub-article></article>
