assisted by conserved basal transcription factors. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIE consists of α and β subunits. Here we have identified and characterised the function of the TFIIEβ homologue in archaea that on the primary sequence level is related to the RNAPIII subunit hRPC39. Both archaeal TFEβ and hRPC39 harbour a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster, which is crucial for heterodimerization of TFEα/β and its engagement with the RNAP clamp. TFEα/β stabilises the preinitiation complex, enhances DNA melting, and stimulates abortive and productive transcription. These activities are strictly dependent on the β subunit and the promoter sequence. Our results suggest that archaeal TFEα/β is likely to represent the evolutionary ancestor of TFIIE-like factors in extant eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life on Earth is often categorized into three domains: the eukaryotes (which include plants, animals and fungi), the bacteria and a group of unusual, single-celled microorganisms called the archaea. But several recent discoveries suggest that the origin of the eukaryotes lies within the archaeal domain. The genetic material of all of these living organisms is made up of DNA, and genes within DNA contain the instructions to make other biological molecules. Making these molecules involves first copying these instructions into a molecule of RNA via a process called transcription.</p><p>All three domains of life use enzymes called RNA polymerases (RNAPs) for transcription, and all RNAPs are thought to have originated from a common ancestor. Archaea and bacteria have a single type of RNAP, whereas all eukaryotes have at least four different kinds of RNAP. The RNAPs found in archaea share many common features with their eukaryotic counterparts. In both cases, the RNAPs do not work alone. Instead, a class of proteins known as transcription factors assist in the first step of the transcription process. One of the eukarotyic RNAPs, termed RNAP II, works with a transcription factor that contains two protein subunits (called TFIIEα and TFIIEβ). While the archaeal counterpart for TFIIEα (called TFEα) is known, the counterpart for TFIIEβ is not.</p><p>Blombach et al. have now identified the archaeal counterpart of TFIIEβ in a species of archaea called <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> and have renamed it TFEβ<italic>. Sulfolobus</italic> cells are unable to survive without this protein, which works in a similar way to TFIIEβ in assisting the RNAP to start transcription. Further analyses show that the TFEβ protein is actually related to a protein subunit that is unique to RNAP III, another eukarotyic RNAP. Both of these proteins contain clusters of iron and sulphur. Blombach et al. also found that these iron-sulphur clusters enable TFEβ to bind to its TFEα partner to form a transcription factor that can interact with the RNAP and help it to carry out transcription.</p><p>These results suggest that the TFEα/β transcription factor found in archaea is likely to resemble the ancestor of the TFIIE transcription factors found in living eukaryotes. This discovery provides new insights in the evolutionary history of both the archaeal and the eukaryotic transcription machineries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>TFE</kwd><kwd>TFIIE</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>079351/Z/06/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>Finn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship DFG BL 1189/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blombach</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>intramural fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reimann</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><name><surname>Albers</surname><given-names>Sonja V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H019332/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>Finn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An archaeal basal transcription factor containing an iron-sulphur cluster sheds light on the evolution of transcription machineries in archaea and eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The conserved core of the archaeal and eukaryotic transcription machineries encompasses a highly complex multisubunit RNAP as well as evolutionary conserved transcription factors that govern its activities through the transcription cycle. The minimal requirements for promoter-directed and start site-specific transcription are identical for the RNAPII system in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</xref>) and the RNAP of archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hausner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qureshi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Werner and Weinzierl, 2002</xref>). Two basal transcription factors, TBP (<underline>T</underline>ATA-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>rotein) and TFB (TFIIB in eukaryotes), are necessary and sufficient to initiate transcription in archaea in vitro. TBP and TFB facilitate promoter recognition and the recruitment of RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Werner and Grohmann, 2011</xref>). In archaea as well as eukaryotes a third factor TFE (TFIIE) enhances the next step in initiation, the transition of the closed to the open complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holstege et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Werner and Weinzierl, 2005</xref>). Eukaryotic TFIIE is a heterodimer composed of subunits TFIIEα and TFIIEβ in humans (Tfa1 and 2 in yeast). Archaeal TFE (hereafter referred to as TFEα) is monomeric and homologous to TFIIEα, but lacks its C-terminal acidic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanzelka et al., 2001</xref>). To date no archaeal homologue of TFIIEβ has been identified. During open complex formation the DNA strands are separated (melted) and the template strand is loaded into the active centre of RNAP. Similar to TFIIE, TFEα facilitates open complex formation by directly interacting with the non-template DNA strand (NTS), and via an allosteric mechanism that is likely to involve structural changes in the RNAP clamp and stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grohmann et al., 2011</xref>). While in archaea the closed-to-open complex transition occurs spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Werner and Weinzierl, 2002</xref>), on most eukaryotic RNAPII promoters it is dependent on the translocase activity of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman and Lis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fishburn et al., 2015</xref>). However, the dependency on TFIIH changes with DNA template topology. Strand separation and subsequent initiation from linear DNA templates strictly depends on TFIIH, but for some promoters this requirement can be overcome by using negatively supercoiled DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</xref>). Under these conditions DNA melting is weakly stimulated by TFIIE, an effect that is obscured by the strong melting activity of TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holstege et al., 1995</xref>). Since TFIIH is not strictly essential for RNAPII initiation per se, similar molecular mechanisms are likely to operate during open complex formation of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs. The archaeal model systems provide a distinct advantage in this respect allowing us to study how TFIIE/TFE facilitates DNA melting in the absence of a TFIIH-like factor.</p><p>Archaea, like bacteria, utilise one type of RNAP to execute their genetic programmes, while the transcription space of eukaryotes is partitioned into distinct and non-overlapping subsets of genes that are transcribed by 3 and 5 specialised types of RNAPs in animals and plants, respectively. The common past of all types of nuclear eukaryotic RNAP systems is reflected in the sequence, structure and function of RNAP subunits and associated basal transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>). TFIIE is a prominent example of this relationship. The human RNAPIII subunits hRPC62/39 (C82/34 in yeast) are positioned at the periphery of RNAPIII nearly identical to the binding site of TFIIE on RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>). TFEα, TFIIEα and hRPC62 contain homologous winged helix (WH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter and Drouin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefèvre et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TFIIEβ and hRPC39 both contain tandem WH domains suggesting their paralogous nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>), although no significant sequence homology was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter and Drouin, 2010</xref>). The origin and evolution of these factors and their role in the multiplication of parallel transcription systems in eukaryotes has remained elusive.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08378.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of a dimeric TFE factor in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conserved and acquired domains of TFIIEα and TFIIEβ-related proteins in Eukaryotes and Archaea derived from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blombach et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</xref>).

To identify interaction partners of Sso0944 we expressed His-tagged Sso0944 in <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> M16 and probed the presence of co-purifying components of the basal transcription apparatus following metal-affinity chromatography by immunodetection. While we found no evidence that the RNAP, TBP or TFB1 co-purified with Sso0944, TFEα co-eluted with Sso0944, indicating that TFEα and Sso0944 are associated in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sypro Ruby-stained SDS-PAGE of the affinity-purified material demonstrates that the polypeptides form a dimeric complex, that is, their association is not dependent on additional factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the affinity tag of Sso0944 prevented its stable association with the RNAP we fractionated a wild type <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> P2 cell lysate by size exclusion chromatography and analysed the fractions using immunodetection. The elution profile of endogenous Sso0944 overlapped with that of TFEα consistent with a heterodimeric TFEα/Sso0944 complex of 36.1 kDa.

Concentrated recombinant TFEα/β has a dark brown colour and its absorption spectrum displays a shoulder at 410 nm that is characteristic for iron-sulphur cluster harbouring proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to define the origin of this absorption more precisely we recorded continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) spectra. The profile of the cw-EPR spectrum with a g-value of 2.01, its sensitivity to the reducing agent sodium dithionite and the sharp decrease in signal at temperatures above 20 K are consistent with a signal corresponding to a cubane [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Double integration and comparison with a spin standard indicate a low cluster-occupancy of approximately 4%, which is in contrast to the strong 410 nm signal in the absorption spectrum. It is common that before reduction aerobically prepared proteins containing [4Fe-4S] clusters display a [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> signal due to oxidative impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beinert et al., 1996</xref>). Addition of a reducing agent often results in the disappearance of the signal of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster concomitant with the appearance of the signal from the intact [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster. Here, however, only the former effect is observed: [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> clusters may not be reduced—and remain EPR-silent—if the redox potential is lower than that of the reducing agent (dithionite), or if the rate of reduction is too slow. Alternatively the reduced [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster could be present in a high spin state, which could give rise to a signal too broad to be detected. To investigate the presence of an EPR-silent [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster, we recorded native mass spectra (MS) of TFEα/β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The spectrum contained two major species one with a mass of 21,236.6 Da and the other with a mass of 36,530.8 Da. The former corresponds to the expected mass for TFEα with a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion bound by its zinc ribbon (ZR) domain while the later corresponds to the mass of the TFEα/β harbouring a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion and a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster. Given that the TFEα ZR harbours a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion, the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster must be coordinated by the four cysteines in the C-terminal domain of TFEβ. As this domain is highly conserved in human hRPC39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), we examined the human protein for the presence of an equivalent FeS cluster. Similar to archaeal TFEβ, the human hRPC62/C39 complex shows an absorption spectrum with a shoulder at 410 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); its cw-EPR signature is characteristic for a [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster with low occupancy (&lt;3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The input fractions show that all mutant variants were expressed in a soluble and heat-stable form with the exception of TFEβ Δ1–84.

Furthermore, oxidation with ferricyanide oxidation causes destruction of the TFEβ cluster (data not shown). This difference between the two FeS clusters in <italic>Sso</italic> RNAP and TFEβ likely reflects different functions. The FeS cluster in the catalytic subunit of yeast DNA Polymerase Pol δ is essential for the interaction with its two auxiliary subunits Pol31 and Pol32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Netz et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the FeS cluster is required for TFEα/β dimerization and cluster damage results in its dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our results demonstrate that steady-state levels of TFEβ are depleted in the stationary phase—the FeS cluster in TFEα/β may provide a handle for fast inactivation of TFEα/β during stress response.

Our permanganate footprinting experiments suggest that TFEα/β, and not TFEα, triggers DNA melting creating a bubble ranging in its extremes from position +4 to −12 position relative to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). TFEα/β, but not TFEα, stimulates the formation of the first phosphodiester bond in an abortive transcription assay as well as productive transcription.

In contrast, in experiments monitoring PIC formation using EMSA that relies to a greater extent on complex stability (as the complexes have to remain intact during electrophoresis), deletion of either TFEα ZR or TFEβ WH strongly reduces PIC stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, stable interaction with the RNAP clamp depends on the TFEα ZR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

While hRPC39 as part of RNAPIII plays a role in the specific recruitment of RNAPIII to its noncoding RNA gene promoters, the hRPC39-like archaeal TFEβ clearly acts as a general transcription initiation factor stimulating transcription from all promoters tested. Our results show that the steady state levels of TFEβ are drastically reduced in stationary phase compared to exponential growth phase, in contrast to other components of the basal <italic>Sso</italic> transcription apparatus. TFEα/β stimulates transcription of different genes to varying extent, dependent on the sequence of the initiatlly melted region within the promoter.

We do not provide direct evidence for a regulatory role of TFEα/β, however, our results suggest that TFEβ has the potential to reprogram transcription in response to different growth phases.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe an archaeal TFIIE β homolog. Using the Sso protein, they show convincingly that it specifically dimerizes with TFEα. They show the Sso0944/TFEβ gene is essential for viability. They demonstrate that the β subunit, like the Pol III subunit RPC39, contains a 4Fe-4S domain. Mutagenesis and functional assays show that the FeS domain is important for dimerization of the α-β subunits. Finally, they demonstrate that the TFEα/β factor stimulates PIC stability, enhances DNA melting from a slightly pre melted promoter and stimulates transcription initiation. They conclude with an interesting speculation on the evolutionary history of TFE/TFIIE in LUCA, archaea and eukaryotes. These are important findings as they tie together the function of the archaeal and eukaryotic factors. Conceptually, these findings advance our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between transcription systems. The authors provide a clear and comprehensive description of a wide variety of experimental methods used in this study. This manuscript is of high quality and well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after successful revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors say that TFEβ has the potential to regulate transcription but they do not provide clear evidence for this. Please clarify or tone down statements.</p><p>2) Some of the pulldown assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref> are confusing as the eluate sometimes contains a subunit marked as one of the TFE subunits that is not visible in the input protein. Please revise text or legends to make clear what is going on here.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> panel D a minimal TFEα/β assembly is shown after Ni affinity purification with a His-tagged b-subunit. However, the complex shown has much more of the a-subunit present. How can that be? This must be clarified.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> it is seen that some of the mutant TFEβ variants have a much higher absorption at 260 nm compared to 280 nm.

Please clarify or tone down statements</italic>.</p><p>We do not provide direct evidence for regulation. Our data support the ‘potential’ of TFE to regulate transcription on a global scale. We have removed the strong statement from the Abstract. We have clarified and discussed the ‘potential’ of TFE to regulate transcription in a very careful and considered manner in the Discussion section: “…TFEα/β stimulates transcription of different genes to varying extent, dependent on the sequence of the initially melted region within the promoter. Thus, promoters that are strongly stimulated by TFEα/β could be downregulated in stationary phase, while expression of TFEα/β unresponsive (or only mildly stimulated) promoters would be less affected. We do not provide direct evidence for a regulatory role of TFEα/β, however, our results suggest that TFEβ has the potential to reprogram transcription in response to different growth phases.”</p><p><italic>2) Some of the pulldown assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B, C</italic></xref> <italic>are confusing as the eluate sometimes contains a subunit marked as one of the TFE subunits that is not visible in the input protein. Please revise text or legends to make clear what is going on here</italic>.</p><p>The affinity column eluate fractions can contain tagged (as well as co-purifying) proteins at higher levels compared to the IP fraction since any efficient purification represents an enrichment. Overall, the heterologous expression of TFEα/β in <italic>E. coli</italic> results in higher TFEα levels compared to TFEβ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> ‘wt’ input versus eluate), and some of the TFEβ mutants are expressed at lower levels compared to wt TFEβ. This makes some of the TFE β variants difficult to discern in the input fraction, but since the co-purification strategy relies on tagged TFEβ, it is always present—and enriched—in the elution fractions. Slight variations of the apparent mobility of proteins are due to independent electrophoresis experiments collated in panel b. We systematically introduced red and blue triangles to identify the TFEα and β bands, respectively, and modified the figure legend as follows to clarify.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>panel D a minimal TFEα/β assembly is shown after Ni affinity purification with a His-tagged b-subunit. However, the complex shown has much more of the a-subunit present. How can that be? This must be clarified</italic>.</p><p>The minimal TFEβ variant is very small (52 amino acids) and stains very poorly using Coomassie Blue as compared to TFEα (comprised of 114 amino acids). Since the complex was purified via the TFEβ his-tag the complex is stoichiometric despite the un-equivalent staining.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>it is seen that some of the mutant TFEβ variants have a much higher absorption at 260 nm compared to 280 nm. This indicates contamination with nucleic acids. How could this influence the experiments?</italic></p><p>The higher absorption at 260 nm relative to 280 nm in the 92S, 95S and 112S mutant variants (compared to wt nor 101S) is due to low levels of contaminants eluting slightly earlier than TFEα/β, and, as the reviewers indicate, possibly due to nucleic acids. The reasons that the contaminants’ contribution is higher in mutant than wt factors is simply due to the fact that their expression levels are considerably <underline>lower</underline>. In order to clarify this detail and allow a direct comparison, we have re-scaled the absorption y-axis of all elution profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to the same maximum (1,200 mU). In addition, we would like to emphasize that in all TFEα/β preparations (wt and mutant variants) the early fractions of the elution peak from the IMAC purification containing potential nucleic acid contaminants were discarded. IMAC purified TFEα/β preparations that were additionally purified via heparin-affinity chromatography were indistinguishable in all activity assays. As some of the mutant TFEα/β variants did not bind to heparin-sepharose, this purification step was omitted in experiments where mutant and wt TFEα/β were compared.</p><p><italic>5) The authors showed that deletions of the TFEα ZR removes binding to the clamp and a deletion of the TFEβ WH weakens PIC formation.

However, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>there might be actually less stimulation by these mutants. Please clarify</italic>.</p><p>In the complex formed between TFE and the recombinant RNAP clamp the latter is a minimal binding site. In this minimal complex the deletion of the TFEα ZR weakens the binding considerably. In contrast, in the DNA melting experiments a much larger interaction surface for TFE is presented—the entire RNAP—and in this context the ZR deletion has no phenotype presumably because additional contacts compensate for the weakened interaction. Robust EMSA signals require stable PICs because all components of the complex have to remain associated throughout the entire electrophoresis. EMSAs are nonequilibrium experiments, when PICs dissociate they will give rise to ‘fuzzy’ band shifts, or disappear altogether. This implies that EMSAs are very sensitive and ideally suited to test weakening effects of mutations, in this case TFE mutations such as the TFEβ WH deletion. This mutant, as well as the TFEα ZR deletion, barely stimulates PIC stability compared to the wt factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The permanganate foot printing experiments have a completely different ‘window of opportunity’; as soon as the DNA strands are separated non-basepaired T-residues are modified (and subsequently cleaved). This in turn implies that the method is less sensitive to the effect of attenuated mutant variants, as our experiments demonstrate TFEα/β, α ΔZR/β, and α/β ΔWH all stimulate permanganate reactivity to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>, it is not obvious from my copy that TFE is stimulating abortive initiation (lanes 9,10).

To clarify this activity we have included the magnitude of the stimulation (2.3±0.5 and 1.6±0.1, respectively) in the manuscript text: “TFEα/β stimulates abortive transcription activity on closed promoter templates (2.3 ± 0.5 fold) as well as pre-opened (1.6 ± 0.1 fold) templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) while no stimulation was observed with TFEα (data not shown).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
