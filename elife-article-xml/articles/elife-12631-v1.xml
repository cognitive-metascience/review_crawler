chloroplasts (TOC). Toc75 is a member of the Omp85 family of bacterial and organellar membrane insertases, characterized by N-terminal POTRA (polypeptide-transport associated) domains and C-terminal membrane-integrated β-barrels. We demonstrate that the Toc75 POTRA domains are essential for protein import and contribute to interactions with TOC receptors, thereby coupling preprotein recognition at the chloroplast surface with membrane translocation. The POTRA domains also interact with preproteins and mediate the recruitment of molecular chaperones in the intermembrane space to facilitate membrane transport. Our studies are consistent with the multi-functional roles of POTRA domains observed in other Omp85 family members and demonstrate that the domains of Toc75 have evolved unique properties specific to the acquisition of protein import during endosymbiotic evolution of the TOC system in plastids.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12631.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12631.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12631.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chloroplasts are a hallmark feature of plant cells and the sites of photosynthesis – the process in which plants harness the energy in sunlight for their own needs. The first chloroplasts arose when a photosynthetic bacterium was engulfed by another host cell, and most of the original bacterial genes have been transferred to the host cell’s nucleus during the evolution of land plants. As a result, modern chloroplasts need to import the thousands of proteins encoded by these genes from the rest of the cell.</p><p>The chloroplast protein import system relies on a protein transporter in the chloroplast membrane that evolved from a family of bacterial transporters. However, the bacterial transporters were initially involved in protein export, and it was not known how the activity of these transporters adapted to move proteins in the opposite direction.</p><p>Paila et al. set out to better understand the chloroplast protein import system and produced mutated forms of the transporter in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. These experiments revealed that a part of the transporter that is conserved in many other organisms, the “protein transport associated domains”, has been adapted for three key roles in protein import. First, this part of the transporter interacts with the other components of the import system that make the transporter more selective and control which direction the proteins are transported. Second, the domains interact with proteins during transport to help move them across the chloroplast membrane. Finally, the domains recruit other molecules called chaperones, which stop the protein from aggregating or misfolding during the transport process. These activities are similar to those for the bacterial export transporters, but clearly evolved to allow transport in the opposite direction – that is, to import proteins into chloroplasts.</p><p>The next challenges are to explain how proteins destined for chloroplasts are recognized and transported through the chloroplast’s membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12631.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12631.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>protein import</kwd><kwd>β-barrel</kwd><kwd>import channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2RO1-GM061893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnell</surname><given-names>Danny J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1050602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Kentaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Lynn GL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conserved polypeptide transport associated (POTRA) domains of the protein import channel, Toc75, are essential for protein import into chloroplasts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biogenesis and function of plastids are reliant on the coordinate expression and selective import of &gt;2500 different nucleus-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ling and Jarvis, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Theg, 2013</xref>). The major pathway for protein import involves the synchronized action of two multi-protein membrane translocons, the TOC (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) and the TIC (translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), which reside within the chloroplast envelope. TOC and TIC complexes contain selective protein conducting channels, which align via physical association between the complexes to provide simultaneous membrane translocation of preproteins from the cytoplasm to the plastid interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Theg, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ling and Jarvis, 2015</xref>). The selectivity and directionality of protein import is controlled by sequential interactions between the targeting determinants within the cleavable, N-terminal transit peptides of preproteins and binding sites within the TOC and TIC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li and Teng, 2013</xref>), as well as import-associated molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flores-Pérez and Jarvis, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwenkert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of the TOC and TIC system during endosymbiosis required the adaptation or acquisition of protein conducting channels, receptors and molecular chaperones at both envelope membranes to provide a unidirectional conduit for the transport of nuclear encoded polypeptides into the organelle. Protein transport across the outer envelope membrane is mediated by a β-barrel membrane protein, Toc75, which is proposed to constitute the major component of the TOC import channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinnah et al., 2002</xref>). Toc75 assembles with two integral membrane receptor GTPases, Toc159 and Toc34, which recognize plastid preproteins in the cytoplasm and control access of preproteins to the Toc75 channel via their intrinsic GTPase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kessler and Schnell, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler and Schnell, 2004</xref>). In addition to its role as the TOC channel, Toc75 is proposed to participate in the targeting and insertion of membrane-anchored outer membrane proteins, including the TOC GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wallas et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Toc75 is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis (<italic>TOC75-III, AT3G46740</italic>) and null mutants are embryo lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jackson-Constan and Keegstra, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hust and Gutensohn, 2006</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>TOC75-III</italic> expression by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2011</xref>) and a hypomorphic <italic>toc75-III</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stanga et al., 2009</xref>) both result in pale phenotypes and growth defects, consistent with the role of Toc75 in chloroplast biogenesis. Based on these studies, Toc75 appears to have evolved to perform multiple functions in protein import, in the assembly of TOC complexes, and in the biogenesis of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Toc75 belongs to the outer membrane protein of 85 kDa (Omp85) superfamily of β-barrel integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu and Inoue, 2009</xref>). Omp85 proteins are exclusively localized to the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inoue and Potter, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schleiff et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Voulhoux and Tommassen, 2004</xref>), and perform major roles in protein transport and the insertion and assembly of outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Voulhoux and Tommassen, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schleiff et al., 2011</xref>). For example, BamA (β-barrel Assembly Machinery protein A) and Sam50 (Sorting and Assembly Machinery 50 kDa), two members of the Omp85 family, function in outer membrane biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria and mitochondria, respectively, by facilitating the folding and insertion of β-barrel proteins at the outer membrane from the periplasmic or intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voulhoux et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schleiff and Soll, 2005</xref>). The structural similarity of Toc75 to these conserved membrane transporters led to the hypothesis that Toc75 evolved from an ancestral Omp85 gene and was adapted during endosymbiosis of the cyanobacterial ancestor to function as the protein import channel in the plastid outer envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Topel et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bredemeier et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gentle et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Toc75 exhibits two main structural features characteristic of Omp85 superfamily members. The N-terminal ~30 kDa region of Toc75 contains three repeats of POTRA (polypeptide-transport associated) domains, each characterized by a β<sub>1</sub>α<sub>1</sub>α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>β<sub>3</sub> secondary structural motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clantin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>). The ~45 kDa C-terminal region is predicted to contain 16 membrane-spanning β-strands and constitute the membrane-integrated β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day et al., 2014</xref>). While there is significant evidence that the C-terminal β-barrel domain of Toc75 acts as a component of the translocon channel for protein translocation at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinnah et al., 1997</xref>), the functions of the N-terminal POTRA domains have not been clearly defined.</p><p>In the case of BamA, specific POTRA repeats are indispensable for the insertion of β-barrel proteins at the <italic>E. coli</italic> outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning et al., 2013</xref>). The POTRA domains of BamA extend into the periplasm, where they interact with other components of the BAM complex (Bam B-E), a major periplasmic chaperone, SurA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>), and nascent outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noinaj et al., 2015</xref>). Structural studies of BamA also suggest that specific POTRA repeats interact with the C-terminal domain to act as a possible gate to the membrane channel of the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noinaj et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>). In another example, deletion of a major portion of the POTRA domain of Sam50 in yeast mitochondria inhibits growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Habib et al., 2007</xref>), and subsequent studies provided evidence that the domain interacts with β-barrel precursors to promote their release from the SAM complex and insertion in the outer membrane from the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>). The studies of BamA and Sam50 are consistent with models in which the POTRA repeats are assembled into multi-functional cassettes to mediate protein-protein interactions required for the assembly and specific targeting function of the membrane biogenesis machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between Toc75 and other Omp85 superfamily members raises interesting evolutionary and mechanistic questions of how the structural and functional features of the conserved POTRA and β-barrel domains of Toc75 have adapted during endosymbiosis to constitute the protein import channel. Structural and electrophysiological studies of Toc75 demonstrate that the protein forms a cation-selective channel with a pore size sufficient to transport unfolded polypeptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinnah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2002</xref>). In vitro pull-down experiments with recombinant POTRA domains of Toc75 suggest that they can interact with the TOC GTPases and chloroplast preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ertel et al., 2005</xref>). This has led to the proposal that they function in TOC complex assembly, interactions with the TOC GTPases, preprotein recognition, or to provide a chaperone-like activity for the preprotein during membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sánchez-Pulido et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ertel et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we combine molecular genetic and biochemical analyses to examine the roles of the POTRA domains in protein import and membrane targeting in chloroplasts. We demonstrate that POTRA domains contribute essential functions to the Toc75 channel. Furthermore, expression of Toc75 lacking one or more of the three POTRA repeats leads to dominant negative phenotypes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Expression of specific deletion mutants alters the size and distribution of the TOC complexes and disrupts preprotein import into the organelle. Biochemical analyses indicate that the Toc75 POTRAs interact specifically with chloroplast preproteins and two proposed chaperones of the intermembrane space, Tic22-III and Tic22-IV. Our results demonstrate multiple roles for the POTRAs in protein import, including TOC complex assembly, preprotein translocation and the recruitment of chaperones to facilitate transport across the intermembrane space.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>POTRA domains are required for Toc75 function</title><p>To investigate the role of POTRA domains in the function of Toc75, we introduced a series of in-frame internal deletion mutations in a <italic>TOC75-III</italic> genomic construct to encode proteins lacking one (Toc75ΔP1), two (Toc75ΔP1-2) or all three (Toc75ΔP1-3) predicted POTRA domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and tested their ability to complement the lethal phenotype of the <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> null mutant.

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin et al., 2005</xref>) under normal growth conditions, implying that one copy of <italic>TOC75-III</italic> is sufficient for chloroplast function. Although most plants transformed with the Toc75 POTRA-deletion constructs (e.g. <italic>TOC75ΔP1#1, TOC75ΔP1-2#1</italic> or TOC75ΔP1-3#1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1B</xref>) were phenotypically indistinguishable from <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> plants (data not shown), several transformed lines (<italic>TOC75ΔP1#2, TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> or <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3#2</italic>) showed progressively increased pale phenotypes and reduced growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The chlorophyll levels in <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2 and TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> plants were reduced by 26% and 62%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3#2</italic> plants were nearly albino and exhibited severe growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the hygromycin resistance marker in progeny of the <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2, TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3#2</italic> lines segregated at a ratio significantly lower than the expected 2:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1C</xref>). These data suggest that expression of Toc75ΔP1, Toc75ΔP1-2 or Toc75ΔP1-3 proteins in these lines competed with the normal function of native Toc75, expressed from the single wild-type allele in the <italic>toc75-III-1</italic>(<italic>+</italic>/-background, resulting in disruption of the import apparatus and a consequent impact on plant growth and viability.</p><p>The differences in the segregation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in the <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2, TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3#2</italic> plants compared to <italic>TOC75ΔP1#1, TOC75ΔP1-2#1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3#1</italic> plants, suggested that the levels of Toc75ΔP1, Toc75ΔP1-2 or Toc75ΔP1-3 in these lines varied. To further examine the nature of the aberrant segregation, we focused on <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2, TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> lines. We were unable to pursue further characterization of <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3</italic> because of the severe phenotype in lines expressing this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We compared the expression levels of Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2 in lines showing normal 2:1 hygromycin resistance segregation (<italic>TOC75ΔP1#1 and TOC75ΔP1-2#1</italic>) and those showing aberrant segregation (<italic>TOC75ΔP1#2 and TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1B and C</xref>). <italic>TOC75ΔP1#1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#1</italic> plants were nearly indistinguishable from heterozygous <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> plants, whereas <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> plants showed a lower germination rate and significant growth defects when grown on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and immunoblotting of extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) from seedlings of these lines indicated that the expression of the Toc75 POTRA deletion was higher in <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> plants compared to <italic>TOC75ΔP1#1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#1.</italic> The examination of additional transformants confirmed that the severity of defects in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – supplement 1</xref>) and germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 - supplement 1A and B</xref>) correlated with the levels of Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – supplement 1C</xref>). Although we did not examine the reasons for the differences in expression between the lines, the location of transgene insertion in the Arabidopsis genome could account for the variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelvin and Kim, 2007</xref>). These data indicate that increased expression of the POTRA deletions induces significant phenotypic defects, consistent with a dominant-negative effect on native Toc75 function in the <italic>toc75-III-1</italic>(<italic>+</italic>/-) background. Consistent with this observation, the levels of Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2 mRNA in <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> or <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> plants were 3.5–4.5 times higher than those of native Toc75 mRNA, whereas the Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2 protein levels were significantly lower than native Toc75. This suggests that expression of <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> is tightly controlled post-transcriptionally or by proteolytic degradation of Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2, most likely in response to the negative impact of the POTRA deletions on chloroplast function.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12631.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dominant negative phenotypes exhibited by plants expressing Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phenotypes of wild type, <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> (+/-) and <italic>TOC75</italic> plants compared to plants expressing lower (<italic>TOC75ΔP1#1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#1</italic>) or higher (<italic>TOC75ΔP1#2 and TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic>) levels of Toc75ΔP1 and Toc75ΔP1-2, respectively.

In the presence of 0.1 mM ATP, preproteins are promoted to a higher affinity intermediate, which is inserted across the outer membrane and represents the initial translocation of preprotein across the envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzpatrick and Keegstra, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inaba and Schnell, 2008</xref>). The distinction between energy-independent binding and the formation of the higher affinity intermediate is apparent by an increase in the levels of preprotein that stably associates with chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</xref>).

We were unable to examine Toc75ΔP1-2 due to relatively low levels of expression of this construct in transgenic plants and the consequent inability to reliably detect proteolytic fragments from the deletion construct. To facilitate our studies, we expressed Toc75 and Toc75ΔP1 containing a myc epitope inserted just upstream of the POTRA domains at the N-terminus of the mature proteins in <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that Toc75 is resistant to low-to-moderate levels of thermolysin, whereas trypsin generates several proteolytic fragments, including peptides corresponding to the N-terminal POTRA deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tranel and Keegstra, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inoue and Potter, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sveshnikova et al., 2000</xref>). As controls for protease activity, we examined the sensitivity of Toc33 and Tic110 to the protease treatments. Toc33 is anchored in the outer membrane, with a short C-terminal transmembrane helix and the bulk of the protein is exposed to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>), and Tic110 is anchored to the inner membrane, with the bulk of the protein extending into the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>). As predicted, Toc33 is digested by both trypsin and thermolysin, with complete degradation of the cytoplasmic domain observed at 200 μg/ml trypsin and 100 μg/ml thermolysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> i).

Reduction in full length Toc75<sub>myc</sub> (75 kDa) is concomitant with the appearance of a ~55 kDa protease-resistant fragment, which reacts with anti-POTRA and anti-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> ii, band a). Disruption of the membrane with triton X-100 results in complete degradation of Toc75, indicating that the protected fragment observed in intact chloroplasts is not intrinsically resistant to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> ii). Treatment of chloroplasts from <italic>TOC75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub></italic> plants with trypsin resulted in the degradation of both the 75 kDa Toc75 and the 68 kDa Toc75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> iii), and generated two anti-POTRA reactive proteolytic fragments of ~55 kDa and ~46 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> iii, bands a and b). The difference in the size of the two anti-POTRA reactive fragments corresponds to the difference in size between native Toc75 and Toc75ΔP1 (8.6 KDa). The ~46 kDa fragment reacted with anti-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> iii, band b), confirming its identity as an N-terminal fragment containing the Toc75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub> POTRA domain fragment. These data demonstrate that the peptides are generated from the N-terminal region of Toc75 and Toc75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub>, respectively, and confirm that Toc75ΔP1 has the same topology as native Toc75 in the outer envelope membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Protein import components accumulate to higher levels in plants expressing POTRA deletions</title><p>Toc75 is implicated in the insertion of Toc33 and Toc159 into the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>), and it participates in the initial stages of targeting of TIC components to the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Theg, 2013</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> i, Toc33, Toc75 and Toc159 from <italic>TOC75</italic> chloroplasts co-migrated in complexes, which peaked at ~1.3 MDa (region a). A second complex, with a peak at ~440 kDa (region b) migrated between 400 and 880 kDa and contained Toc75 and Toc33, but lacked detectable levels of Toc159. The presence of the ~1.3 MDa and ~440 kDa complexes is consistent with the 800–1000 kDa and 300–450 kDa TOC complexes previously reported from pea chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kikuchi et al., 2006</xref>) on 2D blue-native gels. The minor differences in the mobilities of the TOC complexes reported here and in the previous study are likely due to differences in the sizes of TOC components in Arabidopsis versus pea chloroplasts. Both 1.3 MDa and 440 kDa complexes containing native Toc75, Toc33 and Toc159 were also observed in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Toc75ΔP1 is detected in both 1.3 MDa and 440 kDa complexes in chloroplasts from <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> ii), suggesting that Toc75ΔP1 assembles with the core TOC GTPase receptors. By contrast, Toc75ΔP1-2 was absent from the 1.3 MDa complexes and present only in complexes with a mobility similar or smaller than the 440 kDa complexes in <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> iii). In conjunction with the observation that Toc75ΔP1-2 co-immunoprecipitates with Toc33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), the results from 2D blue-native gels suggest that Toc75ΔP1-2 is able to interact with Toc33 but is unable to assemble into the 1.3 MDa complexes containing all three core TOC components.</p><p>Interestingly, the levels of Toc33 migrating at a low molecular weight (~70 kDa peak) were increased significantly in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 chloroplasts compared to <italic>TOC75</italic> chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, region c). Neither Toc75, the Toc75 POTRA deletions or Toc159 co-migrate with this form of Toc33, suggesting that a considerable proportion of Toc33 is not assembled into native TOC complexes in the <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 chloroplasts.

Previous work had demonstrated a potential interaction between the N-terminal POTRA domains of an Omp85 family member in the outer membrane of the cyanobacteria, <italic>Anabeana sp.

These observations led us to examine a possible physical interaction between Toc75 and Tic22 in the chloroplast intermembrane space. A protein fragment encompassing all three Toc75 POTRA domains and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (POTRA-His) was expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and tested for binding to Tic22-III and Tic22-IV. The recombinant POTRA-His was immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) matrix and incubated with in vitro–translated [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-III and [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-IV. Binding was measured as the fraction of [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-III and [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-IV that co-sedimented with the immobilized POTRA domains. Transit peptide-dependent binding of preSSU to Toc75 POTRAs has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ertel et al., 2005</xref>), and therefore, we used [<sup>35</sup>S]preSSU and [<sup>35</sup>S]SSU as positive and negative controls for binding, respectively.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-III, [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-IV and [<sup>35</sup>S]preSSU bound to immobilized POTRA-His in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum binding observed at 60%, 35% and 77% of added radiolabeled proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). None of the proteins exhibited significant binding to the Ni-NTA matrix alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 A</xref>, lanes 2 and 7), and &lt;10% of added [<sup>35</sup>S]SSU, the negative control, associated with the resin at the highest concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

POTRA domains are defined by repeats of conserved β<sub>1</sub>α<sub>1</sub>α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>β<sub>3</sub> secondary structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clantin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paila et al., 2015</xref>), and the variation in primary structure within the repeats contributes to the functional diversification and adaptation of family members for specific roles in the transport and insertion of nascent polypeptides at the outer membrane in bacteria and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis of Toc75 is consistent with a multifunctional cassette model for POTRA domains, and highlights the unique adaptation of the Toc75 POTRA domains to mediate interactions that are essential for assembly of the core TOC components and the transport of polypeptides across the outer membrane.</p><p>We took advantage of the observation that expression of Toc75ΔP1, Toc75ΔP1-2 and Toc75ΔP1-3 in the heterozygous <italic>toc75III-1</italic> background resulted in plants with pale phenotypes and significant growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The phenotypes were dependent on the expression levels of the deletion constructs, and severe effects were observed even at levels of Toc75ΔP1, Toc75ΔP1-2 and Toc75ΔP1-3 that were far less than equimolar to endogenous native Toc75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Given that TOC translocons are large multimeric complexes containing component ratios estimated at 4:4:1 or 3:3:1 (Toc75:Toc34:Toc159), the insertion of defective POTRA deletion subunits into these complexes likely interferes with the coordinate functions of the native subunits.</p><p>Toc75ΔP1 and Toc75ΔP1-2 were targeted, integrated and fully processed at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), with their POTRA domains extending into the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which is consistent with the topology of native Toc75 and all other known Omp85 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>). This indicates that the POTRA domains do not play essential roles in targeting and membrane insertion of Toc75 itself. The orientation of the Toc75 POTRA domains in the intermembrane space also is consistent with the observation that they specifically interact with Tic22 isoforms, proteins localized to the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A separate study using N-terminal fusions of Toc75 to self-assembling split GFP (saGFP) concluded that the N-terminus of Toc75 was localized in the cytoplasm when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>). However, the saGFP-Toc75 constructs used in the study were not shown to complement the lethal phenotype of <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> mutants, and therefore, it is unclear if the fusions assumed a functional topology in the outer membrane.</p><p>Our studies of protein import into isolated chloroplasts from the <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants demonstrate that the POTRA deletions resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of protein import into chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis of saturation-binding experiments under low [ATP] and [GTP] revealed that the decrease in import was due to the reduction in the total number of functional import sites rather than a significant reduction in the affinity of TOC complexes for the preprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the levels of TOC components were unchanged or increased in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the decreased import capacity resulted from defective TOC function and not from decreases in the overall levels of the core TOC proteins.</p><p>Our data reveal an interesting function for the POTRA domains in TOC complex assembly that accounts, at least in part, for the decreased levels of functional TOC complexes observed in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 chloroplasts. Expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and 2D blue-native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) analyses revealed significant changes in the levels and assembly of the core TOC components, which likely results in a population of defective or non-functional translocons. Toc75ΔP1 appeared to retain the ability to assemble with both Toc33 and Toc159 GTPase receptors into 1.3 MDa and 440 kDa complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kikuchi et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that POTRA1 is not required for stoichiometric assembly of TOC complexes. However, Toc75ΔP1-2 was only detected in novel complexes that migrated between 200–880 kDa. A major fraction of Toc33, but not native Toc75 or Toc159, exhibited a coincident broad range of distribution with Toc75ΔP1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Together with the observation that Toc75ΔP1-2 co-immunoprecipitated with Toc33, this suggests that Toc75ΔP1-2 is able to associate normally with Toc33, but not Toc159, evidenced by the lack of Toc159 in the 200–880 kDa complexes in <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic> chloroplasts. This implicates POTRA-2 alone, or in combination with POTRA-1, in interactions between Toc75 and Toc159, which is a requirement for proper TOC complex assembly and function.</p><p>The role of Toc75 POTRAs in TOC assembly is reminiscent of the role of the five repeat POTRA domains of the BamA in the assembly of the BAM complex at the outer membrane. POTRA 5 of BamA interacts with the essential periplasmic lipoprotein, BamD, to form the core of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The core complex recruits BamC and E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht and Zeth, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), and POTRA 2–4 of BamA interact with BamB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim and Paetzel, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noinaj et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2012</xref>) to constitute the fully functional BAM complex. Despite the conservation of functional domains, Toc75 appears to be unique amongst Omp85 family members because it evolved to mediate protein import into plastids from the cytoplasm. The reversal of the transport activity relative to the bacterial and mitochondrial Omp85 family members occurred with the diversification of Toc75 from the cyanobacterial Omp85 ancestor and was driven by the association of Toc75 with the Toc33 and Toc159 receptors. Toc33 and Toc159 provide the GTP-dependent driving force for the unidirectional transport of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the organelle. The Toc33-Toc75-Toc159 core is a universal feature of the plant lineage, and the adaptation of POTRAs to facilitate these interactions was, therefore, a key event in the evolution of TOC complexes.</p><p>Our data also indicate that disruption of Toc75 function in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants perturbs the known coordinate expression of the TOC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sun et al. 2001</xref>), resulting in significant over-expression of Toc33 relative to Toc75 and Toc159. The major portion of the excess Toc33 migrated at ~70 kDa on blue-native PAGE of <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 chloroplasts and was not associated with the other TOC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The excess Toc33 could contribute to the phenotypes observed in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants if it interacted with preproteins and interfered with import. However, our quantitative binding data indicate that energy-independent and energy-dependent bindings are reduced in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), arguing against preprotein binding to excess Toc33 as a significant factor in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 phenotypes.</p><p>We also hypothesize that the Toc75 POTRA domains play a direct role in protein translocation across the outer membrane by selectively binding to chloroplast preproteins in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This proposal is consistent with our observation that the isolated POTRA domains interact with a chloroplast preprotein, preSSU, in a transit-peptide and dose-dependent manner, and previous data demonstrating an interaction between the N-terminal region of Toc75 and preproteins targeted to chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ertel et al., 2005</xref>). Several possibilities exist for the role of the POTRA-transit peptide interaction during protein import. Toc75 crosslinks to the transit peptides of preproteins during initial binding as well as during later stages of membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ma et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that the POTRA domains could contribute to</p><p>preprotein recognition in conjunction with the TOC GTPases and/or stabilize preprotein binding to the translocon upon initial translocation through the Toc75 membrane pore. The latter possibility appears to be most likely, considering the localization of the POTRA domains in the intermembrane space, and the observation that Toc75ΔP1 or Toc75ΔP1-2 did not impact energy-independent binding of preprotein to chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>The substrate-binding activity of POTRA domains has precedence in other Omp85 family members. The POTRA domain of BamA binds nascent β-barrel proteins as they emerge into the periplasmic space from the Sec translocon in the bacterial inner membrane, suggesting that the BamA POTRAs form a platform for the polypeptide substrate to assume the necessary secondary structure required to initiate membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gatzeva-Topalova et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knowles et al., 2008</xref>). POTRA-5, located most adjacent to the β-barrel, is proposed to play an essential role in assisting the insertion of the substrate into the membrane directly or in coordination with the β-barrel and the oligomeric BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sinnige et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>). The single POTRA of Sam50 β-barrel component of the mitochondrial SAM machinery also is proposed to assist in release of the β-barrel substrate into the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stroud et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent crystal structures of BamA showed two different orientations of its POTRA domains, leading to the proposal that the domains are involved in a gating mechanism for regulating access of the substrate to the the β-barrel membrane insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>). A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations of POTRA domains of OMP85 from <italic>Anabaena</italic> revealed a similar conserved feature in these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>), and mutations in the unique loop region of the POTRA domains adjacent to the β-barrel in the cyanobacterial protein influenced the pore properties of the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ertel et al., 2005</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that a similar gating mechanism might function at Toc75, thereby providing a mechanism by which transit peptide binding at TOC complexes controls the outer membrane channel by triggering reorientation of the POTRA domains.</p><p>Finally, we also demonstrate specific interactions of the Toc75 POTRA domains with two homologous import components of the intermembrane space, Tic22-III and Tic22-IV. Tic22 from pea was previously shown to covalently cross-link to preprotein import intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kouranov et al., 1998</xref>), and proteins with significant similarity to Tic22 from apicoplasts of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> have been shown to exhibit chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glaser et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, a Tic22-like protein from cyanobacteria was shown to covalently cross-link with an Omp85 family member of the cyanobacterial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tripp et al., 2012</xref>), providing a precedent for the interaction of Omp85 family members with the Tic22 family of putative chaperones, and its potential conservation from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont. This interaction is also reminiscent of the interaction between the BamA POTRAs and a periplasmic chaperone, SurA, during β-barrel insertion at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The significant increase in the levels of Tic22 isoforms in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 plants is consistent with a functional association between the Toc75 POTRA domains and the Tic22 chaperones and could represent a response to a disruption in chaperone-preprotein interactions during membrane translocation. To date, a chaperone activity for Tic22-III and Tic22-IV in plants has not been investigated, and it will be of great interest to understand how the Toc75 POTRA domains might coordinate interactions between preproteins and the putative chaperone to facilitate preprotein transit through the intermembrane space and engagement of the TIC complex.</p><p>Our analysis of Toc75 is consistent with models in which the POTRA domains play versatile roles in TOC assembly and function, which account for the decreased levels of functional TOC complexes seen in <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>#2 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>#2 chloroplasts. As is the case in other Omp85 family members, each domain is likely to contribute individual activities, but also work in association with the other domains to mediate assembly of the translocon complex and coordinate preprotein translocation. In contrast to bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes, chloroplasts contain two Omp85 family members: Toc75 and OEP80 (Outer Envelope Protein 80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu and Inoue, 2009</xref>). Similar to Toc75, OEP80 is essential in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patel et al., 2008</xref>) and is predicted to contain three N-terminal soluble POTRA domains and a C-terminal β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu and Inoue, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>). OEP80 is not detected in isolated oligomeric TOC complexes, and it has been proposed to function in β-barrel protein biogenesis in a manner analogous to Sam50 and BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckart et al., 2002</xref>). Although phylogenetic analyses indicated that Toc75 and OEP80 are more closely related to each other than either is to other bacterial Omp85 family members, distinct sequence signatures have been identified in both the POTRA and β-barrel domains of the chloroplast proteins to account for evolutionary divergence of these two β-barrel channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day et al., 2014</xref>). The evolution of an import apparatus to mediate the transport of nucleus-encoded preproteins into plastids was an essential element of endosymbiosis. Our data are consistent with the divergent evolution of Toc75 and OEP80 from the ancestral cyanobacterial <italic>OMP85</italic> gene to retain the pathway for β-barrel protein biogenesis, while providing a novel pathway for protein import into the organelle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth, genetic complementation of <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> and screening of transgenic plants</title><p>Seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 were grown on phytoagar plates containing 0.5 × Murashige and Skoog growth medium (MS medium), 1% sucrose under long-day condition for 14-day at 22°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nikolaus Pfanner as the Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The chloroplast protein Toc75 is a member of the Omp85 family of proteins. Proteins of this family contain a β-barrel membrane-embedded domain in their C-terminal part and one to five POTRA domains in the N-terminal region. However, little is known about the functions of the <italic>TOC75</italic> POTRA domains and there is also uncertainty about the orientation of these domains in the outer membrane. The manuscript describes a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the <italic>TOC75</italic> POTRA domains and also addresses the membrane orientation. The authors analyzed the outcome of deleting one, two, or all three POTRA domains of Toc75. In addition they characterized the import behavior of organelles coexpressing one of the deletion variants together with a native form. They also analyzed the assembly of the TOC complex in such chloroplasts. An interesting side aspect of this report is the Toc75 topology analysis, which is in agreement with the bacterial and mitochondrial Omp85 homologs. This is important since a previous controversial study (Sommer et al., 2011) proposed just the opposite orientation for chloroplasts. Finally, the authors show that a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the three POTRA domains can interact with precursor protein and with Tic22. In general, the data presented in the manuscript is technically sound and represents the first characterization of the Toc75 POTRA domains for protein import into chloroplasts. The elucidation of <italic>TOC75</italic> POTRA function will represent a significant step forward in the field, and so this manuscript is potentially of considerable interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Three <italic>TOC75</italic> POTRA deletion constructs were used to try and complement the <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> mutant. These were dP1, dP1-2, dP1-3. As none of these was able to complement the mutant, this only reveals a necessity for POTRA 1. Alternatively perhaps the folding of the whole POTRA domain was already disrupted by the dP1 deletion and so further deletions had no further effects.</p><p>Putative dominant-negative phenotypes were found in some transformed plants containing the POTRA deletion constructs in the heterozygous <italic>toc75-III-1</italic> background. Single plant photos show an increasing severity of effect related to deletion of the P1, P1&amp;2 or P1, 2&amp;3 POTRA domains. Transformants with no phenotype are shown to have near WT levels of overexpression, whereas it appears that the negative phenotypes are associated with high overexpression of the deletion constructs. However, as only one WT-like and one dominant-negative line containing each construct is assessed, the asserted dosage dependency is not clear (this is referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Adding some lines of intermediate expression and with intermediate phenotypes would help. Related to this it would be useful if it could be more clearly shown that the phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are truly representative and characteristic of each construct.</p><p>2) There is a discrepancy between the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Whereas the mRNA levels of <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>Toc75ΔP1-2#2</italic> are much higher than those of <italic>TOC75</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) the protein levels of these variants are much lower than those of Toc75. The authors do not comment on this point.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> the levels of <italic>Toc75ΔP1-2#2</italic> are at most about 20% of those of native Toc75. It is not clear how such low levels can cause such strong &quot;dominant negative&quot; effects. Can the authors exclude the possibility that part of these variant molecules are clogging the TOC complex as substrate in transit and thus affecting function and assembly of the TOC complex?</p><p>The phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are interpreted as a competition effect between the POTRA-deleted <italic>TOC75</italic> and WT <italic>TOC75</italic>, implying necessity of the POTRA domains (this is supported by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showing that POTRA-deleted <italic>TOC75</italic> was imported in vitro and has the same in vivo topology as <italic>TOC75</italic>). However results for a highly overexpressed <italic>TOC75</italic> line are not shown. Therefore it is not possible to tell if the deleterious effect is truly due to assembled <italic>TOC75</italic> lacking POTRA domains (rather than e.g. overabundance of the protein causing competition for import in vivo, presence of the β-barrel domain, or excess import intermediate in the intermembrane space in vivo).</p><p>The title asserts multifunctional roles for POTRA domains in TOC75. However many of the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) of the dominant negative dP1 and dP1-2 plants only show a clear difference compared to the WT-like <italic>TOC75</italic> and <italic>toc75-III-1+/-</italic>, but not between each other. The only data potentially revealing differing roles of the POTRAs are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, which show that dP1-2 <italic>TOC75</italic> does not form part of the largest TOC complex.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The conclusions regarding the hampered import capacity of organelles with the deletion variants are based on only ONE precursor protein (preSSU) and thus might reflect an exceptional case. To substantiate the claims the authors should check at least one more client protein.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the Toc33 protein level are strongly increased in <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>Toc75ΔP1-2#2</italic> chloroplasts while Toc159 remains unchanged. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> nicely shows that Toc33 accumulates in the outer envelope without being assembled in the mature TOC complex. Thus, a major concern of the study is the question if the reduced import of preSSU observed for <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is simply caused by preprotein binding to unassembled Toc33 which cannot hand the substrate over to Toc75? In this case, the initial preprotein binding would not be affected but the import across the outer envelope would be impaired as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This could be tested e.g. by overexpression of Toc33 in the background of wildtype Toc75 or by testing precursors which do not depend on Toc33.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>: Important parts of the anti-myc Western in 6D (iii), which should show the full-length Toc75, were unfortunately omitted. These parts should be shown. In contrast to the authors´ claims, it seems that <italic>Toc75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub></italic> is behaving differently than Toc75 as the former is completely resistant to trypsin. Surprisingly, in the anti-POTRA western is seems as if the vast majority of molecules of both forms are resistant to trypsin. Since the authors have an antibody against Toc75 it will be informative to show a full gel immunodecorated with anti-Toc75 to see also smaller fragments. Currently, I am not convinced that <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> has the same topology as native Toc75.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> the authors performed an anti-atToc33 co-immunoprecipitaion to analyze the stoichiometric assembly of the TOC complex. However, due to the low expression levels of <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic> this analysis does not allow any conclusion about the interaction between <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic> and the other Toc and Tic subunits. Alternatively, the authors could perform an anti-myc co-immunoprecipitation using their Toc75<sub>myc</sub> chloroplasts.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> lacks a negative control. As it stands it might be that solubilization was not complete and ALL outer membrane proteins are pulled-down with Toc33.

These were dP1, dP1-2, dP1-3. As none of these was able to complement the mutant, this only reveals a necessity for POTRA 1. Alternatively perhaps the folding of the whole POTRA domain was already disrupted by the dP1 deletion and so further deletions had no further effects.</italic></p><p><italic>Putative dominant-negative phenotypes were found in some transformed plants containing the POTRA deletion constructs in the heterozygous toc75-III-1 background. Single plant photos show an increasing severity of effect related to deletion of the P1, P1&amp;2 or P1,2&amp;3 POTRA domains. Transformants with no phenotype are shown to have near WT levels of overexpression, whereas it appears that the negative phenotypes are associated with high overexpression of the deletion constructs. However, as only one WT-like and one dominant-negative line containing each construct is assessed, the asserted dosage dependency is not clear (this is referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Adding some lines of intermediate expression and with intermediate phenotypes would help. Related to this it would be useful if it could be more clearly shown that the phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are truly representative and characteristic of each construct.</italic> </p><p>a) The reviewers asked us to clarify our conclusion that the three POTRA domains are essential for Toc75 function. We agree with the reviewers that we can only conclude from our analyses that POTRA1 is essential for Toc75 function. We have modified the Abstract to avoid implying otherwise. However, the increasing severity of the lines expressing <italic>TOC75ΔP1, TOC75ΔP1-2</italic>, and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-3</italic> is consistent with our conclusion that P2 and P3 also contribute to the function of Toc75. This also is supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which show that TOC complexes from <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> have distinct mobility patterns on 2D blue-native PAGE. This leads us to hypothesize that the deletion of POTRA1 and 2 impacts TOC assembly in a manner that is not observed when only POTRA1 is absent.</p><p>b) Second, the reviewers raised the issue of whether our analyses of <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> are representative of multiple lines expressing the POTRA deletion constructs. We have included data on the phenotypes and levels of expression of the POTRA deletions from six independent transformed lines each for <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These lines provide evidence that our data are representative of the constructs and support our conclusion that the severity of the phenotypes correlates with the levels of <italic>Δ</italic>P1 and <italic>Δ</italic>P1-2 expression. It is very difficult to quantify the correlation between expression and visible phenotype in transgenic plants. Therefore, we have eliminated the term “dose-dependent” from the text to avoid implying that we have performed a classical dose-response analysis. Instead, we simply state that increased expression of the deletion mutants results in more severe phenotypes (paragraph six, Introduction).</p><p><italic>2) There is a discrepancy between the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Whereas the mRNA levels of TOC75ΔP1#2 and Toc75ΔP1-2#2 are much higher than those of TOC75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) the protein levels of these variants are much lower than those of Toc75. The authors do not comment on this point.</italic> </p><p><italic>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> the levels of Toc75ΔP1-2#2 are at most about 20% of those of native Toc75. It is not clear how such low levels can cause such strong &quot;dominant negative&quot; effects. Can the authors exclude the possibility that part of these variant molecules are clogging the TOC complex as substrate in transit and thus affecting function and assembly of the TOC complex?</italic> </p><p><italic>The phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are interpreted as a competition effect between the POTRA-deleted TOC75 and WT TOC75, implying necessity of the POTRA domains (this is supported by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showing that POTRA-deleted TOC75 was imported in vitro and has the same in vivo topology as TOC75). However results for a highly overexpressed TOC75 line are not shown. Therefore it is not possible to tell if the deleterious effect is truly due to assembled TOC75 lacking POTRA domains (rather than e.g. overabundance of the protein causing competition for import in vivo, presence of the β-barrel domain, or excess import intermediate in the intermembrane space in vivo).</italic> </p><p><italic>The title asserts multifunctional roles for POTRA domains in TOC75. However many of the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) of the dominant negative dP1 and dP1-2 plants only show a clear difference compared to the WT-like TOC75 and toc75-III-1+/-, but not between each other. The only data potentially revealing differing roles of the POTRAs are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, which show that dP1-2 TOC75 does not form part of the largest TOC complex.</italic> </p><p>These comments focus on the expression levels of the Toc75 POTRA deletions and wild type Toc75 in transgenic plants.</p><p>a) We did not examine the cause of the high levels of mRNA accumulation of the POTRA deletions in the <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2#2</italic> lines relative to expression of wild type Toc75. The transgenes are all expressed from the native promoter, and the gene constructs retain all corresponding intron and exon organization. However, it is well known that positional effects due to the sites of insertion in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome can result in significant differences in the levels of expression of the same gene constructs. With regards to the fact that the protein levels of the POTRA deletions are significantly lower than wild type Toc75 protein, we speculate that this might be due to relative instability of the deletion constructs and their apparent toxicity to the plants. Statements to these effects are added to the text (paragraph three, subheading “POTRA domains are required for Toc75 function”).</p><p>b) TOC complexes are large multimeric assemblies. Toc75 appears to self-associate when expressed and reconstituted from <italic>E. coli</italic>. We hypothesize that the introduction of defective subunits into these complexes can disrupt the function of the large complexes by interfering with the coordinate activities of Toc33, Toc159 and Toc75. This hypothesis is consistent with other known cases in which mutations that impact a small proportion of subunits of oligomeric complexes have significant impacts on function. We have added a statement to the text to explain this possibility (paragraph one, Discussion).</p><p>c) Our data do not support the possibility that the POTRA deletions might be clogging the translocon channel and thereby causing protein import defects. The deletions are targeted, fully processed and membrane integrated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. Furthermore, protein import intermediates that are stuck in the TOC translocon are predicted to be sensitive to thermolysin treatment in intact chloroplasts. The POTRA deletions are insensitive to thermolysin and, in the case of <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic>, assume the same topology as native Toc75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>d) It is very difficult to obtain highly over-expressed lines of wild type Toc75. High level overexpression leads to co-suppression and a lethal phenotype. In unpublished work, we previously expressed Toc75 under strong constitutive promoters (e.g. 35S CaMV), and could obtain up to a 2-fold increase in expression similar to what we observe for wild type Toc75 in <italic>TOC75ΔP1#2</italic> without any obvious phenotypes.</p><p>e) As stated above, we agree that our data do not demonstrate that the individual POTRA repeats have entirely distinct functions. However, it is clear that the POTRAs together play multiple roles in TOC function and assembly. Furthermore, the fact that <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> and <italic>TOC75ΔP1-2</italic> have distinct effects on TOC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggest that their impact on import complexes is not equivalent.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The conclusions regarding the hampered import capacity of organelles with the deletion variants are based on only ONE precursor protein (preSSU) and thus might reflect an exceptional case. To substantiate the claims the authors should check at least one more client protein.</italic> </p><p><italic>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the Toc33 protein level are strongly increased in Toc75ΔP1#2 and Toc75ΔP1-2#2 chloroplasts while Toc159 remains unchanged. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> nicely shows that Toc33 accumulates in the outer envelope without being assembled in the mature TOC complex. Thus, a major concern of the study is the question if the reduced import of preSSU observed for TOC75ΔP1#2 and TOC75ΔP1-2#2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is simply caused by preprotein binding to unassembled Toc33 which cannot hand the substrate over to Toc75? In this case, the initial preprotein binding would not be affected but the import across the outer envelope would be impaired as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This could be tested e.g. by overexpression of Toc33 in the background of wildtype Toc75 or by testing precursors which do not depend on Toc33.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raised questions regarding the nature of the protein import defect in the POTRA deletion lines.</p><p>a) We have added import experiments with an additional preprotein, the precursor to the E1 α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This precursor has previously been shown to utilize TOC complexes for import that are distinct from those used by preSSU. These complexes contain Toc75 assembled with different isoforms of the TOC GTPases. The data show that import of preE1 α is reduced to the same degree as preSSU import and support our conclusion that the POTRAs affect import generally (paragraph three, subheading “POTRA domains are required for Toc75 function”).</p><p>b) Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that excess Toc33 contributes to the import defect, we would expect to see increased binding to chloroplasts under no energy conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Rather, we observe slightly decreased binding levels. Similarly, the kinetic analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not indicate significant changes in the K<sub>d(app)</sub>. We would expect that significant binding by “free” Toc33 would impact the K<sub>d(app)</sub> as this interaction would most certainly have a distinct affinity from intact TOC complexes.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>: Important parts of the anti-myc Western in 6D (iii), which should show the full-length Toc75, were unfortunately omitted. These parts should be shown. In contrast to the authors´ claims, it seems that Toc75ΔP1<sub>myc</sub> is behaving differently than Toc75 as the former is completely resistant to trypsin. Surprisingly, in the anti-POTRA western is seems as if the vast majority of molecules of both forms are resistant to trypsin. Since the authors have an antibody against Toc75 it will be informative to show a full gel immunodecorated with anti-Toc75 to see also smaller fragments. Currently, I am not convinced that Toc75ΔP1 has the same topology as native Toc75.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the questions regarding the interpretation of results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> were a consequence of low quality images generated during PDF conversion. We apologize to the reviewers. We have replaced the original overexposed images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> with higher quality images. We believe these data now clearly demonstrate that native Toc75 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> exhibit indistinguishable protease sensitivity patterns, consistent with our conclusion that they assume the same topology in the outer membrane.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> the authors performed an anti-atToc33 co-immunoprecipitaion to analyze the stoichiometric assembly of the TOC complex. However, due to the low expression levels of Toc75ΔP1 and Toc75ΔP1-2 this analysis does not allow any conclusion about the interaction between Toc75ΔP1 and Toc75ΔP1-2 and the other Toc and Tic subunits. Alternatively, the authors could perform an anti-myc co-immunoprecipitation using their Toc75<sub>myc</sub> chloroplasts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> lacks a negative control. As it stands it might be that solubilization was not complete and ALL outer membrane proteins are pulled-down with Toc33. A negative control like Oep80 or other outer membrane protein should be included.</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> raises several questions: (a) Kikuchi et al. reported two species of TOC complex, one at 800-1000 kDa and the other at 350-500 kDa. Why are the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> different?

(d) in panel (ii): why are there three species of Toc75? A figure with a better quality and more distinct bands is required to draw conclusions about the assembly of the TOC complex.</italic> </p><p>These comments address the assembly of the POTRA deletions with other TOC components.</p><p>a) The intent of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> was only to establish that the deletion mutants can interact directly or indirectly with TOC components and was not intended to address the issue of stoichiometry. We have added a statement to the text to clarify the intent (paragraph two, subheading “Protein import components accumulate to higher levels in plants expressing POTRA deletions”).</p><p>b) We attempted to use anti-myc to immunoprecipitate complexes, but were unsuccessful, perhaps due to the inaccessibility of the epitope on Toc75 within TOC assemblies.</p><p>c) We also included immunoblots of OEP80, an outer membrane negative control, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> to show that it does not co-immunoprecipitate with anti- Toc33.</p><p>d) The minor size differences in the TOC complexes shown here compared to the previous study is likely due to the fact that we are analyzing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplasts, whereas the published study was analyzing pea chloroplasts. The GTPase receptors are different sizes in the two organisms. We do not think this is significant. To avoid confusion, we now refer to the complexes we observe as 1.3 MDa and 440 kDa complexes and explain the slight differences from the results of Kikuchi et al. in the text (paragraph one, subheading “POTRA deletions disrupt TOC complex stoichiometry”).</p><p>e) We have repeated the 2D blue-native gel analysis and included higher quality images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> that are more representative of the ratios of Toc75 and <italic>TOC75ΔP1</italic> observed in other experiments.</p><p>f) We did not detect an 86 kDa fragment when the blots were probed with an anti-serum to the C-terminal domain of Toc159. We take extra precautions to avoid proteolysis during our experiments. Furthermore, Toc159 is much less susceptible to proteolysis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> than in pea chloroplasts in our hands.</p><p>g) As mentioned above, we repeated the 2D blue-native gel analysis and included higher quality blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. A third background band is not detected in these experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
