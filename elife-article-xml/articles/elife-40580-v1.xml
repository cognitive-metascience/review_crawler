Southeast Asia. Yet information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and health burden of α-thalassaemia in the region remains limited. We compiled a geodatabase of α-thalassaemia prevalence and genetic diversity surveys and, using geostatistical modelling methods, generated the first continuous maps of α-thalassaemia mutations in Thailand and sub-national estimates of the number of newborns with severe forms in 2020. We also summarised the current evidence-base for α-thalassaemia prevalence and diversity for the region. We estimate that 3595 (95% credible interval 1,717–6,199) newborns will be born with severe α-thalassaemia in Thailand in 2020, which is considerably higher than previous estimates. Accurate, fine-scale epidemiological data are necessary to guide sustainable national and regional health policies for α-thalassaemia management. Our maps and newborn estimates are an important first step towards this aim.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

It is estimated that up to 5% of the world’s population carries at least one α-thalassaemia variant, with some populations (e.g. in India and Papua New Guinea) reporting gene frequencies of close to 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piel and Weatherall, 2014</xref>). Central to its elevated frequency is the malaria protection afforded by the underlying genetic mutations, which have been favoured by natural selection in populations with historically high rates of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flint et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Premawardhena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weatherall and Clegg, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">May et al., 2007</xref>). Due to recent population migrations, α-thalassaemia is now common in other parts of the world, as illustrated by the inclusion of haemoglobin H (HbH) disease (a form of α-thalassaemia) in the newborn screening programme in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vichinsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppe, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Humans typically possess four copies of the α-globin gene. In an individual with α-thalassaemia, at least one of these four copies is absent or dysfunctional. The resulting deficit in α-globin affects the balance between α-globin and β- or γ-globin chains that is necessary to produce normal adult haemoglobin (HbA) and normal foetal haemoglobin (HbF), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weatherall and Clegg, 2001b</xref>). The severity of α-thalassaemia is inversely related to the number of functional copies of the α-globin gene. A deficit of three or more α-globin genes leads to the production of γ-globin tetramers, called Hb Bart’s, in the foetus or β-globin tetramers, called HbH, in adults. Due to their very high oxygen affinity, neither tetramer is capable of transporting oxygen efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galanello and Cao, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the instability of HbH leads to the production of inclusion bodies in red blood cells and a variable degree of haemolytic anaemia.</p><p>To date, 121 α-globin gene mutations have been identified (HbVar, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://globin.bx.psu.edu">http://globin.bx.psu.edu</ext-link>, accessed 07 July 2018). These include: (i) double gene deletions that remove both α-globin copies in a gene pair (α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia), (ii) single gene deletions that remove one α-globin copy (α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia), and (iii) non-deletional (ND) mutations that in some way inactivate the affected gene (α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia). While deletions constitute the vast majority of these α-thalassaemia variants, non-deletional variants are typically associated with more severe phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fucharoen and Viprakasit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). However, even amongst non-deletional variants, considerable phenotypic variability is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singer, 2009</xref>). Because the geographical distribution of β-thalassaemia largely overlaps with the distribution of α-thalassaemia, it is important to note that their co-inheritance often leads to a reduced imbalance between α-globin and β-globin chains, resulting in a milder thalassaemia phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weatherall et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wainscoat et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kan and Nathan, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Law et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>From a clinical perspective, α-thalassaemia is mostly a burden in Southeast Asia where α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia variants (e.g. --<sup>SEA</sup>, --<sup>THAI</sup>) are common and result in HbH disease when inherited with α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia (e.g. -α<sup>3.7</sup> or -α<sup>4.2</sup>) or α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia (e.g. Hb Constant Spring, or Hb CS, or Hb Paksé), or in Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis when inherited from both parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weatherall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chui, 2005</xref>). Previously, HbH disease was considered to be relatively benign; however, recent evidence suggests a spectrum of mild to severe forms of HbH disease, with the worst affected individuals requiring lifelong transfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fucharoen and Viprakasit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis, the most severe form of α-thalassaemia, associated with an absence of any functional α-globin genes, is almost always fatal <italic>in utero</italic> or soon after birth, although intrauterine interventions and perinatal intensive care can lead to survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Songdej et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this context, there is a growing demand for a better understanding of the epidemiology of α-thalassaemia such that burden estimates can be calculated to guide public health decisions and assess the need for new pharmacological treatments. However, whilst several narrative reviews of the epidemiology of α-thalassaemia in Southeast Asian countries are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chui, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 2011</xref>), a comprehensive review for the whole region has not been performed, making the current evidence-base patchy and incohesive. In addition, there appears to be a substantial amount of data that are available only in local data sources, which is not being accessed by the international community. Estimates of the number of newborns with severe forms of α-thalassaemia published by Modell and Darlison currently represent the only source of information on the epidemiology of thalassaemias and other inherited haemoglobin disorders at national and regional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Modell and Darlison, 2008</xref>). However, various inconsistencies have been identified in these α-thalassaemia estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piel and Weatherall, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, they do not include most of the surveys conducted in the genomic era, which has allowed accurate diagnosis through DNA testing. Finally, haemoglobinopathies often present remarkably heterogeneous geographical distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piel et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piel et al., 2013b</xref>). As shown for other genetic conditions (e.g. sickle-cell anaemia), these variations can be captured by generating continuous allele frequency maps interpolated from population surveys using geostatistical techniques. Combined with high-resolution demographic and birth rate data, these maps allow sub-national newborn estimates to be calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piel et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piel et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The aims of this study are therefore three-fold: i) to compile a geodatabase of published evidence for the distribution of α-thalassaemia and its common genetic variants in Southeast Asia, (ii) to generate the first model-based continuous maps of α-thalassaemia in Thailand and calculate refined estimates of the annual number of newborns affected by severe forms of α-thalassaemia, and iii) to comprehensively evaluate and summarise the compiled evidence-base for the whole region.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The database</title><p>Our keyword searches yielded a total of 868 unique potential sources of data on α-thalassaemia prevalence and/or genetic diversity in 10 Southeast Asian countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A further 74 potential data sources were identified by one of the authors (SE) from local Thai journals and independently double-checked for inclusion into the study (CH). Of all these sources, 75 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the final database. Due to some sources reporting estimates for more than one population, data were available for 106 individual population samples: 58 from the online literature search and 48 from the local literature. A detailed description of the database is provided in Appendix 5.</p><p>Forty-six surveys provided data on α-thalassaemia gene frequency alone, two provided data only relating to genetic diversity and 58 provided data on both. Four surveys were reported at the national level (two from Malaysia, one from Singapore and one from Thailand), and were retained for the regional analysis. The spatial and temporal distributions of identified surveys are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. The country for which the highest number of surveys was published in the international literature (i.e. excluding surveys obtained through local searches) was Thailand. No published surveys were identified for Brunei Darussalam or the Philippines. Within countries, surveys predominated in certain areas. For instance, in Thailand, the northern and northeastern parts of the country contained &gt;75% of all surveys. Data for southern Thailand came exclusively from Thai journals (<italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The total number of individuals sampled was 133,649 (the population of the region is estimated to be 647,483,729 in 2017), with a mean sample size of 1261. Further details on the final database are provided in Appendix 5.</p><p>Prevalence surveys varied considerably with regards to the α-thalassaemia alleles and/or genotypes that were tested for or reported upon; whilst some reported allele frequencies for α<sup>0</sup>-, α<sup>+</sup>- and α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia, others provided data for only one or two of these. To maximise use of the available allele frequency data, whilst avoiding the incorporation of potentially biased estimates for overall α-thalassaemia allele frequency, we generated separate maps for each of the three major forms of α-thalassaemia – that is, α<sup>0</sup>-, α<sup>+</sup>- and α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B and C</xref>, respectively). α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia was the most extensively studied form (<italic>n</italic> = 97), followed by α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia (<italic>n</italic> = 49) and then α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia (<italic>n</italic> = 47).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40580.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Descriptive maps of the observed allele frequencies in the database.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia, (<bold>B</bold>) α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia and (<bold>C</bold>) α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia.

Heterogeneity is greatest in the north of the country. For α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia, while large parts of the northernmost provinces of Chiang Rai, Phayao and Nan have predicted allele frequencies of up to 2%, allele frequencies for the neighbouring provinces of Chiang Mai, Lampang and Phrae are often twice as high (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for a reference map of Thailand provinces).

We estimate that the number of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis births in the country will be 423 (CI: 184–761) in 2020. The number of new cases of HbH disease is estimated to be 3,172, including 2674 (CI: 1,296–4,491) deletional and 498 (CI: 237–947) non-deletional cases. The highest absolute burden of hydrops fetalis is predicted in Bangkok City (57 [CI: 13–151]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), with its high population density, and Udon Thani (23 [CI: 6–66]) in the northeastern zone, where some of the highest α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia allele frequencies are predicted. Other provinces with a comparatively high burden include: Chiang Mai in the north of the country; Khon Kaen, Sakon Nakhon and Ubon Ratchathani in the northeast; and Chon Buri, Samut Prakan and Nonthaburi close to Bangkok City. The estimated number of hydrops fetalis births in these provinces range between 10 and 19. For HbH disease, the highest burden is predicted in northeast Thailand for both the deletional and non-deletional forms. Bangkok City is predicted to have the highest burden of HbH disease (301 [CI: 94–639] for deletional HbH disease and 68 [CI: 25–148] for non-deletional HbH disease).</p><p>To directly compare estimates generated using our methodology with those previously published by Modell and Darlison, we also calculated estimates using population and birth rate data for 2003 (Appendix 3). Modell and Darlison estimated 1017 and 2515 births to be affected by Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis and HbH disease, respectively, in 2003. Using population data from the same year paired with our model-based maps, and assuming no consanguinity, we estimate 709 and 5469 newborns to be born with Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis and HbH disease in the country. As Modell and Darlison included a population coefficient of consanguinity (<italic>F</italic>) in their calculations, we examined the effect that this would have on our estimates. We found that they do not change considerably (951 and 5,409), when a value of <italic>F</italic> of 0.1, a high value for the region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consang.net">www.consang.net</ext-link>), is incorporated. Our estimates are therefore consistent with those by Modell and Darlison for Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis. However, they suggest that the burden of HbH disease in Thailand may have previously been underestimated. Moreover, whilst Modell and Darlison did not estimate the burden of non-deletional forms of HbH disease, our estimates suggest that 15% of the 5469 neonatal cases were of non-deletional types, which are usually associated with more severe phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Overall distribution of α-thalassaemia across Southeast Asia</title><p>In our database for all of Southeast Asia, the number of surveys that tested for all three forms of α-thalassaemia was 40.

Moreover, country reports (e.g. from Malaysia) indicate a shift in the age distribution of thalassaemia patients towards older ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibrahim, 2012</xref>). As the burden increases, there will be greater demand for resources, including healthcare facilities and staff, genetic counselling and drugs, to treat and manage affected patients. This is particularly true for countries in Southeast Asia as well as the Mediterranean, where severe forms of α-thalassaemia (i.e. α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia) are found.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison with existing maps and population estimates</title><p>The model-based maps for Thailand presented here are, to our knowledge, the first spatially continuous maps of the distribution of α-thalassaemia in any country.

Importantly, whilst there are currently no estimates of the number of stillbirths that will occur in Thailand in 2020, our estimate of the number of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis births represents more than 10% of the 3697 stillbirths estimated for 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blencowe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Comparisons between previous newborn estimates and those generated in this study using our updated database and 2003 demographic data revealed an almost two-fold difference for deletional HbH disease (2515 compared to 4694 in the present study). Reasons for such discrepancies most likely relate to: (i) differences in the inclusion criteria used in the generation of our map and therefore our calculation of newborn estimates, (ii) the quantity of survey data used, and iii) the statistical methods employed. For instance, spatial specificity was not a consideration in the study by Modell and Darlison, who used a single allele frequency estimate extrapolated to the whole country. As such, the newborn calculations in the present study represent a methodological advance over previous efforts to assess the burden of α-thalassaemia. We related fine-scale allele frequency data to birth count data of equally high resolution, allowing location-specific estimates to be generated that could be aggregated to province level. Moreover, the use of model-based maps in our calculations enabled the measurement of uncertainty in our predictions. Finally, by including allele frequency data on α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia, we were able to estimate the burden of the more severe non-deletional HbH disease.</p><p>Our newborn estimates for 2020 are considerably lower than those for 2003. This reduction is due to the lower number of births in Thailand in 2020 as a result of a decreasing birth rate and population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">World population prospects, 2017</xref>). It would be interesting to quantify how improvements in the prevention of thalassaemias will affect these estimates in the future.</p><p>Our descriptive maps represent the first detailed cartographic representations of α-thalassaemia allele frequency estimates in Southeast Asia, which take into account the specific geographical location of the surveys in which they were observed. Until now, available maps (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) provided only a crude overview of overall α-thalassaemia gene frequency, without any distinction between different α-thalassaemia forms, and extrapolated to the entire region, thereby masking sub-national and even international, variation in allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piel and Weatherall, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The maps are broadly consistent with early narrative reviews of the gene frequency of α-thalassaemia in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 1987</xref>), showing a clear north-to-south trend of decreasing allele frequencies of α<sup>0</sup>- and α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia and a patchier distribution of α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia. However, our maps also demonstrate a severe lack of data on the allele frequency of α-thalassaemia across large parts of Southeast Asia, including in Myanmar, northern Lao PDR, northern Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines and Brunei. This impedes our ability to assess the fine-scale burden of α-thalassaemia, making efficient public health planning for its control difficult, and limits our ability to track progress in the prevention and management of the disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Patterns of genetic variation and their public health implications</title><p>The pattern of genetic diversity observed in this study indicates variable distributions of mild and severe α-thalassaemia forms. Reasons for this are unclear.

Areas with the highest proportions of co-occurring severe α-thalassaemia forms (i.e. α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia and α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia) may experience a higher prevalence of the severe non-deletional form of HbH disease. Furthermore, the predominance of Hb CS in surveys from Malaysia and Vietnam suggests that the health burden of α-thalassaemia in these areas may be greater than previously thought. Hb CS is a mutation at the termination codon of the α2-globin gene, which, in a normal individual, accounts for three-quarters of overall α-globin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liebhaber and Kan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orkin et al., 1981</xref>). As a result, α2-globin gene mutations, such as Hb CS, tend to cause a more severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chui, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Model strengths and limitations</title><p>The reliability of the model-based maps is intrinsically linked to the quality, quantity and spatial coverage of the data upon which the models are based. We were unable to generate continuous maps for the whole of the Southeast Asian region as data were sparse in large areas. Whilst we are aware that unpublished surveys are likely to be available for most countries of the region, obtaining local data for all of the countries was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that substantial additional survey data can be identified in locally published sources and, as a result, highlighted the enormous value of future collaborations to collate local data in other regions.</p><p>For Thailand, limitations relating to data sparsity, uneven survey distributions and heterogeneity in allele frequency can be quantified in the presented uncertainty intervals. Areas where there is little data or where observed allele frequencies are highly heterogeneous within a small geographical area will have more uncertain predictions, whilst a large amount of data for which there is little heterogeneity will lead to more precise predictions. We identified a lack of data in the southern part of Thailand, which is reflected in larger uncertainty estimates. Other predictions with high associated uncertainty include those along the Thailand-Myanmar border, particularly the southern tail of Myanmar, where no α-thalassaemia prevalence surveys are found. This highlights the arbitrary nature of country borders in mapping studies.</p><p>Spatial smoothing is an important component of most geostatistical models. For the modelling approach used here, the range function (i.e. the extent of spatial autocorrelation) is defined by a parameter within the SPDE framework and takes a prior distribution. The smoothing in the approximate posterior therefore balances over- and under-fitting and is necessary to ensure that the model predicts adequately without fitting the idiosyncrasies of the data. As a result, the model does not predict allele frequencies that fully reflect heterogeneity between nearby surveys. Although extensive variation in allele frequencies between different ethnic groups in similar geographic locations has been observed in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulaphisit et al., 2017</xref>) and other countries (e.g. Sri Lanka), this could not be reflected in our predicted allele frequencies. For example, allele frequencies of around 3.65% for the Hb CS mutation have been reported in the Khmer ethnic group in Surin and Buriram provinces, whilst our model predicts maximum allele frequencies of 1.65% here. This smoothing process can similarly explain why the highest observed α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia frequency of 7% in Khon Kaen was not reproduced in the predicted maps. In fact, our model-based predictions for α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia are remarkably homogenous and the average correlation between the observed and predicted frequencies is low (0.47). This is because the close-range heterogeneity in the observed data, coupled with the absence of a long-range trend in frequency (as is observed for α<sup>0</sup>- and α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia), makes it difficult for the model to discern a signal.</p><p>It is likely that other factors influence the allele frequencies of the different α-thalassaemia forms, but have not been considered in this mapping study, including ethnicity, consanguinity, historic rates of malaria (both <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Douglas et al., 2012</xref>) and population migration patterns. Furthermore, there is bound to be uncertainty in the geolocation of some of the surveys included in the study due to the lack of details published or available. This uncertainty could not be accounted for. Finally, whilst the inclusion criterion of molecular methods should help to improve the reliability of allele frequency estimates, they are not 100% sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Old and Henderson, 2010</xref>) and do not cover all possible α-thalassaemia mutations, which may lead to some error in the reported allele frequencies.</p><p>Whilst we have calculated the burden of α-thalassaemia in terms of the number newborns born with severe forms in 2020, there are other aspects of the disease burden that would be worth considering pending the availability of more data, for example, milder-forms and their coinheritance with β-thalassaemia, DALY losses from α-thalassaemia, maternal complications (some of which can be life-threatening) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chui, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ratanasiri et al., 2009</xref>), psychological effects and, in the case of HbH disease, survival data allowing the calculation of all-age population estimates. Furthermore, the estimates presented here do not include compound disorders, such as EA Bart’s and EF Bart’s diseases (HbH disease with heterozygous and homozygous forms of β<sup>E</sup>, another clinically important structural β-globin variant, respectively), and therefore remain underestimates of the overall burden of α-thalassaemia disorders in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galanello, 2013</xref>). Finally, the visualisation of our burden estimates are subject to the modifiable area unit problem, whereby the presentation of estimates at the province level likely masks pockets of high burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Future prospects and conclusions</title><p>The allele frequency, distribution and genetic variant profile of α-globin forms is only a part of their epidemiological complexity. An improved understanding of the natural history of α-thalassaemia and the factors that modify its clinical outcome will be imperative for establishing better estimates of its burden. This is particularly pertinent in the Southeast Asian region, where the disorder co-exists with β-thalassaemia, including the commonest haemoglobin variant, Hb E. Many studies have shown a positive epistatic interaction between α- and β-thalassaemia, whereby their co-inheritance results in the amelioration of the associated blood disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fucharoen and Weatherall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Viprakasit et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A detailed assessment of current knowledge on the allele frequency of α-thalassaemia and the magnitude of its health burden is needed to develop suitable prevention and control programmes. This study provides a detailed overview of the existing data on the gene frequency and genetic diversity of α-thalassaemia in Southeast Asia. We show that our knowledge of the accurate allele frequency and distribution of this highly complex disease remains somewhat limited. Because of the remarkable geographic heterogeneities in the gene frequency of α-thalassemia, interventions have to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the local population (e.g., prevalence of the disorder in the population, ethnic makeup, and consanguinity) and the local health care system As the epidemiological transition in these countries continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weatherall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bundhamcharoen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhillon et al., 2012</xref>), it will become increasingly important to regularly update regional and national maps of α-thalassaemia gene frequency and newborn estimates such that health and demographic changes can be properly quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piel and Weatherall, 2014</xref>).

biomedical literature databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus) were systematically searched for all records referring to ‘α-thalassaemia’, ‘alpha-thalassaemia’, ‘α-thal’ or alpha-thal’. Broad search terms were used to make the search as inclusive as possible. Retrieved articles were imported into the bibliographic database, Endnote X7 (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and grouped by country. The countries included in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The last search was conducted on 21 July 2017. In addition, a non-systematic review of surveys available in local Thai journals was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Survey inclusion criteria</title><p>The title and abstract of each reference was reviewed for its suitability to this study and those that were considered not to be so were excluded from further review. This included animal studies, review articles and studies performed elsewhere in the world. The remaining references had their full texts (where available) reviewed using a set of strict inclusion criteria, which varied slightly depending on the type of data being reported (i.e. prevalence data or genetic diversity data).</p><p>For prevalence data, details on the number of individuals sampled and the different α-thalassaemia alleles and/or genotypes identified were needed. Thus, surveys that reported allele or genotype frequency without the sample size were excluded as were those that reported an overall α-thalassaemia gene frequency without distinguishing between different α-thalassaemia forms or genotypes. Given the important clinical differences between α<sup>+</sup>-, α<sup>0</sup>- and α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia, many of the surveys focused on specific genotypes, in particular those containing an α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia allele (i.e. --/αα, --/--, -α/-- and αα<sup>ND</sup>/--). As a result, allele frequencies of the other α-thalassaemia forms were not always a reliable representation of their true allele frequency in the study population, despite them being tested for. In this instance, the reported frequencies of the alleles of secondary interest were entered into the database as missing values. Similarly, if an α-thalassaemia allele was not tested for, the survey was still included but the frequency value of the untested allele was entered as missing. For surveys where the diagnostic algorithm and genotype reporting were sufficiently detailed (e.g. all seven major variants tested using PCR and a range of genotypes reported), we assumed that the lack of explicit reporting of certain genotypes reflected a zero frequency of them. Data on the absence of α-thalassaemia in the studied populations were also included. Where necessary, allele frequencies were derived from their respective genotype frequencies by assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardy, 1908</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weinberg, 1908</xref>)</p><p>To be truly representative of the general population, surveys should take place in the community using random sampling. However, it became apparent early in the review process that very few surveys were conducted in this way. We therefore chose to include surveys that sampled from any of the following population groups, provided sampling was random, consecutive or universal: (i) the general community, (ii) pregnant women attending antenatal care and/or their husbands, (iii) cord blood and/or neonates in the absence of any inclusion/exclusion criteria or initial thalassaemia screening, (iv) individuals attending their yearly health check-up, and (v) opt-out volunteers, e.g. students, blood donors or army personnel. These groups were deemed to contain no inherent bias in α-thalassaemia prevalence and thus suitable for the purpose of this study. By contrast, surveys involving opt-in sampling, relatives of known cases of α-thalassaemia, putative anaemic cases, patients or individuals possessing a β-globin variant (i.e. β-thalassaemia, β<sup>E</sup> or β<sup>S</sup>) were excluded. Moreover, surveys that were carried out in specific ethnic groups were only included if the population being investigated was representative of the study area. Representativeness was determined based on information provided in the reference.</p><p>Whilst a range of diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of α-thalassaemia,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 2011</xref>) we only included surveys in which molecular diagnostic methods were used (e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and DNA sequencing).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Old and Henderson, 2010</xref>) This is because other methods are unreliable for characterising the precise α-thalassaemia genotype of an individual. For instance, haematological indices cannot distinguish between α<sup>+</sup>-thalassaemia and the wild-type state nor between α<sup>0</sup>-thalassaemia and iron deficiency anaemia (both of which lead to microcytosis).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fucharoen and Winichagoon, 2011</xref>) Haemoglobin analysis by capillary electrophoresis (CE), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isoelectric focusing (IEF) and citrate agar electrophoresis (CAE) are all techniques that have been used to identify the quantity of Hb Bart’s, Hb H, Hb CS and other types of haemoglobin relevant to α-thalassaemia, and are comparable in performance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alauddin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantikou et al., 2009</xref>) However, accurate diagnosis of specific α-thalassaemia genotypes is not possible with these techniques and their performance is reduced when there is concomitant inheritance of β-thalassaemia.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chui, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alauddin et al., 2017</xref>) Given that the objective of this study was to describe and map allele frequencies, the inclusion of non-molecular studies could affect the reliability of allele frequency estimates.</p><p>The majority of surveys that provided information on the genetic diversity of α-thalassaemia mutations were cross-sectional surveys in which there was no prior knowledge or screening of the α-thalassaemia status of the study sample. All of the same inclusion criteria as those described above were applied – that is: (i) a clearly reported sample size and allele or genotype frequencies, (ii) a representative sample, and (iii) molecular diagnosis. In other surveys, the underlying mutations among individuals known to have α-thalassaemia were characterised. To avoid potential bias towards more severe variants in these surveys, only those that took place outside of the hospital setting and in the absence of any inclusion or exclusion criteria pertaining to disease severity were included. Surveys amongst other patient groups, for example β-thalassaemics, were also excluded. Again, only those surveys using molecular diagnostic methods were included.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3"><title>Georeferencing</title><p>To capture fine-scale spatial heterogeneities in α-thalassaemia gene frequency and/or genetic diversity, included surveys were mapped to the highest spatial resolution possible based on the information provided in the article. Online geopositioning gazeteers were used to identify the latitude and longitude decimal degree coordinates of the study location. For studies that could be georeferenced to the province or district level only, the centroid of the polygon was extracted from ArcMap 10.4.1 (ESRI Inc, Redlands, CA, USA) and used. For studies that were conducted across multiple locations but reported as a single frequency estimate, the coordinates for each site were obtained from the online gazeteers and the centroid of all the sites calculated using ArcMap. In some cases, this resulted in a data point that fell between two land areas, for example Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40580.026</object-id><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Generation of continuous allele frequency maps for Thailand</title><p>Continuous maps of the allele frequencies of α<sup>0</sup>-, α<sup>+</sup>- and α<sup>ND</sup>-thalassaemia were generated for Thailand only. This is because there was considerably more data for Thailand than for any of the other countries in the region, in part due to the inclusion of data from local journals. Data from Thailand and all of its neighbouring countries (Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Malaysia) were used in this part of the analysis to preclude the possibility of a border effect on the predicted allele frequencies. Surveys that were reported only at the national level were excluded. To generate three separate maps of α-thalassaemia allele frequency, data on each α-thalassaemia form were extracted from the database and used as input for three separate models. The observed allele frequency data were transformed through an empirical logit, which, for databases ≥ 20 surveys, can be well approximated by a Gaussian likelihood.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diggle and Ribeiro, 2007</xref>)</p><p>The goal of the geostatistical analysis was to estimate model parameters and generate predictions of α-thalassaemia allele frequencies in Thailand at fine spatial resolution.

Several methods for defining the covariance between spatial points exist; here we use the Matérn class of covariance function in which the correlation function is defined based on the Euclidean distance between locations.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krainski et al., 2017</xref>) Specifically, the stationary Matérn covariance function assumes that if we have two pairs of points separated by the same Euclidean distance <italic>h</italic>, both pairs have same correlation, with correlation monotonically decreasing as a function of <italic>h</italic>.</p><p>Matrix algebra operations on a continuously indexed GF are computationally intensive to model.

The SPDE approach replaces the Matérn covariance function’s dense covariance matrix by a sparse reduced rank matrix. Following the generation of the GMRF prior, the posterior distribution is approximated by an Integrate Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), which uses a combination of analytical approximation and numerical integration methods to approximate the posterior distribution at each point in the GMRF.

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Estimating the burden of α-thalassaemia in Thailand using a comprehensive prevalence database for Southeast Asia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eduardo Franco as the Senior Editor. The two reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is important, novel work. The analyses show a visualized map of α-thalassemia prevalence and genotypic diversity, which can be of a large benefit for future prevention policy in Thailand. A major strength of this work is an extensive review of relevant prevalence and genotype reports. Overall, this represents a valuable and much-needed contribution to the literature about this neglected genetic disorder.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The model's smoothing effect appears to be quite strong, avoiding the more extreme points such as the 7% frequency of ND-thalassaemia quoted in paragraph four of subsection “Overall distribution of α-thalassaemia across Southeast Asia”. This ND-thalassaemia model also had relatively low correlation statistics. The authors need to discuss this further, and why the range in the predicted mean map is so homogenous for the ND-thalassaemias?</p><p>Figures 4-6: why did you select to map proportions and not frequencies? Frequencies would seem a more informative metric. These maps show considerable variation between surveys very close together geographically (e.g. Vietnam and peninsular Malaysia), which would merit some mention in the Discussion.</p><p>The authors need to clarify if this model underestimates the burden of α-thalassemia diseases in Thailand due to the overlapping prevalence of α- and β-thalassemia.</p><p>The authors should clarify why Bangkok is predicted to have the highest burden of both hydrops fetalis and HbH disease (deletional and non-deletional), despite not having the highest allele frequency of α0-thalassemia (Figure 1).</p><p>The influence of consanguinity is interesting. Authors ran their predictions for 2003 both with and without an adjustment coefficient, finding a relatively small difference. Can the authors explain their decision to not include this adjustment factor in their main predictions for 2020?</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The highlight of this work was, for the first time, employment of geostatistical model to estimate burden of severe form of α-thalassemia in Thailand, and to the lesser extent in other Southeast Asian countries, in 2020. The analyses also show visualized map of α-thalassemia prevalence and genotypic diversity, which can be of a large benefit for future prevention policy in Thailand.</p><p>The strength of this work is an extensive review of relevant prevalence and genotype reports, not only from those published in international database, but also from local journals. Criteria for selection of unbiased surveys was clearly stated in the supplementary method 1. The limitation of this work was that these maps represent a prediction or estimation of prevalence. Therefore accuracy of the estimation depends largely upon availability of published data from individual area of the region. The authors, however, clearly stated this limitation in the discussion. Overlapping prevalence of α- and β-thalassemia are also commonly observed in Thailand. This includes e.g., AEBart's disease or AEBart's with CS, clinical phenotype of which can be more severe compare to those with deletional or non-deletional HbH alone. Therefore this model remain underestimates burden of α-thalassemia diseases in Thailand in this context. Future work on model of β-thalassemia prevalence will be very helpful.</p><p>Other specific comment:</p><p>In the Result subsection “Estimates of number of affected newborns in Thailand”: The authors should clarify why Bangkok is predicted to have highest burden of both hydrops fetalis and HbH disease (deletional and non-deletional), despite not having the highest allele frequency of α0-thalassemia (Figure 1).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Hockham and colleagues present an impressive description of the available data about the burden of α-thalassaemia in Thailand and the broader ASEAN region. They make a strong case for the need for this analysis, and then detail a very thorough description of the available information, together with modelled surfaces of α-thalassaemia allele frequencies in Thailand. The scarcity of evidence outside Thailand constrained the modelling analysis to this country alone. From these maps, estimates of newborns affected by different forms of α-thalassaemia in Thailand are projected for 2020. Overall, this presentation of the evidence, and extension thereof through the modelling analysis, represents a valuable and much-needed contribution to the literature about this neglected genetic disorder – congratulations to the authors on this commendable undertaking and their clear distillation of a highly complex disorder.</p><p>The Introduction also quotes frequencies of close to 80% in Southeast Asia (citing reference 1), while values of this magnitude are not discussed in the section &quot;Overall distribution of α-thalassaemia across Southeast Asia&quot;.

The smoothing effect reflects both the quantity, size and heterogeneity of surveys included in our study. To expand on this, we have provided more details in paragraph three in the Model strengths and limitations section in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Spatial smoothing is an important component of our geostatistical model. For the modelling approach used here, the range function (i.e. the extent of spatial autocorrelation) is defined by a parameter within the SPDE framework and takes a prior distribution. The smoothing in the approximate posterior therefore balances over- and under-fitting and is necessary to ensure that the model predicts adequately without fitting the idiosyncrasies of the data. As a result, the model does not predict allele frequencies that fully reflect heterogeneity between nearby surveys. Although extensive variation in allele frequencies between different ethnic groups in similar geographic locations has been observed in Thailand (36) and other countries (e.g. Sri Lanka), this could not be reflected in our predicted allele frequencies. For example, allele frequencies of around 3.65% for the Hb CS mutation have been reported in the Khmer ethnic group in Surin and Buriram provinces, whilst our model predicts maximum allele frequencies of 1.65% here. This smoothing process can similarly explain why the highest observed αND-thalassaemia frequency of 7% in Khon Kaen was not reproduced in the predicted maps; the smoothing process is also taking into account the presence of multiple nearby surveys of larger sample size reporting lower frequencies, thereby masking the extreme value of 7%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This ND-thalassaemia model also had relatively low correlation statistics. The authors need to discuss this further, and why the range in the predicted mean map is so homogenous for the ND-thalassaemias?</p></disp-quote><p>We spent a substantial amount of time exploring alternative models for the ND-thalassaemia map, for example Gaussian models that used a higher number of nodes in the triangular mesh as well as models that used a betabinomial distribution for the observed data. However, the original model presented in the manuscript remained the best-performing model. We have added a few sentences to the end of the above Discussion paragraph to comment on the homogeneity in the predictions and the low correlation statistic as follows:</p><p>“In fact, our model-based predictions for αND-thalassaemia are remarkably homogenous and the average correlation between the observed and predicted frequencies is low (0.47). This is because the close-range heterogeneity in the observed data, coupled with the absence of a long-range trend in frequency (as is observed for α0- and α+-thalassaemia), makes it difficult for the model to discern a signal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 4-6: why did you select to map proportions and not frequencies? Frequencies would seem a more informative metric.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mapped both the proportions (Figure 3) and the frequencies (Figures 4–6), and corrected the legends accordingly. We have also amended the main text to reduce any ambiguity as follows:</p><p>“Figure 3 (Figure 3—source data 1) displays surveys that included all three α-thalassaemia forms (α0-, α+- and αND-thalassaemia), allowing relative proportions of each of the forms to be calculated without giving specific variant details.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These maps show considerable variation between surveys very close together geographically (e.g. Vietnam and peninsular Malaysia), which would merit some mention in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and we have added the following paragraph under the section Patterns of genetic variation and their public health implications in the Discussion:</p><p>“The pattern of genetic diversity observed in this study indicates variable distributions of mild and severe α-thalassaemia forms. Reasons for this are unclear. However, high variant heterogeneity has been observed for other genetic disorders (e.g. G6PD deficiency) in Southeast Asia, (34) which might suggest a similar underlying cause. In their global study, Howes et al. noted that G6PD variants were most diverse in East Asia and the West Pacific, where <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites show strong population structure with lower genetic relatedness between populations in the region. Indeed, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been shown to display genetically structured populations within Thailand alone. (35) It is possible that the evolutionary dynamics between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and haemoglobin variants, including α-thalassaemia, are more complex than we currently appreciate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to clarify if this model underestimates the burden of α-thalassemia diseases in Thailand due to the overlapping prevalence of α- and β-thalassemia.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this was briefly mentioned in the Discussion under Model strengths and limitations, we have amended the sentence to clarify, as suggested:</p><p>“Furthermore, the estimates presented here do not include compound disorders, such as EA Bart’s and EF Bart’s diseases (HbH disease with heterozygous and homozygous forms of βE, another clinically important structural β-globin variant, respectively), and therefore remain underestimates of the overall burden of α -thalassaemia disorders in Thailand.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify why Bangkok is predicted to have the highest burden of both hydrops fetalis and HbH disease (deletional and non-deletional), despite not having the highest allele frequency of α0-thalassemia (Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this point, we have amended the relevant sentence in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“The highest absolute burden of hydrops fetalis is predicted in Bangkok city (57 [CI: 13 – 151]), with its high population density, and Udon Thani (23 [CI: 6 – 66]) in the northeastern zone, where some of the highest α0-thalssaemia allele frequencies are predicted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The influence of consanguinity is interesting.

Can the authors explain their decision to not include this adjustment factor in their main predictions for 2020?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a recurring challenge associated with consanguinity data. We have added the following clarification to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We used the online global database of consanguinity estimates (www.consang.net) to identify an upper limit for the coefficient of consanguinity for Thailand (F = 0.01) (52). However, due to important variations of this coefficient between ethnic groups and the lack of reliable or high-resolution data for consanguinity, we chose not to include it in our main calculations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The strength of this work is an extensive review of relevant prevalence and genotype reports, not only from those published in international database, but also from local journals.
