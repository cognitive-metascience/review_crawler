remain active in the differentiated gonads to avoid genetic sex reprogramming, as described in adult ovaries after <italic>Foxl2</italic> ablation. <italic>Dmrt1</italic> plays a similar role in postnatal testes, but the mechanism of adult testis maintenance remains mostly unknown. <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> are required for postnatal male fertility, but their role in the adult testis has not been investigated. Here we show that after ablation of <italic>Sox9</italic> in Sertoli cells of adult, fertile <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming occurs and Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into granulosa-like cells. The process of testis regression culminates in complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, which become acellular, empty spaces among the extant Leydig cells. DMRT1 protein only remains in non-mutant cells, showing that SOX9/8 maintain <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression in the adult testis. Also, <italic>Sox9/8</italic> warrant testis integrity by controlling the expression of structural proteins and protecting Sertoli cells from early apoptosis. Concluding, this study shows that, in addition to its crucial role in testis development<italic>, Sox9</italic>, together with <italic>Sox8</italic> and coordinately with <italic>Dmrt1</italic>, also controls adult testis maintenance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15635.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15635.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15635.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Scientists thought for years that the ovaries and testes are fully developed, stable organs that cannot change their structure and function in mature mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that a gene called <italic>Foxl2</italic> is active throughout life to prevent ovary cells from becoming more like the Sertoli cells present in the testes. Similarly, a gene called <italic>Dmrt1</italic> keeps Sertoli cells from becoming more like ovary cells after birth.</p><p>Scientists don’t yet know all the details about how <italic>Dmrt1</italic> prevents testes from becoming more ovary-like. For example, do genes that help testes develop in the embryo (which include two genes called <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>) play a role in maintaining the adult testes?</p><p>Barrionuevo, Hurtado, Kim et al. have now genetically engineered adult male mice to lack the <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> genes. The Sertoli cells in the testes of these mice gradually lost their key characteristics and ultimately died. During this process, the testes cells took on certain characteristics that made them more ovary-like: for example, the ovary-maintaining <italic>Foxl2</italic> gene was activated in the Sertoli cells.</p><p>Eventually, the structures in the testes that produce sperm degenerate and are replaced by empty space in the genetically engineered mice. This happens because the <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> genes control the production of proteins that maintain these structures. In addition, these genes also protect the Sertoli cells from self-destructing, and the testes-maintaining <italic>Dmrt1</italic> gene is not active when <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> are missing. More studies are now needed to determine how <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> work with <italic>Dmrt1</italic> to maintain the testes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15635.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15635.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sox9</kwd><kwd>Sox8</kwd><kwd>male-to-female genetic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>testis degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2010-16438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakkali</surname><given-names>Mohammed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK078803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sander</surname><given-names>Maike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK068471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sander</surname><given-names>Maike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG Sche 194/18-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 1104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Andalussian Government, Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P11-CVI-7291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgos</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGL2011-23368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiménez</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Andalussian Government, Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiménez</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The vertebrate testis-determining gene, <italic>Sox9</italic>, also controls adult testis maintenance in mammals, acting redundantly with its paralog <italic>Sox8</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Sox</italic> genes encode an important group of transcription factors with relevant roles in many aspects of pre- and post-natal development of vertebrates and other animal taxa. There are 20 <italic>Sox</italic> genes in vertebrates, which are classified into 9 groups. <italic>Sox8, Sox9,</italic> and <italic>Sox10 (SoxE</italic> group) are involved in many developmental processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lefebvre et al., 2007</xref>). All three <italic>SoxE</italic> genes are expressed during testis development, <italic>Sox9</italic> being essential for testis determination and <italic>Sox9/Sox8</italic> necessary for subsequent embryonic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaboissier, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrionuevo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Sox10</italic> can substitute for <italic>Sox9</italic> during testis determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Polanco et al., 2010</xref>). Undifferentiated gonads have the inherent potential to develop into two completely different organs, either as testes or as ovaries. The decision as to which fate to follow depends on the presence/absence of sex-specific factors. In the male, the Y-linked, mammalian sex-determining factor, <italic>SRY</italic>, upregulates <italic>SOX9</italic> which triggers testis differentiation, whereas in the female, the WNT/β -catenin signaling pathway becomes active and induces ovarian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2008</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Svingen and Koopman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2013</xref>). Both pathways antagonize each other: the loss of either <italic>SRY or SOX9</italic> leads to the formation of XY ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wagner et al., 1994</xref>) whereas the absence of WNT-signaling molecules such as WNT4 or RSPO1 causes XX sex reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vainio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parma et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, gain-of-function experiments confirmed this antagonism, as either upregulation of the testis promoting genes <italic>Sox9</italic> or <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in the XX bipotential gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vidal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) or ectopic activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in the XY bipotential gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maatouk et al., 2008</xref>) leads to XX and XY sex reversal, respectively. Furthermore, Sertoli cell-specific conditional inactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic> on a <italic>Sox8<sup>-/- </sup></italic>background at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), two days after the sex determination stage, leads to <italic>Dmrt1</italic> downregulation with upregulation of the ovarian-specific genes <italic>Wnt4, Rspo1</italic> and <italic>Foxl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georg et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, Sertoli cell-specific ablation of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> at the same stage (E13.5) results in ectopic expression of <italic>Foxl2</italic> by postnatal day 14 (P14) and to <italic>Sox9</italic> downregulation by P28, including male-to-female genetic reprogramming, as revealed by mRNA profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>). Again, gain-of-function experiments confirmed the existence of sexual antagonism after the sex determination period, as conditional stabilization of <italic>β-catenin</italic> in differentiated embryonic Sertoli cells (E13.5, <italic>Amh-Cre</italic>) resulted in testis cord disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). The male-vs-female genetic antagonism also persists in the adult ovary. The finding that in adult fertile females granulosa cells transdifferentiate into Sertoli-like cells after <italic>Foxl2</italic> ablation revealed that terminally differentiated female somatic cells require permanent repression of the male-promoting factors to maintain correct identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic expression of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in the adult ovary silenced <italic>Foxl2</italic> and transdifferentiated granulosa cells into Sertoli-like, <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindeman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the adult testis, a similar phenomenon appears to occur in fully functional Sertoli cells after <italic>Dmrt1</italic> ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>). In addition to cells with a Sertoli cell morphology expressing both SOX9 and FOXL2, some cells with typical granulosa cell features were also observed, including the absence of SOX9 and the presence of FOXL2. However, Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation was not unambiguously documented, as the authors used an inducible ubiquitous promoter (<italic>UBC-CreERT2</italic>) for <italic>Dmrt1</italic> ablation in adult Sertoli cells and the possible existence of genetic reprogramming was not investigated as no mRNA profiling was performed in adult mutant testes.</p><p>Nothing is known on the role of SOX9 in the adult testis, where it is expressed by Sertoli cells in a spermatogenic stage-dependent manner in several mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fröjdman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dadhich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massoud et al., 2014</xref>). Here we report the use of two Sertoli-cell-specific <italic>Cre</italic> lines (<italic>Wt1-CreERT2</italic> and <italic>Sox9-CreERT2</italic>) to induce <italic>Sox9</italic> ablation on a <italic>Sox8<sup>-/- </sup></italic>background in the adult testis, starting at postnatal day 60 (P60). We show that <italic>Sox9/8</italic> Sertoli cell-specific knockout (SC-DKO) testes undergo testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming and Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation. The process is retinoic acid (RA)-mediated and occurs as a consequence of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> downregulation. SOX9/8 are necessary to maintain <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression and thus to prevent <italic>Foxl2</italic> expression in the adult testis. Furthermore, double mutant testes exhibited complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and increased apoptosis, indicating that SOX9/8 are continually required for the maintenance of testis integrityy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> are necessary for maintaining the function and integrity of adult seminiferous tubules</title><p>To investigate the function of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in the adult testis, we induced the Sertoli cell-specific ablation of <italic>Sox9</italic> in adult <italic>Sox8</italic> null mutant mice using the tamoxifen (TX)-inducible <italic>Cre-loxP</italic> mutagenesis system. We used two different <italic>CreERT2</italic> mouse lines, a <italic>Wt1</italic> knock-in line (<italic>Wt1-CreERT2;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al, 2008</xref>), and a <italic>Sox9</italic> BAC-transgenic line (<italic>Sox9-CreERT2;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopp et al, 2011</xref>). To check the Cre recombination efficiency, we introduced the R26R-EYFP allele in both <italic>Sox9-CreERT2</italic> and <italic>Wt1-CreERT2</italic> double homozygous <italic>Sox9/8</italic> knockout (DKO) mutants. <italic>Sox8/9</italic> DKO mice fed with a TX-supplemented diet for a maximun of 30 days starting at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) showed EYFP expression in a reduced number of Sertoli cells already 10 days after the beginning of TX administration (10 datx, P70) in the two <italic>CreERT2</italic> lines. The number of EYFP<sup>+</sup> Sertoli cells increased in both lines at later time-points, the <italic>Sox9-CreERT2 </italic>line showing always a higher number of positive cells than the <italic>Wt1-CreERT2</italic> line. From P150 (90 datx) on, the EYFP signal occupied the whole area of the seminiferous tubule section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ba</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the fact that the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells is very large and complex in shape, together with the severe shrinkage that <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO seminiferous tubules have undergone by this time, made it very difficult to identify individual EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells in these testes. Hence we performed immunofluorescence for SOX9 and counted the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells per transversal testis cord section. At P90 (30 datx) all seminiferous tubules still contained many positive cells, but the number was clearly reduced by P120 (60 datx) and even more by P150 (90 datx), when some testis cords were completely devoid of SOX9<sup>+</sup>cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bb–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B</xref>). At this later stage, the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells per seminiferous tubule cross section decreased to 15.39 ± 3.36 (37% reduction) in the testes of the <italic>Wt1-CreERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>[<italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO (<italic>Wt1</italic>)] mice and to 7.49 ± 3.61 (69% reduction) in those of the <italic>Sox9-CreERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/- </sup></italic>[<italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO (<italic>Sox9</italic>)] mice, when compared to controls (24.31 ± 2.94) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bd</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The fact that the number of recombinant Sertoli cells lacking <italic>Sox9</italic> in these mutant mice continues decreasing for several weeks after the end of the period of TX administration (30 days) suggests that many newly recombined cells appear after that time (persistence of TX in the body) and that perhaps either the <italic>Sox9</italic> transcript or the protein, or both, are very stable in adult Sertoli cells, so that the gene product may remain for days or weeks in the cell after the gene ablation event. We also found that the reduction of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells varied among testis cords and among animals. We selected the most affected regions of the most affected individuals for further analyses.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15635.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> maintain the function and integrity of the adult mouse testis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the time course of TX administration.

In contrast, our <italic>Sox8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sock et al., 2001</xref>) do not show such a severe testicular phenotype and males are normally fertile even at P180. At the histological level, our <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice appeared normal until P120, but showed signs of germ cell desquamation (sloughing) afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–f</xref>). Genetic background differences between the two <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lines may explain these phenotypic discrepancies. TX-treated controls were similar to untreated males, except between P80 (20 datx) and P120 (60 datx) and mainly at P90 (30 datx), when they showed some degenerating seminiferous tubules, but recovered afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ca–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–l</xref>). Testes in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO (<italic>Sox9</italic>) mice were similar to the TX-treated controls at P70 (10 datx) except for a few testis tubules with enlarged lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cg</xref>). At P80 (20datx), only few seminiferous tubules showed signs of degeneration (shrinkage and germ cell depletion), whereas this was more frequent by P90 (30 datx). In many cases, Sertoli cell-only tubules were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ch,i</xref>). By P120 (60 datx), tubules had become solid testis cords whose diameter appeared even more reduced at P150 (90 datx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cj,k</xref>). While some mice continued to exhibit this phenotype at P180 (120 datx), a subset of mice in this group was more affected. In these latter mice Sertoli and germ cells had disappeared completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cl</xref>). At later time points, all mice showed this severe testicular phenotype. This progressive degeneration of the testicular phenotype in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mice was evident when we analyzed the relative abundance of the most relevant testicular morphological features between P70 (10 datx) and P180 (120 datx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, Leydig cells appeared morphologically normal in mutant testes. <italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO (<italic>Wt1</italic>) mice exhibited a similar testicular phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4m–r</xref>). These results show that <italic>Sox8</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> alleles act redundantly in adult Sertoli cells and are necessary to maintain the integrity of the seminiferous tubules of functional testes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Functional status of both somatic and germ cells in testes with <italic>Sox9/8</italic>-deficient Sertoli cells</title><p>To better define the mutant phenotype, we next studied the expression of several somatic and germ cell markers. Laminin, a principal component of the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 1995</xref>) persisted in both P150 (90 datx) and P180 (120 datx) testes of SC-DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Db,c</xref>). <italic>Alpha smooth muscle actin</italic> (<italic>Acta2</italic>) expressed by both peritubular myoid (PM) cells and arterialmuscle fibers was detected in the testes of both TX-treated controls and P150 (90 datx) SC-DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dd,e</xref>). In contrast, at P180 (120 datx), strong arterial ACTA2 signal persisted but that of PM cells was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Df</xref>). This shows that acellular cords in severely affected SC-DKO testes have lost not only Sertoli and germ cells, but also PM cells. Claudin11 is a principal component of tight junctions, the main junctional structures forming the blood-testis barrier (BTB). <italic>Cldn11</italic> (the claudin11 gene) expression was similar between controls and double mutants before P150 (90 datx) (not shown), but it was severely reduced by P150 (90 datx) and completely absent in P180 (120 datx) <italic>Sox9/8</italic> mutant testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dg–i</xref>), indicating that the BTB is not functional in these testes. To proof this assumption, we tested the permeability of the BTB of P120 (60 datx) mice with a biotin tracer experiment revealing that control testes had a functional BTB, whereas that of the mutant testes had become permeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We also performed immunofluorescence for both PCNA, which is expressed in mitotic spermatogonia as well as in zygotene and early pachytene, but not leptotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman and Wolgemuth, 1994</xref>), and DMC1, a meiotic recombination protein marking zygotene-pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). At P60 (30 datx), most mutant seminiferous tubules exhibited a clear reduction of spermatogenic activity and some spermatocytes were abnormally located in the inner region of the tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dk</xref>) and not at the periphery, as seen in TX-treated control testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dj</xref>). In P120 (60 datx) testes, spermatocytes were scarce and only proliferating spermatogonia were seen in most testis tubules (not shown), while at P150 (90 datx), both spermatogonia and spermatocytes had disappeared in most tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dl</xref>). These results indicate that spermatogenesis becomes disrupted in testes with Sertoli cells deficient for both <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic>. Unlike other somatic cells, Leydig cells appear not to be seriously affected in testes from <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mice. These cells do not transdifferentiate into theca cells, as they never express <italic>Foxl2</italic> (as theca cells do; not shown), and maintain the steroidogenic function for a long time after <italic>Sox9</italic> ablation, as deduced from the expression of P450scc, a cytochrome involved in the synthesis of testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dm,n</xref>). Consistently, the testosterone-producing enzyme <italic>HSD17b3</italic> and the marker for adult functional Leydig cells <italic>Insl3</italic> are expressed at high levels in the mutant testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Somatic testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in the absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in adult mouse testes</title><p>The loss of <italic>Foxl2</italic> in adult granulosa cells results in a somatic ovary-to-testis genetic reprogramming with granulosa-to-Sertoli cell transdifferentiation which includes <italic>Sox9</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>).

To test whether a similar phenomenon took place in our <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mice, we carried out immunofluorescence for FOXL2. At P90 (30 datx), FOXL2 protein was almost completely absent from mutant testes. However, by P105 (45 datx), positive cells were present in almost all testis cords, and by P150 (90 datx), the most severely affected mice showed many FOXL2-positive cells within almost all testis cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results show that transdifferentiation also occurs in adult <italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO Sertoli cells. Accordingly, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of P150 untreated control testis, P150 (90 datx) control and mutant testis and control ovary. Our results show that SC-DKO testes exhibit a striking feminization of the testicular transcriptome. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a Log<sub>2</sub>-fold-change heat map including the 12,380 genes detected to have significant differential expression between the five sample conditions (the complete list of genes with differential expression is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). With the exception of a few gene clusters, most genes in mutant testes adopted an ovary-like expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Cluster analyses of all genes, both by replicates and by conditions, showed that mutants are clustered together, with no clear distinction between <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> and <italic>Wt1-CreER</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, pairwise gene sets with significant differential expression at α &lt; 0.05 demonstrated that the number of differentially expressed genes is higher when mutants were compared with testis controls than when compared with ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Accordingly, the distance map is higher between mutant and control testis than between mutant testis and ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The same results were obtained when comparing isoforms, transcription start sites or coding DNA sequences (not shown). Expression heat maps for selected 39 ovarian somatic cell-specific genes and 33 oocyte-specific genes selected using bioGPS (biogps.gnf.org) revealed that the cell reprogramming observed in the SC-DKO testes only affects somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, bar plots for six genes known to be adult granulosa cell markers showed that these genes were upregulated in the mutant Sertoli cells, revealing an ovary-like expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, within the seminiferous cords of SC-DKO testes we found a few FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells expressing the enzyme aromatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Several pieces of evidence show that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells in our mutant testes originate from <italic>Sox9/8</italic> null Sertoli cells. The two gene promoters we used to drive <italic>Cre</italic> expression (<italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Wt1</italic>) are Sertoli cell-specific in the testis, indicating that transdifferentiation originates directly from this cell type. Importantly, we found that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells always located inside testis cords with strong expression of the Cre-recombination reporter EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also analyzed the expression of WT1, a Sertoli cell marker whose expression is maintained after <italic>Sox9/8</italic> ablation in embryonic mouse Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>), and that it is co-expressed with FOXL2 in granulosa cells of immature, but not mature, follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce</xref>). At P90 (30 datx) we observed many WT1<sup>+</sup> Sertoli cells that have already lost SOX9 (green cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bb</xref>). The number of WT1<sup>+</sup> SOX9<sup>-</sup> cells decreased by P150 (90 datx) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">(Figure 3Bc</xref>), indicating that recombined Sertoli cells were being lost. This decrease in the number of WT1<sup>+</sup> SOX9<sup>-</sup> Sertoli cells coincides with an increase in the number of FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells which either retain weak WT1-staining or are WT1<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells originate from cells previously expressing WT1, that is Sertoli cells. Altogether, these results indicate that <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO testes experience a cell-autonomous Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation which triggers the observed testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in these gonads.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15635.018</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of the somatic cells expressing FOXL2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double immunofluorescence for FOXL2 (green, nuclear) and EYFP (red, cytoplasmic) (<bold>B</bold>) Double immunofluorescence for SOX9 and WT1 in P150 (90 datx) TX-treated control (<italic>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) testes (a) and <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO testes analyzed at P90 (30 datx) (b) and P150 (90 datx) (c).

We found that cells coexpressing SOX9 and FOXL2 were rare at any stage analyzed [12 out of 203 FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed SOX9 at P120 (60 datx)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that <italic>Foxl2</italic> upregulation requires previous elimination of both SOXE proteins. Next, we examined the expression of both <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO testes. As <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is expressed in both Sertoli cells and spermatogonia of adult testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raymond et al., 2000</xref>), we used a third marker, PCNA, that labels spermatogonia as well as zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes. Whereas all Sertoli cells in control testes showed strong staining for both DMRT1 and SOX9 (SS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ba</xref>), mutant Sertoli cells showed varying degrees of both SOX9 and DMRT1 staining intensity, although they normally paralleled each other in intensity. Therefore Sertoli cells with a weak staining for both DMRT1 and SOX9 (WS) were also visible in these testes. Consistent with this, we found a very reduced number of cells expressing only DMRT1 at P90 (30 datx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bb–d</xref>, red cells (arrow); SOX9<sup>-</sup> DMRT1<sup>+</sup> PCNA<sup>-</sup>) and almost none at P120 (60 datx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Be–g</xref>). Furthermore, in P150 (90 datx) testes, which are almost devoid of germ cells, DMRT1 immunoreactivity was almost exclusively restricted to SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Double WT1-DMRT1 staining confirmed that as early as at P90 (30 datx) many WT1<sup>+</sup> cells (Sertoli cells) have already lost DMRT1 expression (green cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cb</xref>), showing that <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is downregulated after <italic>Sox9</italic> ablation and before <italic>Wt1</italic> downregulation occurs in SC-DKO testes. In addition, as observed for SOX9 and FOXL2 (see above), DMRT1 and FOXL2 only colocalize in a reduced number of cells in the testes of our <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mice [16 out of 127 FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed DMRT1 at P120 (60 datx)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these findings support the notion that SOX9 and SOX8 are necessary for the maintenance of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression in adult Sertoli cells and that these testis-promoting factors negatively regulate <italic>Foxl2</italic>.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15635.019</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Role of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double immunofluorescence for SOX9 and FOXL2 in TX-treated control (<italic>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) testis (a), <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mutant testes analyzed at P105 (45 datx) and P150 (90 datx) (b,c) and a control ovary (d) (b' is a higher magnification of the area marked in b).

During embryonic development the newly formed Sertoli cells can transdifferentiate to their ovarian counterparts when the testis promoting factors <italic>Sox9</italic> or <italic>Dmrt1</italic> are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>). The finding that <italic>Foxl2</italic> in the adult ovary was necessary to prevent granulosa-to-Sertoli cell transdifferentation revealed that this antagonism also operates in the adult gonad. In the adult testis, the same antagonism also appears to exist, as FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells were observed when <italic>Dmrt1</italic> was ubiquitously deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>). Here we show that Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation can be induced as well in the adult mouse testis by just deleting two <italic>SoxE</italic> genes<italic>, Sox9 and Sox8.</italic> These results evidence that <italic>Sox9</italic> has a crucial role, not only during sex determination and testis differentiation, but also in adult testis maintenance, where, together with <italic>Sox8</italic> and coordinately with <italic>Dmrt1,</italic> it prevents male-to-female genetic reprogramming.</p><p>The regulatory relationship between <italic>Dmrt1</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> requires further discussion. At the sex determination stage of the mouse (E11.5), both <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Dmrt1</italic> are expressed in the early embryonic testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>), but whereas early embryonic <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants show sex reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaboissier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrionuevo et al., 2006</xref>), early embryonic <italic>Dmrt1</italic> KO mice have testes that express <italic>Sox9</italic> and appear histologically normal until P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raymond et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression is independent of DMRT1 during sex determination and some time thereafter. Similarly, Sertoli cell-specific inactivation of <italic>Sox9/8</italic> at E13.5, shortly after the sex determination stage, leads to a rapid downregulation of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> that becomes already visible four days later, at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georg et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Dmrt1</italic> ablation at E13.5 results in a very delayed <italic>Sox9</italic> downregulation, which is seen at P14 (one month later), coinciding with <italic>Foxl2</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>). This suggests again that <italic>Sox9</italic> expression is independent of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in newly differentiated Sertoli cells and that the loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> after <italic>Dmrt1</italic> ablation is a secondary consequence of the upregulation of ovarian genes(s), such as <italic>Foxl2</italic>, in the same cells. On the other hand, several observations suggest the transactivation of <italic>SOX9</italic> by DMRT1: 1) DMRT1 binds near the <italic>Sox9</italic> locus in P28 mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2011a</xref>), 2) ectopic expression of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in embryonic XX gonads causes XX sex reversal with upregulation of <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) and 3) <italic>FOXL2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> sex reversed polled goats undergo a process of transdifferentiation in which <italic>DMRT1</italic> expression precedes the upregulation of <italic>SOX9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elzaiat et al., 2014</xref>). In the latter two cases, however, female-promoting genes, including <italic>FOXL2</italic>, are either downregulated or not expressed, and thus, <italic>SOX9</italic> upregulation could be again an indirect consequence of the downregulation of female-promoting genes. Here we provide evidence that in the adult gonad, mutant <italic>Sox9/8</italic> Sertoli cells lose DMRT1, and that FOXL2 protein appears concomitant with the loss of DMRT1, consistent with the notion that <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression is SOX9/8-dependent and that DMTR1 represses <italic>Foxl2</italic>. Additional observations support this view: 1) nearly all the genes strongly affected by the loss of DMRT1 were also affected by the loss of SOX9/8; 2) Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation observed in the testes of our <italic>Sox9/8</italic> mutant mice may be reduced by decreasing levels of RA, a signaling pathway known to be blocked by DMRT1 in Sertoli cells to prevent <italic>Foxl2</italic> expression and transdifferentiation into granulosa-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minkina et al., 2014</xref>); 3) DMRT1 can silence <italic>Foxl2</italic> in the absence of SOX9 and SOX8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindeman et al., 2015</xref>); and 4) <italic>Sox9</italic> is upregulated in the adult ovary after the ectopic expression of <italic>Dmrt1</italic>, coinciding with <italic>Foxl2</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindeman et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, available data suggest that, like at earlier stages, a main role for SOX9/8 in adult male sex maintenance is to keep <italic>Dmrt1</italic> actively expressed, this latter gene having a fundamental role in repressing female-specific genes. However, these observations do not rule out the possibility that DMRT1 is also necessary for the maintenance of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in the adult testis and that a feed-forward regulatory loop between <italic>Sox9/8</italic> and <italic>Dmrt1</italic> exists that ensures testis maintenance and antagonizes the feminizing action of <italic>Foxl2</italic>. Additional experiments (e.g. a time course of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in adult SC-DKO <italic>Dmrt1</italic> mice) will help to clarify this issue.</p><p>There is evidence that <italic>Wt1</italic> acts upstream of both <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> during the early stages of embryonic testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>). In the adult testis, we have seen that <italic>Sox9/8</italic>-depleted Sertoli cells initially maintain WT1 expression, but this expression becomes progressively downregulated coinciding with the time-point at which <italic>Foxl2</italic> is upregulated. This suggests that <italic>Wt1</italic> retains its hierarchical position also in the adult testis, and that female-specific factors, including <italic>Foxl2,</italic> may be involved in its silencing. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 2004</xref>), we detected two types of granulosa cells in the normal adult ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce</xref>): 1) those located in antral (mature) follicles express FOXL2 but not WT1, and 2) those located in pre-antral follicles express both proteins. Thus, considering these two molecular markers, transdifferentiation of <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO Sertoli cells seems to give rise to mature follicle-type granulosa cells. This expression pattern also suggests that WT1 may play an anti-feminizing role in adult Sertoli cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SOX9 and SOX8 are necessary to maintain tubular architecture and function in adult testes</title><p>We have reported here that the functional redundancy between the <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> alleles observed in embryonic Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>) and other embryonic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaboisier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stolt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reginensi et al., 2011</xref>) is also maintained in adult Sertoli cells. The phenotype of mutant testes becomes ever more severe as the numbers of null alleles increase in their genotype, with extreme phenotypes observed in homozygous DKO testes 4 months after the beginning of TX treatment, at which stage seminiferous tubules have literally disappeared. As Sertoli cell proliferation stops once they obtain their adult appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kluin et al., 1984</xref>), programmed cell death in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> mutants may explain their reduction in number. Consistently, we found no SOX9<sup>+</sup> apoptotic cell by P90 (30 datx), indicating that <italic>Sox9/8</italic> initially protects Sertoli cells from apoptosis, a role previously shown for this gene in other developing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, newly differentiated FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells did also not apoptose, showing that reprogrammed granulosa-like cells are also protected from apoptosis. However, the situation was substantially different in P150 (90 datx) mutant testes, where apoptosis was intense. At these late stages of testis regression, cord structure was dramatically compromised and even Sertoli cells still expressing <italic>Sox9</italic> were seen to undergo apoptosis. It is well known that the number of Sertoli cells must reach a critical threshold to organize embryonic testicular cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmer and Burgoyne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmahl and Capel, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, our results suggest that adult testis tubules also require the presence of a minimum number of Sertoli cells to be maintained. The progressive loss of Sertoli cells after <italic>Sox9/8</italic> ablation, either by apoptosis or by transdifferentiation into granulosa-like cells, appears to reach a point of no return at which the remaining normal Sertoli cells are unable to support the tubular structure and are also induced to apoptose. Hence, our results show that SOXE factors are necessary to maintain Sertoli cell identity and seminiferous tubule integrity, as these cells maintain all the other cell types forming the tubules, which become completely disorganized in their absence.</p><p>Several findings suggest that deregulation of important structural proteins controlled by <italic>SoxE</italic> genes could be involved in the process. SOX9 controls, either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1997</xref>) or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrionuevo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georg et al., 2012</xref>), the expression of extracellular matrix proteins, which contribute importantly to the tubular structure. <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show increased BTB permeability and greatly reduced levels of α-tubulin acetylation, suggesting that impairment of the Sertoli cell cytoskeleton may have modified the microenvironment of the seminiferous epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Also, after <italic>Sox9</italic> ablation in <italic>Sox8</italic> mutants, both developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georg et al., 2012</xref>) and adult testes (present paper) experience downregulation and/or abnormal distribution of several important proteins required for the formation of Sertoli–Sertoli and/or Sertoli–germ cell adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this context, it is noteworthy that spermatogenesis is halted when the functionality of the BTB is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dadhich et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, in our <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO mouse testes, BTB permeation and cytoskeleton impairment may give rise to a damaged intra-tubular microenvironment in which spermatogenesis is not supported anymore, germ cells undergoing both apoptosis and desquamation. Altogether, available data strongly suggest that failure of <italic>Sox9/8</italic> double mutant Sertoli cells to sustain testis tubule architecture is a direct consequence of altered expression of cell adhesion molecules and probably of other structural elements such as components of the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Regarding the somatic cells of the testis, PM cells disappear in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> mutant testes, whereas Leydig cells appear not to be affected, as they express the Leydig cell markers <italic>HSD17b3</italic> and <italic>Insl3</italic>. Although PM and Leydig cell specification is induced by Sertoli cells during early testis development (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Svingen and Koopman, 2013</xref>), at later stages of testis development (E14.5 and onward) Leydig cells do not require Sertoli cells for proliferation and synthesis of testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2006</xref>). Our results in the adult testis show that adult PM cells retain their original dependence from Sertoli cells, whereas maintenance of adult Leydig cells is again Sertoli cell-independent.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Steven Munger (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Over the past few years, a new concept appears in reproductive biology showing that the sexual fate of adult supporting cells in male and female gonads is not fully determined and that transdifferentiation of granulosa to Sertoli can occur. The effect of adult knock-out of both <italic>Sox9</italic> and SOX8 was clearly awaited, given the known key roles of these genes in establishing testis fate in development. Overall this manuscript reports a tremendous amount of work with the characterization of mutant gonads at many different time-points after P60 by histology, immunohistochemistry using many relevant cell markers, and transcriptomic analyses by RNA-sequencing at one developmental stage.

By contrast, in an equivalent study on <italic>Dmrt1</italic>, Matson and colleagues treated P60 mice, carrying the UbiquitinC-cre/ERT2, by only two IP-injections of 4mg tamoxifen/mouse (Matson et al., 2011, Nature 476:101-4). And surprisingly here, after the 3-months TX-treatment the <italic>Sox9</italic> gene is far to be completely deleted as presented on Supplemental Materials and methods, first paragraph (with apparently a better efficiency of the <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> compare with the Wt1-cre; fitting with results presented in the first paragraph of the Results section). Do the authors have an idea to explain this poor efficiency of this TX-treatment? And how are they sure to study double KO <italic>Sox8/9</italic> testes?</p><p>As tamoxifen is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, its action per se remains questionable, especially on reproductive organs. A negative answer to this question could emerge from transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, as example) where TX-treated control and control testis present the same transcriptomic profile. But, uncertainty remains for TX-treatment and an eventual discrepancy between control and mutant animals. As example: it remains difficult to understand if a stage named P150 (90datx) corresponds (i) to a mouse with tamoxifen during 90 days after P60 or (ii) with tamoxifen during 30 days (from P60 to P90) then without tamoxifen from P90 to P150. In the latter case it has been better to note the stage P150 (30 datx + 60) instead of P150 (90 datx). Confusion about this arises in subsection “Transcriptome analysis” compared with the subsection “Somatic testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in the absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in adult mouse testes”; and also from sentences in the subsection “Tamoxifen administration” compared with the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> (&quot;P150 (60 datx)&quot;); and also from the first paragraph of the Results section. Authors should clarify this point all along the text, the figures and the legends of the figures. Moreover, all along the manuscript authors write &quot;TX-treated controls&quot; instead of writing &quot;PXX (ZZ datx)-control&quot; where XX will represent the stage of observation (from 70 to 180) and ZZ the duration of TX-treatment. Authors should indicate in each case how long TX has been administered to control animals. Authors should also indicate the genotype of the control. Normally, the best control of a <italic>Sox9<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup>;Sox9-CreERT2</italic>-P150 (90 datx) will be a <italic>Sox9<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>;Control-P150 (90 datx). Is it the case?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – One concern I have is that the authors may be over interpreting the observed positive linear trend in their comparison of differentially expressed gonad genes from their current (RNA-seq based) <italic>Sox9/8</italic> dco study at P150 to an earlier published microarray analysis of SC-<italic>Dmrt1</italic>KO testes at P28 (Matson et al. 2011). The authors conclude that <italic>Dmrt1</italic> and <italic>Sox9/8</italic> likely act in the same pathway because nearly all genes strongly affected by loss of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> were also affected by the loss of <italic>Sox9/8</italic>. Although I agree this is likely to be true, this pattern of gene expression could be a secondary effect of the change in relative numbers of cell types in these whole gonad samples. Any gene KO that results in loss of Sertoli cells will likely cause this change in the observed expression pattern of known sex-determining genes regardless of which specific pathway they are affecting in the Sertoli cell.</p><p>2) This was requested by one of the reviewers to assist with analysis of data.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also shows double &quot;weak staining&quot; and in contrast with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> provides only merge for SOX9 and FOXL2, the single colors for each staining should be added to convince the reader.

Address potential indirect reproductive effects from TX.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers were concerned about four main issues:</p><p>A) The administration of the tamoxifen (TX) treatment and the notation we used to refer to the analyzed stages;</p><p>B) The CRE recombination efficiency;</p><p>C) The possible collateral effects that TX could have had on the phenotype of our control and mutant mice;</p><p>D) Our interpretation of the results when comparing our RNA-seq data with those from the microarray analysis of SC-<italic>Dmrt1</italic>KO P28 testes performed by Matson et al. (2011).</p><p>A) Regarding the tamoxifen treatment, the reviewers stated that the “authors have mainly characterized testes after a 3 months exposure to tamoxifen”.</p><p>This is a clear confusion as in the Results section and Materials and methods section of our first version of the manuscript it was indicated that diet treatment lasted for 30 days/one month. We initially treated adult mice with TX at a concentration of 30mg/ml and 0.16 mg of TX per gram of body mass using a feeding needle for 5 consecutive days. However, <italic>Sox9/8</italic> double mutants displayed 90% lethality with this treatment. This is probably related to the fact that <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display an idiopathic body mass reduction and are weaker than WT ones, as reported previously (Sock et al., 2001. Idiopathic weight reduction in mice deficient in the high-mobility-group transcription factor <italic>Sox8</italic>. Mol Cell Biol. 21: 6951–6959). Then, we reduced the dose of TX (down to 0.07 mg TX / gr of body mass) and 90% of <italic>Sox9/8</italic> double mutants survived, but the efficiency of CRE recombination in adult Sertoli cells fell then to below 20%. Since acute/short TX treatments were clearly useless in our animal model, we then tried to feed mice with a TX-supplemented diet (40mg TX/100g Harlan 2914 diet) for one month (never for three months).</p><p>TX administration always started at 2 months (postnatal stage P60) and finished just 30 days later (at P90). Thus, a stage named “P150 (90 datx)” (datx: days after TX treatment initiation) corresponds to a mouse treated for 30 days with TX-supplemented diet (from P60 to P90) and fed afterwards with normal diet, from P90 to P150. This treatment resulted in a 100% survival rate and permitted us to induce outstanding phenotypes in the mutant animals. So, all the data presented in the manuscript, except those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and 3 (see below for an explanation), were obtained from mice treated with the TX-supplemented diet as described (one month).</p><p>We assume that, like the reviewers, any other reader could also be confused regarding TX-treatment and admit that our ms was not clear enough in this respect. For this reason, as suggested by the editors, we have included a diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) illustrating the experimental schedule of the TX treatment and explaining how we have noted the main stages analyzed in the study. In our opinion, including this information at the very beginning of the Results section will ensure to make this point definitely clear. Hence, we believe that our original notation of the analyzed stages [P150 (90datx), for instance] will now be easily understandable for the reader, so we decided to keep it as it stands. Nevertheless, we would change the notation as suggested by the reviewers [P150 (30 datx + 60), for instance] if the editor/reviewers still consider that this system is better.</p><p>The reviewers also had some concerns regarding the TX-treated controls. Control animals shared the same cages and diet with mutant ones, so both control and mutant mice received exactly the same treatment. So, we do not see the need and convenience of using a different notation for them. The treatment of control animals was always indicated in the figures and in the figure legends. For instance, in the frame at the top of Figure 1Bb (the new one) it is simply noted Control, but in another frame placed just below it is noted the stage [P150 (90 datx)] which evidences that both control and mutants were treated with TX in the same way. The same system was used in all figures. In addition to the mutant samples, we always placed testis sections from four control animals in our IFs and IHCs histological preparations: WT (both TX-treated and untreated) and <italic>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (both TX-treated and untreated). Notably, we never found a significant difference between them in the expression pattern of any of the markers we analyzed in this study. Moreover, the micrographs we selected to be included in the figures were always from the TX-treated <italic>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Nevertheless, following the reviewers’ recommendations, we have included in the figure legends the genotype of every control mouse that was not explicitly mentioned in the text.</p><p>Similarly, changes have been made in several points of the text (subsection “Somatic testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in the absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in adult mouse testes”, first paragraph, subsection “Tamoxifen administration” and subsection “Transcriptome analysis”), for which the reviewers reported some confusion on TX treatment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and 3 report data from the only experiments in which mice were not treated with a TX-supplemented diet (see above). Instead, TX was administered orally with a feeding-gauge needle. We started using the WT1-CRE line to generate the SC <italic>Sox9/8</italic> DKO mice, and TX was initially administered either intraperitoneally or with a feeding-gauge needle (we obtained better results with the feeding needle). All control and mutant mice with compound homozygous and heterozygous genotypes containing less than 2 <italic>Sox8</italic> null alleles (either 0 or 1) tolerated well the TX treatment, but those containing 2 <italic>Sox8</italic> null alleles exhibited high lethality, permitting us to analyze only some few surviving animals. Nevertheless, the fact is that the results obtained in those initial studies clearly show the redundancy between <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in adult testis maintenance, and we considered unnecessary and inappropriate to sacrifice so many additional animals for simply repeating the same experiment using the TX-supplemented diet. This is why we included the following sentence in our first version of the manuscript: “All results presented here, except those included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, were obtained from mice fed with the TX-supplemented diet.”</p><p>According to these considerations, and in order to avoid any confusion in the rest of the manuscript, we have made changes in the text as shown in legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The reviewers also expressed some concern regarding the sentence in the first paragraph of the Results section, but we believe that with the above changes this sentence is actually not confusing in the new version.</p><p>B) Regarding TX, the reviewers had another concern related to the presumed low efficiency of our treatment system, compared with that used by Matson et al. (2011, Nature 476:101-104).</p><p>As far as we know, no paper has reported to date a TX-induced CRE recombination in adult mouse Sertoli cells showing an efficiency higher than the one we present here. Matson and col. used Ubc-CRE/ERT2 mice to delete <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in adult mice and they observed that after TX injection DMRT1 expression declined rapidly in germ cells while remained constant in Sertoli cells over the following 8 days (Matson et al., 2010) The mammalian doublesex homolog DMRT1 is a transcriptional gatekeeper that controls the mitosis versus meiosis decision in male germ cells. Dev. Cell 19, 612–624]. In the 2011 work, they used the same mice and the same treatment, and they were able to show just a few (only 4) FOXL2+ cells within a testis cord one month after TX administration, evidencing a very low recombination efficiency in Sertoli cells. Actually, no data about the efficiency or kinetics of CRE recombination in Sertoli cells was reported in that paper. Other studies have also revealed that TX-induction of CRE-mediated recombination in adult Sertoli cells it is not an easy task with the available tools. For example, conditional inactivation of Wt1 using a CAG-CRE, revealed efficient recombination in kidney, ovary, pancreas, spleen, lung, and uterus, but not in Sertoli cells (Chau, You-Ying et al., 2011). Acute multiple organ failure in adult mice deleted for the developmental regulator Wt1. PLoS Genet 7.12: e1002404]. Here we show that the number of SOX9+ cells per seminiferous tubule cross section decreased to 37% in the testes of the <italic>Wt1- Cre-ERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and to 69% in the <italic>Sox9-Cre-ERT2;Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testes when compared to controls (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This reduction is even more pronounced if we compare the Sashimi plots for <italic>Sox9</italic> obtained from our transcriptome data (see supplemental Materials and methods), which show a reduction of the WT <italic>Sox9</italic> transcripts of 57% and 80% for the <italic>Wt1-Cre</italic> DKO and the <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> DKO lines, respectively. Thus, we disagree with the notion that we managed with low CRE recombination efficiency in our experiments. Rather, we believe we were able to develop a TX administration schedule that provides the highest CRE recombination efficiency reported to date in Sertoli cells (demonstrated with two different mouse CRE lines). We consider that this method could be a valuable tool for future gene targeting studies in adult Sertoli cells.</p><p>Based on the presumed low efficiency of CRE recombination, the reviewers asked: “how are they (the authors) sure to study double KO <italic>Sox8/9</italic> testes”? We are absolutely sure we studied double KO <italic>Sox8/9</italic> testes for two reasons:</p><p>1) We have used a <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse in which the WT SOX8 protein is absent, as reported previously (Sock et al., 2001) Idiopathic weight reduction in mice deficient in the high-mobility-group transcription factor <italic>Sox8</italic>. Mol Cell Biol. 21: 6951–6959]. Consistent with this, the Sashimi plots for <italic>Sox8</italic> obtained from our transcriptome data (see Supplemental Materials and methods) show that in the <italic>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Sox8</italic> transcripts only conserve the 5’ untranslated region, demonstrating that these individuals are actually homozygous for a <italic>Sox8</italic> null allele.</p><p>2) The Sashimi plots for <italic>Sox9</italic> confirm that, as expected according to the features of the <italic>Sox9<sup>flox</sup></italic> line we used (Kist et al. (2002). Conditional inactivation of <italic>Sox9</italic>: a mouse model for campomelic dysplasia. Genesis 32: 121–123], CRE recombination generates <italic>Sox9</italic> transcripts lacking the 2nd and 3rd exons. In addition, our IF studies demonstrated that the SOX9 protein is highly reduced in the SC <italic>Sox9/8</italic> adult testes after TX administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>C) “Address potential indirect reproductive effects from Tx”.</p><p>Two previous studies have investigated the effect of TX on male fertility on rats: 1) Gopalkrishnan, et al. (1998) Tamoxifen-induced light and electron microscopic changes in the rat testicular morphology and serum hormonal profile of reproductive hormones. Contraception, 57: 261-269; and 2) Gill-Sharma et al., (1993) Effects of tamoxifen on the fertility of male rats. J. Reprod. Fertil. 99: 395-402. In these studies, TX was administered during 90 days at different concentrations: 0.04, 0.2 and 0.4 mg TX /gr body weight/day. The authors observed a progressive degeneration of the germinative epithelium already detectable by day 10 after TX administration. By day 50, the phenotype was quite severe, with prominent reduction of the germinative epithelium thickness and low numbers of spermatids and spermatozoa. The severity of this phenotype increased with the TX concentration.</p><p>Importantly, they also showed that this reduced fertility was completely restored 90 days after drug withdrawal. We have administered to our mice a dosage equivalent to the lowest used in these studies (0.04 TX /gr body weight/ day). In fact, we supplemented our diet with 40 mg TX/100 mg food; a 25 mg mouse eats around 3 gr of food per day and our mice were fed only for 30 days with this diet. We described the effect of this concentration of TX:: “TX-treated controls were similar to untreated males, except between P80 (20 datx) and P120 (60 datx) and mainly at P90 (30 datx), when they showed some degenerating seminiferous tubules, but recovered afterwards”. Additional related information is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>Indeed, at the histological level, P90 (30 datx) testes showed degenerating seminiferous tubules, and the number of spermatozoa was reduced, but at P120 (60 datx) control testes showed almost no difference with the testes of P120 untreated males. At P150 we found no difference between treated (90 datx) and untreated testes. At this later stage, transcriptome comparison showed no difference between TX-treated and untreated testes. In addition, we found no difference in the expression pattern of several proteins analyzed by IHC and IF between TX-treated and untreated controls at any stage.</p><p>Thus, we are confident that TX treatment did not affect the results of our study on <italic>Sox9/8</italic> mutant mice.</p><p>D) Another concern of the reviewers was that “the authors may be over interpreting the observed positive linear trend in their comparison of differentially expressed gonad genes from their current (RNA-seq based) <italic>Sox9/8</italic> dco study at P150 to an earlier published microarray analysis of SC-<italic>Dmrt1</italic>KO testes at P28 (Matson et al. 2011)”.</p><p>We believe the reviewers are correct. A possibility remains that the coincident gene expression pattern observed in these two profiling studies could also have been a secondary effect of the changes in the relative numbers of cell types occurred in both cases. Accordingly, we have changed the text in order to include this possibility (see subsection “Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation is mediated by <italic>Dmrt1</italic> downregulation in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO testes”, second paragraph). We observed that nearly all genes strongly affected by the loss of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> were also affected by the loss of <italic>Sox9/8</italic>, with a regression line whose scope is nearly 1. Based on this, we stated that these results suggest that “both <italic>Dmrt1</italic> and <italic>Sox9/8</italic> act in the same pathway”. But this is just another finding in support of this hypothesis, not the only one. Additional supporting evidence exist: 1) in both <italic>Sox9/8</italic> and <italic>Dmrt1</italic> mutants, <italic>Foxl2</italic> is upregulated; 2) <italic>Sox9/8</italic> ablation leads to <italic>Dmrt1</italic> downregulation; 3) <italic>Dmrt1</italic> ablation leads to <italic>Sox9/8</italic> downregulation; and 4) in both <italic>Sox9/8</italic> and <italic>Dmrt1</italic> mutants, RA-signaling pathway is affected. Overall, available evidence supports the notion that these two genes act in the same pathway in Sertoli cells.</p><p><italic>2) Include Excel table of differential expression comparison from RNA-seq.</italic></p><p>We have included the differential expression comparison from RNA-seq in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, we made a call to this file in the subsection “Somatic testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in the absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> in adult mouse testes”, and we have included a legend.</p><p><italic>3) Moderate any conclusions made on the basis of weak double staining in confocal images.</italic> </p><p>The single color channels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref> were already included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> of the first version of the manuscript. In a former revised version of this manuscript submitted to another journal, we composed a different <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> including the single color channels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>. However, one of the reviewers’ concerns was that the resulting figure was overwhelming. That is why in this version of the manuscript we decided to include the single channels in a supplemental figure. As suggested by the <italic>eLife</italic> reviewers, we have counted 203 FOXL2+ cells from 4 animals at P120 (60 datx) and 12 of them coexpressed SOX9. Likewise, we counted 127 FOXL2+ cells from 4 animals at P120 (60 datx) and 16 coexpressed DMRT1. We changed the text accordingly in the first paragraph of the subsection “Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation is mediated by <italic>Dmrt1</italic> downregulation in <italic>Sox9/8</italic> SC-DKO testes”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
