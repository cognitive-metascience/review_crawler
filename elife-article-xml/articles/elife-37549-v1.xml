Yet in contrast to the singular neuroepithelial tube from which the entire central nervous system (CNS) develops in vivo, current organoid protocols yield tissues with multiple neuroepithelial units, a.k.a. neural rosettes, each acting as independent morphogenesis centers and thereby confounding coordinated, reproducible tissue development. Here, we discover that controlling initial tissue morphology can effectively (&gt;80%) induce single neural rosette emergence within hPSC-derived forebrain and spinal tissues. Notably, the optimal tissue morphology for observing singular rosette emergence was distinct for forebrain versus spinal tissues due to previously unknown differences in ROCK-mediated cell contractility. Following release of geometric confinement, the tissues displayed radial outgrowth with maintenance of a singular neuroepithelium and peripheral neuronal differentiation. Thus, we have identified neural tissue morphology as a critical biophysical parameter for controlling in vitro neural tissue morphogenesis furthering advancement towards biomanufacture of CNS tissues with biomimetic anatomy and physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd>organoid morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>neural rosette</kwd><kwd>stem cell bioengineering</kwd><kwd>advanced biomanufacturing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF-1418976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willett</surname><given-names>Rebecca M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 U54 AI117924-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willett</surname><given-names>Rebecca M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIS-1447449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willett</surname><given-names>Rebecca M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001589</institution-id><institution>Environmental Protection Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>83573701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>Randolph Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS082618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>Randolph Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1014150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>Randolph Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1651645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>Randolph Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33NS082618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>Randolph Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bioengineering approach identifies tissue morphology as an effective variable for controlling the inception of neural organoid morphogenesis via induction of a biomimetic, singular neural rosette tissue cytoarchitecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The derivation of organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has redefined the possibilities of in vitro tissue engineering. Human PSCs have traditionally been characterized by their ability to spontaneously recapitulate facets of developmental tissue morphogenesis upon ectopic implantation in vivo, that is the teratoma assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomson et al., 1998</xref>). However, more recent discovery of their ability to also self-organize emergence of organotypic tissues in vitro, for example cortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>), retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>), cerebral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>) and intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watson et al., 2014</xref>), has spurred the creation of novel developmental and disease models with unprecedented biomimicry of microscale cytoarchitectures and cell phenotype diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasai, 2013</xref>). The innate emergent properties of hPSCs could serve as the basis for advanced biomanufacture of functional tissue and organ models or even transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Workman et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, it remains a challenge to engineer reproducible hPSC morphogenesis in vitro and thereby enable controlled emergence of organotypic tissues with standardized cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marti-Figueroa and Ashton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Human PSC-derived neural organoids commence with a pseudoneurulation event generating pseudostratified neuroepithelial cells (NECs). In this dynamic process, NECs polarize adherens, for example N-cadherin, and tight junction proteins towards an apical lumen while depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins at their basal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert, 2006</xref>). In vivo, neurulation results in emergence of a singular neuroepithelial tube that spans the entire rostrocaudal (R/C) axis of the embryo’s dorsal plane and serves as the primordium of all CNS tissues. This singular polarized neuroepithelium serves as a critical morphogenesis center for organizing establishment of lamellar tissue cytoarchitectures during subsequent stages of development. For example, it localizes waves of mitotic NEC proliferation at the tube’s apical surface while daughter cells migrate radially towards the basal surface to complete differentiation, functional maturation, and expand the CNS parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). Disruption of the neuroepithelial tube’s N-cadherin polarized cytoarchitecture eliminates the sole neurogenic source of embryonic CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>). Alternatively, the presence of multiple neural tubes during development causes congenital abnormalities such as dipolmyelia and diastematomyelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cogliatti, 1986</xref>) or anencephaly as observed in diprosopic parapagus twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spencer, 2000</xref>). Therefore, formation of a singular neuroepithelium within hPSC-derived organotypic tissues is an important cytoarchitectural feature for generating biomimetic CNS tissue models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In current 2- and 3-D hPSC-derived cultures, neurulation-like events occur spontaneously yielding uncontrolled emergence of numerous polarized neuroepithelial tissues, a.k.a. neural rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Integration of engineering techniques such as stirred-tank bioreactor culture during 3-D neural organoid derivation can induce the formation of larger and more contiguous neuroepithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renner et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, derivation of neural organoids around filamentous biomaterial scaffolds was shown to induce elongated neuroepithelial tissues within the 3-D organoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, the persistent presence of multiple neural rosettes of indiscriminate shapes and sizes within a single organotypic tissue inevitably confounds subsequent morphogenesis events and potentially limits tissue maturation. This also produces significant variability in the cytoarchitecture both within and between organoids of a single production batch. Interestingly, singular neural rosette emergence was routinely observed upon derivation of 3-D neuroepithlelial cysts, which have considerably smaller dimensions than hPSC-derived organoids and are generated from single cell mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) suspensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meinhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ranga et al., 2014</xref>). Manual isolation of singular neural rosettes from culture remains the only reliable in vitro method for generating such critical biomimetic cytoarchitecture within hPSC-derived organotypic CNS tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Geometric confinement of hPSC tissues on 2-D micropatterned substrates was recently shown to induce self-organized embryonic patterning, that is mimicking gastrulation, in a morphology dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this and previously discussed mESC-derived neuroepithlelial cysts studies, we investigated whether engineering the morphology of neurally differentiating hPSC tissues could similarly regulate neural rosette emergence. Using a custom image analysis algorithm and machine learning classifier, screens of hPSC-derived neuroepithelial tissues of various micropatterned morphologies revealed an indirect correlation between the tissue’s surface area and the propensity for singular neural rosette emergence. Circular micropatterns of 200 – 250 μm diameter (0.031 – 0.049 mm<sup>2</sup>) were observed to most effectively induce singular neural rosette emergence within forebrain neuroepithelial tissues reaching levels of 80 – 85% efficiency when initially seeded as hPSCs. These studies were further extended to develop an analogous protocol for neuroepithelial tissues of a ventral spinal cord regional phenotype. This revealed that spinal neuroepithelial tissues, unlike their forebrain counterparts, preferentially formed singular neural rosettes (73.5%) on circular micropatterns of 150 μm diameter (0.018 mm<sup>2</sup>), indicating novel biophysical differences between NECs of varying regional phenotypes. During the rosette emergence period, the proliferative neural tissues morphed from a 2-D monolayer to a 3-D, multi-layered, disk morphology of the prescribed micropatterned diameter. Upon release from micropattern confinement, the tissue slices expanded radially while maintaining a singular neuroepithelial rosette as the morphogenesis center, depositing a basal lamina, and displaying neuronal differentiation at the tissues’ periphery. Thus, we have developed a culture platform for engineering controlled neural rosette emergence within hPSC-derived organotypic CNS tissues. Reproducible induction of this nascent cytoarchitecture is a pre-requisite for advanced biomanufacture of human CNS organoids with consistent, biomimetic anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marti-Figueroa and Ashton, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of neural rosette emergence in well plate culture</title><p>Forebrain NECs were derived from hESCs using our previously published E6 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lippmann et al., 2014</xref>). In six days and without the use of SMAD inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>), the E6 protocol generates near homogenous monolayers of Pax6<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup>/N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> NECs that spontaneously produce cultures densely populated with neural rosettes of varying shapes and sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To better characterize neural rosette emergence, we conducted a time course analysis using Pax6 and N-cadherin immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lippmann et al., 2014</xref>), the onset of Pax6 expression, a human neuroectodermal fate determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2010b</xref>), began between days 2 (0%) and 3 (44 ± 15%) of the E6 protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). By day 3 and concurrent with increasing Pax6 expression, the presence of polarized N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> foci were observed. By day 5, Pax6 expression had reached 81 ± 5% and N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> polarization foci had both increased in prevalence and morphed into coherent rings surrounded by contiguous alignment of polarized NECs. Co-localization of F-actin, ZO-1 tight junction proteins, and phospho-H3<sup>+</sup> mitotic nuclei within these polarized structures further supports the use of polarized N-cadherin as a surrogate marker of neural rosette emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2012</xref>.

Interestingly, despite being D4 NECs upon seeding onto micropatterned substrates,~5 days of additional E6 culture was still required for neural rosette emergence similar to well plate culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The 5 day time point also correlated with the highest occurrence (30%, n = 100 tissues) of singular rosette emergence within micropatterned NEC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Additionally, the NECs appeared to proliferate within micropatterned tissues after seeding as indicated by increased Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells density (e.g. day 7 vs 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Persistence of the approximate 5 day time course for neural rosette emergence in E6 media indicates that temporal aspects of rosette emergence may rely on a conserved aspect of E6 culture. As a final test of the 5 day paradigm, we investigated whether seeding Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells on micropatterned substrates was requisite for adherence to the 5 day rosette emergence time course. Neurally differentiating cultures were subcultured at day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the E6 protocol, that is Pax6 expression being absent in D1-2 and present in D3-5 cultures. The cells were re-seeded onto 300 μm diameter (0.071 mm<sup>2</sup>) circular micropattern arrays. Cultures were maintained in E6 media for 5 days prior to fixation and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In all conditions, the cells proliferated and produced neuroepithelial tissues with at least a 2-fold increase in cell density, &gt;80% Pax6 expression, and consistent neural rosette formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Of note, all tested cell phenotypes were observed to initially adhere as monolayers in well plates or on micropatterned substrates even when the seeding density was increased by several folds (data not shown). These results indicate that a 5 day paradigm for neural rosette emergence in E6 media holds for cultures seeded at all stages of hESC neural induction and appears to be a function of Pax6 expression and local cell density. From here onward, a 5 day micropatterned culture period was used to assess neural rosette emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural rosette emergence is regulated by tissue morphology</title><p>The previous experiments demonstrated that switching from a 9.6 cm<sup>2</sup> (a well in a 6-well plate) to a 0.071 mm<sup>2</sup> (300μm diameter) circular neuroepithelial tissue can substantially reduce the number of emerging neural rosettes. However, formation of neuroepithelial tissues with a biomimetic, singular rosette was not reproducible (30%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

In this manner, the cell seeding density would be constant amongst tissues of differing morphologies within the same size scale. Day 4 NECs were seeded onto 0.031, 0.071, and 0.126mm<sup>2</sup> micropattern arrays at 33,300, 75,000, and 133,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, to correspond with changes in micropattern cell-adhesive area across each size scale.

Each tissue was categorized as follows: the presence of 0 or one polarization foci were ‘0 Rosette’; 1 rosette and 0 polarization foci were ‘1 Rosette’; ≥1 rosette with ≥1 additional polarization foci were ‘+1 Rosette’. Although all micropatterned tissue morphologies exhibited the capacity to induce ‘1 Rosette’ neuroepithelial tissues, 0.031mm<sup>2</sup> circular (56%) and square (57%) morphologies were the most efficient.

The physical size of emergent neural rosettes is not conserved across tissues of increasing area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). Hence, the micropatterned tissue morphology does not instruct rosette morphogenesis, but restricts tissue area to statistically favor emergence of a single rosette in accordance with innate NEC properties. Since ROCK inhibition down-regulates actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>), the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> imply that decreasing the contractility of forebrain NECs reduces the length scale over which the cells can effectively polarize to evoke a rosette structure, that is 250 μm vs. 150/180/200 μm in 0 vs. 10 μM Rock inhibitor. This further suggests that forebrain vs. spinal NECs can generate more contractile force since singular rosette emergence peaks in larger forebrain, that is 250 μm (0.049 mm<sup>2</sup>) diameter, versus smaller spinal, that is 150 μm (0.018 mm<sup>2</sup>) diameter, circular tissues. The ability of 10 μM Rock inhibitor to only partially diminish vs. fully eliminate the rosette formation capacity of forebrain vs. spinal NECs also supports this ranking of contractility. These results provide the first evidence that NEC biomechanical properties vary based on their regional patterning. They also demonstrate the necessity of customizing the micropatterned neuroepithelial tissue morphology to efficiently induce singular rosette emergence based on the cell’s regional phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Singular neural rosette cytoarchitecture is maintained during radial tissue outgrowth</title><p>The importance of maintaining a singular neuroepithelium in early CNS development is evident given severe congenital disorders associated with breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>) or duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spencer, 2000</xref>) of the neuroepithelial tube. Accordingly, we investigated whether the singular rosette structure induced within micropatterned neuroepithelial tissues would persist upon subsequent tissue growth and morphogenesis. Using our previously developed ‘clickable’ polyethylene glycol (PEG) brush chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sha et al., 2013</xref>), we synthesized array substrates that could be actuated to release the micropatterned tissues from their confinement and permit radial tissue outgrowth. In our prior publication, tissue outgrowth was enabled by in situ conjugation of –RGD peptide bioconjugates to the microarray’s PEG brushes. However, this caused aberrant migration of single cells away from the neuroepithelial tissues instead of a more coordinated, biomimetic radial tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we explored whether a clickable bioconjugate containing a heparin-binding peptide (-CGTYRSRKY) derived from Fibroblast growth factor-2 would mediate a more gradual tissue expansion. This was posited based on the fact that the heparin-binding peptide (HBP) is unable to directly promote cell migration via integrin binding but could immobilize heparin sulfate proteoglycan-bound ECM proteins (e.g. Laminin) secreted at the neuroepithelial tissues’ basal aspect upon extended culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hudalla and Murphy, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate feasibility of our proposed substrate design, micropatterned arrays with reactive, 200 μm (0.031 mm<sup>2</sup>) diameter, circular PEG brushes were fabricated and functionalized via an overnight incubation in cell culture media containing 0 to 20 μM FITC-HBP conjugated to a Malemide-PEG4-DBCO linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3A–B</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, a direct correlation between fluorescence from immobilized FITC-HBP and the incubation media concentration was observed. Culture media containing 20 μM FITC-HBP-DBCO bioconjugate provided the maximal surface density. Then, we tested whether HBP-presenting PEG brushes could sequester ECM proteins. Substrates modified with cell culture media containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 μM HBP-DBCO bioconjugate were subsequently incubated overnight in media containing 10 μM NHS-rhodamine tagged Laminin, which was isolated from a mouse sarcoma and likely co-bound with heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Imaging revealed a consistent increase in rhodamine fluorescence directly correlated with increasing surface densities of HBP. The quantified fluorescent signal saturated on substrates modified with culture media containing 10 μM HBP-DBCO bioconjugate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Thus, PEG-brushes modified in situ with 10 μM HBP-DBCO bioconjugate are capable of immobilizing Laminin proteins, and potentially a diverse cadre of basement membrane ECM proteins that bind heparin sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Next, neuroepithelial tissue outgrowth was tested on both inert and reactive PEG-grafted substrates micropatterned to display arrays of 200 μm (0.031 mm<sup>2</sup>) diameter circular culture regions with 400 μm center-to-center spacing. The substrates were coated with Matrigel to deposit ECM proteins on the 200 μm diameter culture regions. Pax6<sup>-</sup> D<sup>-</sup>1 hESCs were seeded onto the substrates at 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and maintained in E6 culture for 3 days, at which point the media was supplemented with 10.0 μM HBP-DBCO bioconjugate for 24 hr on both inert and reactive microarray substrates. After three additional days of culture, the tissues were fixed and stained for N-cadherin and Laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Inert control PEG brushes predictably maintained the restricted singular rosette tissue morphology for the culture duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, on reactive substrates modified in situ with HBP-DBCO bioconjugates, the tissues expanded as a coherent, multilayered structures maintaining a singular neuroepithelium and eventually intersecting with neighboring tissues. Also, they displayed basal deposition of laminin resembling the developing neural tube’s basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). To prevent inhibition of tissue outgrowth, the experiment was repeated on reactive micropatterned arrays with 200 μm (0.031 mm<sup>2</sup>) diameter circular regions with larger 800 μm center-to-center spacing. The in situ modification occurred on Day 4 of E6 culture, and microarrays were fixed and stained after an additional 7 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

This is currently being used to develop novel personalized neurological disease modeling platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wells et al., 2016</xref>). However, while impressive in their extent of ex vivo morphogenesis, the spontaneous and cell-intrinsic emergent properties that enable organoid formation also currently limits their wide-scale implementation due to the lack of reproducibility in their macroscale cytoarchitecture and cellular composition. In essence, we now have a glimpse of the neural organoid’s potential, but do not understand the processes that govern their morphogenesis well enough to precisely engineer their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huch et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have melded organoid technology with a biomaterial culture platform to elucidate biophysical parameters that control the genesis of human neural organoid morphogenesis, that is polarized neural epithelium formation.</p><p>Over the past decade, scientists have generated human neural organoids of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>), retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>), forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renner et al., 2017</xref>), midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jo et al., 2016</xref>), and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muguruma et al., 2015</xref>) with both neuronal and glial cellular constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paşca et al., 2015</xref>). However, a consistent limitation in creating reproducible and biomimetic neural organoid anatomy at the macroscale is the random formation of multiple polarized neuroepithelial regions, a.k.a. rosettes, which can each act as independent morphogenesis centers. Using micropatterned culture substrates, we have demonstrated that enforcing a 200 – 250 μm forebrain and 150 μm spinal, circular, neuroepithelial tissue morphology optimally induces formation of a singular rosette cytoarchitecture with 80 – 85% and 73.5% efficiency respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Our results indicate that these biophysical parameters for reproducible induction of a biomimetic, neural tube-like cytoarchitecture are dependent on local cell density, acquisition of Pax6 expression, and cell autonomous biomechanical properties such as contractility. Interestingly, while these results were consistent for tested hESC lines, micropatterned E6 differentiation of D90A <italic>SOD1</italic> mutant ALS-iPSCs also showed optimal singular, forebrain rosette emergence within 250 μm diameter circular tissues but at a lower (26%) efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This corresponded to many instances where tissues displayed a non-uniform Pax6<sup>+</sup> NEC phenotype, indicating that line-to-line variations in neural induction efficiency must be overcome for effective micropatterning of singular neural rosette emergence.</p><p>Furthermore, we have shown that the singular neural rosette cytoarchitecture can be maintained upon subsequent tissue morphogenesis. This indicates that initial constraint of tissue morphology in accordance with these identified length scales could be a generalizable approach to engineering human neural organoids with standardized nascent CNS tissue cytoarchitecture. However, we acknowledge that our micropatterned tissue do morph from 2-D monolayers into 3-D hemispherical tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and therefore, our identified optimal tissue morphology parameters may not be precisely conserved for organoids initially formed as 3-D cell aggregates.</p><p>While organoids can be used to generate novel humanoid disease models, their ability to recapitulate developmental morphogenesis ex vivo and within a human genomic background also provides unique opportunities to investigate mechanisms that orchestrate early human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). In efforts to develop a unified approach for inducing singular neural rosette emergence within neuroepithelium patterned to any CNS rostrocaudal region, we discovered that the biomechanical properties of Pax6<sup>+</sup>/N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> NECs of the dorsal forebrain differed from those of the ventral spinal cord. Forebrain NECs appear to be able to form a singular neural rosette within tissue of larger circular dimensions than spinal NECs because of their increased contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This would seem to correlate with the significantly larger dimensions of forebrain ventricles versus the spinal cord’s central canal, and could represent a novel axis between the biochemical morphogens and biomechanical properties that govern CNS morphogenesis. While our conclusions are based on observations from correlated perturbations of ROCK activity and not direct contractility measurements, our experimental paradigm does provide a unique platform for further definitive analysis of the interplay between biochemical and biomechanical factors that govern this facet of human CNS morphogenesis. To our knowledge, there is no other experimentally tractable means by which such phenomena can be investigated within a human genomic background.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly engineer the nascent neuroepithelial cytoarchitecture of neural organoids in a high-throughput arrayed format could have significant implications for future advanced biomanufacture of the neural organoid platform. The 3-D nature of organoids grown in suspension culture provides constituent cells with a biomimetic tissue context. However, suspension organoids grow to millimeters in diameter limiting real-time analysis of internal morphogenesis processes using traditional imaging modalities. While our microarrayed neural tissues initiate as a 2-D monolayer, they quickly become multilayered and definitively 3-D, that is &gt;4 cell layers thick, within 4 days of culture and continue to increase in thickness upon extended culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Thus, the biophysical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khetan et al., 2013</xref>) and electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frega et al., 2014</xref>) benefit of 3-D organoids may still apply within our engineered neural tube slides. Also, our arrayed approach enables constant monitoring throughout the tissues’ morphogenesis process using confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the stratified microscale cytoarchitecture observed in regions of cortical, retinal, cerebellar, and cerebral organoids may also be achievable upon further modification of our culture substrates to provide continual but expanding confinement as the arrayed tissues grow radially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McNulty et al., 2014</xref>). If achievable, then the substrate parameters elucidated in this study could serve as a basis for generating an engineered well-plate platform to which scientists could simply add their patient-specific hPSCs or Pax6<sup>-</sup> hPSC derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), follow an in situ modification protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and allow the engineered culture substrate to instruct reproducible growth of high density arrays of neural organoid tissues. This would facilitate broad dissemination of the neural organoid platform as well as real-time microscopic investigation of the organoid’s morphogenesis and terminal structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Micropatterned array substrate fabrication</title><p>Micropatterned array cell culture substrates were fabricated using a combination of previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sha et al., 2013</xref>).

Then, the media was supplemented with 1 μM RA, 2 μg/mL Sonic hedgehog, and 2 μM Purmorphomine (Shh, PM; R and D Systems) to induce ventralization. To further enhance ventralization, a 6 hr boost in Wnt signaling via media supplementation with 6 μM CHIR was applied either immediately before subculture or 72 hr after cell seeding onto micropatterned substrates but prior to RA +SHH + PM exposure. The neuroepithelial cells were maintained in E6 +RA + SHH + PM with 50% media changes daily.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuroepithelial tissue image analysis algorithm and descriptor definitions</title><p>An automated workflow for quantitative analysis of micropatterned neuroepithelial tissue morphology was generated using MATLAB (MathWorks, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We first defined morphological characteristics of polarized neuroepithelial tissues. Neural rosettes in micropatterned tissues were identified by the presence of a coherent N-cadherin ring structure described in algorithm logic as halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Neural rosette morphology was further defined by the density of N-cadherin localization along constituent cell membranes with apico-basal polarity, described here as tendrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Areas of NECs that exhibited punctate localization of N-cadherin absent the requisite ring structure and corresponding apico-basal polarity were classified as polarization foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Next, descriptors were established for variance in size and shape of zones of N-cadherin localization defined in the algorithm as measures of polarization area, fitted ellipse major axis length, and eccentricity. Further, a halo intensity ratio was applied to N-cadherin ring structures as a measure of the ratio of internal and external fluorescence intensity across the boundary of N-cadherin localization. Lastly, the apico-basal polarity of constituent cells surrounding apical N-cadherin localization was characterized as a measurement of cell membrane alignment angle compared to the tangent of the N-cadherin boundary (i.e. tendril angle incoherence 1 and 2). This measure was to be analyzed in conjunction with a measure of the tendril 1 and 2 density. Continuous variation in the above descriptors was accounted for to allow discontinuous response in classification of polarizing NECs as polarization foci or neural rosettes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conducting automated analysis of neuroepithelial tissue images</title><p>Automated analysis of NEC polarization and neural rosette emergence was performed using 3D image stacks of single micropatterned neural tissues fluorescently stained for nuclei and N-cadherin. 3D image stacks were compiled from seven vertically segmented image acquisitions at 1.5 μm intervals using a 60X objective with 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. Entire datasets were analyzed in batch fashion using the custom MATLAB program described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). First, images were pre-processed by applying a median filter to the maximum intensity projection. Next, regions of dense N-cadherin staining were identified as discrete blobs (i.e. polarization foci) using the process of maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matas et al., 2004</xref>). After applying a smoothing filter, polarization foci area, eccentricity, and major axis of a fitted ellipse (‘radius’) was calculated for each region detected. Foci with area less than 176 µm<sup>2</sup> were excluded from further processing. To the mean image projection with a median filter, the location and intensity ratio of the N-cadherin halo was assessed. Identification of the halo served to both evaluate the coherence of the N-cadherin ring and establish a boundary for assaying arrangement of tendrils in relation to the halo. Once the halo boundary was established, the tendril density and tendril angle were measured by sampling 20 pixel squares at various points around the foci epicenter at a distance of 1.5X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomson et al., 1998</xref>) and 2X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>) the radius of the foci. Within each sampled area, pixel intensity was assayed to measure density of tendrils and a gradient orientation filter was used to calculate the directionality of tendrils relative to the halo boundary. For each foci identified, values for tendril angle 1 and 2 and tendril density 1 and 2 were calculated as averages from all points sampled. Collectively, these eight descriptors comprised an image descriptor vector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Developing a predictive, machine-learned classifier of polarization</title><p>The MATLAB Machine Learning Toolbox was used to train a classifier based on descriptor vectors from 70, randomly selected, 300 μm diameter (0.071 mm<sup>2</sup>) circular tissues images (55). In addition to the algorithm analysis, these images were also examined independently by five NEC culture experts, who were asked to quantify the total number of N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> polarization areas (i.e. foci) and determine which should also be classified as rosettes. Agreement between 4 out 5 experts was required to designate any polarization foci or rosette as a ‘ground truth’. Then, the human ground truth and the algorithm’s descriptor data for each identified N-cadherin polarization area in the 70 tissues (235 total identified areas) was used to learn a classifier using logic regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Comparison of each human expert’s analyses versus the consensus ground truth revealed a human polarization foci and rosette identification error rate of 21.19 ± 3.35% and 13.05 ± 2.74%, respectively (Table S1). In comparison, the classification function exhibited lower error rates of 14.35% and 8.86%, respectively.</p><p>To further test the classifier, a second round of human expert and algorithm analyses was conducted on an additional 35 neuroepithelial tissues selected randomly and distributed evenly across all morphologies. The human experts and automated image analysis algorithm identified 148 N-cadherin polarization areas total. The human versus classifier polarization and rosette error rates were 19.05 ± 14.61% vs. 20.27% and 9.93 ± 6.96% vs. 19.56%, respectively (Table S2). This suggest that the classifier generalizes well to new morphologies although the classifier’s rosette identification error rate increased potentially due to the variance in tissue morphologies. Still, the image analysis algorithm and classifier workflow were deemed acceptable for detecting trends in singular rosette emergence given the magnitude of differences observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Clickable peptide bioconjugate synthesis</title><p>Bioconjugate ligands were synthesized to undergo copper-free ‘click’ reactions with azide-functionalized PEG-grafted micropatterned substrates in accordance with our published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-tagged and a non-fluorescent version of the FGF-2 heparin-binding peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hudalla and Murphy, 2010</xref>) were purchased from Genescript (Piscataway, NJ). Peptides were designed with a terminal cysteine residue to enable Michael-type addition of a clickable heterobiofunctional linker molecule, consisting of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) with a maleimide-PEG4 crosslinker (DBCO-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Maleimide, Click Chemistry Tools). Peptides were added to a solution of Tris(2-carboxethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) in sterile water pH 7.0 for 1 hr at room temperature. DBCO-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Maleimide in DMF was then added to the solution in 4:1 molar excess and allowed to react while shaking for 1 hr at room temperature. Upon completion, the reaction was pipetted onto the gel bed of a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column packed with Bio-Gel P-2 Gel (Bio-Rad) and allowed to enter the column under gravity flow. The reaction solution was passed through the column using 100 mL sterile water and eluted into one hundred, 1 mL aliquots. Eluted aliquots were concentrated via freeze-drying and analyzed with UV-Vis spectrophotometry for peaks at 309 and 495 nm wavelengths, corresponding to the presence of DBCO and FITC respectively, as well as by a Micro-BCA Assay (Promega) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Peptide bioconjugate containing aliquots were stored lyophilized at −20°C, and upon reconstitution in PBS, the bioconjugate concentration was re-assessed by comparing the UV-Vis DBCO measurement to a standard curve of known concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Azide functionalization of grafted poly(ethylene glycol) Brushes</title><p>PEG-MA-grafted micropatterned arrays underwent Steglich esterification reactions to substitute side-chain hydroxyl groups with bromine, as previously published(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knight et al., 2015</xref>).

Esterification was initiated by injection of 4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) (Sigma Aldrich) in DMF and was allowed to continue for 1 hr at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by removal of the substrates and neutralization of the reaction solution. Modified substrates were rinsed separately in water and ethanol, and then dried under inert gas. Once transferred to a scintillation vial, substrates underwent nucleophilic substitution of both terminal and side-chain bromine groups with azido groups via addition of DMF solution with sodium azide (Sigma Aldrich) for 16 hr at 37°C.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Engineering Induction of Singular Neural Rosette Emergence within hPSC-derived Tissues&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alfonso Martinez Arias (Reviewer #1).</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors help introduce rigor and standards to neural organoids and especially to those modeling early stages of neurogenesis. The work is novel, interesting and well done.</p><p>Usually, we provide a condensed summary of the reviews but we believe that, in this case, you would benefit from receiving the full reviews verbatim, which are attached below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The field of neural 'organoid' is, for the most part, one of much noise and little clarity about what is actually going on in the cultures so it is very good to see a study like this one in which the authors apply rigour and high standards to the reconstruction of the early stages of neurogenesis in vitro. In particular one of the problems that bedevils the field is that of reproducibility and it is in tackling it that the authors make some important findings. Specifically the different biophysical parameters that are required for brain and spinal cord. This is a significant and important contribution to the efforts of creating ex vivo models for the development of the nervous system that will help advances in disease and drug screening.</p><p>I would have liked to see if the rosettes express FoxA2 and SHH (floor plate markers).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this work, the authors combined geometric confinement and E6 based induction protocol to generate singular neural rosette tissue using hESCs. The method reported in this work is very novel and potentially useful for future mechanistic investigations; however the main text is somewhat disorganized, making it difficult to read and understand transitions between figures. Below are my main concerns and questions.</p><p>1) There is no mechanistic study (such as using genetics approach) in this study. It still remains largely unclear how hESCs sense the circular geometry/confinement and become polarized during the rosette formation process. Why are the cells sensitive to the circular pattern size during the induction process? These are important questions that need to be properly investigated.</p><p>2) More detailed quantification and immunostaining/live cell imaging need to be performed to better understand the neural rosette formation process. In the current manuscript, only Pax6 and N-cadherin are used to label neural rosette. More cell lineage/fate markers and more importantly, cell polarity proteins need to be quantified.</p><p>3) There are some overstatements in this study. For example, in Figure 6G, the authors stated that there is lumen formation in the rosette. But the black cavity doesn't necessarily look like a real lumen to me. Again, some staining for apical proteins such as aPKC and Par6 would be very helpful. In the subsection “Neural rosette emergence is regulated by tissue morphology”, the definition of '+1 rosette' should be carefully examined, because the clear definition for polarization is lacking. Again, more polarity related proteins should be studied in this work.</p><p>4) The authors should confirm their neural rosette protocol using hiPSC lines.</p><p>5) In this work, the neural rosette formation is sensitive to the mechanical cue (the geometry and size of the pattern). The connection between this in vitro system and in vivo neural rosette formation should be better elucidated. Is there any evidence showing the neurulation process in vivo is affected by mechanical cues?</p><p>6) How does the pattern size and shape affect the neural rosette formation in this work? Does the pattern size affect certain signaling pathway (BMP? TGF-β?) and then affect the downstream neural activation? Or does the mechanical cue affect the certain transcription factors (YAP/TAZ) directly? More mechanistic studies about the mechanism will certainly strengthen this current study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37549.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I would have liked to see if the rossettes express FoxA2 and SHH (floor plate markers).</p></disp-quote><p>We have immunostained for FoxA2 and SHH to determine if a dorsoventral axis formed spontaneously within the arrayed rosettes.

We acknowledge that is a lengthy manuscript but see this as unavoidable given the interdisciplinary nature of the science. We have tried to make the Results and Discussion sections as straight-forward as possible. We have made revisions throughout to simplify sentence structure and improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is no mechanistic study (such as using genetics approach) in this study.

Polarization of neuroepithelial cells is a characteristic of their phenotype, and there are numerous papers that provide a mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon (Nishimura, Honda and Takeichi, 2012; Copp, Greene and Murdoch, 2003; Vladar, Antic and Axelrod, 2009). As shown in Figure 5B, we observed instances of single rosette formation on all pattern sizes; however, the propensity for generating only a single rosette increases significantly in the identified micropattern diameter ranges. We explicitly state, “Hence, the micropatterned tissue morphology does not instruct rosette morphogenesis, but restricts the tissue area to statistically favor emergence of a single rosette in accordance with innate NEC properties”.</p><p>Thus, there is no mechanistic or genetic study to conduct since the geometric confinement appears to be conditionally favorable and not instructive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More detailed quantification and immunostaining/live cell imaging need to be performed to better understand the neural rosette formation process.

More cell lineage/fate markers and more importantly, cell polarity proteins need to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this manuscript is not to “understand the neural rosette formation process”, but to develop a novel engineering approach to control its emergence. Numerous papers including our own have concluded that Sox2/Pax6 positive cells with polarized-localization of N-cadherin in a rosette structure are definitive neuroepithelial/neural rosette makers (Lancaster et al., 2013; Lippmann, Estevez-Silva and Ashton, 2014; Lippmann et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2012). Furthermore, we show basal deposition of Laminin proteins indicative of their ability to generate a basement membrane (Figure 5). We do not believe that additional proof is necessary, but we have also provided immunostaining to show apical localization of ZO-1, cortical F-actin, and mitotic cell division. The following text was inserted:</p><p>“Co-localization of F-actin, ZO-1 tight junction proteins, and phospho-H3<sup>+</sup> mitotic nuclei within these polarized structures further supports the use of polarized N-cadherin as a surrogate marker of neural rosette emergence (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are some overstatements in this study. For example, in Figure 6G, the authors stated that there is lumen formation in the rosette. But the black cavity doesn't necessarily look like a real lumen to me. Again, some staining for apical proteins such as aPKC and Par6 would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the previous response, we and others have used N-cadherin as a marker of neural rosette formation in Sox2/Pax6 cultures. Figure 6Gi is an XY cross-section through the middle of the hemispherical cell cluster, and Figure 6Giii is a XZ cross-section of the same cell cluster. The elongate Pax6<sup>+</sup> nuclei in Figure 6Gi clearly show polarization to a central region that is confirmed as lumen in 3D by the void space in Figure 6Giii. To further corroborate lumen formation, we have added a 3D animated deconstruction of the immunostained cell cluster. This has been noted in the text (Discussion, last paragraph), Figure 6’s legend, and added as Figure 6—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the subsection “Neural rosette emergence is regulated by tissue morphology”, the definition of '+1 rosette' should be carefully examined, because the clear definition for polarization is lacking. Again, more polarity related proteins should be studied in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1F provides illustrations of what we interpret as a ‘polarization foci’ and a ‘neural rosette’. In the Materials and methods and Supplementary files, we detail quantitative image analysis parameters that define a rosette versus a polarization when developing our image analysis algorithm. As stated, micropatterned cell clusters were identified as ‘+1 rosette’ when they contained “≥ 1 rosette with ≥ 1 additional polarization foci”. We do not know how to be more explicit. As indicated in our response to reviewer #2’s point 1, we have shown additional immunostaining (e.g. ZO-1, cortical F-actin, marker of cell division) to validate that polarized N-cadherin is a proper indicator of neural rosette emergence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should confirm their neural rosette protocol using hiPSC lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted this experiment, and added the following text:</p><p>“Interestingly, while these results were consistent for tested hESC lines, micropatterned E6 differentiation of D90A <italic>SOD1</italic> mutant ALS-iPSCs also showed optimal singular, forebrain rosette emergence within 250μm diameter circular tissues but at a lower (26%) efficiency (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). This corresponded to many instances where tissues displayed a non-uniform Pax6<sup>+</sup> NEC phenotype, indicating that line-to-line variations in neural induction efficiency must be overcome for effective micropatterning of singular neural rosette emergence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In this work, the neural rosette formation is sensitive to the mechanical cue (the geometry and size of the pattern). The connection between this in vitro system and in vivo neural rosette formation should be better elucidated. Is there any evidence showing the neurulation process in vivo is affected by mechanical cues?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the first paragraph of subsection “Neural rosette emergence is regulated by tissue morphology”, “Biophysical studies have inextricably linked developmental morphogenesis events such as neural tube formation with tissue biomechanics (Davidson and Keller, 1999; Nishimura, Honda and Takeichi, 2012)”. Nishimura, Honda and Takeichi (2012) uses chick embryos to investigate planar-cell-polarity pathway activity during neural tube closure. This provides a mechanistic link between neuroepithelial cell polarization/neural tube closure/in vivo neural rosette formation and activation of Rho kinase leading to actomyosin contraction (Figure 7C in Nishimura, Honda and Takeichi, 2012). This is the biomechanical link to neural rosette formation. We would like to reiterate that we do not claim that the geometry or size of the pattern instructs neural rosette formation (stated explicitly in the subsection “NEC biomechanical properties vary by regional phenotype and affect rosette emergence behavior”). Instead, we show that it provides favorable conditions for emergence of a single rosette based on intrinsic properties of the micropatterned neuroepithelial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How does the pattern size and shape affect the neural rosette formation in this work? Does the pattern size affect certain signaling pathway (BMP? TGF-β?) and then affect the downstream neural activation? Or does the mechanical cue affect the certain transcription factors (YAP/TAZ) directly? More mechanistic studies about the mechanism will certainly strengthen this current study.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to reviewer #2, points 2 and 5.</p><p>References:</p><p>A.J. Copp, N.D.E.
