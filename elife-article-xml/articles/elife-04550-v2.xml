By analyzing genome sequence assemblies of five isolates, we show they represent three races that are genetically diverged by ∼1%. Despite this divergence, their genomes are mosaic-like, with ∼25% being introgressed from other races. Sequential infection experiments show that infection by adapted races enables subsequent infection of hosts by normally non-infecting races. This facilitates introgression and the exchange of effector repertoires, and may enable the evolution of novel races that can undergo clonal population expansion on new hosts. We discuss recent studies on hybridization in other eukaryotes such as yeast, <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies, Darwin's finches, sunflowers and cichlid fishes, and the implications of introgression for pathogen evolution in an agro-ecological environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04550.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04550.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04550.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many microorganisms live as parasites inside another living organism, and gain nutrients at their host's expense. Plants and animals have immune systems that serve to protect against this kind of exploitation, but successful parasites have evolved ways to avoid detection by their hosts' immune systems, and/or to suppress hosts' defence mechanisms.</p><p>Parasites often avoid detection by releasing molecules that interfere with specific aspects of a host's immune system. The same molecules, however, can be recognised by the immune systems of other species and trigger defence responses that eradicate the parasites; this explains why most parasites can colonise only a limited number of host species. It is less clear how parasites evolve to become ‘generalists’ that can infect many host species. However, some generalist parasites have several distinct subgroups—each of which is specialised to infect a limited number of host species.</p><p><italic>Albugo candida</italic> is a generalist parasite that infects over 200 plant species, including mustard greens, oilseed and vegetable crops. Even though its looks and its lifestyle resemble those of a fungus, <italic>A. candida</italic> is actually an oomycete: a group of organisms that are more closely related to golden-brown algae than they are to fungi. About 24 subgroups (or ‘races’) of this generalist parasite have been identified to date, but it remains unclear how these subgroups have evolved.</p><p>McMullan, Gardiner et al. tested different isolates of <italic>A. candida</italic>—four from southeast England and one from western Canada—which had been collected from different plant species and confirmed that each could only infect a narrow range of plant hosts.</p><p>Next, the genome sequences of these five <italic>A. candida</italic> strains were assembled and compared. This analysis revealed that the five strains represented three distinct subgroups (or races) of <italic>A. candida</italic>. Moreover, some parts of one subgroup's genome were most similar to those found in a second subgroup; and other parts were more like sections of the third subgroup's genome. McMullan, Gardiner et al. point out that such ‘mosaic-like genomes’ indicate crossbreeding between the different subgroups. But as <italic>A. candida</italic> must infect a plant in order to reproduce, and different subgroups infect different host plants, how can different subgroups meet in order to mate and reproduce?</p><p>In answer to this question, McMullan, Gardiner et al. showed that a plant that is infected with one subgroup of <italic>A. candida</italic> becomes susceptible to co-infection with other subgroups, including those that couldn't normally infect this plant species on their own. These findings reveal that generalist parasites can therefore evolve new subgroups via a mechanism that is similar to the way that crossbreeding (or hybridization) between existing species can lead to the evolution of new species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04550.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04550.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Albugo candida</italic></kwd><kwd>oomycete</kwd><kwd>mosaic genome</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>introgression</kwd><kwd>hybridization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>233376 (ALBUGON)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Jonathan DG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwich Research Park</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Earth &amp; Life Systems Alliance (ELSA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMullan</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Ben J</given-names></name><name><surname>van Oosterhout</surname><given-names>Cock</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/H020691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holub</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008389</institution-id><institution>Uddannelses- og Forskningsministeriet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Jonathan DG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hybridization and introgression blur species boundaries and broaden genetic diversity available for adaptation; and widespread introgression underpins the evolution of races of the generalist pathogen <italic>Albugo candida</italic> that specialise on different host plant species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most parasites have a restricted host range and are often unable to exploit even closely related hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poulin and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Compared to necrotrophs that reproduce on dead plant material, obligate biotrophic parasites can only reproduce on living tissue, and thus are intimately associated with their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thines, 2014</xref>). This might be expected to result in host specialization. The adaptive evolution of, for example, new effectors that enable more efficient exploitation of one host species, increases the risk of detection in other host species by triggering their immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Kamoun, 2012</xref>). Due to this trade-off, the saying ‘<italic>Jack of all trades, master of none</italic>’ is especially true for obligate biotrophic parasites, because natural selection that maximises parasite fitness on one particular host species might lead to specialisation and reduced host range (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). Yet there are generalist biotrophic parasites that appear to have overcome this evolutionary dilemma and show virulence on diverse hosts.</p><p>Some ‘generalist’ parasite species have solved the dilemma by evolving multiple specialised races, each of which infect different hosts. For example, the eukaryotic oomycete order <italic>Albuginales</italic> consists entirely of obligate biotrophic pathogens that cause disease on a broad range of plant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biga, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi and Priest, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker and Priest, 2007</xref>). Its largest genus, <italic>Albugo</italic>, comprises ∼50 (usually) specialist pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thines et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ploch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>), yet <italic>Albugo candida</italic> (Pers.) Roussel can infect over 200 species of plants in 63 genera from the families of Brassicaceae, Cleomaceae and Capparaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saharan and Verma, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>A. candida</italic> infections are the causal agent of ‘white blister rust’ disease resulting in 9–60% losses on economically important oilseed and vegetable <italic>Brassica</italic> crops. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper and Pittma, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbetti and Carter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saharan and Verma, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meena et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>A. candida</italic> consists of different physiological races that each usually show high host specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hiura, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pound and Williams, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petrie, 1988</xref>). ∼24 races of <italic>A. candida</italic> have been defined, based primarily on their host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saharan and Verma, 1992</xref>).</p><p><italic>A. candida</italic> is a diploid organism that reproduces both asexually and sexually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Holub et al. 1995</xref>), but the relative importance of both reproductive modes is not well established. During asexual reproduction, diploid zoospores are formed in a special propagule (the zoosporangium) on a thallus of hyphae beneath the leaf epidermis. White blisters comprising large numbers of dehydrated sporangia eventually rupture the epidermis to release inoculum for dispersal. When reproducing sexually, fertilization between two isolates results in non-motile diploid thick-walled oospores that can resist extreme temperatures and desiccation. Although the relative importance of different mechanisms of reproduction in the <italic>Albugo</italic> life cycle remains poorly understood, clonal reproduction enables rapid population expansion, especially in genetically uniform crop monocultures.</p><p><italic>A. candida</italic> is considered a single species despite the fact it comprises several specialised physiological races that colonize different host plants (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drès and Mallet, 2002</xref>). According to evolutionary and population genetic theory, adaptations and trade-offs associated with host-specialisation combined with strong population structuring can result in adaptive radiation and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Abbott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stukenbrock, 2013</xref>). Conceivably, <italic>A. candida</italic> is an adaptive radiation ‘in progress’, and the broad host range is realised by ongoing specialisation of independent races that are on the road to speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drès and Mallet, 2002</xref>). This raises the important question; does parasite specialization inevitably lead to speciation?</p><p><italic>Albugo</italic> spp. infection strongly suppresses host innate immunity and <italic>Albugo</italic> spp. are unique compared to other microbial plant pathogens in enhancing host susceptibility to secondary infection by otherwise avirulent pathogens, including downy mildews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that enhanced susceptibility imposed by <italic>Albugo</italic> might accelerate adaptation of other pathogen species to an <italic>Albugo</italic>-susceptible host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thines, 2014</xref>). However, no evolutionary rationale has been put forward to explain why it might be adaptive for <italic>Albugo</italic> sp. to render its hosts so susceptible to other pathogens that could compete for access to the same resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>). Arguably, suppression of host innate immunity could facilitate cohabitation of distinct physiological races and thus may enable genetic exchange between them. Introgression, here defined as the introduction by recombination of syntenic nucleotide variation from a parental donor race into the genome of a recipient race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hedrick, 2013</xref>), could slow down genetic divergence, and hence, retard speciation. On the other hand, introgression between races that are well-adapted to exploit different host plants could be maladaptive and strongly selected against because hybrids will inherit effector alleles derived from both parental races. Given that immune recognition of even a single effector is sufficient to trigger the immune response and stop an infection, hybrids that possess an expanded repertoire of effector alleles are likely to have a strong fitness disadvantage on most potential host plants.</p><p>Much of the ecology and evolution of <italic>A. candida</italic> remains unknown, but with its many specialized races and a broad host range, this ‘generalist’ plant pathogen is a fascinating study organism. The questions we addressed in the present study are: (1) Are the distinct physiological <italic>A. candida</italic> races genetically isolated and ‘on the road to speciation’? (2) Does suppression of host innate immunity enable cohabitation and growth of races with non-overlapping host ranges? To answer these questions, we generated genome sequence assemblies of five isolates that were collected from four host species (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>, <italic>Brassica juncea</italic>, <italic>Capsella bursa-pastoris</italic>, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>). We sequenced one isolate of one race, and two isolates of each of two additional races. We show that these races are not genetically isolated despite having non-overlapping host ranges. Recombination analysis shows there is widespread genetic exchange between <italic>A. candida</italic> races, and that hybridisation leading to introgression has occurred numerous times, which include exchanges in the recent past. To explain this observation, we examined whether pre-infection of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Brassica</italic> with virulent <italic>A. candida</italic> races results in enhanced host susceptibility, and found that pre-infection with a virulent strain enables proliferation of an <italic>A. candida</italic> isolate that would otherwise not colonize that host. For the two races with two isolates, we show that population expansion is by clonal reproduction. We discuss the impact of genetic exchange on <italic>A. candida</italic> evolution, and consider the implications for pathogen evolution and reproduction in an agro-ecological environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>A. candida</italic> host specificity: single race isolates are host specific</title><p>AcNc2 was recovered from infected leaves of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Eri-1 field-grown plants in Norwich (UK) in 2007.

We screened 356 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions for their susceptibility to AcNc2 and 38.5% were susceptible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary files 1, 2</xref>). Race Ac2V was originally isolated in Canada on <italic>B. juncea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rimmer et al., 2000</xref>). We confirmed virulence of Ac2V on <italic>B. juncea</italic> by spray inoculation of <italic>B. juncea</italic> ‘Cutlass’ and ‘Czerniac’. On 3-week-old <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants, all 107 tested accessions were resistant.

These tests confirm that <italic>A. candida</italic> races show pronounced host specificity to distinct host species.

Note that the presence of such well-defined blocks of high sequence similarity in an otherwise diverged genome is characteristic for rare introgression between organisms that show a high (yet incomplete) level of reproductive isolation. Noteworthy too is the fact that a high level of recombination (relative to the mutation rate) would homogenise the sequence divergence between the races, and hence, that this would not result in the observed mosaic-like structure.</p><p>Despite the fact that introgression between races is rare, it must have occurred multiple times between the ancestors of the three races given that the coalescence times varies markedly between the different blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Assuming a base mutation rate of µ = 10<sup>−8</sup> per cell cycle, with 100 cell cycles per year (i.e., a combined mutation rate of 10<sup>−6</sup> per year), analysis in the software HybRIDS show that the most recent introgression event has occurred circa 220 years ago, whilst the oldest event occurred almost 200,000 years ago. The mean age calculated across all introgression events equals 6237 (±12,594) years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). (With a combined mutation rate of µ = 10<sup>−7</sup> per base per year, the range in the age of introgression would span from 2200 to 2,000,000 years). Irrespective of the mutation rate, the principal finding is that genetic introgression amongst <italic>A. candida</italic> races is an ongoing evolutionary process occurring across a wide range of evolutionary times, and that it gives rise to mosaic genomes with the introgression blocks interspersed in the recipient genomic background.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04550.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Age of recombination blocks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Age of the 675 recombination blocks (mutation rate of μ = 10<sup>−6</sup>) estimated using binomial mass function; (<bold>B</bold>) Boxplot of the median (plus first nation blocks and third quartile) log-age of recombination events in contigs.

It is however entirely likely that by studying only a small subset of all the known races, we have underestimated the actual level of introgression across all races.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Intra-race diversity suggests clonal propagation after creation of novel adapted allele repertoires</title><p>To better understand the evolution and diversification of <italic>A. candida</italic> genomes, we analysed the pattern of recombination and nucleotide divergence with the inclusion of two additional <italic>A. candida</italic> isolates. AcBoL is an additional isolate from the AcBoT race and AcEm2 is an additional isolate of the AcNc2 race (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found evidence for 581 recombination events, of which 335 included AcBoT or AcBoL as recombinants. These two isolates shared a recombinant block in 97.3% of recombination events (AcBoT and AcBoL = 326; AcBoT = 6; AcBoL = 3). AcNc2 and AcEm2 shared a recombinant block in 99.6% of events (AcNc2 and AcEm2 = 246; AcNc2 = 0; AcEm2 = 1). This demonstrates that the AcBoT/AcBoL and AcNc2/AcEm2 races have remained largely unchanged since their initial emergence.</p><p>The nucleotide diversity within genomes (i.e., the observed heterozygosity) and the nucleotide divergence between genomes (i.e., genetic differentiation) can be used to further understand <italic>A. candida</italic> population biology. Isolates AcBoT and AcBoL were both collected in Lincolnshire in 2009, and the observed heterozygosity in these isolates was at least 13 times higher than that of any of the other races (percentage heterozygous positions in contig 1: AcBoT = 0.653%; AcBoL = 0.644%; AcNc2 = 0.047%; AcEm2 = 0.044%; Ac2V = 0.028%) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Remarkably, AcBoT and AcBoL are heterozygous for almost all of the same sites; 97.2% of the sites that are heterozygous in AcBoT are also heterozygous in AcBoL (and 98.5% vice versa). This is only consistent with clonal reproduction because after just one generation of sexual reproduction (or selfing with recombination), Mendelian segregation would eradicate this high level of genotypic similarity. Notably, such evidence for clonal propagation of a race would be difficult to obtain for haploid fungal pathogens.</p><p>With little evidence for recombination and gene flow, most nucleotide divergence between AcBoT and AcBoL must have accumulated through mutation.

Assuming a mutation rate of 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> per cell division, and 100 cell divisions per lineage per year, we estimate that these isolates could have diverged 305 (262–353) years ago. The other pair of isolates, AcNc2 and AcEm2, were collected in Norfolk in 2007 and in Kent in 1993 (160 km apart), respectively. Similar to the former two isolates, AcNc2 and AcEm2 are also nearly identical (nucleotide divergence π = 0.046%, that is, they are &gt;99.95% identical) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If we again assume that their nucleotide divergence arose by mutation alone, their estimated divergence time is 890 (814–970) years. However, unlike AcBoT and AcBoL, AcNc2 and AcEm2 are much less heterozygous (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which suggests that another genetic mechanism, for example, loss of heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamour et al., 2012</xref>), might be operating which has eradicated the gene diversity in the clonally propagating races over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sequential infections abolish host specificity of susceptibility to <italic>A. candida</italic> infection</title><p><italic>A. candida</italic> infection compromises host resistance against otherwise avirulent pathogen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>).

To test this we performed sequential inoculation experiments, identifying races using the genome sequences to create race-specific DNA markers.

Here, we describe the genomes of five isolates from three races of <italic>A. candida</italic> that colonize distinct host plant species and appear to have non-overlapping host ranges. Genome analyses show that the races have a mosaic-like genome structure that is consistent with genetic introgression between races that have significantly diverged (mean nucleotide divergence ∼1%). Despite this divergence, ∼25% of the nucleotide sequence within the analysed genome (3.2 Mb out of 12.4 Mb) is derived from other <italic>A. candida</italic> races. 675 introgressed blocks were identified in the 127 analysed contigs and each block was confirmed by at least three independent recombination algorithms. Based on the high nucleotide similarity of the recombined regions, it appears that some genetic exchange must have occurred recently and that introgression has happened multiple times between the ancestors of the three races.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis for the observed mosaic-like genome structure is that the polymorphisms were already present in the ancestor of <italic>A. candida</italic>, and that those may have sorted stochastically among descendant host races. This is known as incomplete lineage sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pamilo and Nei, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hobolth et al., 2007</xref>), and such ancestrally shared polymorphism is notoriously difficult to distinguish from polymorphisms shared through secondary contact and introgression. However, by estimating the coalescence time of the introgressed regions we showed that hybridisation between the races is an ongoing evolutionary process, with some introgression events occurring as recent as 220 years ago. We therefore reject the hypothesis of incomplete lineage sorting and propose that genetic exchanges between the <italic>A. candida</italic> host races have occurred through rare but nevertheless significant introgression events.</p><p>If host-ranges are determined by multiple loci, one might expect that recombination will quickly lead to ‘super genotypes’ with very wide host ranges. However, this is unlikely because of the dual consequences of effector alleles; they not only can contribute to virulence, but if recognized by <italic>Resistance</italic> (<italic>R</italic>) gene alleles in a particular host, they can result in the complete loss of virulence on that host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11b">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</xref>). Effectors selected to facilitate infection and evade recognition by <italic>R</italic> genes in one host might be recognised by the <italic>R</italic> genes in another host and be maladaptive. Thus, genotypes that are highly virulent on multiple hosts are unlikely to arise by recombination between races that specialize on distinct specific hosts, although occasionally, acquiring an effector from one race by introgression might offer an adaptive advantage assuming that the effector is not recognised.</p><p>Strikingly, each race shared a mosaic pattern of large genomic regions (&gt;10,000 bp) that were virtually identical between two races (and diverged from the third). Given that mutations accumulate over time, this implies that the exchange must have occurred relatively recently. Yet, <italic>A. candida</italic> is an obligate biotrophic parasite that is highly host-specific. The host-specificity of <italic>A. candida</italic> races was confirmed in our experiments, and this raises the question of how distinct <italic>A. candida</italic> races can achieve the physical contact required for them to have sex and recombine. We addressed this question using experimental infections of host plants with multiple races. Crucially, we showed that infection with a virulent race of <italic>A. candida</italic> suppresses host immunity sufficiently to enable subsequent co-colonization by an otherwise non-virulent race (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>). Although this opens up competition between races for the same (limited) resource, it also brings a significant evolutionary/ecological advantage by blurring the borders of host range, thereby creating secondary contact zones that enable sexual reproduction and genetic exchange between races. Given the high-host specificity of obligate biotrophic parasites, this ability of <italic>A. candida</italic> to enable occasional genetic exchange between specialised races could create novel repertoires of effector alleles that would enable colonization of new hosts (‘host jumps’). For example, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resistance to race Ac2V can at least in part be explained by the <italic>WRR4</italic> gene, a classical NB-LRR <italic>R</italic> gene, which presumably recognizes an Ac2V effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borhan et al., 2008</xref>). Hypothetically, if this Ac2V effector would segregate away in hybrid offspring, or by loss of heterozygosity, these offspring could become virulent on <italic>WRR4</italic>-carrying <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hosts.</p><p>Once a new hybrid race has been established, it can reproduce asexually and clonally on susceptible hosts without continued genetic exchange with other races. We base this inference on the exceptionally high genotypic similarity between independent isolates that infect the same host plant (i.e., AcBoT-AcBoL and AcEm2-AcNc2). For example, AcBoT and AcBoL share &gt;97% of their heterozygous sites. This observation is significant because it rules out sexual reproduction (or selfing with recombination), given that Mendelian segregation would eradicate this high level of genotypic similarity within a single generation. Hence, we conclude that reproduction of AcBoT and AcBoL is asexual and clonal, and we speculate that these races may have derived from a common ancestor that was selected coincident with the onset of widespread <italic>B. oleracea</italic> cultivation in Europe. The <italic>A. thaliana</italic>-infecting isolates (AcNc2 and AcEm2) were sampled at a broad spatiotemporal scale (14 years and 100 miles apart), and yet they showed a very high nucleotide similarity (&gt;99.95% identical). This shows that clonal reproduction coincided with their rapid population expansion. Remarkably though, compared to the former two isolates, AcEm2 and AcNc2 had a relatively low level of observed heterozygosity, and the number of heterozygous sites was &gt;13 times less than that of AcBoT and AcBoL. Since these races do not self-fertilize, this suggests that gene conversion or another mechanism might be operating to reduce the nucleotide diversity within their genomes over time. Such loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has also been reported for <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamour et al., 2012</xref>), and in yeast, LOH events can encompass entire chromosomes, which is thought to be explained by the break-induced replication (BIR) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11a">Diogo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>‘Hybrid speciation’ or ‘recombinational speciation’ is often associated with a mosaic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baack and Rieseberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stukenbrock et al., 2012</xref>) and because introgressed genes have been ‘pre-tested’ by selection, they are more likely to be adaptive than random changes to the genetic code by mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hedrick, 2013</xref>). For example, <italic>Helianthus anomalus</italic> is a wild sunflower species derived via hybridization between two parental species, and its genome is characterised by parental species blocks. In this case, however, hybridisation and speciation occurred over a short evolutionary time-span (10–60 generations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ungerer et al., 1998</xref>), which differs from hybridisation in <italic>A. candida</italic>, where it appears to be a persistent evolutionary process. Darwin's finches are a classic example of a young adaptive radiation, and recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamichhaney et al. (2015)</xref> showed that species from different islands show extensive genomic exchange through recent hybridisation. Introgressive hybridization was found to occur throughout the radiation, fuelling the genetic variation in beak shape, and thereby facilitating adaptive evolution. Perhaps more pertinently, the relationships of members of the parasite's principal host, plants of the <italic>Brassica</italic> genus, are themselves considered to be the result of a number of hybridisation events, as defined by the Triangle of U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nagahara, 1935</xref>). Hybridisation events have also been implicated in speciation and adaptive radiation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, rare introgression events among <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies are believed to have facilitated the exchange of mimicry genes across multiple time points post speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Evidence for more frequent introgression has been observed in the malaria vector species complex (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Fontaine et al., 2015</xref>). More examples of such introgression can be anticipated to emerge given the continued improvement and reduction in cost of DNA sequencing methods, and the development of novel software that enable analysis of whole genome recombination (Ward and van Oosterhout, submitted).</p><p>Perhaps more than any other system, studies on yeasts have offered valuable insights into how introgression and hybridisation can affect genome architectures of eukaryotic microorganisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14b">Dujon, 2010</xref>). Genetic exchanges amongst three strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have been quantified using genomic data which show that the rate of outcrossing is remarkably low, with only 314 outcrossing events during circa 16 million cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ruderfer et al., 2006</xref>). With such a low rate of genetic exchange, the strains accumulate sequence variation by mutation and thus genetically diverge. Given the low level of genetic exchange amongst the <italic>A. candida</italic> host races, this may also explain their genetic divergence. In yeast, natural hybrids have been reported in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14b">Dujon, 2010</xref>), with hybridisation leading to the nonreciprocal genetic exchange accompanied by the loss of genes and genomic regions. This results in chimeric sequences from which novel lineages could emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Greig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Usher and Bond, 2009</xref>). For example, <italic>Lachancea kluyveri</italic> possesses mega-base long chromosomal fragments of distinct composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Payen et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the genomes of wine strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contain introgressed regions from <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, <italic>S. kudriavzevii kudriavzevii</italic>, <italic>S. uvarum uvarum</italic>, and <italic>Zygosaccharomyces bailii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14b">Dujon, 2010</xref>). Given that the introgressed sequences in the genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are nearly identical to those in the donor genomes, hybridisation must have occurred recently, which is similar to what we observe in <italic>A. candida</italic>. Although introgression appears to be a general phenomenon in yeast genomes, its importance for evolution has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14b">Dujon, 2010</xref>). The mosaic-like genome structure of <italic>A. candida</italic> suggests that hybridisation and genetic introgression may play an equally important role in the biology of this oomycete.</p><p>Introgression can introduce novel adaptive trait combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seehausen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hedrick, 2013</xref>) as well as enable the loss by segregation of host-specific ‘avirulent’ effector alleles that can trigger the immune response in potential hosts. In rare novel recombinant races, such maladapted effectors that trigger the response of a specific host may be segregated away, allowing the recombinant to avoid immune recognition and colonise this new host. Once this happens, the new hybrid can rapidly expand its geographic range and population size through clonal reproduction. Hybrids between <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp. races can show expanded host range compared to their parental lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ersek et al., 1995</xref>) while the importance of virulence gene transfer that subsequently leads to the expansion of pathogens' host range has also been reported for bacterial and fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doolittle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mehrabi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ability of pathogens to recombine and generate novel recombinant genotypes and subsequently proliferate clonally may be particularly favoured in the agro-ecological environment. Recent fusion between genetically distinct plant pathogens has been shown in <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stukenbrock et al., 2012</xref>), where a hybrid speciation event has generated a generalist pathogen of grass species, and in <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hacquard et al., 2013</xref>), where a mosaic genome structure has been generated by sex between divergent isolates. Adaptation of pathogens to agro-ecosystems can be correlated with a reduction in diversity of recently emerged lineages and at the same time, high levels of genome plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stukenbrock and Bataillon, 2012</xref>). This genome plasticity has also been observed in <italic>B. graminis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hacquard et al., 2013</xref>). Race specialization observed in the potato late blight pathogen <italic>P. infestans</italic>, the rice blast pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, and the wheat yellow rust pathogen <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stukenbrock and Bataillon, 2012</xref>), may represent the result of a broader mechanism of pathogen adaptation to a crop monoculture. <italic>A. candida</italic>, which is known to live on both wild weeds (e.g., <italic>A. thaliana</italic>) and important crop species (e.g., <italic>B. juncea</italic>), thus provides remarkable insights into the impact of recombination in generating new virulent races and subsequent clonal propagation of a novel race.

GeneMark predictions were made with the default settings. Consensus gene models were generated with Evigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequently, the catalog of non-overlapping gene models was created from the Evigan, Augustus, Genemark and Geneid predictions. The gene space coverage was assessed with CEGMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Parra et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Functional annotations of AcNc2 proteins were performed via comparison of the predicted protein sequences with the protein databases; UniProtKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Suzek et al., 2007</xref>) and NCBI non-redundant RefSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pruitt et al., 2009</xref>) databases were scanned using BLASTP algorithm (E-value ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>); and Pfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Punta et al., 2012</xref>) was searched with the program hmmscan from HMMER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Eddy, 2011</xref>) with the default settings.

Crinkler's homologs were detected using BLASTP searches (E-value ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>) against NCBI non-redundant RefSeq database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pruitt et al., 2009</xref>). Homologs of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> ‘CHXC’ proteins were identified through Tribe-MCL clustering, also using BLASTP searches (E-value ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>) of the <italic>A. laibachii</italic> predicted proteome, and string search for the ‘CH[A-Z]C’ motif in the first 100 residues after predicted signal peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Repetitive elements</title><p>The library of repeats in AcNc2 assembly was constructed with RepeatScout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Price et al., 2005</xref>) and was joined with the previously made library for <italic>A. laibachii</italic> (Kemen et al., 2011). This updated library in combination with RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">http://www.repeatmasker.org/</ext-link>) was used for the identification of repeats and their frequencies. Transposon elements were annotated using TBLASTX searches (E-value ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>) against the database of transposon elements, RepBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Jurka et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Phylogenetic trees were built (MrBayes program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001</xref>]) for the nucleotide sequence alignments of the orthologous genes present in four <italic>A. candida</italic> races and <italic>A. laibachii</italic>. Trees were built for 100 single copy genes (50 core eukaryotic genes and 50 singletons with unknown function) Phylogenetic Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters. We used lset = 6, gamma model, mcmc of 10 million, samfreq = 7000 and burnin = 375. Population genetic parameter ‘theta’ (<italic>Θ</italic> = 4<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><italic>μ</italic>) was estimated using mlRho program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Haubold et al., 2010</xref>). Four different topologies were inferred with equal support which warranted further investigation into the role of introgression.</p><p>Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package version 1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14a">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>) was used to produce the race phylogeny (based on contig 1). BEAST implements Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian for divergence time dating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14a">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>). Bayesian phylogenetic trees were constructed with a HKY+G nucleotide substitution model under a strict molecular clock (with units in mutations per site) and a Yule tree prior. We ran ten independent MCMC analyses each of 10 million steps and a 10% burn-in. MCMC chain mixing was assessed using Tracer 1.5 which showed ESS &gt;3000 for each statistic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Recombination analyses and detection of exchanged sequence blocks</title><p>Recombination events were statistically identified on contigs ≥10,000 bp using the software RDP3 using five independent detection algorithms: RDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heath et al., 2006</xref>), GENECONV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padidam et al., 1999</xref>), Maxchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith, 1992</xref>), Chimaera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Posada and Crandall, 2001</xref>), and 3Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boni et al., 2007</xref>). Tests were conducted using a critical value α = 0.05 and p-values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons of sequences. Sequences were linear using unphase base calling and the random assignment of one of the nucleotides at each polymorphic site. Given that recombination algorithms use <italic>cis</italic> mutations to define regions of a sequence that share the same phylogenetic history, the statistical power to detect recombination is reduced when using unphased data (Darren Martin pers. comm.). This is because the signal of unphase base calling erodes any underlying signal of recombination. This procedure is conservative and underestimates the true number of recombination events because it reduces sequence similarity between the recombinant and parental sequence. Phylogenetic evidence of recombination was required to confirm a recombination event. Window sizes for each detection method were set to defaults. Only events for which the software identified the parental sequences (i.e., no ‘unknowns’) without ambiguous start and end position of the recombination block are reported and used in the analyses. Furthermore, events were only considered to be genuine if they were supported by at least three of the five detection algorithms. Hence, the estimates of the number of recombination events are conservative.</p><p>The effects of recombination on the sequence similarity between three genomes was visualised using a newly developed code in the R package HybRIDS (<underline>Hyb</underline>rid <underline>R</underline>ecombination, <underline>I</underline>dentification and <underline>D</underline>ating, <underline>S</underline>oftware, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elsa.ac.uk/">http://www.elsa.ac.uk/</ext-link>). HybRIDS uses a colour triangle to visualise the sequence similarity between aligned sequences. It calculates the colour of each 100 bp window based on the proportion of SNPs shared between the pairwise sequences. All monomorphic sites were excluded in this calculation. HybRIDS uses the additive colour system in which the primary colours used are red, green, and blue. These colours are plotted on the corners of the RGB colour triangle, which is shown in the legend as a reference. In cases where all SNPs are shared between just two of the three races, the hybrid colour is an exact 50% mix of two primary colours. The hybrid colours are yellow, purple and turquoise, and these colours suggest recent gene exchange between the two races. At such recombined regions, the third race receives its primary colour (because by definition, it must be unique at the 100 bp window and completely dissimilar from the other two races). Older recombined regions are predicted to have accumulated SNPs unique to each race, causing the block of two hybridizing races to diverge. In the graph, the colour of such areas contains more than 50% of the primary colour of that race. The colours in the centre of the triangle are pale and reflect areas where the three races share approximately similar numbers of polymorphisms. The SNPs in these pale regions, and in regions where the colours are close to the primary colours, are more likely caused by mutations than by genetic exchange. Note that primary colours can also be assigned to regions that may have recombined, but which originate from a race that was not sampled, and hence, which polymorphisms were not included in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Dating recombination events</title><p>We used the sequence divergence of the recombination block between the recombinant and the minor parent (i.e., the sequence donating the recombinant region) to estimate the divergence time since a recombination event. We used two dating methods, a binomial mass function and an analysis with the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package version 1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14a">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>). A binomial mass function was used to estimate the mean divergence time of a block of given size with an observed number of SNPs. In order to correct for mutation saturation, homoplasy, back mutations and transition/transversion ratios, we converted the observed number of SNPs into the number of mutations using a JC correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Jukes and Cantor, 1969</xref>). The probability of finding a number of SNPs less or equal to the observed number in a block of known size was calculated. The mean time is found when the binomial mass function returns a probability value p = 0.5. This approach finds the most probable age of the recombination event, and it assumes that since the recombination event, the block evolved neutrally over t years, and that each base has the chance to mutate with a probability µ per year (µ = 10<sup>−6</sup> and 10<sup>−7</sup>). The algorithm uses a strict molecular clock, and because the mutation rate in oomycetes is unknown, we assumed µ = 10<sup>−6</sup> as well as µ = 10<sup>−7</sup> per base per year. The lower value of the mutation rate of µ = 10<sup>−7</sup> was used as a more conservative estimate. Given that we do not know the mutation rate of oomycetes, the estimated dates are merely an approximation and shown to illustrate that the exchanged blocks are dated back to a wide range of evolutionary times. The simple dating method based on the binomial mass function was compared to more computationally intensive analysis with BEAST by dating 20 recombination events from the ‘contig 1’ of AcNc2 and performing a linear regression analysis to confirm application of the faster binomial algorithm to all 675 recombination events. The principle aim of these analyses was to identify whether or not recombinant regions span a range of dates (in line with the expectation under an introgression model).</p><p>BEAST bayesian phylogenetic trees were constructed with a HKY+G nucleotide substitution model under a strict molecular clock (µ = 10<sup>−6</sup>) and a Yule tree prior. We ran 10 independent MCMC analyses each of 10 million steps and a 10% burn-in for each of the 20 recombination events. MCMC chain mixing was assessed using Tracer 1.5 which showed ESS &gt;3000 for each statistic.</p><p>Note however that the divergence estimates made by the binomial mass function and the analysis with BEAST are conservative (i.e., the true time of the recombination event are probably more recent) given that we had only three sequences in the analysis. Consequently, the ‘true’ parental sequence has probably not been sampled, which means that the observed divergence is larger than that of the actual parental (donor) sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Substitution rates and selection</title><p>The substitution rates (non-synonymous substitution rate per non- synonymous site (dN) and synonymous substitution rate per synonymous site (dS)) and the ratio of the dN/dS for the orthologous protein-coding sequences between three isolates were estimated with the M0 model in PAML (Yang, 2007). The dN/dS ratio is traditionally used as an indicator of the strength and type of selective constrains acting upon a gene. Values of dN/dS ≈ 1 indicate neutral evolution. Values of dN/dS significantly less than unity indicate purifying selection, whereas dN/dS significantly larger than unity suggest positive selection. The Tajima's <italic>D</italic> statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tajima, 1989</xref>) were not calculated because we do not possess allele frequency data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr M Borhan for the providing Ac2V material; Jodie Pike for technical assistance; Dr OJ Furzer, M Burrell, Dr C Schudoma and Dr D MacLean for computational assistance.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and two peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First, there were concerns about the evidence for hybridization, both from the side of in vivo experimentation and from the interpretation of the sequence data with respect to ploidy and recombination patterns. Second, the reviewers felt that the failure to identify credible candidate genes or gene networks that arose from hybridization and that are responsible for adaptation weakened the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The article by McMullan and colleagues investigates the genome of the obligate pathogen <italic>Albugo candida</italic> infecting Brassicas including Arabidopsis. The authors sequenced the genomes of 5 strains sampled from different Brassica hosts falling into 3 distinct clades. Analysis was based mostly on 3 strains, one from each race (clade). Authors identified recombination blocks and regions of divergence among the three races. The authors combine genome sequencing, modeling and genetic work to assemble a nice story on divergence among three races of the pathogen.</p><p>The authors should formally test for linkage disequilibrium and clonality using SNPs and the index of association or LD.</p><p>I liked the inclusion of simupop simulation to infer patterns and date events. This effort showed that incomplete lineage sorting does not lead to the observed mosaic genome structure. However, I believe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the supplements is missing and I could not see the actual graphs showing this pattern.</p><p>The phenotyping work on host range was not repeated in independent experiments and the experiments included a different number of treatments for each strain.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript as presented lacks novelty although the work is well done and highly publishable elsewhere. The genome of <italic>A. candida</italic> was published in 2011 by Links et al. Here the authors resequence 5 strains and analyze 3 strains in fine detail. The races are found to have a mosaic like genome structure and that races diverged a considerable amount of time ago. <italic>A. candida</italic> is host specific, and thus races associated with a given host are not expected to cross breed with those on another host; the authors established presence of recombination blocks. They also demonstrate that co-inoculated strains from a host and non-host on a host can establish infection by the non-host strain and replicate this effect for several strain-host combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, this work is not repeated and lacks the validation from a full second experiment. Furthermore, it only shows the strains can coexist in the same environment, but it does not demonstrate hybridization or recombination. I think if they could demonstrate sexual reproduction or hybridization among diverged races, and tie the hybrid genomes into this story they would have a great paper. As it stands, I think this would be better published in a disciplinary journal given that it mostly provides information on more distant divergence, adaptation and coinfection. Lack of sex also needs to be more formally tested on a larger sample of strains.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by McMullan et al describes patterns of genomic variation and exchange between three races of <italic>Albugo candida</italic>, an oomycete pathogen of Brassicas, and provides evidence that co-infection could allow for such genetic exchange. Virulence tests confirmed prior work on the host-specificity of these isolates (AcNc2, Ac2V and AcBot) <italic>to A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>B. juncea</italic> and <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, respectively. When host plants are first infected by the specific pathogen race, this can allow for subsequent infection of otherwise avirulent races in the same plant, expanding on prior work showing secondary infection by downy mildews on hosts that have primary resistance. By analyzing genome assemblies of five isolates, the authors identified regions that appear to have ancestrally recombined between the races, resulting in a “mosaic genome”, followed by an apparent clonal expansion. The authors hypothesize that immunosuppression by the infectious isolates allowed a non-infectious race to colonize and recombine with it, allowing for new combinations of virulence genes.</p><p>This is an interesting study of genetic variability and exchange between pathogenic lineages; however the methods used to detect recombination do not clearly establish the certainty of inferred exchange events. The risk of relying on a single program (RDP3) to determine recombination is highlighted by the primary publication on this method, which states: “The drawback of such a flexible, exploratory framework is that it can often be difficult to assess the uncertainty associated with inferred recombination patterns. However, with its wide range of cross-checking tools, RDP3 is complementary to probabilistic recombination analysis approaches.” The authors have not included any such support for the recombinogenic regions identified using this data, including standard metrics of linkage disequilibrium, and it is unclear if their measure of using events detected by 3 of 5 models in RPD3 represents an optimal concordance. Some simulations are included, although this is used to evaluate the origin of the overall pattern, rather than validate the genomic regions detected with RDP3.</p><p>One major point of confusion in reading the manuscript is the lack of clarity on the ploidy level of <italic>A. candida</italic> and the methods used to analyze nucleotide variation. The authors compared heterozygous sites (suggesting the species is diploid), although there is no description in the supplementary methods of how these sites were identified or their confidence level. The “unphase base calling and the random assignment of one of the nucleotides at each polymorphic site” provided the sequence used for the recombination analysis. This process is then described as “conservative”, based on unphased heterozygous data underestimating variance, but direct support for this statement is not provided. The methods and the analysis of how nucleotide variants were identified through alignments of raw sequence or assemblies need to be more thoroughly described.</p><p>Given that ancestral recombination between these races is the main result of this paper to support their hypothesis, this analysis needs to be supported by an additional method, and a more detailed description of how results compare from the individual methods in RDP3 and probability based methods.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>We have considered your appeal regarding your manuscript entitled “Immunosuppression enables expanded host ranges and can explain mosaic genome structures in <italic>Albugo candida</italic> races”. We have now received comments from an expert on hybridization, and in light of the very positive evaluation, we would like to invite you to revise your article.</p><p>Your manuscript presents the analysis of several genomes of different races of <italic>Albugo candida</italic>. You provide very nice evidence that the genomes show signs of introgression of up to 25% material from other races. Since these races have host ranges which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, exclude each other, it is of great interest to understand how recombination between races can occur. You solve this conundrum by showing that exposure by one pathogen race makes the host plant susceptible to other races, to which they are normally resistant, thus providing a clear path to hybridization between races that normally have nonoverlapping host ranges.</p><p>The study is well carried out and convincing, but the presentation could be improved in several places.</p><p>1) While the material provided is clearly suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, the manuscript is not written in a very accessible style, rather what one would expect for a much more specialist journal. The message of this study is of potential interest for many readers (not only plant pathologists), but there is the danger it will attract little attention as currently presented. For example, proper population genetic terminology is mostly missing, examples from other system are almost absent and comparisons with other cases of hybrid formation (there are many in plants and animals and several nice genomic studies have been published) are ignored. The topic of breakdown of isolation mechanisms has implications for other central topics in evolution and ecology, such as local adaptation and speciation. Here the discussion could go much further.</p><p>2) The data suggest that 25% of the genome of a race is introgressed from a genome from a different host race. With this much introgression, and assuming that this study did not find exceptional cases, but rather a representative sample from the wild, one wonders about the genetic architecture of host-range determination. If host-ranges are determined by multiple loci, one would except that recombination will quickly lead to super genotypes, with very wide host ranges. Apparently this did not happen; maybe recombination cannot change this. This would be the case if they are sitting in non-recombining gene clusters, or a single locus (with multiple alleles) is responsible for host ranges. We would like to see some discussion about this.</p><p>3) The authors use the term “immunosuppression”. To an animal immunologist, this implies that the study included the assessment of immunological parameters, which is not the case. Rather, you observe in experimental infections that a first infection facilitates infection with a second race of the pathogen. We suggest rephrasing this, so as to not confuse animal immunologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04550.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p>Regarding the statement that “the reviewers felt that the failure to identify credible candidate genes or gene networks that arose from hybridization and that are responsible for adaptation weakened the impact of the work,” there is nothing about this in the reviewers’ substantive comments, and so we do not understand how this can be used to justify rejection. This comment is asking us to solve the molecular basis of non-host resistance in non-colonized plants to these different races. Researchers spend their careers trying to understand non-host resistance, and it is unrealistic to expect a meaningful and decisive explanation to emerge from comparison of 5 isolates of 3 races that infect three different host plants. We have of course generated a list of candidate genes that might underpin non-host resistance in Arabidopsis to the Brassica races, but we want to test them to see which of these candidate genes are causal, and also characterize the corresponding resistance genes that underpin non-host resistance. We could certainly say “it might be one of these 10 polymorphic secreted genes that underpins host specificity”, but it would be better to combine that with empirical tests in a different paper.</p><p>We can easily add more detail about our mapping pipeline to the methods. We failed to spell out that the co-inoculation experiments were done 3 times (AcBoT followed by Ac2v on <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, Ac2v followed by Nc2 on <italic>B. juncea</italic> three times) or twice (Nc2 followed by Ac2v on Ws-2; another rep easily added if required).</p><p>In addition, the literature is very clear on the host-range specificity of each <italic>A. candida</italic> race, but given our narrative, we decided to try to go the extra mile by testing whether any of 100s of Arabidopsis accessions <italic>might</italic> be susceptible to the Brassica-infecting races. We found none. We inoculated trays with 24 modules, with each module containing 10-20 plants for each genotype and each tray contained 5 out of 24 modules that carried susceptible control plants: four at the edges and one in the middle so we can be sure that spores are distributed well. With these susceptible positive controls to verify functional inoculum, and scores of plants tested from each accession, these confirmatory data are decisive. If any Arabidopsis genotype had been susceptible to Brassica-infecting races, we would have seen it, and we are confident there is no risk of false negative conclusions.</p><p>We show categorical and unambiguous evidence for recombination between races in the mosaic genomes. Software RDP3 conducts 5 different tests of this, with 5 different algorithms (one of which is RDP). The reviewer noted that “… RDP3 is complementary to probabilistic recombination analysis approaches.” We designed new software (HybRIDS) which does include a probabilistic recombination analysis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.norwichresearchpark.com/HybRIDS">http://www.norwichresearchpark.com/HybRIDS</ext-link>). In a previous version of the manuscript we explained in detail how this probabilistic recombination analysis works and presented the results. However, we decided to cut this out to avoid redundancy and because we believe the evidence based on the various algorithms in RDP3 is normally accepted to be robust (especially given the fact we identified 675 significant recombinant blocks). However, we would be happy to include a table with exact probabilities of all 675 events. Also, we can easily include a (standard) LD analysis that will confirm that the observed mosaic genome structure is consistent with recombination. To be honest, this is superfluous to the much more sophisticated battery of analyses we have done already which shows beyond any doubt that the mosaic genome can <italic>only</italic> be explained by recent recombination between significantly diverged races.</p><p>This same reviewer is confused about ploidy. The oomycete plant pathogens such as <italic>Phytophthora infestans, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> and <italic>Albugo candida</italic> are all diploids, and occasionally of higher ploidy; the point is they are not haploid. We regret any lack of clarity in our manuscript that might have led to confusion about ploidy on the part of one reviewer.</p><p>The only weakness in the manuscript that we are prepared to acknowledge is that although we showed (in multiple reps) that immunosuppression enables coexistence of races that do not have overlapping host range, we were nevertheless (despite considerable effort) unable to detect formation of new hybrids between races (we looked for oospores in leaves co-infected by different non-selfing races). But <italic>A. candida</italic> is usually heterothallic; the races we tested could all be the same mating type (and nothing is known about genes that specify mating type in this species), which would make crosses impossible. The reviewers did not appreciate that we simply wanted to show the in planta phenomenon (coexistence due to immunosuppression resulting in increased host susceptibility). Because we failed to observe heterozygotes, reviewers saw this as a negative result. However, our analysis suggests that the rate of (genetic exchange + recombination) is 100-1000 times lower than the mutation rate (shown in further population genetic simulations not presented in the paper, but easily provided for supplementary information), so one would expect genetic exchange to be rare.</p><p>Reviewer 1 says: “Overall, the manuscript as presented lacks novelty although the work is well done and highly publishable elsewhere.”</p><p>We contest this assessment of novelty. The significance of our work is that it shows that races that colonize different Brassicaceae, and which were previously regarded as being incapable of genetic exchange with each other, can in fact coexist due to immunosuppression, and thus (if of opposite mating type) can mate. This observation, combined with the unambiguous evidence for mosaic genomes, provides a truly novel insight into how parasites can coevolve with their hosts, enabling substantial diversification while retaining potential for further release of novelty by occasional inter-race mating and recombination. Despite their considerable genetic diversification (∼1%, which is equivalent to the divergence between humans and chimps), <italic>A. candida</italic> races exchange so much genetic material that ∼25% of their genome is from another race. We show this beyond any doubt (using five independent algorithms as well as a probabilistic recombinant analysis in HybRIDS software) and use computer simulations to exclude other evolutionary scenarios. This level of genetic exchange + recombination between specialised pathogen races has <italic>never</italic> been observed in the wild at this scale. But most novel of all, we believe, are the evolutionary and ecological implications; we show that very rarely, the new recombinants are extremely fit and colonise a given host plant over a large geographic range through clonal population expansion. We demonstrate this using population genetic simulations that show that clonal population expansion is the only plausible origin of the AcBoT and AcBoL (<italic>B. oleracea</italic> infecting) race as well as the AcNc2/AcEm2 race. We show that for AcBoT and AcBoL, this must have happened recently (probably in the last few hundred years, probably when <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> began to be widely grown in Europe), which has profound implications for agriculture.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>We have considered your appeal regarding your manuscript entitled “Immunosuppression enables expanded host ranges and can explain mosaic genome structures in</italic> Albugo candida <italic>races”.

Here the discussion could go much further</italic>.</p><p>Many thanks for these suggestions to broaden the appeal and significance of the manuscript. We have gone to some length to broaden the appeal of our findings by considering them within a broader context of other pathogens, yeast, plants, malaria vectors and vertebrates, including the recent paper in Nature on introgression in Darwin’s finches. For example, in the Discussion we highlight literature on yeast genome evolution, in which the authors infer recent hybridizations based on a genome analysis of introgression in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Introgressed regions from various other yeast species can be nearly identical to those in the donor genomes, so hybridisation must have occurred relatively recently. We draw a similar conclusion for <italic>Albugo</italic>, and in addition, we estimate the dates when recombination or hybridisation has occurred in our study system.</p><p><italic>2) The data suggest that 25% of the genome of a race is introgressed from a genome from a different host race. With this much introgression, and assuming that this study did not find exceptional cases, but rather a representative sample from the wild, one wonders about the genetic architecture of host-range determination.

We would like to see some discussion about this</italic>.</p><p>We are here asked to consider the genetic architecture of host-range determination and why recombination does not lead to “super genotypes”, with very wide host ranges. In the Introduction we state: “The adaptive evolution of, for example, new effectors that enable more efficient exploitation of one host species, increases the risk of detection in other host species by triggering their immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Kamoun, 2012</xref>)”.

However, suppression of innate immunity of both <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> by <italic>Albugo candida</italic> was first described by Cooper et al., 2008a (cited in the manuscript).
