barriers that prevent frequent zoonotic transmission and pandemics. One of these barriers is the poor activity of avian IAV polymerases in human cells. Differences between avian and mammalian ANP32 proteins underlie this host range barrier. Human ANP32A and ANP32B homologues both support function of human-adapted influenza polymerase but do not support efficient activity of avian IAV polymerase which requires avian ANP32A. We show here that the gene currently designated as avian ANP32B is evolutionarily distinct from mammalian ANP32B, and that chicken ANP32B does not support IAV polymerase activity even of human-adapted viruses. Consequently, IAV relies solely on chicken ANP32A to support its replication in chicken cells. Amino acids 129I and 130N, accounted for the inactivity of chicken ANP32B. Transfer of these residues to chicken ANP32A abolished support of IAV polymerase. Understanding ANP32 function will help develop antiviral strategies and aid the design of influenza virus resilient genome edited chickens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45066.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The influenza A virus pandemic of 1918 killed more people than the armed conflicts of World War 1. Like all other pandemic and seasonal influenza, this virus originated from bird viruses. In fact, avian influenza viruses continually threaten to spark new outbreaks in humans, but pandemics do not occur often. This is because these viruses must undergo several adaptations before they can replicate in and spread between people.</p><p>Viruses make new copies of themselves using the molecular machinery of the cells that they invade. The proteins that make up this machinery are often slightly different in different species, and so a virus that can replicate in cells of one species might not be able to do so when it invades a cell from another species. In 2016, researchers discovered that species differences in a cell protein called ANP32A pose a key barrier that avian influenza viruses have to overcome.</p><p>Now, Long et al. â including some of the researchers involved in the 2016 study â show that the avian influenza virus cannot replicate in chicken cells that lack ANP32A. Exploring closely related versions of the genes that produce ANP32A and its relative ANP32B in different species revealed the region of the protein that the virus relies on to support its replication. Long et al. speculate that by making a few small changes to the ANP32A gene in chickens, it might be possible to generate a gene-edited chicken that is resilient to influenza.</p><p>Close contact with poultry has led to hundreds of cases of âbird âfluâ in South East Asia, many of which have been fatal. Moreover, if avian influenza viruses mutate further in an infected person, a new pandemic could begin. Stopping influenza viruses from replicating in chickens would prevent people from being exposed to these dangerous viruses, whilst also improving the welfare of the chickens.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) infect a wide range of host species but originate from wild birds. Zoonotic transmission from the avian reservoir is initially restricted by host specific species barriers. Infection of new host species requires the virus to bind to cell surface receptors, utilise foreign host cellular proteins whilst evading host restriction factors in order to replicate its genome, and finally transmit between individuals of the new host.</p><p>The negative sense RNA genome of influenza A virus (IAV) is replicated in the cell nucleus using a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a heterotrimer composed of the polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic (PA) proteins together with nucleoprotein (NP) that surrounds the viral RNA, forming the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Crucially, the viral polymerase must co-opt host factors to carry out transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). The PB2 subunit is a major determinant of the host restriction of the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almond, 1977</xref>). Avian IAV polymerases typically contain a glutamic acid at position 627 of PB2, and mutation to a lysine, the typical residue at this position in mammalian-adapted PB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Subbarao et al., 1993</xref>), can adapt the avian polymerase to function efficiently in mammalian cells. We have suggested that the restriction of avian IAV polymerase is due to a species specific difference in host protein ANP32A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Long et al., 2016</xref>). Avian ANP32A proteins have a 33 amino acid insertion, lacking in mammals, and overexpression of chicken ANP32A (chANP32A) in human cells rescues efficient function of avian origin IAV polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Long et al., 2016</xref>). Removal of the 33 amino acids from chANP32A prevents polymerase rescue, whilst conversely artificial insertion of the 33 amino acids into either huANP32A or B overcomes host restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Long et al., 2016</xref>). A naturally occurring splice variant of avian ANP32A lacks the first four amino acids of the 33 amino acid insertion, reducing the rescue efficiency of avian IAV polymerase in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2018</xref>). This may be due to the disruption of a SUMOylation interaction motif, shown to enhance chANP32Aâs interaction with IAV polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Domingues and Hale, 2017</xref>). In human cells, both family members ANP32A and ANP32B (huANP32A/B) are utilised by human adapted IAV polymerases, and are thought to stimulate genome replication from the viral cRNA template, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sugiyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that the avian ANP32B clade is evolutionarily distinct from mammalian and other ANP32Bs. We demonstrate that two amino acids differences, N129 and D130, in the LRR5 domain of chANP32B render it unable to interact with and support IAV polymerase function. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to remove the exon encoding the 33 amino acid insertion from chANP32A or to knockout the entire protein in chicken cells. Edited cells that expressed the short chANP32A isoform lacking the additional 33 amino acids supported mammalian-adapted but not avian IAV polymerase activity. Cells completely lacking chANP32A did not support either mammalian or avian IAV polymerase activity and were resilient to IAV infection. These results suggest a strategy to engineer IAV resilience in poultry through genetic deletion or amino acid changes of the LRR domain of ANP32A protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic analysis identifies that avian ANP32B is a paralog of mammalian ANP32B</title><p>To examine the relatedness of ANP32 proteins from different species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using vertebrate ANP32 protein sequences using <italic>Drosophila</italic> mapmodulin protein as an outgroup. ANP32A and E homologues formed well-supported monophyletic clades which included multiple avian and mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Most vertebrate ANP32B proteins formed a monophyletic clade but this clade did not include avian ANP32B proteins. Rather, avian ANP32B proteins were strongly supported as members of a distinct clade with ANP32C from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and unnamed predicted proteins from non-placental mammals. This suggests that avian ANP32B and mammalian ANP32B are paralogues: birds have lost the protein orthologous to human ANP32B and eutherian mammals have lost the protein orthologous to avian ANP32B. Synteny provides further evidence to support the evolutionary relationship between avian ANP32B, <italic>Xenopus</italic> ANP32C, and the unnamed marsupial gene as they are all found adjacent to ZNF414 and MYO1F on their respective chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In humans, we found a short stretch of sequence between ZNF414 and MY01F which appears homologous to avian ANP32B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This provides further evidence that a functional gene orthologous to avian ANP32B has been lost in placental mammals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45066.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic and sequence analysis reveals avian ANP32B to be a paralog of mammalian ANP32B.</title><p>The best maximum-likelihood tree was calculated from a set of ANP32 proteins with mapmodulin from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as an outgroup using RAxML with 100 bootstraps.

Exogenous expression of C-terminally FLAG-tagged chANP32A could rescue the activity of avian IAV polymerase whereas expression of chANP32B-FLAG, which naturally lacks the 33 amino acid insertion, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In double knockout cells, neither human-adapted nor avian-origin polymerase were active. Expression of chANP32A-FLAG rescued activity of both polymerases but expression of chicken ANP32B-FLAG rescued neither, despite confirmation of robust expression by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). This suggests that chicken ANP32B is not functional for IAV polymerase and that the IAV polymerase activity relies on ANP32A in chicken cells. To confirm this in chicken cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate chicken DF-1 cells which lacked chANP32B but retained chANP32A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Wild type DF-1 cells had mRNAs for chANP32A, B and E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and supported activity of avian IAV polymerase bearing either PB2 627E or 627K. Overexpression of chANP32B-FLAG did not affect activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). DF-1 bKO cells also supported activity of both polymerases and again, exogenous expression of chANP32B had no effect. Since chicken cells lacking expression of chANP32B did not demonstrate any loss of IAV polymerase activity compared to WT, this implied that chANP32B is not functional for IAV polymerase and that IAV polymerase uses solely ANP32 family member A in chicken cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45066.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chicken ANP32B is not functional for IAV polymerase.</title><p>Cells were transfected with avian H5N1 50â92 polymerase (PB2 627E or 627K) together with NP, firefly minigenome reporter, <italic>Renilla</italic> expression control, either Empty vector (control) or ANP32 expression plasmid and incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hr.

Chicken PGC cells were genome edited using CRISPR/Cas9 and a single guide RNA which generated chANP32A knock-out cells (aKO) containing a biallelic deletion of 8 nucleotides in exon 1. PGCs lacking the 33 amino acid insertion in chANP32A were generated using a pair of guide RNAs to remove exon five resulting in chicken cells with a mammalian-like ANP32A (Î33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The precise deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequence analysis of subcloned PCR products from genomic DNA, and both found to be homozygous at both alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We differentiated the edited chicken PGCs into fibroblast-like cells using serum induction with the aim of generating cell lines to test avian IAV polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Removal of the 33 amino acids from ANP32A resulted in restriction of the 627E polymerase but not the 627K polymerase, mirroring the avian IAV polymerase phenotype observed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Long et al., 2016</xref>).

In avian ANP32A proteins (except some flightless birds) a sequence duplication, derived in part from nucleotides that encode 27 amino acids (149-175), has resulted in an additional exon and an insertion of up to 33 amino acids between the central domain and the LCAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We previously showed that insertion of the 33 amino acids from the central domain of chANP32A into the equivalent region of the human ANP32A or huANP32B proteins conferred the ability to rescue the activity of a restricted avian IAV polymerase in human cells. The equivalent 33 amino acid insertion into chANP32B (chANP32B<sup>33</sup>) did not support avian IAV polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In order to ascertain the domains of chANP32B that rendered it non-functional for IAV polymerase activity, we generated chimeric constructs between human and chicken ANP32B. To measure the rescue of avian IAV polymerase in human 293 T cells, all chimeric constructs had the 33 amino acid sequence derived from chANP32A inserted between the LRR and LCAR domains. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed that all chimeric constructs were expressed and localised to the cell nucleus as for the wild type ANP32 proteins. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Swapping the LCAR domain of chANP32B into huANP32B<sup>33</sup> did not prevent the rescue of avian IAV polymerase (huANP32B<sup>33</sup><sub>LCAR</sub>). Introduction of the central domain of chANP32B into huANP32B (huANP32B<sup>33</sup><sub>CENT</sub>) significantly reduced rescue efficiency and swapping the LRR domain of chANP32B (huANP32B<sup>33</sup><sub>LRR</sub>) rendered the protein non-functional to avian IAV polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). By sequential swapping of each LRR repeat, the 5<sup>th</sup> LRR of chANP32B was found to be the domain that prevented rescue of avian IAV polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The fifth LRR contains five amino acid differences between human and chicken ANP32B, highlighted on the crystal structure of huANP32A, plus an additional one difference to chANP32A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Since chicken cells that completely lack expression of chANP32A show no polymerase activity in the minigenome assay, they might be refractory to IAV infection. Multi-cycle growth kinetics of recombinant influenza A viruses were measured in WT and aKO PGC-derived fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To ensure robust infection, recombinant viruses were generated carrying H1N1 vaccine strain PR8 haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and M genes; this also mitigated the risks of working with avian influenza viruses with novel antigenicity. Infectious titres of recombinant virus with internal genes of avian H5N1 virus 50â92 were not detected in the chicken cells lacking ANP32A infected at low MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). At higher MOI virus titres were significantly reduced compared to WT chicken cells, almost 325-fold less at 8 hr post infection and 16-fold less by 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Similarly, at low MOI, a recombinant virus with internal genes from the H7N9 virus A/Anhui/1/2013, had limited virus growth in aKO cells but replicated efficiently in WT fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). At the higher MOI, peak viral titres were 1365-fold less than in WT cells at 8 hr post infection and 100-fold less by 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Since virus growth in aKO cells was observed at the higher MOI, we sequenced the PB2 gene of virus progeny to determine if this replication was due to adaptation in PB2. At 24 hr post infection the sequence of the PB2 gene from virus in supernatants of cells infected at high MOI was determined. Virus recovered from aKO and WT cells was found to be identical and contained no sequence changes compared with the inoculum, suggesting adaptation in PB2 was not required for the low level of replication seen in the aKO cells.

We found avian ANP32B proteins formed a separate phylogenetic group from other ANP32Bs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Synteny demonstrated that an avian ANP32B homologue was present in coelacanth, amphibians and non-placental mammals as these loci were identical to the ANP32B locus in birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). A functional avian ANP32B homologue has been lost in placental mammals although a very small part of an ANP32 gene remained in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Human ANP32C is an intronless gene that is most closely related to ANP32A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reilly et al., 2014</xref>) and is unrelated to the avian ANP32B clade. There was no evidence found of a mammalian ANP32B homologue in birds.</p><p>Chicken ANP32B could not support influenza polymerase function due to an amino acid difference in LRR5 at residue 129 that adversely affected the interaction between chANP32B and influenza polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Other avian ANP32B proteins, including those of duck and turkey, carry isoleucine at residue 129 suggesting that our findings may also be applicable to other avian hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The replacement of the exposed polar residue, asparagine (N129) with the hydrophobic isoleucine (I) may have led to the disruption of a key electrostatic interaction between ANP32A and the virus polymerase complex. In addition to the residue 129I, the central domain (amino acids 141â175) of chANP32B also contributed to its poor efficiency at rescuing avian IAV polymerase function in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This, together with the observation that scrambling amino acids 149â175 in chANP32A prevented both human-adapted and avian IAV polymerase function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that LRR5 and the central domain of ANP32A are crucial to IAV polymerase function. Our finding that chANP32B is non-functional for IAV polymerase was recently corroborated by another research group; this preliminary work also found that this phenotype mapped to residues 129I and 130N of chANP32B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The observation that scrambling the 33-amino acid insertion prevented avian IAV polymerase rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with results from by Domingues and Hale and Baker and colleagues which showed that the SUMO Interaction motif (SIM)-like sequence present in the 33 amino acid insertion (VLSLV), was required for strong binding to both 627E and 627K polymerase and its deletion or mutation decreased its ability to support avian IAV polymerase activity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Domingues and Hale, 2017</xref>). Understanding the domains important to binding and function may help us understand the mechanism by which ANP32A or B support IAV polymerase which is still not fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sugiyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Chicken cells lacking ANP32A did not support activity of avian or human-adapted IAV polymerase in minigenome assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, at higher MOI, virus replication was observed in aKO cells, although still significantly lower than in WT PGC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c&amp;d</xref>). This implies some IAV polymerase function, albeit inefficient, in the absence of chANP32A in the context of virus infection. Other viral products present during virus infection such as NEP may partly compensate for the block in replication in cells that lack chANP32A. Indeed NEP expression has been reported to rescue avian polymerase replication in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">MÃ¤nz et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless the significantly reduced level of virus replication observed in the chicken cells that lack chANP32A in vitro implies that in vivo, chickens that do not express ANP32A or express altered protein may be resilient to infection by IAV. It will be pertinent to investigate whether IAV can evolve to replicate in chicken cells that lack or express a mutated ANP32A although no adaptation of PB2 gene was observed here. The discrepancy between the lack of polymerase activity in the minigenome assay in absence of ANP32A yet limited replication observed using infectious virus in the same cells may ultimately reveal interesting insights about how ANP32A supports polymerase. The use of the PGC-derived chicken cells to investigate a host factor essential for virus raises the possibility of generating genome-edited chicken models resistant or resilient to infection. Chicken PGCs can be efficiently genome-edited to generate specific haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Idoko-Akoh et al., 2018</xref>). Our novel method of chicken PGC differentiation into fibroblast-like cells enabled robust testing of a defined genotype, and will permit future investigation of other host genetic factors identified through forward genetic screens and suspected to play important roles in virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrated that a mutated chANP32A was able to bind histone 4, suggesting this cellular role may not be affected by amino acid change at 129. However, there are many roles attributed to ANP32A proteins in the cell, such as embryogenesis, and disruption of these functions may limit the ability to generate healthy gene-edited animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reilly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reilly et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that specific domains of ANP32 proteins are important for the function of IAV polymerases and describe a lack of redundancy in the involvement of ANP32 family members to support IAV polymerase complex in chicken cells that is determined by the variation in ANP32 protein sequences. These data may aid in the design of novel small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the ANP32-polymerase interface and form the basis of a potential pathway for the generation of influenza virus resilient animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td>GFP<sup>+</sup>/Hyline cross</td><td>Roslin Institute</td><td/><td>Fertile heterozygous eggs for PGC derivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Primary cells (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td>Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs)</td><td><italic>G. gallus</italic> GFP<sup>+</sup>/Hyline cross, Roslin Institute (This study)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td>DF-1 fibroblasts</td><td>American Type Culture Collection</td><td>CRL-12203;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.

Avian influenza virus relies exclusively on avian ANP32A, thereby defining the host range of influenza virus and is dependent upon a duplication in ANP32A that is unique to birds. In this work the authors could show that human and avian ANP32B are paralogues with a different evolutionary history. Using a series of genomic deletions or mutations in human and avian cells, they show that influenza polymerase is effectively non-functional in human cells lacking both ANP32A and B, whereas deletion of only ANP32A in chicken cells yields the same phenotype. In complementation experiments, the authors could further show that ANP32B cannot stimulate polymerase activity and that only two amino acid variants common to avian ANP32B render it non-functional for the viral polymerase. Intriguingly, viral replication is severely impaired in chicken cells where ANP32A is knocked out, leading the authors to propose that genetic modification of chickens could serve as a bio-control for influenza virus.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose that &quot;avian ANP32B and mammalian ANP32B are paralogues: birds have lost the protein orthologous to human ANP32B and eutherian mammals have lost the protein orthologous to avian ANP32B&quot;. This is based on the phylogenetic relationships, that suggest that avian ANP32B and mammalian ANP32B shared a common ancestor gene that derived these proteins by duplication, and then one was lost in avian and the other in mammals. If this is the case, it is likely that avian have the remains of a non functional mammalian ANP32B, and mammals the remains of a non functional avian ANP32B (or ANP32C, its orthologue). Are these pseudogenes found in the genome of mammals and birds? The authors indicate in the discussion that this is the case for humans, but no mention in birds is given.</p><p>2) The way the manuscript is written and the data presented are a bit misleading. At the end, the story is that ANP32A, ANP32B and ANP32C are paralogues. Only ANP32A and ANP32B support influenza polymerase replication, with some species-specificity depending on polymerase polymorphisms. ANP32B is not found in avian, and the so called avian ANP32B is in reality ANP32C, and therefore, avian species only have ANP32A to support influenza polymerase activity, as they lack ANP32B. The authors should re-write the Abstract and some of the portions of the manuscript to make this point clear.</p><p>3) Although is clear the deletion or alteration of chicken ANP32A make chicken cells resistant to optimal replication with influenza virus, the authors cannot exclude that if mutations are introduced in chicken that abrogate the ability of ANP32A to promote virus replication, this result in a selective pressure that select for mutant influenza viruses able to use avian ANP32B or mutated avian ANP32A. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that PGC aKO are &quot;effectively resistant&quot; to influenza virus replication. Yet, Figure 7 shows clear low-level titres that persist throughout the infection and these are noted in the Discussion (paragraph three). A more rigorous assessment is needed to know if these cells support viral replication, both in low MOI multi-cycle and high MOI single-cycle infections. While this could appear to be a semantic distinction, it is critically important for their proposed use of aKO as a bio-control. Any level of viral replication in aKO cells raises the possibility that the virus will adapt, possibly by acquiring the ability to utilise ANP32B. Do viruses recovered at 48hr contain any novel mutations, especially in 7a or 7c-d where titres persist or even increase at later times?</p><p>5) The authors propose using aKO in chickens as a means to control influenza virus replication. While a potentially interesting approach, the current data limit confidence in this conclusion. Influenza virus rapidly adapts to diverse host environments, with as little as a single amino acid change in the polymerase conveying new functionality in using different ANP32 proteins. It would seem likely that adaptive variants would arise under these conditions. Moreover, knock-out analysis in mice shows that ANP32A plays an important role in embryogenesis, and that this is more pronounced in the absence of ANP32B (Reilly et al., 2011). Will this also occur in chickens, which naturally lack a true ANP32B paralog and where the newly-named ANP32C is nonfunctional in at least its ability to support IAV polymerases? A more tempered and nuanced discussion of the potential of aKOs is warranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45066.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose that &quot;avian ANP32B and mammalian ANP32B are paralogues: birds have lost the protein orthologous to human ANP32B and eutherian mammals have lost the protein orthologous to avian ANP32B&quot;.

Subsequently, ANP32C was lost in the ancestor of placental mammals and ANP32B was lost in the ancestor of birds. The reviewers suggest that the remains of ANP32C should be found in mammals and ANP32B should be found in birds. We have searched more extensively for evidence of these genes. For humans, the synteny surrounding where a gene orthologous to avian ANP32B should be is the same as in marsupials. There is a small amount of evidence that there are remnants of what would have been an ANP32 gene still present in humans: specifically, LRR3 of avian ANP32B maps to the human genome at this locus. However, for mammalian ANP32B in birds, the synteny of the surrounding genes suggests that the gene was lost through a chromosomal rearrangement (e.g. an inversion) as the surrounding genes in birds are very different.</p><p>In humans, there is an intronless gene named ANP32C, which is unrelated to <italic>Xenopus</italic> ANP32C and Avian ANP32Bs, but is closely related to ANP32A.

We have altered this to âresilientâ in the manuscript.</p><p>We have repeated the virology in the WT and aKO PGC fibroblast cells in order to robustly test their resilience to infection. Previously we did not pH wash cells to remove any virus present in the inoculum for fear of damaging the PGC fibroblasts. Since then we have found they tolerate it well and have disregarded previous virus growth curves as we could not be confident if we were measuring residual virus from the inoculum or true virus amplification. This has been updated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>We infected WT and aKO PGC fibroblasts with either PR8 reassortant H5N1 or H7N9 virus at an MOI of 0.0001 or 1.0. We observed no or very limited replication in the aKO cells at the lower MOI and were unable to sequence from this material at the 48 hour time point.

We only state here that our data suggest this as a possible and very novel approach. We believe that the data here warrant the generation of ANP32A gene-edited chickens to test this possibility as a next step and we have recently obtained funding to this end. Part of this project will include the examination of virus evolution in conditions where ANP32A is lacking or altered.</p><p>We have better represented the limitations of our findings in the Discussion to acknowledge the possible detrimental effect on host of ANP32A modification and discuss the need to examine virus evolution in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
