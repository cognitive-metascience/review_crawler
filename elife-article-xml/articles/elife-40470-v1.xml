Among them, <italic>lncEGFL7OS</italic>, located in the opposite strand of the <italic>EGFL7/miR-126</italic> gene, is regulated by ETS factors through a bidirectional promoter in ECs. It is enriched in highly vascularized human tissues, and upregulated in the hearts of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. LncEGFL7OS silencing impairs angiogenesis as shown by EC/fibroblast co-culture, in vitro/in vivo and ex vivo human choroid sprouting angiogenesis assays, while lncEGFL7OS overexpression has the opposite function. Mechanistically, lncEGFL7OS is required for MAPK and AKT pathway activation by regulating EGFL7/miR-126 expression. MAX protein was identified as a lncEGFL7OS-interacting protein that functions to regulate histone acetylation in the EGFL7/miR-126 promoter/enhancer. CRISPR-mediated targeting of EGLF7/miR-126/lncEGFL7OS locus inhibits angiogenesis, inciting therapeutic potential of targeting this locus. Our study establishes lncEGFL7OS as a human/primate-specific EC-restricted lncRNA critical for human angiogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40470.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A well-networked supply of blood vessels is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the body. To do so, new blood vessels need to form throughout life, from embryonic development to adult life. This process, known as angiogenesis, also plays a critical role in exercise, menstruation, injury and disease.</p><p>If it becomes faulty, it can lead to conditions such as the ‘wet’ version of age-related macular degeneration, where leaky blood vessels grow under the retina. This can lead to rapid and severe loss of vision. One way to treat this condition is to stop the growth of new blood vessels into this area using anti-angiogenic therapy, but not all patients respond to it. Identifying new mechanisms at play in human angiogenesis could provide insight into potential new therapies for this disease and other angiogenesis-related conditions.</p><p>A large amount of our genetic material is made up of a group of molecules called long non-coding RNAs or lncRNAs for short, which normally do not code for proteins. However, they are thought to play a role in many processes and diseases, but it has been unclear if they also influence angiogenesis. Now, Zhou, Yu et al. set out to study these RNA molecules in different types of human vessel-lining cells and to identify their role in angiogenesis.</p><p>Out of the 30,000 lncRNAs measured, about 500 of them were more abundant in these cells than other types of cells. One of the lncRNAs, called lncEGFL7OS, can be found on two human genes known to be relevant in angiogenesis (EGFL7 and miR-126). The results showed that patients with a condition called dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle overstretches and becomes weak, had elevated levels of lncEGFL7OS. Other experiments analyzing human eye tissue revealed that lncEGFL7OS is required for angiogenesis by increasing the concentration of the EGFL7 and miR-126 gene products in cells. To achieve this, it binds together with a specific protein to the regulatory regions of the two genes to control their activity.</p><p>The discovery of a new control mechanism for angiogenesis in humans could lead to new therapies for conditions such as macular degeneration and other diseases in which angiogenesis is affected. A next step will be to see if the same RNA molecules and genes are also elevated in other diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group

and homeostasis. Aberrant angiogenesis has been associated with numerous diseases, including heart disease, tumor growth, metastasis and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmeliet, 2003</xref>). Defective vascularization, usually associated with compensatory angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, has been observed in human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Boer et al., 2003</xref>). Methods to augment angiogenesis have been tested clinically for DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ylä-Herttuala et al., 2017</xref>). Anti-angiogenic therapy, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), has shown efficacy clinically in treating wet AMD, the leading blinding disease in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zampros et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hurwitz et al., 2004</xref>). However, some patients failed to respond to anti-VEGF treatment. Similarly, anti-angiogenic therapies have shown efficacy in certain cancers when used alone or combined with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sandler et al., 2006</xref>). However, anti-angiogenic therapy has met several hurdles on its way to be an main option for cancer therapy, mainly due to drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shojaei and Ferrara, 2007</xref>). Identifying novel human angiogenesis mechanism would provide important insights and potential therapeutic options for angiogenesis-related diseases.</p><p>It is now established that up to 90% of the human genome is transcribed, and the majority of these transcripts are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that do not encode proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ecker, 2012</xref>). NcRNAs can be classified as short noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other classic ncRNAs. miRNAs include a group of small noncoding RNAs sized ~22 nucleotides that play important regulatory functions in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Olson, 2009</xref>). LncRNAs represent a large group of long (typically &gt;200 nt) noncoding RNAs, whose function is still largely enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>). The study of lncRNAs in vascular biology is still in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MM and Goyal, 2016</xref>). Several lncRNAs, including MALAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michalik et al., 2014</xref>), MANTIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leisegang et al., 2017</xref>), PUNISHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurian et al., 2015</xref>), MEG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), MIAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2015</xref>), SENCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulberdaa et al., 2016</xref>), GATA6-AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann et al., 2018</xref>) and STEEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Man et al., 2018</xref>), have been shown to regulate angiogenesis. Dependent on their subcellular localizations, these lncRNAs function by regulating promoter and enhancer activities of angiogenesis-related genes in cis, or modulating gene expression by in trans mechanism through interaction with DNA/RNA-binding proteins or chromatin modifying proteins, or functioning as antisense RNAs to mRNAs or sponge for miRNAs in the cytoplasm.</p><p>By profiling more than 30,000 lncRNAs in several primary human EC lines, we have identified ~500 human EC-restricted lncRNAs. Among them, we focused on <italic>lncEGFL7OS</italic>, which is located in the opposite strand of the <italic>EGFL7/miR-126</italic> gene. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we established lncEGFL7OS as a disease-relevant, human/primate-specific, EC-enriched lncRNA that is critical for angiogenesis through regulating MAX transcription factor activity at the EGFL7/miR-126 locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microarray profiling of lncRNAs in ECs and confirmation of the EC-restricted lncRNAs</title><p>To identify lncRNAs specific in ECs, a microarray was performed to profile ~30,000 lncRNAs and ~26,000 coding transcripts using an Arraystar human LncRNA microarray v3.0 system (Arraystar, Rockville, MD). Three primary human EC lines and two non-EC lines at low passages, namely, human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), human retinal EC (HREC), human choroidal EC (HCEC), human dermal fibroblast cell (HDF) and human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell lines, were used in the array. Purity of EC lines was confirmed by acetyl-LDL uptake and EC marker staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the array results validated the clustering of EC lines, which clearly separates from the HDF and RPE cell lines based on lncRNA and mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, lncRNAs appeared to be a stronger classifier to distinguish between EC and non-ECs than mRNAs. 498 lncRNAs are enriched in all three EC lines for more than two folds compared to the non-ECs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for top 50 hits, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among them, 308 are intergenic lncRNAs, 62 are sense overlapping lncRNAs, 83 are antisense lncRNAs, 23 are bidirectional lncRNAs, and 22 lncRNAs were previously identified as pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When these lncRNAs were cross-referenced with the enhancer-like lncRNAs, 19 of them are known enhancer-like lncRNAs with nearby coding genes within 300 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ørom et al., 2010</xref>). We also took advantage of our microarray system in profiling both lncRNAs and mRNAs, and examined the lncRNA/mRNA regulation relationship for the EC-restricted lncRNAs. Since many lncRNAs have been shown to exert locus-specific effect on nearby genes, we first did a bioinformatics search for protein-coding genes that are within 10 kb of the 498 EC-restricted lncRNAs. 91 lncRNAs have protein-coding genes within 10 kb of the lncRNA gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Moreover, 27 of the 91 lncRNAs exhibited parallel expression pattern to the neighboring mRNAs in all 5 cell lines tested, while three of them showed inverse expression pattern relationship with the neighboring mRNAs. For some lncRNAs, including those near to <italic>SRGN</italic>, <italic>FOXC2</italic>, <italic>STEAP1B</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>GOT2</italic>, <italic>EGFL7</italic> and <italic>PRKAR1B</italic>, the specificity for lncRNA in ECs is more robust than the neighboring mRNAs; for some other lncRNAs, including those near to <italic>HHIP</italic>, <italic>ESAM</italic>, and <italic>UBE2L3</italic>, their EC-specificity is less robust than their neighboring mRNAs. These results suggest that some lncRNAs can serve as robust EC-restricted gene expression markers. We also carried out a functional enrichment analysis based on the EC-restricted lncRNAs and the associated genes. The following biological processes and genes are highly represented in the associated lncRNAs with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>): (1) heart development (NRP1, ECE1, FOXC2, PKD1, ZFPM2, FKBP1A, FOXP4); (2) chordate embryonic development (GATA2, SATB2, ECE1, LMX1B, FOXC2, PKD1, ZFPM2); (3) embryonic development ending in birth (GATA2, SATB2, ECE1, LMX1B, FOXC2, PKD1, ZFPM2); (4) blood vessel development (NRP1, EGFL7, ROBO4, FOXC2, PKD1, ZFPM2); (5) vasculature development (NRP1, EGFL7, ROBO4, FOXC2, PKD1, ZFPM2); and (6) metallopeptidase activity (ECE1, ADAMTS16, LTA4H, MMP25, ADAM15).

SENCR was used a marker for cytoplasmic-enriched lncRNA, while NEAT-1 was used as a marker for nuclear enriched- lncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).

RNaseA-treated samples were used as negative control and adeno-lncEGFL7OS-overexpressed HUVECs were used as positive control for specificity of the probe.

Taken together, these data indicate that lncEGFL7OS is expressed at relatively low copy numbers in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HUVEC cells.</p><p>To study the involvement of lncEGFL7OS in cardiovascular disease, we asked whether lncEGFL7OS expression correlates with human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a disease with defective vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Boer et al., 2003</xref>). Increased expression of proangiogenic factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and VEGF-A, have been found in DCM, likely due to the compensatory angiogenesis and/or increased mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to the diseased heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roura et al., 2007</xref>). The expression of lncEGFL7OS was examined by qRT-PCR in the hearts of 7 DCM patients, with five healthy hearts used as controls. In the DCM hearts, the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a prominent marker for heart failure, was drastically upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with the increased angiogenic factors, the expression of EC/EPC marker PECAM-1 was also marginally increased. We found lncEGFL7OS expression was significantly elevated in the hearts of DCM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of EGFL7B and EGFL7C, as well as pri-miR-126, was also significantly upregulated in the hearts of DCM patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Regulation of lncEGFL7OS expression by ETS factors through a bidirectional promoter in HUVECs</title><p>To dissect the lncEGFL7OS regulation mechanism in relation to its host gene EGFL7/miR-126, we aimed to identify the potential regulatory elements for lncEGFL7OS. We have analyzed the cell type-specific active element of the locus from online database UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A critical regulatory element is located on EGFL7B promoter between lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7/miR-126. Bioinformatics data from ENCODE indicate that <italic>LncEGFL7OS</italic> DNA contains a region positive for epigenetic marks including histone H3 trimethylated lysine four methylation (H3K4Me1) and H3K27Ac (mark poised and active enhancers), H3K4Me3 (marks promoter of protein coding genes), and binding sites for transcription factors MAX, MYC and RNA Polymerase (PolR) II. Several binding sites for ETS transcription factors were found in region. We have shown that its homologous region drives the EC-enriched LacZ reporter gene expression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>). Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) PCR assay using antibodies against MAX/MYC, RNA Pol II and histone H3 trimethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3) demonstrated the binding of these factors specifically to the region but not a non-relevant nearby region, indicating that this region is transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additional potential promoters were not found in the region between lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7 transcripts by bioinformatics approach. Instead, CpG islands were found in the region. CpG islands in mammalian promoter regions tend to show bidirectional promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antequera, 2003</xref>). Bidirectional promoters have been proposed to drive head-to-head gene transcription involving ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uesaka et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these, we tested a novel hypothesis that a bidirectional promoter (<italic>lncEGFL7OS/EGFL7/miR-126</italic> promoter) regulated by ETS factors drives the expression of both lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7/miR-126 in human ECs. The putative <italic>lncEGFL7OS</italic> promoter was cloned into a promoter-less luciferase reporter construct in either sense or anti-sense direction. By luciferase assay, the promoter in either direction exhibited similar activity under baseline in 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, ETS1 transcription factor significantly activated the promoter activity in either direction, while the ETS1mut that lacks the DNA-binding domain showed significantly reduced activation of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>). ETS factors have been shown to regulate miR-126 expression in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2010</xref>).To further test whether ETS factors are required to regulate lncEGFL7OS expression, ETS1 and ETS2 genes were silenced in HUVEC cells, and lncEGFL7OS and pri-miR-126 expression were examined by qRT-PCR. Both genes were significantly reduced by ETS1/2 silencing, suggesting ETS factors control the expression of both lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7/miR-126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Regulation of angiogenesis by lncEGFL7OS in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To define the potential role for lncEGFL7OS in angiogenesis, we performed EC-fibroblast co-culture assays after silencing lncEGFL7OS using two independent siRNAs in HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hetheridge et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Under starvation condition, si-lincEGFL7#2 significantly decreased EC proliferation as shown by BrdU incorporation compared to the random control, while the effect from si-lncEGFL7OS#1 was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the EC proliferation induced by VEGF treatment was significantly repressed by either si-lncEGFL7OS#1 or si-lncEGFL7OS#2. To further characterize the reduced EC proliferation after lncEGFL7OS knockdown, the cell cycle profile was quantified after flow cytometry under normal culture conditions. A significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase was observed upon lncEGFL7OS knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Accordingly, cells in the S and G2/M phase are significantly decreased. This indicates a G1 arrest in the si-lncEGFL7OS treated cells. We also determined whether EC migration is affected by lncEGFL7OS knockdown. Using a scratch wound assay, we found that compared to the control, lncEGFL7OS silencing significantly repressed EC migration in response to VEGF treatment after wound scratch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). To assess whether lncEGFL7OS silencing results in EC death, TUNEL assay was performed. In the control condition,~0.4% of EC cells undergo cell death, silencing of lncEGFL7OS by siRNA#1 and #2 significantly increased EC death to ~0.55% and~0.64%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the increase of EC death by si-lncEGFL7OS is statistically significant, but probably not biologically important with regard to the angiogenic phenotypes observed. These results indicate that lncEGFL7OS is required for proper EC proliferation and migration in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40470.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Regulation of EC proliferation and migration by lncEGFL7OS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of EC proliferation in response to VEGF-A as indicated by BrDU incorporation after lncEGFL7OS silencing (n = 3).

The expression of EGFL7B-C and miR-126 was examined by qRT-PCR upon lncEGFL7OS knockdown.

The downregulation of EGFL7 at protein level by lncEGFL7OS knockdown was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, the expression of both miR-126 and miR-126*, a microRNA located in the intron of EGFL7 gene, is also downregulated by lncEGFL7OS knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). miR-126 has been shown to modulate MAP kinase signaling and PI3K-AKT signaling by targeting Spred-1 and PI3KR2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhnert et al., 2008</xref>).

We also examined whether lncEGFL7OS overexpression increases the expression of EGFL7 and miR-126.

Moreover, CRISPR-mediated targeting of EGLF7/miR-126/lncEGFL7OS locus inhibited angiogenesis, suggesting therapeutic potential of targeting this locus. Upregulation of lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7/miR-126 was observed in the hearts of DCM patients, which may reflect the compensatory vascularization/angiogenesis in DCM.

Several lncRNAs, including lncEGFL7OS, HHIP-AS1 and SENCR, were in the short list from both microarrays. The difference from our results may reflect the different cell types used in the microarrays. We found 498 lncRNAs are enriched in three different primary EC lines compared to non-EC lines using a cutoff of 2. By hierarchical cluster analysis, lncRNA-based clustering appeared to be a stronger classifier for EC lines than mRNA clustering. This is consistent with the general perception that lncRNAs exhibit better tissue specificity than mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>). We also found significant variability in lncRNA expression among EC lines, consistent the observed heterogeneity among ECs. Given the central importance of ECs in vascular biology, this dataset may provide a foundation to study the regulation and function for lncRNAs in various vascular development and disease models. Of note, we also found many lncRNAs are highly expressed in ECs, but those lncRNAs are not necessarily EC-specific (data not shown). Those lncRNAs may also important function in cell types including ECs.</p><p>Looking deep into the gene list, 91 lncRNAs of the 498 EC-restricted genes have protein coding genes within 10 kb, and about a third of them showed parallel or inverse expression pattern to the associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis indicates that EC-restricted lncRNAs are associated with genes involved in vascular development. Those lncRNAs may be good candidates for further functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolution of lncEGFL7OS/EGFL7/miR-126 locus</title><p>The evolution of <italic>EGFL7/miR-126</italic> locus exemplifies the evolution of the vascular system. EGFL7 encodes an EGF-like domain containing protein that is specifically secreted by vascular ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker et al., 2004</xref>). It is conserved among vertebrates but an orthologue is also found in Drosophila melanogaster (CG7447) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikolic et al., 2010</xref>). miR-126 and miR-126* are encoded by the intron of EGFL7, and are conserved from Fugu in vertebrates to homo sapiens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>). They are the only miRNAs that are known to be specifically in EC lineage and hematopoietic stem cells. Loss-of-function studies in mice and zebrafish revealed an important function of miR-126 in governing vascular integrity and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>). <italic>Egfl7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display similar vascular abnormalities to <italic>MiR126<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, including edema, defective cranial vessel and retinal vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>). However, an independent study suggests that the vascular phenotype of <italic>Egfl7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could be attributed to the <italic>MiR126</italic> deletion (or downregulation) in the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhnert et al., 2008</xref>). The important regulatory function of miR-126 in vascular integrity and angiogenesis is correlated with its appearance during the evolution of vascular system in vertebrates. Besides, miR-126 also has documented functions in vascular inflammation, as well as innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agudo et al., 2014</xref>). That also correlates with the evolutionary innovation of adaptive immune system in vertebrates. These support an important function of <italic>EGFL7</italic>/miR-126 locus from the evolutionary point of view. To further dissect the function and regulation of the locus during evolution from vertebrates to humans, we identified <italic>lncEGFL7OS</italic>, which is located in the opposite strand neighboring the EGFL7/miR-126 gene. It only exists in humans and several other primates, including rhesus monkeys, but not in other lower vertebrate species including mice. Although we showed significant function of lncEGFL7OS in human angiogenesis, the full spectrum of lncEGFL7OS function remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>lncEGFL7OS is a human/primate-specific EC-restricted lncRNA required for proper human angiogenesis</title><p>The expression of lncEGFL7OS is restricted to ECs and highly vascularized tissues, which is consistent with the expression of its host genes EGFL7 and miR-126. As to its regulatory mechanisms, we found that both lncEGFL7OS and miR-126 are regulated by ETS1/2 factors in ECs through a bidirectional promoter. We found that lncEGFL7OS is required for proper angiogenesis in vitro by using EC-fibroblast co-culture vasculogenesis/angiogenesis assays. Conversely, overexpression of lncEGFL7OS enhances angiogenesis. Using a human choroid sprouting angiogenesis model we developed, we further demonstrated that lncEGFL7OS is required for human sprouting angiogenesis. This study indicates that three different transcripts from the EGFL7/miR-126 locus, including lncEGFL7OS, EGFL7 and miR-126, have important functions in angiogenesis. EGFL7 and miR-126 have been previously shown to regulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikolic et al., 2010</xref>). EGFL7 is essential for vascular tube formation during vasculogenesis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker et al., 2004</xref>). The importance of miR-126 in angiogenesis was demonstrated by loss-of-function studies in both mouse and zebrafish. Targeted deletion of miR-126 in mice or miR-126 knockdown in zebrafish resulted in loss of vascular integrity and defective angiogenesis, while overexpression of miR-126 regulates angiogenesis in a cell-type and strand-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhnert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). It is intriguing that, in contrast to EGFL7 and miR-126, lncEGFL7OS represents a human/primate-specific mechanism in regulating angiogenesis, since lncEGFL7OS only exists in human and several other primates. New angiogenesis mechanism through lncEGF7OS has evolved during evolution, which underscores the importance and delicacy of EFGL7/miR-126 locus in angiogenesis. This study also highlights the importance of using human (and/or primate) system to study the mechanism of angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Mechanism of lncEGFL7OS action</title><p>We showed that the action of lncEGFL7OS reflects at least partially the regulation of expression of EGFL7 and miR-126. miR-126 has been shown to promote MAP kinase and PI3K signaling in response to VEGF and FGF by targeting negative regulators of these signaling pathways, including Spred-1 and PIK3R2. Consistent with the downregulation of miR-126 by lncEGFL7OS silencing, we found that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT in response to VEGF is repressed by lncEGFL7OS silencing. Mechanistically, MAX transcription factor was identified as a lncEGFL7OS interaction protein required for lncEGFL7OS-regulated gene expression and angiogenesis in ECs. Under normal conditions, the lncEGFL7OS/MAX interaction is likely locus dependent since several other MAX target genes were not affected by lncEGFL7OS silencing. This is possibly due to the low expression of lncEGFL7OS. LncEGFL7OS enhances the transcription of EGFL7/miR-126 by binding to MAX protein that is recruited to the bidirectional promoter/enhancer region in EGFL7/miR-126. MAX knockdown blunts the induction of miR-126 by lncEGFL7OS in ECs. MAX transcription factor has been shown to interact with MYC to control cell proliferation and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amati and Land, 1994</xref>). MYC has been shown to stimulate histone acetylation and gene transcription by recruitment of cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vervoorts et al., 2003</xref>). Based on our results showing interaction of MAX and p300, the enrichment of H3K27 acetylation by lncEGFL7OS likely result from the recruitment of CBP and P300 by MAX/MYC. Taken together, lncEGFL7OS acts in cis by interacting with MAX transcription factor to enhance H3K7 acetylation and promote EGFL7/miR-126 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Therapeutic implications</title><p>Identifying angiogenic mechanisms that are conserved to human is critical for developing therapeutics for human vascular disorders. Our studies have demonstrated that lncEGFL7OS is a human/primate-specific lncRNA critical for human angiogenesis. This may be directly translatable for human diseases involving abnormal angiogenesis. Our studies showed increased expression of both lncEGFL7OS and EGFL7/miR-126 in the heart of DCM patients. Although the causative role of lncEGFL7OS in DCM is still unclear, lncEGFL7OS upregulation may reflect the compensatory vascularization/angiogenesis in DCM. It would be intriguing to test whether manipulating the lncEGFL7OS/EGFL7/miR-126 axis has therapeutic benefits for DCM patients. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and choroidal neovascularization is a hallmark for wet AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jager et al., 2008</xref>). Although anti-VEGF agents can markedly improve the clinical outcome of wet AMD, they have been unable to induce complete angiogenesis regression, and only 30–40% of individuals experienced vision improvement after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Folk and Stone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger Falk et al., 2013</xref>). We developed a human choroid sprouting angiogenesis model and showed that silencing of lncEGFL7OS represses human choroid sprouting angiogenesis. It would be appealing to develop and test lncEGFL7OS-based therapy to treat choroidal neovascularization in wet AMD and other vascular disorders in the future. In this regard, our data that CRISPR-mediated targeting of EGLF7/miR-126/lncEGFL7OS locus inhibits angiogenesis could have therapeutic implications in angiogenesis-related diseases. Targeting this locus could be a potent approach for inhibiting angiogenesis than targeting the three genes individually.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and in vivo angiogenesis assay</title><p>Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the ARVO statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Tulane University.

The choroid was transfected with control si-RNA, or mix of si-LncEGFL7OS#1 and si-LncEGFL7OS#2 (50nM each) for overnight. Choroid fragments were then washed by EGM2 media then placed in growth factor-reduced Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> (BD Biosciences) in 24-well plate. Briefly, 30 µl of matrigel was used to coat the bottom of 24 well plates without touching the edge of the well. After seeding the choroid, the plate was incubated in a 37 °C cell culture incubator to make the Matrigel solidify. 500 µl EC growth medium (EGM-2) were added slowly to the plate without disturbing the Matrigel, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C cell culture incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell culture medium was changed every 48 hr. The EC sprouts normally start to appear on the day five and grow rapidly between day 7 and 10. Phase contrast photos of individual explants were taken using a Nikon microscope. The sprouting distance was quantified with computer software ImageJ (National Institute of Health). Sprouting ECs were stained with ICAM-2 (BD Pharmingen) or isolectin B4 (Vector Lab).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA, Western blot analysis and Immunofluorescence</title><p>Human total RNA master panel II was purchased from clontech (Takara). Total RNA was isolated from human choroid tissues or cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was purified using a Cytoplasmic and Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp., Thorold, ON, Canada) according to manufacturer’s supplied protocol. In brief, cells growing in monolayer were rinsed with 1xPBS and lysed directly on the plate with ice-cold Lysis Buffer. Next cell lysate was transferred to the RNase-free microcentrifuge tube and spun for 3 min at 14,000 x g. Supernatant containing cytoplasmic RNA was mixed with manufacturer’s supplied buffer (Buffer SK) and 100% ethanol, and applied onto a spin column. The pellet containing the nuclear RNA was mixed with Buffer SK and 100% ethanol, and applied onto a spin column. Both columns were washed with supplied Wash Solution, and RNA was eluted with supplied elution buffer (Elution Buffer E). For maximum recovery two rounds of elution were performed. Quantitative (q) RT-PCR or regular RT-PCR was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis system (BioRad), miRNA qRT-PCR was performed using qScript cDNA Synthesis and microRNA Quantification System (Quanta Biosciences). lncEGFL7OS RACE PCR was performed using Marathon –ready cDNA from human placenta (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). 5’RACE and 3’RACE PCR was carried out using lncEGFL7OS primers and primers from the kit. Then a second round of PCR was performed using the combination of the RACE products and the RACE primers from the kit. The derived PCR product was then cloned using TOPO vector and sequenced.

Briefly, 10<sup>6</sup> HUVEC cells were harvested for total RNA isolation using Trizol. 16% (8µl out of 50 µl) of the total RNA was used for reverse transcription reaction as described above, and 1/100 of the cDNA was used as template in each well for the subsequent qRT-PCR. Therefore, for each well, the total lncEGFL7OS came from about ~1600 cells. For establishing the standard curve, pCRII-TOPO-lncEGFL7OS plasmid was linearized for generating lncEGFL7OS RNA by in vitro transcription. After concentration determination and copy number calculation, a given amount of RNA was employed to carry out the reverse transcription under the same conditions for HUVEC total RNA. The derived cDNA was diluted for PCR to generate a standard curve for lncEGFL7OS PCR. The copy number of RNA per cell was calculated based on the CT number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>High resolution RNA FISH experiments</title><p>25 Stellaris RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes for lncEGFL7OS were designed according to Stellaris FISH probe designer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biosearchtech.com/">https://www.biosearchtech.com/</ext-link> Account/Login?return=/stellaris-designer) (BiosearchTech, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jason Fish as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found your work to be an in-depth mechanistic study that is novel and of significant interest. This manuscript contributes to a growing body of work describing lncRNA function in endothelial cells. The data provide a greater understanding of the EGFL7/miR-126 locus, and is an important contribution to the field of vascular biology. Furthermore, these data contributes to the understanding of lncRNA mechanisms, especially regarding cis and in trans regulation. The reviewers commented that overall the experiments were well controlled and that the data support the main conclusions. However, there are several additional experiments that would provide necessary support for your conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion regarding the ability of lncEGFL7OS to recruit MAX to the EGFL7 locus is made from lncEGFL7OS over-expression studies. These ChIP experiments (MAX, H3K27ac) should be performed in cells in which lncEGFL7OS is knocked-down to ensure that this happens endogenously. LncEGFL7OS over-expression appears to increase MAX recruitment to multiple MAX target sites that are outside of the EGFL7 locus. It is important to demonstrate the specificity by also assessing non-MAX target sites.</p><p>2) For the in vivo Matrigel implantation model depicted in Figure 3C, the authors show increased PECAM-1 labelling indicating endothelial networking activity. A major foundation of this manuscript is that lncEGFL7OS regulates human angiogenesis.

These ChIP experiments (MAX, H3K27ac) should be performed in cells in which lncEGFL7OS is knocked-down to ensure that this happens endogenously. LncEGFL7OS over-expression appears to increase MAX recruitment to multiple MAX target sites that are outside of the EGFL7 locus. It is important to demonstrate the specificity by also assessing non-MAX target sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed MAX, H3K27ac CHIP experiments in lncEGFL7OS knockdown cells, and found that lncEGFL7OS knockdown decreased MAX and H3K27ac recruiting to the EGFL7 locus (as shown by new Figure 7A and 7B). We also include a negative control region for Chip PCR experiments showing the specificity of MAX to the MAX targeting sites (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the in vivo Matrigel implantation model depicted in Figure 3C, the authors show increased PECAM-1 labelling indicating endothelial networking activity. A major foundation of this manuscript is that lncEGFL7OS regulates human angiogenesis. While many other assays show angiogenic behaviour, the assay in Figure 3C could show actual blood vessel formation and blood flow and would strengthen the findings. For example, a stain for a red blood cell marker or contrast within the Matrigel implant could definitively show &quot;angiogenesis&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a 2-week in vivo Matrigel with the stainings suggested by the reviewers. The results show partial overlapping of human PECAM-1 staining and mouse Ter-119 (red blood cell marker) and α-SMA (smooth muscle marker) staining (New Figure 3C, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2) in the blood vessels formed from the HUVEC cells in vivo. These suggest functionality of the formed vessels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 2C and 2D show the subcellular localization of the lncEGFL7OS RNA.

We have taken the advice and have done experiments to overexpress lncEGFL7OS-(F2+F3) portion of the RNA, which doesn’t interact with MAX. We found that overexpression of this form doesn’t impact the expression of EGFL7 and miR-126, nor affect angiogenesis in EC-fibroblast co-culture assay. These confirm that the interaction of lncEGFL7OS with MAX is required for EGFL7/miR-126 regulation and angiogenesis enhanced by EGFL7/miR-126.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is unclear how low the expression levels of the lncEGFL7OS really are in endothelial cells when compared to other lncRNAs, Egfl7 mRNA and miR-126.
