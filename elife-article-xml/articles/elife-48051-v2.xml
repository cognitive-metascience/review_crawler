of cellular content. Here, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to enable the simultaneous imaging of 15+ proteins within staged MS lesions. To test the potential for IMC to discriminate between different types of lesions, we selected a case with severe rebound MS disease activity after natalizumab cessation. With post-acquisition analysis pipelines we were able to: (1) Discriminate demyelinating macrophages from the resident microglial pool; (2) Determine which types of lymphocytes reside closest to blood vessels; (3) Identify multiple subsets of T and B cells, and (4) Ascertain dynamics of T cell phenotypes vis-à-vis lesion type and location. We propose that IMC will enable a comprehensive analysis of single-cell phenotypes, their functional states and cell-cell interactions in relation to lesion morphometry and demyelinating activity in MS patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48051.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It takes an army of immune cells to defend the body against infection. But sometimes the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells and chronic inflammatory conditions develop. In multiple sclerosis – also known as “MS” – a horde of immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord, forming lesions which strip nerve cells of their insultation, a protective fatty material called myelin. Nerve cells become damaged, scarred and exposed, and this interferes with messages between the brain and other parts of the body.</p><p>Advanced imaging techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by capturing lesions as they develop in the brain and spinal cord. Researchers have also focused their efforts on understanding how immune cells activated in the blood stream invade the central nervous system. To better understand how a mistaken immune response leads to nerve damage in multiple sclerosis, a forensic examination of which immune cells accumulate in brain tissue to form lesions is needed. Standard techniques for analyzing whole tissue samples are however limited by design, capable of detecting only a few cell markers in one section of tissue.</p><p>Ramaglia et al. have now validated a new imaging technique for looking at an array of cell types in brain tissue in a single sample. The technique – called imaging mass cytometry (or IMC for short) – was used to look at post-mortem brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient with an acute form of the illness. The tissue examined had multiple sclerosis lesions present. Different types of immune cells were simultaneously identified and characterized using a panel of antibodies which recognize the signature proteins each immune cell makes when active. The state of the underlying myelin content of the tissue was also characterized.</p><p>The imaging approach could distinguish between the immune cells of the brain (known as resident microglia) and a type of white blood cell summoned as part of the immune response (infiltrating macrophages). The analysis showed that, in the particular patient examined, microglia are abundant in active lesions in multiple sclerosis; also, different subsets of white blood cells were detected. Measuring how far different immune cells had migrated from nearby blood vessels added insights as to how immune cells move through the brain and which cells may have arrived first.</p><p>Altogether, Ramaglia et al. have shown that IMC can be used as a discovery tool to gain a deeper understanding of multiple sclerosis lesions and immune cells active in the inflamed brain. Further work will apply this now validated imaging approach to large cohorts of multiple sclerosis patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>imaging mass cytometry</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>lesions</kwd><kwd>immunopathology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR-1602-07777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramaglia</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000261</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gommerman</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name><name><surname>Prat</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imaging mass cytometry simultaneously lights up distinct immune cells in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with profound heterogeneity in the neuropathological and immunopathological appearance of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucchinetti et al., 2000</xref>). Recent consensus has standardized staging of MS brain tissue into categories including normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), (p)reactive lesions (or ‘pre-phagocytic’ lesions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett and Prineas, 2004</xref>) which may represent an initial lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez et al., 2015</xref>), periplaque white matter (PPWM) which is immediately adjacent to a lesion, early or late active demyelinating lesions, mixed active/inactive demyelinating lesions (also called slowly expanding or ‘smouldering'; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischer et al., 2015</xref>), and inactive lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhlmann et al., 2017</xref>). The pattern of demyelination can also be fundamentally different between patients, with pattern I being T cell-mediated, pattern II being IgG- and complement-mediated, and pattern III and IV characterized by a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucchinetti et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Lymphocytes, microglia and macrophages are associated with active demyelination and neurodegeneration in the MS brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frischer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haider et al., 2014</xref>) and are thought to play key roles in the disease process, as supported by studies in experimental models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). Depending on the type of lesion and the sub-region within a lesion (for example center vs edge), different myeloid and lymphoid cells can be found. These have a variety of phenotypes that reflect activation state and pathologic potential. With respect to myeloid cells, yolk sac-derived (resident) microglia and blood-derived (recruited) monocytes/macrophages accumulate at sites of active demyelination and neuroaxonal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frischer et al., 2009</xref>). Microglia and macrophages within the MS brain can lose their normally homeostatic properties and acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype with expression of molecules involved in phagocytosis, oxidative injury, antigen presentation and T cell co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gay et al., 1997</xref>). Either via T cell-mediated recognition of myelin epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2001</xref>) or complement binding to myelin autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Storch et al., 1998</xref>), these lymphocyte-dependent events initiate a process that results in the activation of microglia and recruitment of macrophages at the lesion site. Microglia and macrophages become activated and internalize myelin, degrading it within their lysosomes. The detection of small (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, MOG) or large (proteolipid protein, PLP) myelin proteins indicates the temporal development of myelin destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucchinetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhlmann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In terms of lymphocytes, MS lesions contain T cells and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). In active lesions, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferate and have an activated cytotoxic phenotype. Subsequently, some CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are destroyed by apoptosis while others, with tissue-resident memory features, persist. Tissue resident memory T cells lose expression of surface molecules that are involved in the egress of leukocytes from inflamed tissue, which has been suggested as a potential mechanism responsible for the compartmentalized inflammatory response in established lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are also found in MS lesions and have been shown to produce cytokines such as IL-17 and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kebir et al., 2007</xref>). B cells are thought to differentiate into plasma cells, perhaps in situ, but little is known about their phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While past and recent immunohistological studies have provided insights into the types of immune cells populating MS lesions at different lesional stages and the neurodegenerative changes that accompany these infiltrating immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frischer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luchetti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zrzavy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Popescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>), this type of analysis requires immunohistological staining of serial sections and is limited to the number of analytes that can be simultaneously visualized on a given tissue section. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of single-cell phenotypes and functional states in relation to demyelination within MS tissue is lacking. To circumvent this challenge, we have employed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). IMC uses time-of-flight inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to detect dozens of markers simultaneously on a single tissue section. It achieves this by measuring the abundance of metal isotopes tagged to antibodies and indexed against their source location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). Applying this new technology to post-mortem MS brain tissue, we carefully analysed staged lesions in a case with severe rebound MS disease activity after natalizumab (NTZ, also known as anti-VLA4) cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larochelle et al., 2017</xref>). The highly inflammatory nature of the lesions present in the brain of this specific case, makes this tissue a good positive control to test a variety of analytes involved in neuroinflammation. The data we collected suggest that IMC, in combination with existing imaging techniques, can profoundly impact our knowledge of the inflammatory response and tissue injury in the MS brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparability of IF versus IMC approach and specificity of metal-conjugated antibodies on brain-resident cell types</title><p>In this study, we performed two separate IMC runs on the same patient and control tissue. For the patient, we selected brain tissue from a NTZ-rebound case with significant neuroinflammation and multiple types of lesions apparent including (p)reactive, active, mixed active-inactive as well as normal appearing white matter. The first run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) was to validate our panel and the approach in general. The second run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) was to evaluate the composition of immune cells across several types of lesions and sub-lesional areas. To evaluate the validity of IMC for the analysis of post-mortem MS brain tissue, we first investigated whether images generated by IMC revealed a similar number of cells expressing a given marker in a mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett and Prineas, 2004</xref>) area of tissue, as determined by IF. We used IF or IMC on serial sections from the same tissue block. Sections were stained with DAPI (IF) or Iridium-intercalator (IMC) to identify cell-associated DNA, and with anti-CD3-FITC (IF) or anti-CD3-170Er (IMC) to identify CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Imaging of equivalent ROI in IF- and IMC-stained sections showed similar staining patterns with clearly resolved anatomical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We also showed that IMC is able to resolve myelin engulfed by microglia/macrophages with a similar pattern as what is observed using IHC and IF approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we performed a number of comparisons of analytes imaged using IF versus IMC. Comparisons included (1) the number of nuclei identified with DAPI by IF and the number of nuclei identified with intercalator by IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>); (2) the number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells identified with FITC-labeled secondary antibody by IF and the number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells identified with the 170Er metal-tag by IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>); (3) the percentage of PLP<sup>+</sup> area identified with AF568-labeled secondary antibody by IF and the percentage of PLP<sup>+</sup> area identified with the 141Pr metal-tag by IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>); (4) the number of HLA<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells identified with FITC-labeled secondary antibody by IF and the number of HLA<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells identified with the 147Sm metal-tag by IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>); and (5) the number of CD68<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells identified with FITC-labeled secondary antibody by IF and the number of CD68<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells identified with the 159Tb metal-tag by IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>). All comparisons yielded a significant positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient: r = 0.9182, p=0.0002; r = 0.8929, p=0.01; r = 0.9544, p&lt;0.0001; r = 0.9794, p&lt;0.0001; r = 0.9051, p&lt;0.0001 for nuclei, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, %PLP<sup>+</sup> area, HLA<sup>+</sup> cells and CD68<sup>+</sup> cells respectively), indicating proportional representation of brain-resident cells that is in agreement for both methods. In summary, IMC reproduces staining patterns that are in agreement with those produced using the more standard IF method in an NTZ-rebound brain tissue.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48051.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing IMC to IF in MS lesions.</title><p>Two serial sections were assessed: one used for immunofluorescence (IF, <bold>a and a’</bold>) and one dedicated to Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC, <bold>a’’</bold>).

While each region of interest is stained with the entire antibody panel simultaneously, and the identification of cell phenotypes is based on all markers included in the panel (using negative and positive selection as described in the Materials and methods), we limited our depiction of the images to display no more than three analytes at once. An example of an image with 8-analytes displayed simultaneously is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. IMC imaging of the edge of an active demyelinating lesion identified CD3<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD3<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes other than T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The co-expression of CD68 in CD3<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> cells identifies these as microglia/macrophages (CD3<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Since antibodies directed to the B cell-restricted lineage markers CD19 and CD20 were sub-optimal on our brain tissues, we relied instead on antibodies that detect the two allelic variants of the immunoglobulin light chain (κ/λ). This provided two advantages: the ability to capture all B cells, irrespective of their maturation/activation status (for example, plasma cells downregulate CD19/CD20) and the ability to test specificity of our B cell directed reagents since κ and λ are allelically excluded on the surface of B cells. As expected, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells lack expression of immunoglobulin light chain, (CD3<sup>+</sup>κ/λ<sup>-</sup>). Moreover, we identified B cells that were either positive for the κ or λ light chain and negative for the CD3 marker of T cells and the CD68 marker of macrophages (for example, CD3<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>-</sup>κ<sup>+</sup> B cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> arrow, versus CD3<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>-</sup>λ<sup>-</sup> B cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> arrow and vice versa CD3<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>-</sup>κ<sup>-</sup> B cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> arrow head, versus CD3<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>-</sup>λ<sup>+</sup> B cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> arrow head). We found that the extracellular matrix protein collagen (not cell-associated) surrounded putative blood vessels lined by endothelial cells that expressed the CD31 marker as expected. In contrast, macrophages visualized by CD68 do not stain positive for collagen nor express CD31 (CD31<sup>-</sup>collagen<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Lastly, we asked whether the IMC approach would have sufficient sensitivity to detect soluble molecules that can be rare in tissues. For this, we used an antibody against granzyme B, a serine protease with pro-inflammatory function produced by activated cytotoxic T cells. IMC identified a granzyme B<sup>+</sup> signal with granular expression in close proximity to nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref>). These results show that IMC enables imaging of multiple markers on a single tissue section reproducing IF-equivalent staining patterns and with cell lineage-specific markers expressed on appropriate cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Qualitative staging of NTZ rebound lesions by IMC</title><p>To verify whether IMC provides us with the ability to differentiate normal-appearing tissue versus different lesional stages of the NTZ rebound brain, we analysed the proteolipid protein (PLP) signal that visualizes myelin and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) signal that visualizes antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Note that in some ROI, the PLP staining pattern reflects the cross-sectional orientation of myelinated fibers (for example WMC and NAWM), whereas in others, longitudinal myelin tracks are observed (for example (p)reactive). The different orientation of the tissue results from the sectioning plane of the tissue block and is reflected in the staining pattern displayed. Consistent with the generally non-inflamed and myelinated state of healthy white matter, control white matter showed intact myelin staining with few HLA<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in the NTZ rebound brain exhibited normal myelin staining, however HLA<sup>+</sup> cells within the NTZ rebound NAWM appeared enriched when compared to control white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). Similarly, the (p)reactive lesion showed a normal myelin signal but HLA<sup>+</sup> cells accumulated at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). The active lesion core showed loss of PLP signal with accumulation of HLA<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>).

In these regions, although myelination appeared normal, we also found that demyelinating blood-derived macrophages infiltrated the parenchyma.

Notably, a large proportion (on average 88%) of demyelinating myeloid cells in active lesions and at the edge of mixed active-inactive lesions were derived from the resident microglial pool, whereas macrophages that infiltrated the parenchyma of these lesional areas were largely inactive as indicated by the presence of enlarged but empty vacuoles in these cells. This is likely the result of the macrophage’s inability to digest the myelin’s neutral lipid components that accumulate and persist in macrophages.</p><p>In terms of lymphocytes, in classical active lesions and mixed active-inactive demyelinating lesions from this particular NTZ-rebound case T cells were abundant. Although CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generally predominated across lesional stages, and in some cases proliferated (as also shown in a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>), we also found a conspicuous number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells not only within lesions but also at the (p)reactive lesion site and periplaque white matter, likely reflecting the highly inflammatory nature of the lesions in this NTZ-rebound case. In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>‘chronically activated’ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) were also particularly abundant in the (p)reactive lesion site. This suggests an involvement of these cells in the early stages of lesion formation, even in established lesions in this particular case. Similar to other findings in the case of T lymphocytes, our data also reproduced immunohistological findings that described B lymphocytes in all lesion stages in lower numbers compared to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). By using IgM in combination with CD38 and κ/λ, our panel has the increased capacity of identifying different B cell subsets, including IgM<sup>+</sup> and switched memory B cells.</p><p>It has been suggested that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lesions from patients with relapsing, progressive and fulminant acute MS show features of tissue-resident memory cells and play a central role in the establishment of tissue-specific immunological memory, propagating chronic compartmentalized inflammation and tissue damage in the MS brain by local activation following re-exposure to their cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). B cells are also detected in all MS lesion types but their localization seems to be restricted to the pervascular space of some veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Machado-Santos et al have shown that the majority of B and T cells are present in the perivascular cuffs, distant from sites of initial myelin damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). This supports the possibility that demyelination is induced by soluble factors produced by lymphocyte which diffuse into the tissue and in turn activate phagocytes. Our findings from a single NTZ-rebound case with high inflammatory activity observed both perivascular localization of B and T cells, as well as examples of B and T cells that diffusely infiltrate the lesion parenchyma. However, due to the nature of the acquired region of interest, which doesn’t capture the areas surrounding the site of ablation, it is possible that blood vessels were positioned immediately outside the region of interest. These would be missed in the cell-blood vessel distance analysis. Further analysis of larger areas across multiple tissue samples is required to definitely determine whether B and T cells are found within the lesion parenchyma as a generalized feature of MS.</p><p>A comprehensive phenotypic characterization of B cells in MS tissue is lacking and the role of B cells in MS lesions is currently unresolved. Recent clinical studies have reported a protective effect of therapies targeting CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells in MS patients, suggesting a major role for B cells in the disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauser et al., 2008</xref>). Our IMC results allowed for better segregation of B cell phenotypes (memory, class switched etc). Further addition of other markers, particularly for plasma cells (such as CD138, TACI) will be important for a full characterization of B cell subsets within the MS brain. This is particularly relevant in light of recent findings that demonstrate that some B lineage cells play a protective role in neuroinflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rojas et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While IMC has the advantage of multiplexing capability, it also has limitations. For example, it yields information only about the brain region imaged and is low throughput. It is therefore possible that different cell populations can exist in brain regions and sublesional areas other than those imaged. As is the case for the analysis of tissue stained with standard IHC/IF methods, multiple regions must be acquired. In addition, our study has the limitation that it is based on the analysis of immune cells in lesions from a single case with severe MS disease activity after NTZ withdrawal. Our goal was to provide proof that the IMC technology can be used as a powerful tool for the analysis of complex cellular phenotypes in heterogeneous tissues such as the MS brain, and a future direction will be to use the technique on a well-characterized MS brain tissue cohort. Moreover, given that the cells in these lesions had known phenotypes, the supervised approach for thresholding used herein was reasonable. However in the future, unsupervised analysis of data sets generated using the IMC or other multiparametric in situ analysis approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsujikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal-Hausdorf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), may identify novel cell types in tissue that are understudied, for example the MS meninges. In addition, discovery of novel cell types using a technique such as IMC can then be recapitulated with standard techniques using multiple well-characterized specimens from established brain banks.</p><p>Overall, our data reproduced immunohistological patterns of microglia and lymphocyte activation that had previously been described in carefully staged MS brain lesions at well-defined disease stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zrzavy et al., 2017</xref>) using a multi-parameter approach. We propose that IMC will enable a high dimensional analysis of single-cell phenotypes along with their functional states, as well as cell-cell interactions in relation to lesion morphometry and (demyelinating) activity. The IMC approach in combination with parallel high throughput techniques has the potential to profoundly impact our knowledge of the nature of the inflammatory response and tissue injury in the MS brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

pathologic analysis of the brain</title><p>The clinical and pathologic characteristics of the case reported in this study have been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larochelle et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the patient was a 32-year-old female, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS in 2005. Natalizumab (NTZ) therapy was initiated (expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 5.0 per relapse, and 3.5 upon induction on NTZ) but stopped after 2 years because, although clinically and radiologically stable (EDSS 2.0), the patient tested positive to the John Cunningham virus (JVC) virus antibody titer. Glatiramer acetate was started 1 month prior to NTZ cessation, and the patient received a 5 day course of intravenous (iv) methylprednisolone after the last NTZ infusion. Four months later, the patient was hospitalized for the presentation of new motor and cognitive deficits. Over the course of 2 weeks, the patient worsened (EDSS 9.5). Despite daily course of iv methylprednisolone, the patient developed several new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on repeated MRI. Since no clinical or radiological improvements were observed, the family decided to stop active care, as per patient’s previous wishes. Autopsy was performed within 1 hr post-mortem, 4 days after withdrawal of all medication.</p><p>The patient had previously provided written consent for post-mortem donation of the CNS to research (ethics committee approval number BH.07.001). Pathologic analysis of the brain revealed abundant, active demyelinating, and highly inflammatory MS lesions with immunological pattern II (IgG- and complement-mediated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larochelle et al., 2017</xref>), according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucchinetti et al. (2000)</xref>. Despite the extent of the inflammation, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) were excluded, from a pathologic point of view, although a later study proposed that Epstein-Barr virus-associated IRIS could have been the possible cause of the fulminant MS relapse in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serafini et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, immunohistochemistry and qPCR for JCV was reported negative. Finally, the neuropathologist-confirmed diagnosis of severe MS rebound inflammatory demyelinating activity after NTZ withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larochelle et al., 2017</xref>). The non-neurological control case was an 86-year-old female that died of cardiac arrest.

For microglia we additionally used TMEM119, that is expressed on yolk sac-derived (resident) microglia but not on recruited blood-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Satoh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>). Other markers were used to detect phagocytosis (CD68) and capacity for antigen presentation (human leukocyte antigen, HLA). All T cells were detected with the cellular marker CD3. CD8α detected MHC class I restricted T cells while CD4 detected MHC class II restricted T cells. All B cells were identified by the expression of either the kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) allelic variants of the immunoglobulin light chain. CD38 was used to detect a multifunctional molecule expressed by leucocytes in general and involved in the activation of T cells and B cells. IgM was used to identify naïve and non-class switch memory B cells, in addition to detecting free immunoglobulins. Furthermore, microglia and T cells express the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT1), that translocates to the nucleus upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</xref>).

The following day, slides were first washed with 0.05% PBS-Tween and then with PBS, followed by incubation with Iridium-conjugated intercalator (Fluidigm, catalogue number 201192B), diluted 1:2000 in 0.5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Lastly, slides were dipped in water (Invitrogen ultrapure distilled water), air dried and stored at room temperature until they were ablated.</p><p><italic>Identification of region of interest (ROI) for laser ablation</italic>. Two serial sections each stained for either IF or IMC, were used. Based on IF staining with an antibody specific for proteolipid protein (PLP) (to visualize myelin) and DAPI (to visualize nuclei), ROIs were selected for ablation to capture the regions of interest for this study.</p><p><italic>High-spatial resolution laser ablation of tissue sections</italic>. Tissue sections were analyzed by IMC, which couples laser ablation techniques and CyTOF mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandura et al., 2009</xref>) (Cytof software v6.7). Briefly, a UV laser beam (λ = 219 nm) with a 1µmx1µm spot size is used to ablate the tissue. The laser rasters across the tissue at a rate of 200 Hz (200 pixels/s) with the requisitie energy to fully remove the tissue within the selected region of interest. The time needed to analyze each image of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>, using the methodology described in this manuscript, is approximately 1 hr and 45 min. The ablated tissue is then carried by a stream of inert helium and argon gas into the Helios (a CyTOF system) where the material is completely ionized in the inductively coupled plasma. The ionized material then passes through high pass ion optics to remove ions with a mass less than 75amu before the ions enter the time of flight detector where they are separated based on their mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenmiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendall et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Data analysis and image visualization.</italic> Images of each mass channel were reconstructed by plotting the laser shot signals in the same order they were recorded, line scan by line scan, generating pseudo-colored intensity maps of each mass channel. These data were examined using MCD Viewer (V.1.0.560, Fluidigm). For qualitative assessments, images remained at the automatic threshold generated by MCD Viewer, based on the on the 98th percentile of signal. For further analysis, data were exported from MCD Viewer as tiff files, and each channel was run through an individual analysis pipeline in CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2008</xref>) (V3.185) in order to despeckle the image. Composite images were created for each ROI using Image J (V1.52a), and any changes to the brightness or contrast of a given marker were consistent across ROIs.</p><p><italic>Calculation of the limit of detection.</italic> MCD Viewer was used to export text files acquired with the Hyperion IMC instrument (Fluidigm Inc, Markham ON), which were then converted to 32-bit single-channel TIFF images. The polygon tool within ImageJ 1.15 s was used to manually outline the ROI (white matter of control, normal-appearing white matter) or subROI (periplaque white matter, lesion edge, lesion core), manually identified on the bases of PLP, HLA and Iridium-intercalator signals. Gray matter was excluded from subsequent analysis. Each image was despeckled in Definiens Developer XD 2.7 (Definiens Inc, Munich, Germany), using a 2D gray-level morphological opening filter with kernel radius of 1. In addition, the intensities of each marker were normalized using a modified z score approach, in which the intensity of each pixel is divided by the sum of (mean intensity of the image plus 3 times the standard deviation of the pixels in the image) I<sub>zs</sub> = I/(μ<sub>Im</sub>+3*σ <sub>Im</sub>). This normalization approach has been previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellingson et al., 2012</xref>) and we found that it allows for a reliable comparison between IMC markers across different channels, with per-marker comparisons holding robustly across a 16-fold antibody dilution series (data not shown).</p><p><italic>Single-cell segmentation.</italic> In order to define cells, we used a customized segmentation algorithm that took into account both the presence of nuclear DNA Iridium-intercalator as well as a set of markers of interest (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In brief, a Gaussian blur was applied to the DNA signal and the resulting blurred image was segmented to identify nuclear content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Segmentation around the nuclei was expanded to simulate the cytoplasm, corresponding to individual cell areas, using a combination of threshold and watershed filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Next we interrogated the segmented image for the presence of specific markers or combinations of markers that are either biologically co-expressed, or whose expression is mutually exclusive, according to the combination of markers indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. If a nucleated cell was positive for a marker or a combination of markers (see example for CD3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>), the marker(s) signal was used to refine the initial nuclear segmentation. Nucleated cells that were not positive for any of the markers used, were segmented purely based on DNA signal and expanded to simulate the cytoplasmic area around the nucleus.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48051.024</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Antibody panels for the identification of functional cell types by IMC.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Functional cell type</th><th valign="top">Antibody panel</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Macrophages and microglia</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Macrophages</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>high</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>-</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated macrophages</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>high</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>PLP<sup>-</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Demyelinating macrophages</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>high</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>-</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>PLP<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Microglia</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>low/+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated microglia</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>low/+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>PLP<sup>-</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Demyelinating microglia</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>low/+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup>TMEM119<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>PLP<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>T Cells</bold></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>NFAT<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated and proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>NFAT<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">‘Chronically activated’ CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Proliferating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>NFAT<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Activated and proliferating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>NFAT<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">‘Chronically activated’ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>B Cells</bold></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Naïve B Cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>Igκ/Igλ<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">IgM memory B cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>Igκ/Igλ<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Switched memory B cells</td><td valign="top">CD45<sup>+</sup>Igκ/Igλ<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p><italic>Gating strategy for quantitative analysis of T cell, B cell, macrophage and microglial cell subsets.</italic> Segmented cell exports of raw and normalized marker intensities for all channels in each region of interest were exported as a single csv file. The per-cell mean intensities of each marker combination, (see marker list in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), were linearly rescaled for visualization purposes. 2D log-log biaxial scatterplots of these intensities were generated in Python (V3.6.8) using matplotlib (V3.0.3). A positive- and negative-gating strategy was applied to establish thresholds that identify particular cell types. Quadrants were set on pathologist-verified positive cells. In brief, ROI was examined in Definiens Developer XD 2.7. Cells were manually annotated by a pathologist, based on the expression of a biologically relevant set of markers to identify cells in each class of interest as defined below (see examples of manual selection to identify myeloid cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; to identify T cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>; to identify B cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). These identified positive cells were superimposed to the 2D log-log scatterplots to definitively establish gates that would capture the appropriate positivity range of each cell phenotype as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>For T cells</italic>: All nucleated cells expressing Igκ, Igλ, IgM, CD68 and HLA were eliminated, as these markers are not expressed on T cells. Gates were established for CD3 and CD45 based on a 2D log-log scatterplot of these markers. Following the identification of T-lineage cells, the same procedure was performed for CD3 vs CD4 and CD3 vs CD8, resulting in the identification of two subpopulations: CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thresholds for Ki67 (a marker of proliferation) and NFAT1 (a marker of activation) were established based on manually annotated CD3<sup>+</sup>KI67<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>NFAT1<sup>+</sup> cells, as described above. All cell populations were validated by manual annotation as described above.</p><p><italic>For B Cells:</italic> All nucleated cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD68 were eliminated as these markers are not expressed on B cells. B cells were further identified by CD45 above the same threshold set for T cells. Scatterplot comparison for Igκ and Igλ intensity identified Igκ+ and Igλ<sup>+</sup> single-positive populations. Igκ<sup>+</sup>Igλ<sup>+</sup> double positive cells were eliminated as artifactual, since the two allelic variants cannot co-exist on a given cell. Within Igκ+ or Igλ<sup>+</sup> B-lineage cells, we compared IgM to CD38 to determine the relative abundance of IgM<sup>+</sup> or CD38<sup>+</sup> cell subpopulations. All cell populations were validated by manual annotation as described above.</p><p><italic>For macrophages and microglia</italic>: All nucleated cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD8, Igκ/λ and IgM were eliminated as these markers are not expressed on macrophages and microglia. Discrimination of the remaining cells was visualized in a scatterplot for TMEM119 and CD45. The threshold for TMEM119 positive signal was determined by comparison to TMEM119<sup>+</sup> microglial cells that were identified by manual observation, relative to other cell types. The threshold for CD45 high or low signal was determined by the comparison to manually identified TMEM<sup>-</sup> macrophages. Manually identified microglial cells were used to establish the lower limit of the CD45 quadrants. Cells that were low for both TMEM119 and CD45 were labeled ‘other’ and ignored from subsequent analysis. These latter cells, likely correspond to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and other cell types. Both TMEM119<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>low/+</sup> microglial cells and TMEM<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>high</sup> macrophages were further evaluated for HLA, CD68 and PLP (depicted as scatterplots), to differentiate microglia or macrophages that are either resting or activated/phagocytic/demyelinating. All cell populations were validated by manual annotation as described above.</p><p><italic>Generation of cell density map.</italic> The gating strategy described above was confirmed by plotting the appropriately gated cell types for major lineage markers (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Note that Igκ&gt;Igλ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6a</xref> consistent with over-representation of κ<sup>+</sup> B cells in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koulieris et al., 2012</xref>).

A heat map, generated using Seaborn (V0.9.0), displayed the cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> of tissue.</p><p><italic>Generation of distance map.</italic> To assess the location of identified cells relative to blood vessels, collagen<sup>+</sup> perivascular regions of &gt;10 µm diameter and &gt;800 µm<sup>2</sup> area were segmented, and the distance between cells of interest and the border of these perivascular regions was calculated. Similarly to the cellular density calculations, average vessel distances corresponding to the mean of the per-cell vessel distance values were computed, expressed in µm, and presented as a distance heat map. Some regions did not contain any cells of a particular type, leading to undefined values for those particular regions and cell type combinations (presented as ‘n/a’, not applicable).</p><p><italic>Potential of Heat-diffusion Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) mapping.</italic> To study the dynamics of T cell phenotypes, Potential of Heat-diffusion Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) mapping was performed in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon, 2019</xref>). Relevant parameters were selected for analysis of T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD38, CD45, HLA, Ki67, NFAT1, distance to blood vessels). Raw, mean single-cell marker intensity values extracted from segmented IMC images as well as measured distances to blood vessels were subjected to log10 transformation followed by Z-score normalization. These normalized single-cell parameter values along with metadata indexing the class and lesion type of residence for each cell served as input for PHATE mapping, as detailed in the online user guide. The PHATE algorithm was executed with k = 100 and other parameters left as their default specifications. Plots were generated using the R ggplot2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hadley, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Where statistical testing was possible, all tests were performed using Prism software (v5.01; GraphPadSoftware, San Diego, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ramaglia et al. elegantly utilize imaging mass cytometry (IMC), an innovative multiplex protocol to perform comprehensive and functional analysis of cell heterogeneity and their distribution within MS lesions in a patient. They were able to study 15 immune markers simultaneously. This work highlights how the combination of multiplexed tissue imaging and advanced computational tools allows for a comprehensive characterization of immune/glial cells within/around MS lesions, their functional state and cell-cell interactions in relation to lesion localization. Given the array of immune cells infiltrating the CNS during disease likes MS, this technological advance will allow for a more granular understanding of cell phenotypes within distinct CNS compartments and how distinct inflammatory states shape their function and interactions. It is important to note that this is a single case study involving a rebound case of MS disease activity, and the authors must be careful in their conclusions of any findings from this work.</p><p>The reviewers agree that although the number of samples analyzed is small, these studies are extremely promising because they describe a novel method to perform molecular histopathology. Recent studies have described this technology for multiplexing stainings and for phenotyping cells in the tissue context in other disease conditions, such as cancer (e.g. Giesen et al., 2014, Chang et al., 2017, Carvajal-Hausdorf et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019, etc.) Overall, it is a solid piece of work from a technical point of view and describes the potential use of this technique. Thus the description and application of this potentially interesting technology is not new per se, but this technology may have implications for future studies aimed at characterizing and phenotyping inflammatory processes in MS brain sections with the best possible precision. We hope that you can address the following points in your revisions of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– While this is a proof of principle study, the case number used for this study is very low. Most if not all investigations were done on a single MS and one control case. Therefore, the discussion should be geared towards the unique neuropathology of this case and how the multiparametric findings provided by IMC contrast with those of conventional immunostainings. Apart of showing the feasibility on single cases of the technology, it remains unclear how generalizable and reproducible the described findings are. Of note, the 11 lesions studied come from a patient with severe rebound MS disease activity after natalizumab cessation. This pathology is characterized by heavy immune cell infiltration and activation that represents an extreme side of the inflammatory spectrum. Hence, the authors cannot claim that the majority of demyelinating macrophage-like cells in active lesions are derived from the resident microglial pool. Likewise, stating that B cells with a predominant switched memory phenotype are enriched in parenchyma across all lesion stages while unswitched B cells localized to the vasculature might only be true for anti-VLA-4 rebound disease, but not for MS. The authors also observed high numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells within (p)reactive lesions, a surprising finding that could be confounded by the exacerbated neuroinflammation seen in this patient and that contrasts with the elevated T cell infiltration reported in active lesions. Thus, the authors would need a comprehensive characterization of MS lesions from prototypical MS specimens to raise such points conclusively. However, given the similarities in neuroinflammation between natalizumab cessation (including JCV seropositivity) and PML, the findings of this study might be more relevant for conditions like PML. This is further supported by the predominant perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found in this patient.</p><p>– On the technical side, the manuscript needs to highlight the benefits of IMC compared to conventional immunostaining. The authors should consider including imaging data highlighting the benefits of IMC such as panels including more than 8 parameters at low and high power will help to appreciate the potential of this technique. Given that most analysis of phenotyping cells were finally made by 3-4 marker combinations it not sufficient elaborated what analyses are done here which are not possible with conventional fluoresecence co-immunostainings.</p><p>– The authors compared only a limited set of markers between IHC and IMC. How did the other markers perform between IHC vs. IMC? In particular, the sensitivity of IHC is strongly dependent on the amplification method used. Thus, stating that IMC might be more sensitive than IHC seems premature at this stage unless supported by a more systematic comparison.</p><p>– When performing the characterization of T cell populations, the authors described a large number of unclassified T cells. The total number of these cells should be included in Figure 7. In future studies, it would be of interest to include markers to determine which cell types are making up such large cohort. The study would benefit from making use of the novel computational tools available to analyze IMC data. Some examples include PHATE mapping and Pseudotime analysis which would allow to establish phenotypic fates within the immune cell populations studied.</p><p>– The data analysis workflow as described in this manuscript needs manual intervention at various steps which are not described in sufficient details. This may make it difficult to reproduce the procedure by others in the future.</p><p>– Despite the capacity to multiplex stainings for MS, it is not well elaborated what one can learn about the MS pathophysiology by this technology in the current study. The authors should elaborate here more, and this comment relates to the single case study above.</p><p>– In the Discussion the authors should consider the state of the literature regarding multiparametric in situ analysis (seminal papers include: Gerner et al., 2012, Moreau et al., 2012, Tsujikawa et al., 2017, Li et al., 2017 and Kwong et al., 2017) and explain how IMC compares to established techniques. As a whole, given the technical nature of the manuscript, the authors should base their conclusions on the experimental underpinnings of IMC and limit extrapolations to MS generally.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48051.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– While this is a proof of principle study, the case number used for this study is very low.

We have changed the text as well as the Abstract, refraining from generalizing our observation using a single case of aggressive rebound to the spectrum of what can be found in more “classical” MS. Rather, we will explicitly refer to this case a Natalizumab (NTZ)-rebound case. We have provided context as to why this case was chosen (serves as a good “positive” control for neuroinflammation) in the last paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Comparability of IF versus IMC approach and specificity of metal-conjugated antibodies on brain-resident cell types”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also observed high numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells within (p)reactive lesions, a surprising finding that could be confounded by the exacerbated neuroinflammation seen in this patient and that contrasts with the elevated T cell infiltration reported in active lesions.

As mentioned above, we will refer to this case as an NTZ-rebound case rather than an MS case. We have also stressed in the Discussion the need for further studies on well-characterized cohorts (see Discussion, ninth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– On the technical side, the manuscript needs to highlight the benefits of IMC compared to conventional immunostaining.

Indeed, the identification of cell phenotypes is based on all markers included in our panel using negative and positive selection. For example, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are identified as being IgM<sup>-</sup>Igκ<sup>-</sup>Igλ<sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>. Moreover, we limited our depiction of the image so that the reader can view the data in a digestible manner. For example, the images depicting myeloid cells (Figure 4), T cells (Figure 5) and B cells (Figure 6) include a few markers each for easy visualization, and the panels (ROI) shown are exactly the same in each figure. Therefore, for each ROI, we are indeed showing a total of 10-12 markers (across the 3 figures). We have now clarified these points in the text – please see the last paragraph of the subsection “Comparability of IF versus IMC approach and specificity of metal-conjugated antibodies on brain-resident cell types”.</p><p>However, we also agree with the reviewer that it is important to highlight the potential of this technique. Thus, we have included a new image that visualizes a combination of 8 markers: Intercalator, PLP, HLA, CD68, CD3, CD8, Igκ/Igλin a single ROI (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors compared only a limited set of markers between IHC and IMC.

We have extended the analysis comparing IF and IMC to 3 additional markers, PLP, HLA and CD68. Indeed, we found that the IMC method still reproduces staining patterns that are in agreement with those produced using a standard IF method in MS brain tissue, with similar sensitivity. These data are shown in a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We have modified the text to reflect this finding and have removed the comment regarding the relative sensitivity of IMC versus IF since it is impossible to generalize across antibody lots and between IF versus IMC serial sections. These data are now described in the subsection “Comparability of IF versus IMC approach and specificity of metal-conjugated antibodies on brain-resident cell types”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When performing the characterization of T cell populations, the authors described a large number of unclassified T cells.

With his contribution we have been able to include PHATE mapping of brain-resident T cells. The methodology for the PHATE analysis is reported in the subsection “Potential of Heat-diffusion Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) mapping”; the results are reported in the subsection “Analysis of Potential of Heat-diffusion Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) mapping” and visualized in Figure 8. Our findings in brief:</p><p>1) Using PHATE, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are nicely segregated. However, interestingly there is a population CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and unassigned T cells that form a distinct cluster in this particular anti-NTZ-rebound patient. Unassigned T cells are enriched within this distinct cluster. We call this cluster t1.</p><p>2) Slowly expanding lesions are the most likely lesion type to contain Cluster t1 cells in this particular NTZ-rebound patient.</p><p>3) Based on distance from Collagen<sup>+</sup> blood vessels, Cluster t1 are almost exclusively found close to blood vessels whereas the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that discriminate themselves from Cluster t1 cells are farther from the blood vessels in this particular NTZ-rebound patient.</p><p>4) Cluster t1 cells are more likely to have higher levels of CD45 and are less likely to have low levels of HLA (a marker of T cell exhaustion) but seem to not be distinguishable from other lesion-resident cells in terms of Ki67, NFAT or CD38 in this particular NTZ-rebound patient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The data analysis workflow as described in this manuscript needs manual intervention at various steps which are not described in sufficient details.
