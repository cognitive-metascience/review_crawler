general anesthesia with propofol are prominent states of reduced arousal linked to the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, ‘wake-like’ EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG for short) is a widespread technique that helps to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. In particular, it can be used to examine, recognize and compare different states of brain consciousness such as sleep, wakefulness or general anesthesia. Yet, during rapid eye movement sleep (the sleep phase in which dreaming occurs), the electrical activity of the brain is similar to the one recorded during wakefulness, making it difficult to distinguish these states based on EEG alone.</p><p>EEG records brain activity in the shape of rhythmic waves whose frequency, shape and amplitude vary depending on the state of consciousness. In the EEG signal from the human brain, the higher frequency waves are weaker than the low-frequency waves: a measure known as spectral slope reflects the degree of this difference in the signal strength. Previous research suggests that spectral slope can be used to distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia and non-REM sleep. Here, Lendner et al. explored whether certain elements of the spectral slope could also discern wakefulness from all states of reduced arousal.</p><p>EEG readings were taken from patients and volunteers who were awake, asleep or under anesthesia, using electrodes placed either on the scalp or into the brain. Lendner et al. found that the spectral slope could distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia, deep non-REM and REM sleep. The changes in the spectral slope during sleep could accurately track the degree of arousal with great temporal precision and across a wide range of time scales.</p><p>This method means that states of consciousness can be spotted just from a scalp EEG. In the future, this approach could be embedded into the techniques used for monitoring sleep or anesthesia during operations; it could also be harnessed to monitor other low-response states, such as comas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>intracranial electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>1/f dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE 3863/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lendner</surname><given-names>Janna Desiree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS21135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE 8329/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helfrich</surname><given-names>Randolph F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG03116408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG05401901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG05410601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-AG039170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mander</surname><given-names>Bryce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-oscillatory brain activity can be used to monitor arousal levels during both NREM and REM sleep as well as under general anesthesia with propofol.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>General anesthesia is a reversible, pharmaceutically induced state of unconsciousness, while sleep is internally generated and cycles between rapid (REM) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franks and Zecharia, 2011</xref>). Both sleep stages and anesthesia are characterized by a behaviorally similar state of reduced physical arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franks and Zecharia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). Definitions of arousal vary and include e.g. autonomic, behavioral or mental arousal. For this study, we followed an updated version of the framework by Laureys et al. that defined consciousness on two axes – <italic>content</italic> (awareness) and <italic>level</italic> (arousal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laureys, 2005</xref>). While the conscious <italic>content</italic> is low in NREM sleep and propofol anesthesia, it is high in wakefulness and dreaming states like REM. The <italic>arousal level</italic> is low during anesthesia and in all sleep states including REM.</p><p>Both NREM sleep stage 3 (also called slow-wave sleep) and general anesthesia with propofol exhibit similar electrophysiological features, such as an increase in low frequency activity and the occurrence of prominent slow oscillations (&lt;1.25 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franks and Zecharia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prerau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, propofol anesthesia has been linked to the emergence of a strong frontal alpha oscillation (8–12 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>) whereas spindles (12–16 Hz) typically appear in NREM sleep stage 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prerau et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, REM sleep is characterized by a desynchronized, active pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which resembles wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prerau et al., 2017</xref>). The additional defining features of REM sleep are therefore peripheral markers including muscle atonia as detected by electromyography (EMG) combined with rapid eye movements in the electrooculogram (EOG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prerau et al., 2017</xref>). To date, it has been challenging to differentiate REM sleep from wakefulness in humans solely from the electrophysiological brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several lines of inquiry highlighted the importance of non-oscillatory, scale-free neural activity for brain physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>). The electrophysiological power spectrum is characterized by a 1/f signal drop-off, i.e. higher frequency activity exhibits reduced power as compared to low frequency activity. This scaling law between power and frequency can be estimated from the exponential decay of the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>) and has previously been used to assess a variety of cognitive and EEG phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miskovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pereda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pritchard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Susmáková and Krakovská, 2008</xref>). Notably, this decay function mainly captures non-oscillatory brain activity, which is not characterized by a defining temporal scale, such as band-limited oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, analyses of scale-free 1/f dynamics might prove especially helpful when analyzing brain states that are not characterized by prominent oscillations such as REM sleep in humans. We hypothesized that markers of 1/f activity, such as the spectral slope of the power spectrum, may provide an electrophysiological signature that distinguishes ‘paradoxical’ REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siegel, 2011</xref>) from wakefulness.</p><p>Importantly, 1/f dynamics can also be observed in a variety of other signals. For instance, long-range temporal correlations of neuronal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001</xref>) or the size and duration of neuronal avalanches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Palva et al., 2013</xref>) also follow a power law but these scale-free behaviors likely have a different neurophysiological basis than the 1/f drop-off of the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings suggested that 1/f dynamics differentiate wakefulness from general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao, 2016</xref>). For instance, using intracranial recordings in macaque monkeys, it had been shown that the spectral slope between 30 and 50 Hz reliably tracked changes in arousal level under propofol anesthesia from induction to emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that that the spectral slope between 1 and 40 Hz in human scalp EEG recordings discriminated states with conscious content, namely wakefulness and ketamine anesthesia, from states where no conscious report was possible, i.e. Xenon and propofol anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies implied that propofol anesthesia was accompanied by a steeper decay of the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>With regard to sleep physiology, it had been observed that the spectral exponent of human scalp EEG becomes more negative during NREM sleep, when estimated e.g. in the 1 to 5 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2003</xref>), 3 to 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pereda et al., 1998</xref>) or 0.5 to 35 Hz frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miskovic et al., 2019</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in intracranial recordings with subdural grid electrodes in humans between 10 and 100 Hz (one subject; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freeman and Zhai, 2009</xref>) or 1 and 100 Hz (five subjects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>). Note that the 1/f background activity was estimated from frequency bands that were potentially influenced by simultaneously occurring low frequency oscillation i.e. delta (&lt;4 Hz) or slow waves (&lt;1.25 Hz) that might affect the degree of spectral tilt.</p><p>General anesthetics like propofol, etomidate and barbiturates act on GABAergic receptors to enhance inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, computational simulations indicated that the spectral slope might provide a surrogate marker for the excitation to inhibition (E/I) balance with more negative spectral slopes (esp. in the 30 to 50 Hz range) indexing enhanced inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). This model was validated using intracranial recordings in macaques and rodents: A shift in E/I-balance towards inhibition by administrating propofol resulted in a steeper slope of the power spectrum. Likewise, the spectral slope in the rodent hippocampus varied across the depth of hippocampus, directly reflecting the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cells in the underlying neuronal population. Moreover, a modulation of spectral slope was also observed as a function of the hippocampal theta cycle, likely reflecting rapid shifts in E/I-balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A recent study that employed two-photon calcium imaging in mice provided additional insight into putative changes in E/I-balance during the sleep cycle. Cortical activity in mice was reduced during NREM sleep compared to wakefulness and, notably, even further reduced during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethard et al., 2016</xref>). Crucially, the authors observed a selective increase in inhibitory interneuron activity (parvalbumin-positive interneurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethard et al., 2016</xref>) during REM but not NREM sleep revealing an overall shift towards inhibition during REM sleep.</p><p>In the present study, we assessed if 1/f spectral dynamics, in particular in the 30 to 50 Hz range, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), could track arousal states in humans both under anesthesia with propofol and during sleep in intracranial and scalp EEG recordings. Specifically, we hypothesized that the spectral slope should become more negative (i.e. the power spectrum steeper) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. Importantly, we also predicted that the spectral slope could discriminate wakefulness from NREM as well as REM sleep. Based on recent reports linking E/I-balance and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethard et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that the spectral slope, as a putative marker of E/I-balance, should facilitate the detection of REM sleep directly from the current brain state, without complementary information from additional EMG or EOG recordings. While previous studies that included lower frequency power in their slope estimates, found the slope of REM to be close to wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>), we specifically investigated if the aperiodic background activity in the 30 to 50 Hz range could reliably discriminate REM sleep from wakefulness and NREM sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We tested if non-oscillatory brain activity as quantified by the spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum could discriminate different states of arousal in four independent studies: We obtained both (1) scalp EEG (n = 9) and (2) intracranial EEG (n = 12) under general anesthesia with propofol. Furthermore, we recorded (3) scalp EEG (n = 20) as well as (4) scalp EEG combined with intracranial EEG (n = 10) during a full night of sleep. We utilized both extra- and intracranial recordings to assess the precise spatial extent of the observed effects. In line with previous reports, the spectral slope was defined by a linear fit to the power spectrum in log-log space between 30 and 45 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).

In Study 3, we obtained polysomnography recordings from 20 healthy subjects, which included scalp EEG, as well as electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG) and electrooculography (EOG).

Effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d.</p><p>To assess the spatial extent of the observed effects in EEG, we calculated cluster-based permutation tests to correct for multiple comparisons as implemented in FieldTrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) (Monte-Carlo method; maxsize criterion; 1000 iterations). A permutation distribution was obtained by randomly shuffling condition labels and then compared to the actual distribution to obtain an estimate of significance. Spatial clusters are formed by thresholding independent t-tests of slope differences between wake and anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) or wake and sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) at a p value &lt; 0.05. All results were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. In order to control for EMG as a potential confound in the sleep EEG (Study 3), we utilized a partial correlation (Spearman) that partialled the slope of the EMG out of the correlation before computing the cluster-based permutation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Correlation coefficients (r-values) were transformed into t-values using the following formula (N = number of subjects):<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For statistical assessment of the Mutual Information (MI), we employed surrogate testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). To obtain a surrogate distribution from the observed data, we utilized a random block swapping procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aru et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>). The number of repetitions was equal to the number of available sleep stages. On every iteration, we re-calculated the MI of these block swapped hypnograms with the discretized time-resolved slope to create a surrogate distribution against which we could compare our original observation. To compare the results across subjects, we z-scored the values by subtracting the mean of the surrogate distribution from the observed MI and dividing by the standard deviation of the surrogate distribution. Note that a z = 1.96 reflects an uncorrected two-tailed p-value of 0.05, while a z-score of &gt;2.8 indicates a Bonferroni-corrected significant p-value (p&lt;0.05/19 channels=0.0026). The z-values were transformed into p-values for topographic depiction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) based on a normal cumulative distribution function (two-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Connectivity</title><p>For the analysis of fronto-parietal connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>), we choose electrode Fz and Pz in our sleep EEG recordings (Study 3; n = 20) to calculate the magnitude squared coherence from frequencies of 0.1 to 64 Hz in 0.1 Hz steps using the <italic>mscohere.m</italic> function from the MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox (Release R2015a, MathWorks, Inc, USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pal et al., 2015</xref>). Note that coherence estimates reflect both power changes as well as changes in phase synchrony. Therefore, we also calculated the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) and amplitude correlations (rho) to disentangle the effects of phase and power, respectively. To discount the effects of volume spread, we calculated the imaginary PLV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>) (iPLV) and orthogonalized power correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>) (rhoortho).</p><p>We then quantified the Mutual Information (MI; see above) to compare how well the results capture the changes between different sleep stages across the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quian Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009</xref>).

shows that a particular marker of neural activity – the slope of the EEG power spectrum – can be used to distinguish between different states of arousal. Importantly, this measure can be reliably estimated from scalp EEG recordings, and accurately separates REM sleep from wakefulness, which to date had been challenging using EEG. Furthermore, the authors show that anesthesia reflects a brain-wide state, while sleep patterns are observed in specific networks.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An Electrophysiological Marker of Arousal Level in Humans&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Giovanni Piantoni (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In recognition of the fact that revisions may take longer than the two months we typically allow, until the research enterprise restarts in full, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lendner and colleagues assess 1/f EEG activity as a proxy of arousal by comparing both invasive and non-invasive recordings of awake, anesthetized and sleeping humans. The authors calculated the slope in the log-log power spectral density during periods of wakefulness, N3 and REM sleep and propofol anesthesia. They consistently found across four studies (both intracranial and scalp EEG) that the slope is shallower for wakefulness as compared to the other states of reduced arousal. A series of control analyses (LDA, changes in center frequency and width of the frequency range, link to slow waves) confirmed the main finding. The findings are exciting and well tested over multiple studies and recording setups. Particularly intriguing is the similarity between propofol and sleep.</p><p>Although the study in general represents an important contribution to the field of human electrophysiological research, we are not entirely convinced by the used methods, inferential statistics, and by the way the findings are integrated into the existing literature. The analysis of multiple data sets in order to draw inferences on various levels is compelling and impressive but warrants a more consistent methodological approach and the acknowledgement of earlier findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, the manuscript is lacking connection with existing literature, leading to unwarranted novelty claims and rather unspecific hypotheses. Authors should integrate the existing literature more thoroughly.</p><p>This is especially of importance for the Introduction and Discussion sections. For example, the authors cite Colombo et al., 2019, in the Introduction but do not acknowledge that this study performed a comparison of EEG spectral exponents between the awake state and anesthesia under different drugs, including Propofol, and found a steepening of the spectrum under Propofol anesthesia compared to awake rest. Similarly, the authors cite Miskovic et al., 2019 without noting that the cited study compared PSD exponents between different sleep stages and found results comparable to those of the current manuscript.</p><p>It is essential to put the results of the current study into context and note that they replicate earlier findings and are not the first of their kind in data from human subjects. The appeal of novelty claims in the Introduction which states that only non-human animal results exist for the central question of the manuscript, should be omitted. Instead, we suggest to formulate more precise hypotheses regarding the direction of effects (steepening vs. flattening of spectra) and to touch upon E/I balance and neurotransmitters already in the Introduction.</p><p>2) We had several concerns regarding the inferential statistics used. Permutation-based or non-parametric tests are more appropriate for the majority of performed tests and should be implemented.</p><p>More specifically: Inferential statistics should be adapted to meet the distributional properties of the data they are performed on. The comparison of very small samples (e.g. n = 9) using t-tests should be replaced by non-parametric or permutation-based approaches. Similarly, comparing goodness of fit statistics using t-tests should be omitted (subsection “The relationship of slow waves and the spectral slope”) and replaced by proper model comparisons.</p><p>Additionally, performance correct percentages of the used LDA should undergo an appropriate transformation before being tested against each other (e.g. logit).</p><p>On a more general note, we suggest to replace the LDA approach with a multivariate model predicting arousal states based on the predictors the authors aim to compare. This way their predictive power can be compared directly (if scaled in the same way, e.g. z-scored) and their shared variance in the dependent variable can be accounted for. Furthermore, the discussion of prediction accuracies should include a reference to the &quot;ground truth&quot; that is predicted here, the ratings of a trained specialist which are 80% reliable.</p><p>3) One of the major claims of the paper is that the effect of interest is consistent across techniques (EEG, iEEG) and brain states (propofol, sleep). To support this claim, the authors would need to be consistent in their analysis pipelines of the different datasets. More specifically:</p><p>– Why were different length segments (and taper numbers) used for sleep vs anesthesia? Would be better for direct comparison to keep these parameters the same.</p><p>– The iEEG studies and the scalp EEG studies use a very different reference. Bipolar for iEEG and common average for the scalp EEG studies (the reference is not clearly specified for study 3 though, please clarify). One would expect that the choice of reference would have a large impact on the slope, but this does not seem the case. For example, local dynamics captured by bipolar referencing are in general very different from global effects such as those observed in scalp EEG. In fact, the Laplacian reference does not change the results. Could the authors discuss in more detail the role of referencing in their interpretation of the neurophysiological basis of 1/f dynamics?</p><p>4) Furthermore, we had some concerns regarding anatomical claims.</p><p>The fact that sleep stage-slope correlation seems to be dominated by medial PFC/temporal sites is interesting, though might be biased by the iEEG montage, as those are also the regions with the most electrodes due to epilepsy monitoring. There should be a statistical analysis that shows that those regions have a significantly higher proportion of &quot;differentiating&quot; electrodes than other brain regions. In addition to a sound statistical analysis, the authors should provide a table with the number of total electrodes and the number of electrodes showing a significant change in slope, per brain region. As it is, it's hard to define the regions of interest based on the brain plots shown.</p><p>Additionally, it would have been much more powerful if the anatomical claims could be corroborated by the EEG recordings. Not sure source localization is possible on the EEG data given low electrode numbers, but that would really have strengthened the story. In current form it remains a little unclear what the main sources of all these effects are.</p><p>5) The fitting of 1/f spectral exponents should be improved and frequency ranges should be motivated more clearly.</p><p>Although it is correct that Gao et al., 2017, used a frequency range of 30-50 Hz for their 1/f PSD fit, this choice was motivated by the linear decrease of power in LFP recordings within that frequency range. However, oscillatory parts of the spectrum, whether of neural or non-neural origin (line noise), can aptly be fitted and excluded from a 1/f fit using the FOOOF package (https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/). The use of this or another software package (e.g. BOSC or eBOSC: https://github.com/jkosciessa/eBOSC) would allow the authors to directly asses the change of PSD exponents across different levels of arousal across wider frequency ranges without having to alter time-series first using IRASA. In fact, Colombo and colleagues show a steepening of the PSD between 1 and 40 Hz from awake rest compared to Propofol anesthesia, a result the authors could try to replicate and discuss using the proposed analyses techniques. Furthermore, goodness of fit statistics for the performed linear fits are missing and should be added for any kind of fitting procedure the authors decide to apply.</p><p>6) Discussion could be more in depth in terms of:</p><p>– connection with existing literature;</p><p>– underlying mechanisms/generation of the recorded signals;</p><p>– interpretation of the findings and implications for our understanding of sleep vs wake processes;</p><p>– actual discussion of practical use, i.e., how reliable is slope as a measure to distinguish these states on the single subject level.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An Electrophysiological Marker of Arousal Level in Humans&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and Saskia Haegens (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>We appreciate the very thorough revisions, especially methods wise, and believe they have strengthened the paper considerably. After discussion with one of the original reviewers, we have one remaining point we would still like to see clarified, but other than that all our previous concerns have been adequately dealt with.</p><p>The issue we are still unclear on pertains to this claim:</p><p>&quot;Critically, the accuracy of this classification is comparable to trained personnel, since the inter-rater reliability between sleep state scoring experts is typically about 80%&quot;.</p><p>However, if the ground truth here consists of the sleep staging done by trained experts, for whom we know the inter-rater reliability is typically about 80%, then a 100% accuracy of the classifier would be a 100% match with these expert raters (i.e., not necessarily a 100% accurate classification of sleep stage). In other words, the performance of the classifier is bound by the accuracy of the ground truth. Since we do not know the &quot;true&quot; sleep stage, we can only conclude that the classifier accurately predicts the experts' ratings 80% of the time here. Please add some language to make this explicit in the discussion of these results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55092.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, the manuscript is lacking connection with existing literature, leading to unwarranted novelty claims and rather unspecific hypotheses. Authors should integrate the existing literature more thoroughly.</p><p>This is especially of importance for the Introduction and Discussion sections. For example, the authors cite Colombo et al., 2019, in the Introduction but do not acknowledge that this study performed a comparison of EEG spectral exponents between the awake state and anesthesia under different drugs, including Propofol, and found a steepening of the spectrum under Propofol anesthesia compared to awake rest. Similarly, the authors cite Miskovic et al., 2019, without noting that the cited study compared PSD exponents between different sleep stages and found results comparable to those of the current manuscript.</p><p>It is essential to put the results of the current study into context and note that they replicate earlier findings and are not the first of their kind in data from human subjects. The appeal of novelty claims in the Introduction which states that only non-human animal results exist for the central question of the manuscript, should be omitted. Instead, we suggest to formulate more precise hypotheses regarding the direction of effects (steepening vs. flattening of spectra) and to touch upon E/I balance and neurotransmitters already in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize about the lack of connection to existing literature. We thank the reviewers for their comments and carefully revisited both the Introduction and Discussion. The revised manuscript features a completely rewritten Introduction and Discussion section with a clearer structure. Critically, we now introduce the concept of E/I-balance early in the Introduction and clearly state our predictions with regard to the hypothesized link between E/I-balance and 1/f features.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“General anesthesia is a reversible, pharmaceutically induced state of unconsciousness, while sleep is internally generated and cycles between rapid (REM) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM; (Brown et al., 2010; Franks and Zecharia, 2011a). […]While previous studies that included lower frequency power in their slope estimates, found the slope of REM to be close to wakefulness (He et al., 2010), we specifically investigated if the aperiodic background activity in the 30 – 50 Hz range could reliably discriminate REM sleep from wakefulness and NREM sleep.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We had several concerns regarding the inferential statistics used. Permutation-based or non-parametric tests are more appropriate for the majority of performed tests and should be implemented.</p><p>More specifically: Inferential statistics should be adapted to meet the distributional properties of the data they are performed on. The comparison of very small samples (e.g. n = 9) using t-tests should be replaced by non-parametric or permutation-based approaches.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and now employ non-parametric permutation statistics throughout the manuscript. In the previous version of the manuscript, we utilized cluster-based permutation tests when assessing the spatial extent of the data (see e.g. Figure 1B, 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we replaced t-tests by permutation t-test in which the original observation was compared against a surrogate distribution after re-calculating the test statistic (e.g. T- or F-values) 10,000 times with randomly shuffled condition labels. The empirically observed t-value was then compared relative to the surrogate distribution of permuted t-values (e.g. Figure 1B, C; Figure 3A-C). For the repeated measures ANOVA, we adopted a similar approach where the original RM-ANOVA output was compared to a shuffled distribution after randomly flipping condition labels 10,000 times (e.g. Figure 2B, C; Figure 3D-F). Post-hoc t-tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Similarly, comparing goodness of fit statistics using t-tests should be omitted (subsection “The relationship of slow waves and the spectral slope”) and replaced by proper model comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and removed the goodness of fit statistic comparison using t-test from the manuscript. Instead we now evaluate the shared variance using a multivariate general linear model:</p><p>“First, we found that the interaction of spectral slope and slow wave activity did not explain more unique variance than the sum of the univariate metrics in a GLM, hence, indicating that the slope and slow wave activity provide complimentary information about arousal states (Figure 3). In addition, if lower frequencies (e.g. 1 – 20 Hz) were utilized for spectral slope estimation, MI between the hypnogram and the time-resolved spectral slope decreased (Figure 2—figure supplement 5D) suggesting that lower frequencies and the 30 – 45 Hz range may index distinct processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, performance correct percentages of the used LDA should undergo an appropriate transformation before being tested against each other (e.g. logit).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and performed logit-transformation of the LDA correct percentages before comparison. We edited Figure 3 and revised the results in the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Results:</p><p><bold>“</bold>The spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from states of reduced arousal.</p><p>Our findings provide evidence that the spectral slope reliably discriminates wakefulness from sleep. Multiple prior reports indicated that slow waves are a hallmark of decreased arousal states (Brown et al., 2010; Franks and Zecharia, 2011a; Murphy et al., 2011). […] Note, that slow wave power was already elevated during wakefulness, which may reflect a premedication with a sedative (see Figure 1A and Materials and methods).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a more general note, we suggest to replace the LDA approach with a multivariate model predicting arousal states based on the predictors the authors aim to compare. This way their predictive power can be compared directly (if scaled in the same way, e.g. z-scored) and their shared variance in the dependent variable can be accounted for.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this recommendation. Accordingly, we calculated a multivariate model to predict the arousal states based on the slope and slow oscillation (SO; &lt; 1.25 Hz) power. This approach enabled us to directly compare the unique variance that was explained by either the spectral slope or SO power. Moreover, this method facilitated a direct assessment of the multivariate interaction of both parameters.</p><p>In order to model the unique contributions of the parameters as well as their interaction, we first scaled both by means of a z-score and then calculated their main effects as well as their interaction using a multivariate general linear model. Critically, we utilized an unbalanced design, which implicitly orthogonalizes the contribution of different factors and hence, distills non-overlapping unique explained variance, which was subsequently quantified by means of the eta squared metric.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Uni- and multivariate discrimination of wakefulness and REM sleep using the spectral slope and slow oscillation power.</title><p>Single subject example at scalp EEG electrode Fz. a, While both 1/f slope (z-scored; left panel) and slow oscillation power (SO, &lt; 1.25 Hz; z-scored; right panel) are able to differentiate wakefulness (red) from REM sleep (green; black: mean ± SEM) in a univariate comparison, the 1/f slope provides most of the discriminative power in a multivariate space as seen in panel b (SO power vs. 1/f slope; both z-scored).

Note that the main discriminating factor, which successfully discriminates both conditions, is the spectral slope, as indicated by a clear separation of the two states along the first dimension (on the x-axis).</p><p>When discerning wakefulness from REM sleep, information (as quantified by unique explained variance eta squared) about the underlying arousal state was significantly different between spectral slope, SO power and their interaction (Figure 3D). Post hoc permutation t-tests revealed that this effect was mostly driven by the spectral slope (slope: 0.29 ± 0.05 (mean ± SEM), SO: 0.05 ± 0.01; interaction: 0.06 ± 0.03; post-hoc permutation t-tests (Bonferroni corrected): Slope-SO: p &lt; 0.001, obs. t<sub>17</sub> = 4.29, d = 1.50, Slope-Int.: p &lt; 0.001, obs. t<sub>17</sub> = 4.84, d = 1.62; SO-Int.: p = 0.63, obs. t<sub>17</sub> = 0.82, d = 0.29).</p><p>For NREM stage 3 sleep and wakefulness, there was no difference in explained variance between factors (Figure 3E; post-hoc permutation t-tests (Bonferroni corrected): Slope-SO: p = 0.406, obs. t<sub>17</sub> = -1.11, d = -0.39; Slope-Int.: p = 0.422 obs. t<sub>17</sub> = 1.09, d = 0.31; SO-Int.: p = 0.032, obs. t<sub>17</sub> = 2.44, d = 0.88).</p><p>Between anesthesia and wakefulness, information about the state was again significantly different between factors (Figure 3F). As in the wake-REM differentiation, this could mostly be attributed to the spectral slope (post-hoc permutation t-tests (Bonferroni corrected): Slope-SO: p &lt; 0.001, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = 3.70, d = 1.75), Slope-Int.: p &lt; 0.001, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = 3.95, d = 1.87, SO-Int.: p = 0.019, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = 2.67, d = 1.07).</p><p>The results from the GLM mirrored the findings from the LDA approach: When discerning wakefulness from REM sleep and anesthesia, the spectral slope was more informative about the underlying arousal state than SO power or the interaction of both factors. For NREM sleep stage 3, both slope and SO power contained a comparable amount of information. The interaction of both factors did not explain more unique variance than the sum of the univariate metrics, hence, indicating that the slope and SO power provide complimentary information about arousal states.</p><p>We carefully considered the reviewers’ proposal to replace the LDA approach but felt that the results as obtained from the LDA offer an additional advantage, namely a very intuitive comparison as quantified as percent correct to interrater reliability in sleep scoring (80.6% for R&amp;K and 82% for AASM; (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2009). Therefore, we elected to present both approaches side-by-side in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“General Linear Model: When discerning wakefulness from REM sleep, information (as quantified by unique explained variance eta squared) about the underlying arousal state was significantly different between the spectral slope, SO power and their interaction (repeated-measures ANOVA permutation test: p &lt; 0.001, F<sub>1.16, 19.74</sub> = 19.69). […] The spectral slope enabled an improved classification and contained more unique information about arousal state compared to slow wave power when differentiating wakefulness from both propofol anesthesia and REM sleep and was comparable when discerning wakefulness from N3 sleep.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the discussion of prediction accuracies should include a reference to the &quot;ground truth&quot; that is predicted here, the ratings of a trained specialist which are 80% reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the recommendation. This information can be found in the following paragraph:</p><p>This finding indicates that the spectral slope constitutes a marker that successfully discriminates REM sleep from wakefulness solely from the electrophysiological brain state. Critically, the accuracy of this classification is comparable to trained personnel, since the inter-rater reliability between sleep state scoring experts is typically about 80% (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the major claims of the paper is that the effect of interest is consistent across techniques (EEG, iEEG) and brain states (propofol, sleep). To support this claim, the authors would need to be consistent in their analysis pipelines of the different datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ input and therefore, carefully assessed the influence of different variables on spectral slope estimation. In particular, we identified the following parameters, which were queried:</p><p>Power - Method for power calculation:</p><p>To evaluate the impact of different spectral decompoisition methods for subsequent spectral slope estimation, we recalculated the power spectra using the original multi-taper approach, a single Hanning taper, a periodogram and Welch’s method (Figure 2—figure supplement 6). We calculated a signal-to-noise ratio (mean divided by standard deviation) and found that the multitaper approach provides significantly cleaner spectral estimates as compared to the other methods in all tested frequency bands (n = 20; cluster permutation test: p &lt; 0.001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More specifically:</p><p>– Why were different length segments (and taper numbers) used for sleep vs anesthesia? Would be better for direct comparison to keep these parameters the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our motivation and our rationale for the chosen parameters and then present supporting data.</p><p>Motivation and rationale</p><p>While we agree with the reviewers that the same settings for all recordings would facilitate an easier direct comparison, we want to point out that sleep and anesthesia are different neurophysiological states. While they share some characteristics including a reduced arousal level, they also exhibit different temporal dynamics and spectral features. Specifically, the duration of these states typically differs – while a full night of sleep often lasts for 6 – 10 hours, surgical anesthesia is often only maintained for 1 – 3 hours or less. Here, we find similar recordings lengths of 7.99 ± 0.01 hours (mean ± SEM) for sleep and 3.81 ± 0.22 hours for anesthesia.</p><p>a) Segment Length:</p><p>Sleep scoring is typically carried out in 30 second segments under the assumption that neuronal activity stays relatively stationary within this time frame (Prerau et al., 2017). We therefore adapted a 30 second segment length for our slope estimation during sleep as the 30 second staging was the only “ground truth” available.</p><p>For anesthesia, no such convention exists. While many studies used 1 to 2 second segments (e.g. (Colombo et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2017), we decided to utilize a longer segment length of 10 seconds as this approach offered the opportunity to use a Multitaper approach for power estimation in the examined frequency range. A segment length of 30 seconds, on the other hand, resulted in pronounced temporal smoothing of slope dynamics under anesthesia compared to 10 second segments (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A).</p><p>b) Taper Numbers:</p><p>The number of the dpss tapers used in the Multitaper method is a direct result of the segment length and our chosen frequency smoothing of 1 Hz (Prerau et al., 2017):</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> The time-half-bandwidth product (THBP) is a result of the segment length (SL) and the frequency resolution (fR).

Under anesthesia, however, the 30 second segment resulted in pronounced temporal smoothing of slope dynamics compared to 10 second segments (Figure 1—figure supplement 3a). We therefore kept the original segment lengths in the main manuscript but added our results as supplemental figures to facilitate a direct comparison between segment lengths and number of tapers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The iEEG studies and the scalp EEG studies use a very different reference.

In addition to a sound statistical analysis, the authors should provide a table with the number of total electrodes and the number of electrodes showing a significant change in slope, per brain region. As it is, it's hard to define the regions of interest based on the brain plots shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions. We want to point out that we did not select electrodes in regions of interest but used all available electrodes that were non-epileptic and located in gray matter. See Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>155 out of 352 SEEG (44.03 %) followed the observed scalp EEG pattern of a more negative slope in sleep compared to wakefulness (Figure 2C), significantly more than chance (33 % chance level; chi-squared test: Χ2 = 8.20, p = 0.0042).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there might be a selection bias in anatomical location of contacts in medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions as temporal epilepsy is the most common form of epilepsy. To access MTL regions, electrodes are inserted through lateral temporal cortex (LTC). To access orbitofrontal, cingulate and insular regions, electrodes are inserted through the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both implantation schemes lead to a paucity of recording sites in parietal and posterior regions. As the implantation of all the electrodes is purely due to clinical consideration, it will remain one limitation of this method.</p><p>We carefully revisited the anatomical localization of the depth electrodes and collected the information about subregions and state- dependent slope modulation in a table, as requested by the reviewers (Table 2). In Study 3 – Intracranial sleep, the majority of sEEG electrodes were located in PFC (132/352, 37.5 %), followed by LTC (79/352; 22.4%) and MTL (48/352; 13.6%).</p><p>As the visual impression suggested, medial PFC exhibits a significantly higher fraction of electrodes with sleep state- dependent slope modulation than lateral PFC (chi-squared test: Χ2 = 33.56, p &lt; 0.000). The same was true for MTL compared to LTC (Χ2 = 33.12, p &lt; 0.0001). When comparing mPFC and MTL, which both showed high levels of state- dependent slope modulation, or lPFC and LTC, that showed only little modulation, there was no significant regional difference (mPFC – MTL: Χ2 = 1.89, p = 0.169; lPFC – LTC: Χ2 = 0.19, p = 0.659). These comparisons underscore that the differences in chi squared test are not driven by electrode number.</p><p>For completeness, we also included a table (Table 1) with the subregions of electrodes in Study 2 – Intracranial anesthesia although almost all electrodes exhibited a state- dependent slope modulation:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We included the tables in the manuscript and edited the following paragraph:</p></disp-quote><p>“We observed the same pattern – a more negative spectral slope in N3 and REM sleep as compared to wakefulness – in 155 of 352 SEEG (44.03 %; <italic>chi-squared test against chance-level (33%)</italic>: <italic>Χ2</italic> = 8.20, p = 0.0042; Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 3).

Not sure source localization is possible on the EEG data given low electrode numbers, but that would really have strengthened the story. In current form it remains a little unclear what the main sources of all these effects are.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and we source-localized the slope difference between wakefulness and sleep in scalp EEG (Study 3, n = 19; one patient had to be excluded due to insufficient wake trials).</p><p>Cortical sources of the sensor-level EEG data were reconstructed by using a LCMV (linearly constraint minimum variance) beamforming approach (Van Veen et al., 1997) to estimate the time series for every voxel on the grid. A standard T1 MRI template and a BEM (boundary element method) headmodel from the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011) were used to construct a 3D template grid at 1cm spacing in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Electrode location was derived from a standard 10/20 template from the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011). Prior to source projection, sensor level data was common average referenced and epoched into 30 second segments. To minimize computational load, we selected a two second data segment from the center of every epoch to construct the covariance matrix. The LCMV spatial filter was then calculated using the covariance matrix of the sensor-level EEG data with 5% regularization. Spatial filters were constructed for each of the grid positions separately to maximally suppress activity from all other sources. The resulting time courses in source space then underwent spectral analysis using a Fourier transform after applying a Hanning window. The PSD slope of every segment was then estimated using linear regression in the range from 30-45 Hz as outlined before. To obtain a similar contrast to the intracranial analysis depicted in Figure 2C, mean slope values during sleep were subtracted from the mean slope during wakefulness at every voxel in source space and then source-interpolated onto a standard template brain in MNI space (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Note that δ slope is reported as positive values whereas slope difference is depicted as a negative value. Both intracranial as well as the source-interpolated scalp EEG results revealed a focus in medial prefrontal areas (mPFC, Figure 2C – magenta, 2—figure supplement 3 – yellow).</p><p>Since it is challenging to localize sources to the MTL (in particular in the case of a 19 channel EEG), we employed an ROI-based approach focusing on PFC subregions. In line with our results from the intracranial sleep study (Study 4, Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 3), we defined the mPFC and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) as regions-of-interest (ROI; Figure 2—figure supplement 3). To identify ROI at source level, we used the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas as implemented in FieldTrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011). The ROI mPFC contained the following tissue labels: 23 &amp; 24 – ‘Frontal_Sup_Medial_L &amp; R’, 25 &amp; 26 – ‘Frontal_Med_Orb_L &amp; R’, 27 &amp; 28 – ‘Rectus_L &amp; R’, 31 &amp; 32 – Cingulum_Ant_L &amp; R’. The ROI dlPFC consisted of the following atlas tissue labels: 3 &amp; 4 – ‘Frontal_Sup_L &amp; R’, 7 &amp; 8 – ‘Frontal_Mid_L &amp; R’, 11 &amp; 12 – ‘Frontal_Inf_Oper_L &amp; R’, 13 &amp; 14 – ‘Frontal_Inf_Tri_L &amp; R’ and 15 &amp; 16 ‘Frontal_Inf_Orb_L &amp; R’.</p><p>In the mPFC ROI the slope decreased from wakefulness to sleep by 0.54 ± 0.23 (mean ± SEM) whereas in dlPFC it decreased by 0.36 ± 0.22. This slope difference between wakefulness and sleep was significantly different from zero for mPFC (paired t-test: p = 0.018) but not for dlPFC (p = 0.074). This difference in slope modulation between mPFC and dlPFC was significant (p = 0.036) in line with our observations in intracranial EEG.</p><p>Taken together, the observed anatomical pattern from the beamformer analysis of the sleep scalp EEG fits the previous results from the intracranial sleep study.</p><p>However, a beamformer analysis of only 19 channel EEG has only limited explanatory power and should be interpreted cautiously. We therefore refrained from adding the analysis to the main manuscript, especially since the manuscript already features intracranial recordings in humans. However, we introduced a new supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) depicting the results which is referred to in the following sentence of the result section:</p><p>“We established that the spectral slope closely tracks the hypnogram. […] Given the spatial heterogeneity of intracranial responses (Parvizi and Kastner, 2018), there was a remarkable convergence on medial PFC that resembled the pattern observed at source level (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and the overlying scalp EEG electrode Fz (Figure 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fitting of 1/f spectral exponents should be improved and frequency ranges should be motivated more clearly.</p><p>Although it is correct that Gao et al., 2017, used a frequency range of 30-50 Hz for their 1/f PSD fit, this choice was motivated by the linear decrease of power in LFP recordings within that frequency range.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify our motivation to choose the 30 – 45 Hz range for spectral slope estimation. Please note that we now also incorporated a detailed empirical validation in the manuscript.</p><p>There is a wide variation of slope estimations from different frequency ranges (Colombo et al., 2019; He et al., 2010; K. J. Miller et al., 2009b; Miskovic et al., 2019; Pereda et al., 1998; Shen et al., 2003). Very low frequencies below 1 Hz were out of reach due to limitations with the DC amplifier in our recordings (He et al., 2010). We also excluded frequencies above 45 Hz as we were careful not to include any filtering artifacts from the 50 Hz line noise in the European recordings. We then adapted this setting for all datasets across recording modalities for reasons of consistency.</p><p>The choice to calculate the slope estimate with this particular frequency band stemmed from the following considerations:</p><p>(Gao et al., 2017) used a 30 – 50 Hz frequency range in their paper with propofol anesthesia in monkeys; it therefore seemed reasonable to expect that this frequency range would also be suitable in human anesthesia data.</p><p>Prominent neuronal oscillations mostly occur below 30 Hz and could possibly confound the estimation of the 1/f slope estimate. Especially states like propofol anesthesia and NREM sleep stage 3 are characterized by strong oscillations (e.g. α at 8 – 12 Hz and δ at 1 – 4 Hz under propofol (Purdon et al., 2013) and slow waves (&lt; 1.25 Hz) and spindles at12 – 16 Hz in sleep (Prerau et al., 2017). To circumvent this problem, we a) used a fit above the frequency range where most oscillations occur and b) validated the choice by a removal of the oscillatory component using irregular resampling (IRASA; (Wen and Liu, 2016).</p><p>Note the IRASA method is computationally expensive and time consuming. This would prevent any further use of the marker in a clinical on-line setting like monitoring depth of anesthesia. Hence, we decided to use the approach to fit above the oscillatory frequency domain to offer an easy and computationally effective tool that is not confounded by oscillations.</p><p>Additional appeal to use the 30-45 Hz frequency range came from the possible mechanistical explanation: (Gao et al., 2017) showed in the modelling part of their paper that the slope in this frequency range tracks changes in the ratio of inhibition to excitation. As both propofol anesthesia and NREM sleep stage 3 are associated with an increase in inhibition (Brown et al., 2011; Niethard et al., 2016), the slope in that range should reliably track changes from wakefulness to these states of reduced arousal.</p><p>We then validated the chosen frequency range in both the sleep study with scalp EEG (Study 3) and the sleep study with intracranial recordings (Study 4). While both sleep studies provided us with a hypnogram that could pose as a “ground truth” for the evaluation of different slope fits, the intracranial sleep data had the additional benefit of allowing slope fits above 45 Hz.</p><p>Center frequency for fit:</p><p>We evaluated the relationship between hypnogram and time-resolved slope as a function of different center frequencies (± 10 Hz around center frequency starting from 20 up to 150 Hz: 10-30 (20), 20-40 (30), 30-50 (40) and so on) and found that spectral slope estimates only correlated significantly/ had a significant Mutual Information (MI) with the hypnogram if center frequencies up to 40 Hz were selected for the fit Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</p><p>Length of fit:</p><p>We evaluated the relationship between hypnogram and time-resolved slope as a function of fit lengths (from 30 Hz onwards with a 10 Hz increase of fit length up to 100 Hz: 30-40, 30-50, 30-60 and so on). The results showed that spectral slope estimates could be fitted with variable fit length from 30 Hz onwards and still resulted in a significant correlation/ MI with the hypnogram, see Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</p><p>Fit to low frequencies:</p><p>We evaluated fits to lower frequencies starting from 1 to 5 Hz with an increasing length of additional 5 Hz per fit after discounting the oscillatory components from the power spectrum by means of irregular resampling (IRASA; Figure 2—figure supplement 5c). The rationale for using a method like IRASA before attempting a slope fit was the occurrence of strong low frequency oscillations like slow waves which could possibly distort the slope estimate. When comparing the MI between the spectral slope fits and the hypnogram to the MIs of a surrogate distribution derived from a random block swapping procedure and the hypnogram, the 30 to 45 frequency range resulted in significantly higher MI than the fits to lower frequencies, see Figure 2—figure supplement 5D.</p><p>The results of these calculations were part of the original version of the manuscript (old Figure S6; new Figure 2—figure supplement 5). However, we realize that the organization of the subpanels was non-optimal and led to some confusion about the connection between subpanels. We rearranged the results in the new version of the figure and hope that it is now easier to follow.</p><p>Taken together, our analyses regarding the frequency range settings for spectral slope estimation suggested that a center frequency up to 40 Hz with at least a 10 Hz range should be used if calculating the spectral slope for sleep EEG for 30 second segments. A spectral slope estimated from the 30-45 Hz range provided the highest MI with the hypnogram indicating that this frequency range is well suited to distinguish wakefulness from N3 and REM sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, oscillatory parts of the spectrum, whether of neural or non-neural origin (line noise), can aptly be fitted and excluded from a 1/f fit using the FOOOF package (https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/). The use of this or another software package (e.g. BOSC or eBOSC: https://github.com/jkosciessa/eBOSC) would allow the authors to directly asses the change of PSD exponents across different levels of arousal across wider frequency ranges without having to alter time-series first using IRASA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions. We would like to highlight that the IRASA method (Wen and Liu, 2016) was only used for one part of the analysis (fitting to frequency ranges below 30 Hz, compare 2c – Fit to lower frequencies). Therefore, all the analyses in the manuscript were performed on the recorded time-series data after artifact rejection, demeaning and detrending.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we evaluated the influence of different slope fitting algorithms on spectral slope estimation and recalculated the slopes using both the FOOOF (Haller et al., 2018) and the eBOSC algorithm (Caplan et al., 2001; Kosciessa et al., 2020; Whitten et al., 2011) in Study 1 – Anesthesia scalp EEG (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) and Study 3 – Sleep scalp EEG (Figure 2—figure supplement 9) and added goodness of fit statistics.</p><p>Linear regression:</p><p>Both our approach as well as the eBOSC algorithm (Kosciessa et al., 2020) perform a linear regression on the PSD in log-log space, albeit with using either the polyfit.m function (in our case) or the robustfit.m in the case of eBOSC.</p><p>Model fit:</p><p>The FOOOF algorithm follows the following steps to estimate the oscillatory and aperiodic signal: First an exponential fit is performed to the power spectrum in semi-log space, then this fit is subtracted from the PSD. The residual signal is treated as a combination of oscillations and noise and is repeatedly fit with multiple gaussian fits to detect putative oscillatory peaks until the noise floor is reached. The detected peaks are then validated against the mixed oscillatory/noise signal and subtracted from the original PSD. The new residual signal is then fit again for a better estimate of the aperiodic signal. Both, the multi Gaussian fits and the improved aperiodic fit are then combined in a model (compare to Figure 3 (Haller et al., 2018)). When the PSD does not contain a bend, also called knee, in the aperiodic signal, then the algorithm is “equivalent to fitting a line in log-log space” (Haller et al., 2018).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The influence of different fit algorithms on spectral slope estimation in general anesthesia with propofol.</title><p>a, 1/f spectral slope in wakefulness (Wake, red) and under anesthesia (Ana, blue) using the original polyfit (Orig., orange), FOOOF (lblue) or eBOSC (purple) algorithm (n = 9, averaged across electrodes).

Note that propofol anesthesia is characterized by strong oscillations, mainly in the δ (1-4) and α range (8-12 Hz) which might distort spectral slope estimates (Purdon et al., 2013).</p><p>30 – 45 Hz: When fitting the slope to the 30 – 45 Hz range, there was no significant difference between slope estimated derived from the original polyfit and eBOSC, FOOOF and eBOSC (Figure 1—figure supplement 4a/ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>A).

Despite this difference, the slope values were still strongly correlated (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D).

These differences were not significant between the original polyfit and the FOOOF algorithm but were between the original and eBOSC (Figure 2—figure supplement 9A). Both slopes derived from FOOOF and eBOSC were strongly correlated with slopes calculated by the original polyfit (Figure 2—figure supplement 9B, C).

When the slope was fitted to the 1-40 Hz frequency range, the absolute slope values changed slightly but the overall pattern of a more negative slope for anesthesia than for wakefulness persisted (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). To directly compare the fits to the 30-45 and the 1-40 Hz frequency range, we contrasted the effect sizes (Cohen’s d) of the wakefulness-anesthesia comparison of the two fits (Figure 1—figure supplement 4G) and found no significant difference between the two irrespective of fitting algorithm (Permutation t-test: Orig.<sub>30-45</sub> – Orig.<sub>1-40</sub>: p = 0.773, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = -0.84, d = -0.37; fooof<sub>30-45</sub> – fooof<sub>1-40</sub>: p = 0.737, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = -0.63, d = -0.28; eBOSC<sub>30-45</sub> – eBOSC<sub>1-40</sub>: p = 0.672, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = -0.47, d = -0.20).</p><p>Moreover, we recalculated how well both slope fits can differentiate between wakefulness and anesthesia with a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Both 1/f slope fits result in a higher percentage of correct classification compared to SO power (SO: 52.43 ± 1.04 % (mean ± SEM), slope<sub>30-45</sub>: 76.56 ± 3.56 %, slope<sub>1-40</sub>: 83.75 ± 2.31 %; permutation t-tests: Slope<sub>30-45</sub> – SO: p &lt; 0.001, observed (obs.) t<sub>8</sub> = 6.10, d = 2.63; Slope<sub>1-40</sub> – SO: p &lt; 0.001, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = 9.24, d = 3.88). When directly comparing the slope fits, the fit to 1-40 Hz performed better than the 30-45 Hz (p = 0.023, obs. t<sub>8</sub> = 2.49, d = 0.83).</p><p>Taken together, while the absolute slope values varied, the overall slope pattern as well as the effect size between wakefulness and anesthesia was comparable between fits. However, the 1-40 Hz fit had a better wake-anesthesia classification performance. This performance difference might be due to an inclusion of both the low frequency (&lt; 4 Hz) and the α frequency (8 – 12 Hz) range into the 1 – 40 Hz fit. Under propofol anesthesia, these frequency ranges are typically characterized by prominent oscillations (Purdon et al., 2013) that might distort spectral slope estimation leading to overlapping information between the two factors. Notably, this finding is contrast to our results in sleep, where an inclusion of low frequencies hampered the MI between the hypnogram (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5D). This implies that optimal fit ranges for spectral slope estimation could differ between arousal states.</p><p>In conclusion, both the 30-45 as well as the 1-40 frequency range seem suited to be used for spectral slope estimation under anesthesia in scalp EEG. However, the 30 – 45 Hz range had the highest MI between the hypnogram and the spectral slope in sleep in scalp EEG indicating that this specific range is well suited to be used in both sleep and anesthesia recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, goodness of fit statistics for the performed linear fits are missing and should be added for any kind of fitting procedure the authors decide to apply.</p><p>6) Discussion could be more in depth in terms of:</p><p>– connection with existing literature;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and carefully revisited the manuscript.
