Using murine myelin-reactive CD4 T cells, we demonstrate that proximal T cell signaling modulates Notch activation by a spatiotemporally constrained mechanism. The protein kinase PKCθ is a critical mediator of signaling by the T cell antigen receptor and the principal costimulatory receptor CD28. PKCθ selectively inactivates the negative regulator of F-actin generation, Coronin 1A, at the center of the T cell interface with the antigen presenting cell (APC). This allows for effective generation of the large actin-based lamellum required for recruitment of the Notch-processing membrane metalloproteinase ADAM10. Such enhancement of Notch activation is critical for efficient T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation. We reveal a novel mechanism that, through modulation of the cytoskeleton, controls Notch activation at the T cell:APC interface thereby linking T cell receptor and Notch signaling pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20003.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20003.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20003.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body’s immune system recognizes and responds to foreign agents such as bacteria and viruses. Immune cells known as T cells recognize foreign substances through a protein on their surface called the T cell receptor. Specifically, the T cell receptor binds to fragments of foreign proteins displayed on the surface of other cells, which sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the T cell becoming activated. An activated T cell divides to form new cells that develop into “effector” T cells, which can mount an effective immune response.</p><p>The T cell engages with the cell displaying the foreign proteins via an interface referred to as the immunological synapse. This zone of contact brings together the signaling machinery of the T cell. Like many other cells, T cells contain an internal skeleton-like structure made up of actin filaments. These filaments are crucial for the formation of the immunological synapse, in part because they help to transport the T cell receptor and other signaling proteins to the immunological synapse.</p><p>Recent research suggests that a signaling protein called Notch plays an important role in instructing activated T cells to develop into effector cells. Notch is found on the surface of many cells, including T cells, and it becomes activated when it is cut by a specific enzyme. However, it was not entirely clear how T cell signaling drives the activation of the Notch protein.</p><p>Britton et al. have now investigated the mechanism that leads to Notch activation in T cells from mice. The results show that a protein found inside the T cell, called PKCθ, is a major contributor to Notch activation when T cells become activated. So how does the PKCθ protein control the activation of Notch? Britton et al. observed that PKCθ inactivates a protein that normally inhibits actin filaments from forming, and does so specifically at the center of the immunological synapse. This inhibition promotes the generation of a large actin-rich structure known as the lamellal actin network. This structure is required to recruit the Notch-cutting enzyme to the immunological synapse. Further analysis revealed that Notch gets cut and activated during the first few minutes of T cell activation leading to cell division and the development of effector T cells.</p><p>Following on from this work, the next challenge will be to explore if altering signaling from the T cell receptor – for example, using drugs or small molecules – can modify the activation of Notch. If so, it will be important to explore if the chemicals could potentially be used to treat diseases that develop when T cells go awry, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20003.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20003.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CD4 T cell</kwd><kwd>cell signalling</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCIG-GA-2012-321554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wuelfing</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000381</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>900/08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatos-Peyton</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102387/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambler</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><name><surname>Tunbridge</surname><given-names>Helen M</given-names></name><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Kerrie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hampton-O’Neil</surname><given-names>Lea A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091074/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Elaine V</given-names></name><name><surname>Wraith</surname><given-names>David Cameron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883</institution-id><institution>University of Bristol</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Danielle J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>086779/Z/08/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>Graham J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>T cell receptor and Notch signaling pathways are linked via a novel mechanism involving modulation of the cytoskeleton.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cell activation is mediated by antigen recognition through the T cell receptor (TCR). To allow physiological adaptation, the TCR signal is modulated by co-regulatory signals. Here, we address co-stimulation through Notch. Notch family proteins are large, heterodimeric transmembrane receptors. Upon Notch ligation by one of a family of Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osborne and Minter, 2007</xref>), a plasma membrane-tethered matrix metalloproteinase, ADAM10 or ADAM17, removes the Notch extracellular domain. Subsequently, the plasma membrane-embedded γ-secretase complex liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD constitutively translocates to the nucleus where it displaces transcriptional repressors and recruits enhancers to genomic loci characterized by binding of the transcription factor RPBJκ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borggrefe and Oswald, 2009</xref>).</p><p>An essential role for Notch1 in T cell thymic development is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Washburn et al., 1997</xref>); a Notch1 deficient hematopoietic compartment yields no T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radtke et al., 1999</xref>). Notch1 signaling also plays a pivotal role in mature T cells. Notch1 is activated following TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ong et al., 2008</xref>) and is required for effector cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keerthivasan et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of Notch1 activation is directly proportional to the strength of the TCR signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guy et al., 2013</xref>). Antigen-induced Notch1 activation in T cells may be ligand independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz and Osborne, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palaga et al., 2003</xref>). However, the cellular mechanism coupling proximal T cell signaling to Notch activation is unresolved. Here we reveal a spatially constrained mechanism of Notch1 activation. We demonstrate that PKCθ, a serine/threonine kinase integrating TCR and CD28 signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Kong, 2016</xref>), enhances T cell actin dynamics through localization and phosphorylation of the negative actin regulator Coronin1A (Coro 1A) and thus mediates actin-based recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell:APC interface for efficient Notch activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PKCθ enhances Notch activation</title><p>To study the role of TCR/CD28-proximal signaling in Notch1 activation, we bred PKCθ-deficient Tg4 mice (Tg4<sup>KO</sup>). PKCθ integrates TCR and CD28 signals. PKCθ-deletion renders peripheral T cells hyporesponsive but allows normal thymic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2000</xref>). Tg4 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 1995</xref>) recognize the acetylated N-terminal peptide of myelin basic protein Ac1-9[4K] and its high affinity MHC-binding analogue Ac1-9[4Y].</p><p>To determine whether Notch activation could play a role in mature T cells that is comparable to that in thymocytes, where Notch drives critical developmental decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radtke et al., 2013</xref>), we assayed NICD expression in Tg4 thymocytes, naïve and primed T cells in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. NICD expression and changes thereof upon cellular activation were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, Notch activation was impaired in mature T cells from Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice. Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice showed reduced Notch1 expression sixteen hours after in vivo T cell activation by injecting mice with 80 µg [4Y] peptide s.c. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) even though Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice were grossly normal with a reduced number and proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> splenocytes but unaffected Tg4 TCR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Reduced Notch expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis 60 min after s.c. administration of [4Y] peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and through analysis of Notch1-dependent hes1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Corroborating these data in non-TCR transgenic T cells, Notch1 cleavage in naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD44<sup>−</sup>, CD25<sup>−</sup>) from PKCθ-deficient B10.PL mice was diminished following overnight activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Such Notch activation was CD28-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with an important role of PKCθ downstream of CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>). As biochemical signaling activity in T cell activation peaks within the first few minutes, we verified that PKCθ-dependent Notch activation can also occur at this time scale. Increased nuclear Notch enrichment could be detected 5 to 20 min after in vitro T cell activation or after injecting mice with 80 µg [4Y] peptide s.c. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). This effect was corroborated using a second TCR transgenic system, 5C.C7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singleton et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20003.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PKCθ enhances antigen-induced Notch activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tg4<sup>WT</sup> and Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice were injected subcutaneously with 80 µg of MBPAc1-9[4Y] peptide or PBS.

We visualized ADAM10 recruitment to the interface between the T cell and the APC by virally transducing Tg4<sup>WT</sup> and Tg4<sup>KO</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with ADAM10-GFP. ADAM10-GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells were imaged as they interacted with H-2<sup>u</sup> PL8 lymphoma APC presenting the Ac1-9[4Y] antigen. Tg4<sup>KO</sup> T cells, whether transduced to express ADAM10-GFP or other sensors, formed tight cell couples upon APC contact albeit with a slightly reduced frequency compared to Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells (30 ± 5% versus 50 ± 4%, p=0.02) with comparable gross T cell morphology, as characterized in the next paragraph. Such effective cell coupling allowed an analysis of the interface recruitment of GFP-tagged signaling intermediates and the spatiotemporal patterns thereof. ADAM10-GFP was recruited rapidly and transiently to the interface of Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells and APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) consistent with previous work in AND T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guy et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, ADAM10-GFP was not enriched at the interface of Tg4<sup>KO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In Tg4<sup>WT</sup> cells, ADAM10 was enriched in the interface lamellum, an actin-based signaling structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roybal et al., 2015b</xref>). Impairment of lamellum formation with 40 nM Jasplakinolide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roybal et al., 2015a</xref>) prevented ADAM10 interface recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and Notch cleavage following stimulation with anti-CD3/28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The defect in lamellal ADAM10 recruitment upon PKCθ-deficiency was selective since the lamellal accumulation of Themis, a protein with substantially more prominent and persistent lamellal accumulation than ADAM10, was only moderately impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that actin-dependent ADAM10 recruitment to the T cell:APC interface at the early peak of T cell signaling activity mediates efficient Notch1 activation downstream of PKCθ. In AND T cells strong stimuli cause concerted accumulation of the TCR, Vav and Notch at the T cell/APC interface as related to efficient Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guy et al., 2013</xref>). Actin dynamics may thus mediate coordinated interface accumulation of both ADAM10 and Notch. It needs to be determined how PKCθ and Vav-dependent actin dynamics are related.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20003.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PKCθ mediates transient actin-dependent recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell lamellum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tg4<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, treated with 40 nM Jasplakinolide (bottom) or not (top), and Tg4<sup>KO</sup> (middle) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing ADAM10-GFP were activated with PL8 cells presenting the Ac1-9[4Y] peptide.

Coronin activity is negatively regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, which can be induced by phorbol ester treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oku et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2012</xref>). To allow detection of changes in Coronin1A phosphorylation, we prevented Coronin1A dephosphorylation by treating cells with the phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oku et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2012</xref>). Treating Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells with PMA and Calyculin A resulted in a shift in the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated Coronin1A from 0.3 ± 0.1 to 2.8 ± 1.1 fold, indicative of efficient Coronin1A phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This shift was significantly (p&lt;0.05) smaller in Tg4<sup>KO</sup> cells (0.25 ± 0.05 to 0.8 ± 0.25 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) demonstrating that PKCθ is required for efficient PMA-induced phosphorylation of Coronin1A. Together, our data suggest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) that in Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells PKCθ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>) inactivates Coronin 1A selectively in the region of most intense stimulating signaling, i.e. the center of the T cell:APC interface with effects extending across the entire lamellum but not reaching the peripheral actin ring. Thus PKCθ locally inhibits Coronin 1A-mediated attenuation of actin dynamics, promoting the formation of a strong actin-based lamellum. With regard to Notch1 activation this allows for the efficient actin-driven recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell:APC interface. This mechanism of enhanced Notch processing peaks within the first few minutes of T cell activation. Such early signaling emphasis is consistently observed in Tg4<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and other TCR transgenic systems, where it extends to the nuclear localization of other transcription factors, NFAT and NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roybal et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singleton et al., 2009</xref>). We have thus identified a spatially restricted, actin-dependent mechanism of Notch activation downstream of PKCθ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Future work will determine how the enhancement of Notch activation by PKCθ is integrated with PKCθ-dependent NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gruber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2000</xref>) in the regulation of T cell differentiation.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20003-media7.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20003.018</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>PKCθ-GFP accumulates at the center of the interface between Tg4<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and PL8 APCs.</title><p>A representative interaction of a Tg4<sup>WT</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expressing PKCθ-GFP with a PL8 APC presenting the Ac1-9[4Y] peptide is shown as in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>.

While causally connecting such divergent time scales is a great challenge, there is precedent. 15 min of contact between a primed T cell and a professional APC is sufficient to trigger T cell proliferation 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, 1 hr of ZAP-70 activity can trigger substantial negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>). Differential signaling kinetics may also regulate Treg induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</xref>). On an even shorter time scale 5 min of TGFβ incubation saturates Smad2 phosphorylation at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vizán et al., 2013</xref>). In T cell activation, it has been argued that a time delay in the onset of activating versus inhibitory signaling from 2 to more than 5 min, respectively, may play an important role in the induction of anergy in response to high doses of antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolchinsky et al., 2014</xref>). In B cells a single pulse of BCR engagement can trigger the nuclear accumulation of NFκB for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damdinsuren et al., 2010</xref>). While mechanisms linking rapid proximal signaling to later cell function largely remain to be determined, the well-supported existence of such causal links is consistent with our model of PKCθ-dependent Notch activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were maintained under SPF conditions with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and standard chow at the University of Bristol.

T cell:APC couples were identified in electron micrographs through their wide cellular interface. As described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roybal et al. (2015b)</xref>, the time point assignment of cell couples was filtered with morphological criteria post acquisition using the presence of a uropod and T cell elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. The significance of pairwise comparisons was measured by Student’s t-test. Where multiple comparisons were made, significance was determined by ANOVA with Tukey correction. The statistical significance in differences in percentage occurrence was calculated with a proportions z-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>GJB was supported by the Wellcome Trust Dynamic Cell Biology programme grant 086779/Z/08/A RA, HMT, KEM, LAH were supported by the Wellcome Trust Dynamic Cell Biology programme grant 102387/Z/13/Z DJC was supported by a University of Bristol PhD studentship CSP was supported by a senior research fellowship from the Multiple Sclerosis Society CW was supported by the ERC grant PCIG-GA-2012–321554 DW was supported by a Wellcome Trust Programme Grant 091074/Z/09/Z We acknowledge the MRC, the Wolfson Foundation and the University of Bristol for supporting the Wolfson Bioimaging Facility.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael L Dustin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bernard Malissen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tg4 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from Tg4 mice that are deprived of the serine-threonine kinase PKCq and were injected 18 h previously with the Tg4 cognate antigen showed a reduction in intracellular Notch1 expression as compared to Tg4 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from WT mice. A finding further confirmed by analysis of Notch1-dependent hes1 expression. There is a concern regarding the level of Hes1 activation in relation to cells that utilise bona fide ligand dependent Notch signalling, such as thymocytes, and using thymocytes from the same mouse strains as positive controls would be helpful to put this in perspective. Following CD3 + CD28 stimulation for 18 hours, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from B10.PL mice deprived of PKCq showed reduced Notch1 cleavage. This cleavage occurred within a time frame compatible with TCR signalling. T cell proliferation, CD69 and c-Myc upregulation and Th17 development were defective in Tg4KO T cells whereas IL-2 and Th1 cell differentiation were unaffected. Importantly, constitutive activation of Notch in Tg4KO cells restored T cell proliferation and Th17 cell differentiation. The authors admit that this is an over-expression experiment, but it would be helpful to see the level of expression, normalised to cell number, for early DN thymocytes, mature T cells undergoing activation and the retrovirally transduced cells. Visualization of ADAM10 at the T cell-APC interface showed that it was recruited rapidly and transiently to interfaces involving of Tg4WT T cells but not Tg4KO T cells. Therefore, the actin-dependent (Jasplakinolide sensitive) early recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell-APC interface likely contributes to efficient Notch1 activation downstream of PKC There is a concern as to how jJasplakinolide, a non-specific F-actin stabilizer, can be used in this manner without inhibiting synapse formation – it would be useful to see titration data to better understand the degree to which the width of the optimum Jasplakinolide concentration for this effect θ. Treating Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells with PMA and Calyculin A – a phosphatase inhibitor – resulted in PKCq-dependent Coronin1A phosphorylation. There was a concern that a Calyculin A alone condition was not shown and whether or not PMA is required to see the increase phosphorylation. This gel shown is also sub-optimal due to artefacts and repeating this with the additional condition will also provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the data. This led the authors to propose that PKCθq enhances T cell actin dynamics through co-localization with and phosphorylation of the negative actin regulator Coronin1A, thereby mediating actin-based recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell-APC interface and efficient Notch activation.</p><p>I do not have any specific concerns. The data are solid and the proposed model interesting in that it concurs to integrate the TCR-CD28 signaling pathways with the Notch pathway. As shown by the authors this is of biological relevance since impairment of such integrated loop affects Th17 differentiation. Importantly those studies were performed in primary T cells and not transformed T cells.</p><p>Overall, the model is interesting and some of the data are generally convincing, but the series of experiments is marred by use of different time points without explanation. Further explanation of these choices and how this relates to the operation of the proposed mechanism in the line of T-APC interaction would strengthen the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide data on Notch ICD and Hes1 levels in mature T cells undergoing activation, DN thymocytes, which are known to use the pathway and show clear Hes1 signatures in public data, and the NICD over-expressing cells used later on. This data could be supplemental, its significance should be clearly discussed.</p><p>2) In relation to evidence for CoroninA phosphorylation by PKCtheta, it is a concern that the calyculin A alone condition is omitted. The authors should repeat the experiment with this condition included. How would the authors interpret the result if PMA is not needed to see the effect? The gel shown is also suboptimal and an effort should be made in this new experiment to reduce artefacts that make the interpretation ambiguous.</p><p>3) To test whether ADAM10 recruitment to the synapse is mediated by PKC-theta dependent actin changes, they use Jasplakinolide. But this drug would also be expected to impair synapse formation by stabilising F-actin which is then collapsed by myosin II based contractility. Its assumed that this rescue effect is seen only in a narrow range of Jasplakinolide concentrations to semiselectively counteract the loss of CoroninA inhibition. The authors should show a Jasplakinolide titration to clarify this and also it would be helpful to see the total F-actin at each point to understand that nature of this effect. Otherwise it’s hard to understand how a saturating concentration of Jasplakinolide would accomplish the desired effect. The authors could discuss if there is any reason to expect that Jasplakinolide would specifically counteract CoroninA function.</p><p>4) The mix of time scales from minutes to hours to days makes it difficult to parse out exactly the kinetics of the mechanism. The authors need to provide a rationale for these timings and how these relate to T-APC interaction time lines that are established in the literature. When is this effect most important?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20003.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Provide data on Notch ICD and Hes1 levels in mature T cells undergoing activation, DN thymocytes, which are known to use the pathway and show clear Hes1 signatures in public data, and the NICD over-expressing cells used later on.

As previously communicated with the editorial office, Christoph Wuelfing and colleagues recently published a paper in which they conducted a titration of this drug using similar TCR transgenic T cells (5CC7). This paper (Roybal et al. PLOS ONE 10 (8) e0133231) addresses the questions raised by the reviewer. Furthermore, we have shown that 5CC7 and Tg4, the TCR transgenic used in this study, behave identically in cell coupling assays when treated with the drug. The cell coupling-frequencies of Jasplakinolide-treated Tg4 cells, shown relative to 5CC7, are added in the text and are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. The relevance of the comparative data is referred to in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. In summary, the cell coupling data shown in this figure establish that Tg4 and 5C.C7 T cells respond comparably to increasing concentrations of Jasplakinolide. The extensive characterization of the effect of 40 nM Jasplakinolide on T cell actin dynamics in (Roybal et al., 2015a) therefore applies to the Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells.</p><p><italic>4) The mix of time scales from minutes to hours to days makes it difficult to parse out exactly the kinetics of the mechanism. The authors need to provide a rationale for these timings and how these relate to T-APC interaction time lines that are established in the literature. When is this effect most important?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers have asked us to discuss the mix of time scales from minutes to hours to days. We have included a short paragraph at the end of the paper that emphasises how signalling events of relatively short duration lead to longer-term cellular changes. The extremely rapid signalling events taking place at the immune synapse are best revealed by the type of spatio-temporal analysis used in this paper. Longer-term changes in cell function i.e. cell activation, surface phenotype, cytokine production require medium term analysis, on the scale of hours, while changes in cell differentiation require days to be observed. We have defined the role of PKCθ on such cellular events using techniques that are appropriate for the time scale of the specific event.</p></body></sub-article></article>
