A variety of different photoreceptors regulate this process. Purple photosynthetic bacteria synthesize a novel photoreceptor AerR that uses cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>) as a blue-light absorbing chromophore to control photosystem synthesis. AerR directly interacts with the redox responding transcription factor CrtJ, affecting CrtJ’s interaction with photosystem promoters. In this study, we show that AerR is translated as two isoforms that differ by 41 amino acids at the amino terminus. The ratio of these isoforms was affected by light and cell growth phase with the long variant predominating during photosynthetic exponential growth and the short variant predominating in dark conditions and/or stationary phase. Pigmentation and transcriptomic analyses show that the short AerR variant represses, while long variant activates, photosynthesis genes. The long form of AerR also activates many genes involved in cellular metabolism and motility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39028.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some bacteria are able to use a process called photosynthesis to convert energy from sunlight into another form of energy they can use to grow. Within the bacteria, structures known as photosystems are responsible for absorbing light and transferring the energy to other molecules. The levels of light surrounding the bacteria continually fluctuate. To optimize the amount of light they absorb for photosynthesis, the bacteria have receptors that detect light and regulate the activities of the genes that produce photosystems.</p><p>One group of bacteria that carry out photosynthesis are collectively known as purple bacteria. These bacteria contain a light receptor called AerR that interacts with a protein called CrtJ, which can directly bind to and alter the activity of genes involved in photosynthesis. AerR senses light by binding to a molecule called vitamin B12, which can absorb blue light, but it was not clear how it affects the CrtJ protein.</p><p>Fang, Yamamoto et al. used biochemical and genetic approaches to study AerR in a purple bacterium known as <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic>. The experiments show that <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> makes two different versions of AerR. The larger version only binds to vitamin B12 that is carrying light energy and stimulates CrtJ to activate genes involved in photosynthesis. On the other hand, the shorter version binds to vitamin B12 in the dark and causes CrtJ to repress genes that produce photosystems.</p><p>Receptors similar to AerR are found in many bacteria and other single-celled organisms known as Archaea, including in species that do not perform photosynthesis. Therefore, these findings are likely to be useful to researchers studying how bacteria and Archaea sense light in a variety of situations. A next step will be to find out how the different forms of AerR can change the properties of CrtJ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B12 photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>Rhodobacter capsulatus</kwd><kwd>CrtJ/PpsR</kwd><kwd>anoxygenic photosynthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM040941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Carl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel B12 containing photoreceptor is synthesized as two different isoforms that interact with the same transcription factor, with one isoform directing activation and the other promoting repression of photosystem synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Purple photosynthetic bacteria are an interesting group of diverse bacteria that preferentially synthesizes a photosystem under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imhoff and Hiraishi, 2015</xref>). This is partially due to the fact that photopigments can generate singlet oxygen as a byproduct of light excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berghoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziegelhoffer and Donohue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pospísil, 2009</xref>). Thus, many purple photosynthetic bacteria repress synthesis of their photosystem in response to the presence of oxygen, and in this case, generate energy using respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crofts et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swem et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu and Bauer, 2010</xref>). In species where it has been examined, there is an aerobic repressor called CrtJ (also called PpsR in some species) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomelsky and Kaplan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Penfold and Pemberton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ponnampalam et al., 1995</xref>) that senses oxygen via oxidation of a Cys present in CrtJ’s DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masuda and Bauer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2002</xref>). Initially, it was thought that CrtJ/PpsR only binds and represses photosystem promoters under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ponnampalam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masuda and Bauer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2002</xref>). However, a recent study showed that CrtJ is bound to a photosystem promoter (<italic>bchC</italic>) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the extent of DNA protection by CrtJ to this promoter is significantly altered in vivo under aerobic verses anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to environmental changes in oxygen tension, phototrophic microorganisms are subjected to daily variations in light intensity and wavelength. To optimize light energy absorption for photosynthesis, and to better adapt their physiology to dark periods, these cells also control photosystem synthesis using various photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomelsky and Hoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masuda, 2013</xref>). A variety of chromophores such as FMN (used in <underline>L</underline>ight, <underline>O</underline>xygen or <underline>V</underline>oltage, LOV domain containing proteins), FAD (used in sensors of <underline>B</underline>lue-<underline>L</underline>ight <underline>U</underline>sing <underline>F</underline>AD, BLUF domain containing proteins), 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (used in <underline>P</underline>hotoactive <underline>Y</underline>ellow <underline>P</underline>rotein, PYP), phytochromobilin (used in bacteriophytochromes) and cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>) are used as light absorbing chromophores by photoreceptors present in purple bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masuda and Bauer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomelsky and Hoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masuda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomelsky and Klug, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendriks, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giraud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). Photoreceptor proteins need to either contain a linked output domain or to interact with other proteins that transmit photoreceptor sensed light signals into physiological changes. In some purple bacteria, photoreceptors can interact with transcription factors to alter the transcription of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendriks, 2009</xref>). For example, in the purple non-sulfur alpha-proteobacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, the interaction of the FAD-binding blue light sensor AppA with the transcription factor PpsR is well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masuda and Bauer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giraud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomelsky and Kaplan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metz et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palutris</italic>, PpsR repression is also regulated via an interaction with a red-light sensing bacteriophytochrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braatsch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braatsch et al., 2007</xref>). These light dependent interactions have also been used as optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaberniuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Redchuk et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In all sequenced purple photosynthetic bacterial genomes, there is a gene coding for a cobalamin binding photoreceptor called <italic>aerR</italic> that is located upstream of <italic>ppsR</italic>/<italic>crtJ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeulen and Bauer, 2015</xref>). The discovery that AerR binds cobalamin in a light-dependent manner explained a long-standing observation that this group of bacteria needs cobalamin to undergo synthesis of their photosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains unknown how AerR and CrtJ coordinate global changes in <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> physiology in response to changes in redox and light. We have shown that AerR can directly interact with CrtJ both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>) and that AerR can affect the DNA binding characteristics of CrtJ at target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> uses two offset promoters, and an alternative internal Leu start codon, to synthesize long and short isoforms of AerR. We further show that the long AerR variant converts CrtJ into an activator while the short AerR variant converts CrtJ into a repressor of photosystem gene expression. We also show that the long AerR variant coordinates synthesis of photosystem with expression of a large variety of additional genes that affect cellular metabolism and motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>There are two isoforms of AerR in vivo</title><p>We analyzed the in vivo presence of AerR by Western blot analysis using an <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> strain in which a 3xFLAG-tag was chromosomally inserted at the 3’ terminus of the <italic>aerR</italic> open reading frame. A previous study established that a 3xFLAG-tag at the carboxyl end of AerR did not measurably affect AerR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Western blot analysis shows the unexpected presence of two AerR-FLAG isoforms with one at ~30 kDa (LAerR) and the other at ~25 kDa (SAerR) based on electrophoretic mobility.

This indicates that the 25 kDa isoform (SAerR) either represents a proteolytic processing event or an alternative translational start site. Interestingly, steady-state amounts of these two AerR isoforms consistently changed depending on what point in the <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> cultivation growth curve that AerR-FLAG isoforms were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). When dark semi-aerobically grown cells were harvested at different points in mid-exponential phase, these two AerR isoforms are present at approximately equal amounts.

We accessed the possibility that one of these internal Met codons was functioning as an internal SAerR initiation codon by constructing three deletions within the LAerR coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The first deletion extended from the LAerR initiation codon to Met35, the second deletion extended from the LAerR initiation codon to Met49 and the third deletion extended from the LAerR initiation codon to Met61. Each of these AerR deletion constructs also contained a C-terminal FLAG epitope and all were ectopically expressed from the <italic>aerR</italic> native promoter in <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> on a plasmid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the Met1 through Met35 truncated strain still expressed two forms with the 30 kDa isoform shifted to ~27 kDa as a result of the deletion/truncation while the 25 kDa isoform showed same mobility as the WT control. The second deletion from Met1 through Met49 and the third deletion that extended to Met61 lost expression of both the longer and shorter isoforms indicating that the SAerR isoform starts between the M35 and M49 codons. One nucleotide frame shift insertions were subsequently created at several points between the Met35 and Met49 codons to further determine the SAerR initiation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While M35<sup>+1</sup> (one nucleotide inserted after M35 codon) and V38<sup>+1</sup> (one nucleotide inserted after V38 codon) strains still expressed the 25 kDa isoform, strains with nucleotide insertions after the L41, T43, and V44 codons did not express SAerR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result indicates the second initiation starts at the A39, E40, or L41 codon.</p><p>To find the exact location of the SAerR initiation codon, we constructed plasmids that contained the <italic>aerR</italic> promoter region and a partial <italic>aerR</italic> sequence fused to the <italic>bchE</italic> open reading frame that also had a FLAG epitope tag for use as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To focus on identification of the second initiation codon, these constructs also contained a one base insertion downstream of the LAerR initiation codon, resulting in disruption of LAerR peptide synthesis. Three constructs were made; one having the FLAG-<italic>bchE</italic> gene fused downstream of the A39 <italic>aerR</italic> codon, a second construct with FLAG-<italic>bchE</italic> fused to <italic>aerR</italic> codon E40, and a third with FLAG-<italic>bchE</italic> fused to L41.

This indicates that the L41 codon (CTG) is functioning as a second start site for the SAerR isoform. Six through sixteen bases upstream of L41 is a putative ribosome binding site (5’-GAAcGGAGtgG-3’) that exhibits considerable complementarity with the cognate <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> 16S rRNA sequence (3’-CUUuCCUCcaC-5’).</p><p>Finally, we also analyzed whether there was an additional internal transcription start site for SAerR by amplification of 5’ mRNA end(s) using cDNA 5’ RACE (<underline>R</underline>apid <underline>A</underline>mplification of <underline>c</underline>DNA <underline>E</underline>nds) (GeneRacer kit, Invitrogen). Note that a terminator exonuclease (Epicentre) treatment step was introduced in the 5' RACE experiments to degrade processed RNA, allowing only the selection for primary transcripts. A 24 base cDNA primer was also designed to be complementary to a region of the <italic>aerR</italic> transcript that is 299 bases downstream of the LAerR initiation codon. Consequently, this primer should amplify both a large transcript responsible for transcribing LAerR as well as a shorter transcript responsible for transcribing SAerR, should such a shorter transcript exist. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, two transcription start sites were indeed detected by sequencing: one with a start site 25 bp upstream of the LAerR initiation codon and a second initiating at the 8<sup>th</sup> codon of LAerR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The longer transcript could potentially be responsible for both LAerR and SAerR expression while the shorter transcript would be dedicated to the expression of SAerR. Inspection of the sequence upstream of these transcript initiation sites shows the presence of putative promoter recognition sequences with the SAerR −35 and −10 regions exhibiting good sequence similarity to previously characterized <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swem et al., 2001</xref>). However, this is not the case with the upstream LAerR promoter region which shows poor promoter sequence conservation indicating that the upstream LAerR promoter may utilize an alternative sigma subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, there are FnrL binding sites located near both promoter regions, which is not unexpected given that FnrL is known to regulate AerR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumka and Bauer, 2015</xref>) and that ChIP-seq analysis also has revealed FnrL binds at both of these promoter regions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumka and Bauer, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Construction of strains that express stable AerR isoforms</title><p>To effectively evaluate the function of each AerR isoform required that strains be constructed that only express the long or short isoforms of AerR.

The combination of both of these silent mutations resulted in a strain (termed ∆SAerR) that produces normal amounts of LAerR without any detectable amounts of SAerR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To obtain a strain that only synthesizes SAerR, we constructed a strain that had a one nucleotide chromosomal insertion immediately downstream of the LAerR Met initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This frameshift insertion results in the generation of an in frame stop codon 15 bp downstream of the LAerR initiating Met codon resulting in the synthesis of just a five aa peptide. Western blot analysis shows that this strain (termed ∆LAerR) only synthesizes SAerR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, a negative control strain was constructed (AerR null) that lacks both the short and long forms of AerR. This strain has a frameshift after codon L45 that results in undetectable amounts of both the LAerR and SAerR peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

For this analysis, cells were grown in rich PY medium under dark semi-aerobic conditions, harvested at late-exponential phase (OD = 0.6 to 0.7) and analyzed for the level of pigments after organic extraction. The bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that relative to wild-type cells, the strain that lacks the short isoform (∆SAerR) has ~1.6 and 1.75-fold enhancement of carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) levels, respectively. This is contrasted by the strain which lacks the long isoform of AerR (∆LAerR) that exhibits significantly reduced amounts of carotenoids and Bchl (20% and 2% of WT, respectively). The amount of Bchl biosynthesis exhibited by the strain lacking LAerR is also lower than that observed with the AerR null strain (20% of WT), which is thought to undergo constitutive CrtJ mediated repression of <italic>bch</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). In this growth condition, it appears that the long and short isoforms of AerR have opposite functions with SAerR involved in suppressing photopigment synthesis and LAerR involved in enhancing photopigment biosynthesis. When these same four strains were grown under anaerobic photosynthetic illuminated conditions, the ∆SAerR strain exhibited a slight 30% reduction in Bchl and carotenoid production while the ∆LAerR strain showed a more severe reduction in these pigments (78% and 65% reduction, respectively) relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, these studies have also demonstrated that AerR does tightly interact with the photosystem regulator CrtJ in vivo and in vitro. This interaction also subsequently affects the DNA binding characteristics of CrtJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). To further understand the role of short and long forms of AerR, we checked whether both isoforms are indeed both capable of interacting with CrtJ. We also checked the dependency of CrtJ on the observed phenotypes of strains expressing only SAerR or LAerR.</p><p>In vitro binding affinities measuring the interaction of each AerR isoform with CrtJ were obtained using microscale thermophoresis (MST) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). The observed binding affinity of CrtJ to LAerR was slightly lower than observed with CrtJ to SAerR with an EC<sub>50</sub> = 7.8 ± 1.2 µM for LAerR containing bound hydroxyl-Cbl (OH-Cbl), 2.1 ± 1 µM for SAerR with bound OH-Cbl and 2.1 ± 0.8 µM SAerR with bound Adenosyl-Cbl (Ado-Cbl). Thus, both AerR isoforms are indeed capable of forming a complex with CrtJ. The type of Cbl bound to SAerR also does not seem to appear affect its interaction with CrtJ.</p><p>We next addressed whether LAerR and SAerR both interact with CrtJ in vivo by addressing CrtJ dependency on the observed phenotypes exhibited by strains that lacked either LAerR or SAerR. A 1.5-fold increase in dark semi-aerobic Bchl production has previously been reported for the <italic>crtJ</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>) so the question we addressed is whether increased Bchl production exhibited by a CrtJ deletion mutation is dominant over the observed reduction in Bchl production by the ∆LAerR and AerR null strains when grown under dark semi-aerobic conditions. For this analysis, we constructed an in-frame deletion of <italic>crtJ</italic> in the relevant <italic>aerR</italic> mutant strains giving rise to <italic>∆SaerR-∆crtJ, ∆LaerR-∆crtJ</italic> and null <italic>aerR-∆crtJ</italic> strains. In dark semi-aerobic growth conditions, all three strains that contained the <italic>crtJ</italic> deletion (<italic>∆crtJ</italic>, null <italic>aerR-∆crtJ,</italic> ∆L<italic>aerR-∆crtJ</italic> and ∆S<italic>aerR-∆crtJ</italic>) exhibited 1.5 to 2-fold higher amounts of Bchl relative to that observed by the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, this increase in pigment production is very similar to the increase in pigment production observed when the ∆SAerR strain just expresses the LAerR isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The 1.5-fold increase in Bchl production over that of WT strain exhibited by the ∆L<italic>aerR-∆crtJ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) is also a stark contrast to the severe ~80% reduction in pigment production exhibited by the ∆LAerR strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result demonstrates that the increased pigment production exhibited by a deletion of CrtJ is dominant over reduced pigment production exhibited by the loss of LAerR. Furthermore, the observed increased pigment production exhibited by the ∆SAerR strain appears to be indistinguishable from the increased pigmentation phenotype exhibited by a deletion of CrtJ. One conclusion in comparing the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> is that (i) both LAerR and SAerR works in CrtJ dependent manner and (ii) an absence of SAerR results in CrtJ no longer being able to repress bacteriochlorophyll gene expression whereas a loss of the LAerR isoform leads to the inability of CrtJ to enhanced pigment production.</p><p>When pigment production was analyzed under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions, we observed that the introduction of the ∆<italic>crtJ</italic> deletion into the AerR null, ∆SAerR and ∆LAerR strains largely suppresses these AerR mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicating that the ∆<italic>crtJ</italic> phenotype is dominant over that of the ∆SAerR and ∆LAerR phenotypes under photosynthetic conditions.

Specifically, it was shown that LAerR tightly binds OH-Cbl which is generated as a byproduct of light excitation of Ado-Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). A Cbl deficiency was also shown to result in a reduction in pigmentation and photosystem gene expression in a manner that mimics the phenotype of an AerR null mutation. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that LAerR forms upper and lower axial ligands with the Co metal in OH-Cbl using two histidine residues (His10 and His145). Alanine substitutions on one of these His ligands alters the Co spectrum with Ala mutations in both of these His residues abolishing the ability of LAerR to bind OH-Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Given that SAerR lacks the His10 upper Co ligand, we also addressed whether SAerR is indeed capable of light-dependent binding OH-Cbl in vitro as described for LAerR. For this analysis, purified SAerR protein was incubated with several Cbl derivatives under dark or illuminated conditions followed by removal of unbound cobalamins with a desalting column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Spectral analysis of SAerR surprisingly showed that SAerR is able to bind all tested cobalamin derivatives (OH-Cbl, Ado-Cbl, cyano-Cbl, and methyl-Cbl) under both dark and illuminated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This pigment reduction mirrors the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> which show that a strain that just harbors SAerR has a severe reduction in pigment synthesis. In contrast, a strain harboring an SAerR_H145A,G148E expression plasmid contained only slightly less than WT amounts of Bchl and carotenoid (orange spectrum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This indicates that disruption of SAerR’s ability to bind B<sub>12</sub> impairs CrtJ mediated repression activity. The growth rate observed when shifted from semi-aerobic to anaerobic photosynthetic conditions also supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, the SAerR_H145A, G148E expressing strain grew at nearly the same growth rate as the strain that did not express SAerR while the strain that expressed SAerR exhibited a significant delay in photosynthetic growth. Collectively, these results indicate that unlike LAerR, SAerR promiscuously binds Cbl with differing upper ligands in a light-independent manner and that Cbl binding has an important role for SAerR activity. That said, we do note that the Cbl binding mutant does not reach the same optical density as does the WT strain, and also has pigment levels that do not reach the same level as that of the WT strain.

The heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, and the quantitated fold-changes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, show photosynthesis gene expression changes under dark semi-aerobic conditions. Overall the ∆LAerR strain that lacks LAerR, and the AerR null mutation strain that does not contain either isoforms of AerR, both exhibited reduced photosystem gene expression profiles relative to that observed by the WT strain. However, there are several important differences. For example, the ∆LAerR strain has significantly reduced expression of the <italic>puc</italic> operon coding for light harvesting II (LHII) structural peptides which is not observed by the AerR null strain where <italic>puc</italic> expression is unchanged from the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This result indicates that SAerR has a role in repressing <italic>puc</italic> (LHII) expression. A second difference is that the ∆LAerR strain also has significantly reduced expression of the <italic>bchEJGP</italic> operon and reduced expression of the divergent <italic>crtA-bchIDO</italic> and <italic>crtIB</italic> operons relative to the AerR null and WT strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This also indicates a role of SAerR in repressing expression of these operons. Note that the <italic>crtI-crtB</italic> gene products code for phytoene dehydrogenase and phytoene synthase, respectively, which are involved in the first two committed steps of carotenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong, 1995</xref>). The same is true for <italic>bchID</italic> which code for the ATPase subunits in Mg-chelatase, the first committed step in Bchl biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Senge and Smith, 1995</xref>). Thus, the rather significant ‘super’ repression of these two divergent operons that occurs upon loss of LAerR likely causes the observed severe reduction of Bchl and carotenoids synthesis in the dark semi-aerobically grown ∆LAerR strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Evidence for the involvement of CrtJ in LAerR mediated activation of these photosystem genes is also observed by the rather significant increase in expression exhibited by the <italic>∆crtJ</italic> and <italic>∆aerR∆crtJ</italic> double mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is also congruent with the observed photopigment phenotype suppression in the SAerR and LAerR strains by the addition of a CrtJ mutation as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Finally, in regards to the ∆SAerR strain that lacks SAerR, there is increased photosystem transcripts relative to WT cells indicating that SAerR likely has a repressing role under dark semi-aerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39028.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Heat map of global expression changes in AerR and CrtJ mutant strains as measured by RNA-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Changes in expression occuring in the photosynthesis gene cluster region of the <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> chromosome in dark semi-aerobically grown AerR mutation strains.

A loss of the LAerR isoform results in lower expression of genes involved in such diverse cellular processes as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, chemotaxis and motility, cobalamin biosynthesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle, heme biosynthesis, ribosomal proteins and several transporters. In each these cases, LAerR appears to be functioning as an activator as its loss leads to a reduction of expression of these genes. One stark exception is an operon coding for a bacterial microcompartment that metabolizes 1,2 propanediol for ATP production where LAerR appears to function as a repressor as a loss of LAerR leads to a rather dramatic increase in the expression of these bacterial microcompartment genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In the central metabolism category, many genes involved in glycolysis are reduced in both the AerR Null and LAerR depleted strains but increased in the SAerR depleted strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Specifically, these results indicate that LAerR activates expression of many glycolysis enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (<italic>fba</italic>), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>gap1</italic>), phosphoglycerate kinase (<italic>pgk</italic>) and pyruvate kinase (<italic>pykA2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). LAerR mediated increase in glycolysis likely lead to increased synthesis of pyruvate that feeds into the TCA cycle potentially increasing synthesis of a number of important molecules such as isoprenoids, tetrapyrroles and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Conversely, increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the ΔSAerR strain indicates that the SAerR isoform has a role in decreasing the flow of metabolites into these cellular processes. Interestingly, the same pattern of decreased expression by SAerR and increased expression by LAerR is observed for several genes involved in branched-chain amino acid transportation, carbon fixation mediated by form I (<italic>cbbLS</italic>) and form II RubisCO (<italic>cbbM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, LAerR stimulates expression of almost all the 50S and 30S ribosomal proteins, numerous genes involved in motility and chemotaxis, and numerous genes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This latter effect is notable as LAerR itself uses cobalamin as a cofactor in a light-dependent manner.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39028.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of the LAerR regulon in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>capsulatus</italic> under photosynthetic growth conditions.</title><p>LAerR activates carbon fixation, chemotaxis and motility, cobalamin biosynthesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle, heme biosynthesis, photosynthesis, ribosome and some transporters like xylose, ribulose and BCAA transporters.

The ratio of the LAerR and SAerR isoforms changes as cells transition from logarithmic to stationary phases of growth with LAerR predominating in the log phase and SAerR predominating in the stationary phase. The LAerR isoform also predominates in cells that are shifted from dark to illuminated photosynthetic conditions while the short form predominates when cells are shifted from light to dark conditions.</p><p>5’ race analysis shows two transcription start sites with a shorter transcript initiated within the LAerR coding region that is likely responsible for SAerR expression. Conversely, LAerR is expressed from a longer transcript, although at this stage we cannot rule out the possibility that the longer LAerR transcript is also responsible for both LAerR and SAerR expression. Our mutational studies also demonstrate that an alternative CTG (Leu41) translational start site is responsible for the production of SAerR. In bacteria, three initiation factors (IF1, IF2, and IF3) are involved in translation initiation of the ribosomal complex with IF3 inhibits translation from non-canonical initial codons such as ATT, ATC, and CTG. IF3 is known to inspect the initiation codon, thus in IF3 mutants there is increased translation from non-canonical codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sussman et al., 1996</xref>). In <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, a homolog of IF3 (PifC) was reported to possess similar activity as IF3 and also found to be an important factor for Bchl biosynthesis and synthesis of the photosystem in semi-aerobic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babic et al., 1997</xref>). While it remains to be determined how changes in cellular growth rate/cellular physiology affects translation initiation at the CTG SAerR start site, it has been observed that many species sequesters 70S ribosomes into inactive 100S complexes in stationary phase with a protein known as YhbH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ueta et al., 2005</xref>). Inactive 100S ribosomes can also be returned into an active 70S state with another factor termed YfiA when adequate growth conditions resume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ueta et al., 2005</xref>). Orthologs of IF3, YhbH and YfiA are present in the <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> genome and thus would be good targets in future studies to explore the mechanism of how cellular physiology may ultimately control SAerR initiation at this internal CTG codon. We also observed a rapid reduction of LAerR in response to a growth shift from lit to dark conditions, which may indicate that LAerR is unstable under conditions where it would not contain bound cobalamin.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>AerR functions as an activation/repression switch of CrtJ function</title><p>An earlier in vitro study using small DNA templates for DNA binding analysis indicated that AerR (corresponding to LAerR in this study) likely functioned as an anti-repressor that dissociated CrtJ from photosystem promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). However, more recent in vitro studies, using much larger DNA segments, demonstrated that LAerR does not disassociate CrtJ from target promoters, but instead, alters CrtJ’s interaction with the DNA template by significantly increasing the extent of the DNA that it interacts with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). Additional in vivo analysis using ChIP-seq also revealed that CrtJ does not significantly disassociate from target promoters under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). These results indicate that the control of photosystem gene expression by CrtJ is much more complex and nuanced than previously thought. Indeed in this study, we demonstrate that <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> synthesizes two isoforms of AerR, LAerR and SAerR, which have opposite effects on gene expression in a CrtJ dependent manner. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, SAerR is the predominant variant in stationary phase under dark semi-aerobic conditions. Its interaction with CrtJ promotes CrtJ mediated super repression of the <italic>bchEJGP, bchODI-crtA, crtIB</italic> and <italic>puc</italic> operons leading to reduced synthesis of the photosystem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While CrtJ is capable of repressing photosystem gene expression on its own, its repression without SAerR seems partial or weaker than when CrtJ is complexed with SAerR. Previous studies have shown that CrtJ cooperatively binds to target promoters at tandem CrtJ binding motifs (TGT-N<sub>12</sub>-ACA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ponnampalam and Bauer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ponnampalam et al., 1998</xref>). The CrtJ binding motifs are either located close together such as what occurs in the <italic>bchC</italic> promoter where they are 8 bp apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ponnampalam et al., 1998</xref>), or present at more distant locations 45 to 500 bp apart such as what occurs in the <italic>puc</italic>, <italic>bchEJGP, bchODI-crtA, and crtIB</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elsen et al., 1998</xref>). In this regard, it’s interesting that our RNA-seq results show that SAerR mediated enhancement of CrtJ repression is greater at promoters where CrtJ binding motifs are more distantly located than at the <italic>bchC</italic> promoter where CrtJ binding sites are only 8 bp apart.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39028.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of LAerR and SAerR function in controlling gene expression.</title><p>The results of this study, coupled with in vivo and in vitro DNA binding studies by Fang et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>), suggest that LAerR and SAerR are both capable of interacting with CrtJ. SAerR (red dot) complexed with Adenosyl- (Ado) or Methyl-cobalamin (Me:Cbl) is predominantly made under dark and/or stationary growth conditions. SAerR complexed with these biologically active cobalamin derivatives stimulates CrtJ (dark green) mediated photosystem repression. Under photosynthetic conditions, LAerR (light green dot) is the predominate form with this variant only binding hydroxyl cobalamin (OH-Cbl) that is generated via photolysis of Ado or methyl-cobalamin. LAerR bound with OH-Cbl interacts with CrtJ in a manner that promotes extensive interaction with target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>) activating gene expression.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39028-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>In stark contrast to the ability of SAerR to enhanced CrtJ’s ability to promote aerobic repression, our study also indicates that LAerR, which is the predominate isoform under photosynthetic conditions, switches CrtJ to an anaerobic photosynthetic activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). One clue to how this may occur is provided by previous in vitro and in vivo studies with LAerR which demonstrated that LAerR can dramatically affect CrtJ binding to the <italic>bchC</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). Specifically, it was observed that CrtJ alone only bound to the two tandem <italic>bchC</italic> CrtJ binding motifs. However when in the presence of LAerR, then CrtJ interacted with an extended region that spanned several hundred base pairs beyond the tandem CrtJ binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). We propose that LAerR mediated extension of CrtJ interaction to target promoters is likely responsible for switching CrtJ from an aerobic repressor to an anaerobic photosynthetic activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>LAerR and SAerR also have clear differences in cobalamin binding characteristics with LAerR only binding OH-Cbl in a light-dependent manner while SAerR can bind all tested biologically relevant forms of cobalamin irrespective of light exposure. This result indicates that His10, which is only present in LAerR, is responsible for providing cobalamine specificity. LAerR also likely has a predominant role under illuminated conditions which is the growth condition that will form OH-Cbl as a product of photolysis of the upper ligand in Cbl. Conversely, the ability of SAerR to bind all tested forms of Cbl lends to its dominant role under dark conditions.</p><p>Differing roles of the LAerR and SAerR isoforms is also evident from RNA-seq results which show that LAerR controls expression of many more cellular process (photosystem synthesis and the expression of numerous glycolysis genes involved in central metabolism) than does SAerR. In WT cells the high LAerR/SAerR ratio during exponential phase presumably enhances energy production and protein biosynthesis needed for fast cellular growth. Conversely, the low LAerR/SAerR ratio observed in cells entering stationary phase would lead to reduced synthesis of the photosystem and reduced glycolysis as these cells are not actively replicating and thus require less energy production.</p><p>Finally, while LAerR likely has a direct effect on gene expression by interacting with CrtJ it also likely has an indirect role in controlling gene expression. For example, as diagramed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, deletion of LAerR leads to reduced synthesis of genes involved in energy production as well as reduced expression of many ribosomal genes. Indeed, reduced expression of numerous ribosomal genes in the ∆LAerR strain is puzzling as ribosomal genes show no in vivo binding of CrtJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang and Bauer, 2017</xref>). One possible explanation is that the absence of LAerR in the ∆LAerR strain actually causes an energy limiting stringent like growth condition which is known to lead to reduced expression of ribosomal genes. Along this vein, the branch chain amino acid (BCAA) transporter genes (<italic>rcc03426-03433</italic>), that code for an importer of BCAA’s, were found to be highly directly downregulated in the AerR null and in the ∆LAerR strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, several BCAA were recently shown to stimulate the degradation of the cellular alarmone molecules (p)ppGpp which regulate the stringent response that is known to influence expression of ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang and Bauer, 2018</xref>). Another consequence of reduced synthesis of the photosystem by the ∆LAerR strain would be fewer electrons flowing from the photosystem to the quinone pool. Such an alteration in the redox state of ubiquinones would be sensed by the ubiquinone responding sensor kinase RegB leading to downstream alterations in global gene expression by RegA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu and Bauer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schindel and Bauer, 2016</xref>). This might be the reason why part of RegA regulon (chemotaxis and motility genes, bacterial microcompartment etc.) is also observed to be indirectly affected upon deletion of AerR.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>L and SAerR isoforms are also present in other photosynthetic bacteria</title><p>It is known that the AerR gene is present and linked to the CrtJ gene in all sequenced purple non-sulfur bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeulen and Bauer, 2015</xref>). The long isoform of AerR has also been isolated from numerous species and shown to bind cobalamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeulen and Bauer, 2015</xref>). In a previous study, AerR and CrtJ from <italic>Rhodospirillum centenum</italic> were also disrupted with resulting phenotypes indicating that AerR and/or CrtJ likely have dual functions for both activation and repression of photosystem gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>).

A study has also shown that AerR and AppA have opposing functions in regulating the activity of CrtJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeulen and Bauer, 2015</xref>) suggesting that this species may have replaced the short AerR isoform with a gene duplication event that gave rise to AppA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

To construct an N-terminal truncated AerR expression plasmid, Rc_aerR-insA-f (one nucleotide insertion after M1 codon), Rc_aerR_MNG-f (M35-AerR), Rc_aerR_MVE-f (M49-AerR), or Rc_aerR_MDL-f (M61-AerR) primers were used instead of Rc_aerR-f. Each point mutation was introduced into the pBBR-aerR-FLAG plasmid by PCR amplification using specific primer pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). For a reporter assay, FLAG-bchE fragment was amplified from pSRKGm-bchE plasmid with Flag-bchE-f and M13+ pBBR-MSC2-r and pBBR plasmid that included a partial aerR sequence. This was amplified with pBBR-MSC2-f and Rc_aerRA39/E40/L41-FbchE-r, respectively from the pBBR-aerR-FLAG plasmid. Then, these two fragments were connected using an In-Fusion kit (Clonetech), resulting pBBR-aerR_A39-FLAG-bchE, pBBR-aerR_E40-FLAG-bchE, and pBBR-aerR_L41-FLAG-bchE, respectively.

For in vitro analysis, pSUMO-AerR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>) was used to express LAerR isoform in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A 120 bp DNA sequence including M1 to E40 codons of <italic>aerR</italic> was removed from pSUMO-AerR plasmid to express the SAerR isoform.

Triplicate biological replicates (independent cell cultures grown under similar conditions at different times) were used for each RNA-Seq analysis for each described condition. Total RNA was extracted using ISOLATE II RNA Mini Kit (Bioline) followed by TURBO DNase (Ambion) treatment. The reaction mixture was cleaned and concentrated by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) and assayed for DNA contamination by PCR amplification on samples with or without reverse transcriptase treatment. Final RNA concentrations were measured using NanoDrop spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific). Further quality control was performed with a 2200 TapeStation using RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies). Library construction and RNA-sequencing were performed by the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics at Indiana University-Bloomington. Ribosomal RNA was depleted and libraries were created using a ScriptSeq Complete Kit (Illumina) for bacteria according to manufacturer’s protocol. Single-end sequencing reactions (&gt;75 × coverage) were performed on Illumina NextSeq sequencer with raw sequence read files deposited in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the accession number SRP136743.

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differing Isoforms of the Cobalamin Binding Photoreceptor AerR Oppositely Regulate Photosystem Expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz serving both as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alexander Mankin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The list of revisions is on the long end for <italic>eLife</italic> but the hope is that most will be quick to address.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper of Yamamoto et al. presents a finding that the aerR gene in the purple photosynthetic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> is translated from two start codons leading to the production of longer and shorter isoforms of the AerR protein (LAerR and SAerR, respectively). The isoforms are differentially expressed in cells grown under different conditions and differ in their ability to interact with cobalamine. They also differ in their effect on gene regulation, likely mediated by the transcriptional repressor CrtJ.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that the aerR gene is expressed from two start codons is the key finding of the study. These data need to be in the main text.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether switch in expression of the long vs. short forms of AerR is controlled at the level of transcription or translation. This would largely depend on whether both protein isoforms could be expressed from the long mRNA. The authors should address this by expressing long mRNA (prepared by in vitro transcription from a T7 promoter) on the bacterial (e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>) cell-free system (PUREsystem, NEB or cell extract based systems from Promega or Roche) and test whether one or two protein isoforms are generated. The reviewers understand that if the experiment shows that both proteins are made from the long in vitro transcript, this is a valuable information. If not, this may well be due to differences in translation between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> or the in vitro and in vivo situation.</p><p>3) The results of the RNAseq experiment need to be confirmed for some selected genes by another method. In case of the ΔAerR strain under dark conditions the changes are limited and restricted to certain functional groups. However, under phototrophic conditions change for &gt; 1500 genes is observed. This may be a real physiological response but it is important to exclude any artifacts, which may e.g. stem from calibration problems.</p><p>4) AerR-CrtJ binding may be influenced by different cobalamin derivatives. Thus, the experiment in Figure 5 should be done with different cobalamin derivatives; this should provide important information of how SAerR and LAerR differentially control CrtJ activity.</p><p>5) The authors should perform carotenoid determination in photosynthetically grown cells. Furthermore, such pigment analysis may need to be performed at different growth phases to test how LAerR levels influences pigmentation. The authors should also characterize the absorption spectra of membrane preparations of the mutants. Such data will provide useful information of how SAerR and LAerR differentially regulate puf and puc operons.</p><p>6) The authors should point out the spectral features of Abo-Cbl and OH-Cbl bound SAerR were actually different. This spectral change reflects difference of chromophore-protein interactions between Abo-Cbl and OH-Cbl bound SAerRs; thus the two protein isoforms are in different conformations. Biochemical analysis of AerR (e.g. as in Figure 5) needs to be done with, at least, the two isoforms.</p><p>7) Some results need further explanation/details:</p><p>- The authors indicate that 5'RACE showed two transcription initiation sites (Discussion, second paragraph and supplementary translation data), but the gel in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows only one PCR band. It is unclear which PCR product was sequenced to identify the second transcription start site.</p><p>- The authors suggest that differential translation is driven by differential transcription. Does their RNA-seq data show an increase in the aerR gene coverage after the second transcription start site.</p><p>- Figure 3 and 6: The details of the cell culture conditions were not provided: e.g. the cells were harvested at mid-log phase? Because the level of LAerR isoform is different in each growth phase (Figure 1), the information should be given.</p><p>- Figure 4: The observed growth delay for dLAerR and AerR-null mutants seems to result from low-pigmentation under aerobic conditions before starting the measurement (Figure 3A).</p><p>- The details of the experimental conditions for the AerR and CrtJ interaction (Figure 5) were not provided. For example, it is not clear whether the AerR used in the experiment was cobalamin-bound form or unbound form. Please provide such information. If the authors used cobalamin-bound form, what kind of cobalamin bound to the apo-AerR?</p><p>- The SAerR variant, which does no longer bind cobalamin due to point mutations, still has a strong phenotype (spectra and growth). It would be appropriate to comment on this instead of claiming only slight effects.</p><p>- It is possible that the AerR point mutations influences not only cobalamin-binding characteristics, but also stability/level of AerR in vivo. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>- LAerR, but not SAerR, expression level is changed in response to growth modes (Figure 1), and SAerR can bind both photo-activated and non-activated cobalamin although LAerR can bind only photo-activated one (Figure 7). Although the RNA seq gave some information about the functional differences of the two isoforms (Figure 9, 10), the biochemical properties of the two AerR isoforms is not clearly discussed in the manuscript. The manuscript would benefit from such discussion, with schematic models of the action of each AerR isoform and CrtJ.</p><p>8) Some text needs to be modified:</p><p>- It is sometimes hard to follow the story and to extract the important messages. The authors should make an effort for the text to be accessible to a wide audience.</p><p>- It is not clear from the Abstract why photosynthetic bacteria control photosystem synthesis. What is the meaning of the first sentence of the Abstract? What do the authors mean by &quot;adjusts their physiology for optimal light absorption&quot;?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the Introduction, the authors briefly mention that photosystems can generate oxidative stress, and that photosystem production must also be controlled to avoid oxidative stress. The important function of photoreceptors to monitor conditions, which may cause photooxidative stress and to trigger the crucial adaptation process to these conditions is not really considered in other parts of the paper.</p><p>- The discussion of the IF3 function (Discussion, second paragraph) is inaccurate. IF3 is not 'involved in translation from non-canonical initiation codons' and it does not 'increase initiation from non-canonical codons'. Instead, IF3 discriminates against the non-canonical initiation codons.</p><p>- The discussion of the hibernation factors and formation of the 100S ribosomes in the stationary phase seem irrelevant for their findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39028.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that the aerR gene is expressed from two start codons is the key finding of the study.

Western blot analysis shows that only the full-length long isoform is produced. This result would be no different than what would be observed in a cell free system. Note also that <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> has a very high GC content so its native -10 promoter recognition sequences are quite different than that of typical <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters. Consequently, its highly likely that <italic>E. coli</italic> polymerase does not recognize these two R. capsulatus AerR promoters.</p><p>That said, we do provide evidence that both transcription and translation contributed to the control of LAerR vs. SAerR. For example, we have observed that we can significantly increase SAerR protein levels by just mutating its start codon CTG to a silent Leu TTG (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), this is an evidence that translation initiation indeed plays an role in controlling SAerR levels. We also showed that a truncation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) construct without the promoter for the short transcript still produced both LAerR and SAerR, indicating that a single long transcript is capable of synthesizing both isoforms (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results of the RNAseq experiment need to be confirmed for some selected genes by another method.

Note that our laboratory has a lengthy publication record with numerous studies that analyzed global expression changes via RNA-seq (1-6). In all of our RNA-seq studies we validate our results using qPCR with a variety of select target genes. We also note that observed changes in carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll levels also faithfully mirrors changes that we see in RNA transcript reads that we obtain via RNA-seq. Consequently, we are highly confident of the transcription values obtained via our in house RNA-seq analysis pipeline. In addition, previously published ChIP-seq data showing colocalization of CrtJ and AerR to operons that are highly regulated by these regulators also correlates well with the RNA-seq data reported in this study. This latter confirmation is shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><p>1) Dong, Q., and C. E.
