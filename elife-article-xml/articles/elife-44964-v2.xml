Selective targeting of distinct mossy fibers determines how the cerebellum processes vestibular signals. We focused on vestibular projections to ON and OFF classes of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), which transform single mossy fiber signals into long-lasting excitation or inhibition respectively, and impact the activity of ensembles of granule cells. To determine whether these contacts are indeed selective, connectivity was traced back from UBC to specific ganglion cell, hair cell and vestibular organ subtypes in mice. We show that a specialized subset of primary afferents contacts ON UBCs, but not OFF UBCs, while secondary afferents contact both subtypes. Striking anatomical differences were observed between primary and secondary afferents, their synapses, and the UBCs they contact. Thus, each class of UBC functions to transform specific signals through distinct anatomical pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44964.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>While out jogging, you have no trouble keeping your eyes fixed on objects in the distance even though your head and eyes are moving with every step. Humans owe this stability of the visual world partly to a region of the brain called the vestibular cerebellum. From its position underneath the rest of the brain, the vestibular cerebellum detects head motion and then triggers compensatory movements to stabilize the head, body and eyes.</p><p>The vestibular cerebellum receives sensory input from the body via direct and indirect routes. The direct input comes from five structures within the inner ear, each of which detects movement of the head in one particular direction. The indirect input travels to the cerebellum via the brainstem, which connects the brain with the spinal cord. The indirect input contains information on head movements in multiple directions combined with input from other senses such as vision.</p><p>By studying the mouse brain, Balmer and Trussell have now mapped the direct and indirect circuits that carry sensory information to the vestibular cerebellum. Both types of input activate cells within the vestibular cerebellum called unipolar brush cells (UBCs). There are two types of UBCs: ON and OFF. Direct sensory input from the inner ear activates only ON UBCs. These cells respond to the arrival of sensory input by increasing their activity. Indirect input from the brainstem activates both ON UBCs and OFF UBCs. The latter respond to the input by decreasing their activity.</p><p>The vestibular cerebellum thus processes direct and indirect inputs via segregated pathways containing different types of UBCs. The next step in understanding how the cerebellum maintains a stable visual world is to identify the circuitry beyond the UBCs. Understanding these circuits will ultimately provide insights into balance disorders, such as vertigo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>mossy fiber</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd><kwd>unipolar brush cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC014878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 DC016905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balmer</surname><given-names>Timothy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS028901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct inputs to the cerebellum make contact on specific subtypes of target neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cerebellum, mossy fibers convey multimodal signals from diverse regions of the central nervous system to the granule cell layer. âExpansion recodingâ theories of cerebellar processing require these mossy fiber inputs to diverge to hundreds of granule cells, and their signals are integrated first by granule cell dendrites and then by the massive dendritic trees of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>). However, mossy fiber inputs to vestibular cerebellum differ from those of other cerebellar lobes in receiving mossy fibers directly from peripheral ganglion neurons (the primary vestibular afferents), as well as from brainstem nuclei (secondary afferents). Each of the primary afferents carries signals from a single vestibular organ, with each organ coding head position or velocity in a given plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 1988</xref>). Maintaining separate mossy fiber signals from specific end organ sources in âlabeled linesâ could allow segregated ensembles of granule cells to faithfully encode head movements along specific planes. Alternatively or additionally, specific sources might undergo selective amplification by local circuitry to enhance their representation to downstream neurons. However, such mechanisms are not consistent with the general view of cerebellar function that diverse mossy fibers are simply integrated by individual granule cells, and differ primarily by short term plasticity at the granule cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), necessitating an examination of mossy fiber innervation of the vestibular cerebellum.</p><p>We investigated this problem by tracing vestibular cerebellar mossy fibers back to their primary and secondary sources, and forward to target neurons in the cerebellum, focusing on unipolar brush cells (UBCs), because they form a processing layer prior to the well-studied granule cells. UBCs are excitatory interneurons within the granule cell layer that receive a single mossy fiber ending on their brush-like dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mugnaini and Floris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>). Instead of integrating multiple inputs as granule cells do, this large synaptic contact dramatically transforms activity of one mossy fiber before projecting to hundreds of granule cells and other UBCs. In vestibular processing areas of rodent cerebellum, UBCs are present in exceptionally high density and could coordinate ensembles of granule cells to respond to single directions of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Floris et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>This problem is deepened by the diversity of UBCs. Two subtypes of UBC have been described: ON UBCs respond to mossy fiber input with a prolonged depolarization and enhancement of firing while OFF UBCs are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). Both responses last for hundreds of milliseconds, an outcome of selective receptor expression in the two subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>)Â combined with the great size the mossy fiber-UBC synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugnaini et al., 1994</xref>). Given this potent circuit element, it is critical to determine which vestibular organs map directly to cerebellum and which UBC subtypes they contact to understand vestibular representation. For example, if both subtypes receive common sensory input, then the ON/OFF distinction in UBCs would allow mossy signals to diverge, setting up distinct processing pathways within the granule cell layer, such that the OFF pathway could be a negative image of the vestibular motion. On the other hand, if each subtype receives mossy fiber input that conveys a distinct vestibular modality, then ON and OFF UBCs would mediate modality-specific transformations of extrinsic inputs. Here we show that in cerebellar lobe X of mouse, the primary representation is from a subset of angular acceleration coding neurons, and these signals reach and are amplified by ON UBCs, but not OFF UBCs. OFF UBCs by contrast only process secondary afferent signals that may contain signals integrated over multiple directions of movement, hemispheres and/or modalities. We also show that primary and secondary inputs exhibit dramatic differences in their axonal and synaptic morphology, as well as in the morphology of the UBCs they contact, which may further refine coding in the granule cell layer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary vestibular afferents in the Glt25d2 mouse line</title><p>Vestibular hair cells detect head acceleration, velocity, and gravity, and convey these signals to vestibular ganglion (VG) neurons; within each vestibular end organ, there are two subtypes of hair cell and at least three subtypes of VG cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>).

In cerebellar lobes IX and X, these afferents appeared as mossy fibers, and were most likely primary (first-order) from the VG, and not those from brainstem vestibular nuclei or nucleus prepositus hypoglossi that also project to cerebellum, because no somata lying in these areas expressed Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Note that we could not be confident we imaged every VG neuron because dissection of the complete VG complex was not always possible.</p><p>In two Glt25d2 mice, histological analysis of the injection site revealed numerous GFP-labeled primary afferents in lobe X and very few in lobe IX. In these experiments, all five end organs and VG ipsilateral to the injection site were successfully processed. The afferents in the end organs were almost exclusively dimorphic, having calyx endings surrounding hair cells with extending processes ending in boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâH</xref>). No pure-calyx endings and only one bouton-only ending was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

As expected, only a few afferents in the end organs contralateral to the injection were retrolabeled, likely due to virus that diffused across the cerebellar midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korte and Mugnaini, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Another injection labeled numerous afferents projecting to the ventral leaflet of lobe IX in addition to lobe X.

Despite many more afferents labeled, none expressed calretinin and were therefore also exclusively not pure-calyx endings (0 of 729 calyces, one mouse, five end organs). The result that many more afferents were labeled in the otolith organs is consistent with more otolith afferents targeting lobe IX than lobe X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maklad and Fritzsch, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In sum, in the Glt25d2 mouse line the source of Cre+Â primary vestibular afferents that project to lobe X are mostly dimorphic afferents in the ipsilateral semicircular canals and extrastriolar regions of the sacculus, and are therefore likely to predominantly convey information about angular acceleration of the head. To investigate all the primary vestibular projections to cerebellum, injections were made using a non-Cre-dependent retrograde virus (AAV2-retro-CAG-GFP) targeting lobe X.

VG ipsilateral to the site of injection had many retrogradely labeled somata, including 2.7% that were calretinin-positive (34/1486, nÂ =Â 3 VG in separate experiments). The majority of calretinin positive cells were not retrolabeled (91%, 343/377). Examples of central/striolar pure-calyx afferents that were retrolabeled were found in all five end organs, although they were rare, numbering only a few per end organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). This provides evidence that some pure-calyx afferents may project to cerebellum, but we cannot determine whether they project to lobe X, lobe IX or cerebellar nuclei, as all regions were infected. In comparison to the Cre-dependent virus, this viral injection labeled many more afferents in all the end organs, but especially in the otolith organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2GâH</xref>). In this experiment many peripheral afferents in the lateral utricle were labeled, consistent with the report that hair cell polarity relates to afferent projection pattern, with afferents innervating lateral utricle projecting to cerebellum and medial utricle projecting to vestibular nucleiÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of the afferents appeared to be dimorphic and were too dense/numerous to count accurately.

The chances of finding a UBC that happened to be contacted by a nearby labeled fiber was low. However, of 107 UBCs recorded in brain slices from 22 mice, all 13 UBCs that responded to optogenetic activation of primary afferents were ON UBCs. The response to ChR2 stimulation of primary afferents was remarkably similar to responses evoked by electrical stimulation of white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, primary afferents preferentially target ON UBCs and we found no evidence for primary projections to OFF UBCs.</p><p>Recorded cells were filled with biocytin for post hoc imaging during whole-cell recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâF</xref>). Biocytin fills confirmed the UBC morphology of the recorded cells and allowed visualization of the contacts between presynaptic EYFP-labeled mossy fiber axon and biocytin filled postsynaptic brush in six experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This approach provided views of the complex morphology of these synaptic interfaces. 3D renderings were made in order to estimate the surface area of the brush and the area of the brush that contacted the mossy fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3GâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

The area of the UBC brush itself was 446.68Â Â±Â 86.35 Âµm<sup>2</sup> (meanÂ Â±Â SD), and thus nearly a quarter of the dendrite was available for synaptic contact.

The slow EPSC amplitudes that occur at the offset of stimulation and decay times did not correlate with the contact area between the mossy fiber and UBC or the brush area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

To quantify the proportion of UBCs that receive input from these primary vestibular afferents a systematic random sampling approach was taken that ensured all of the granule cell layer of lobe X had an equal probability of being sampled (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Overall 145 mGluR1-expressing UBCs were counted, 29 of which received primary afferent input (20%).

To label VG neurons that do not express Cre in the Glt25d2 line, we injected GFP or tdTomato-expressing viruses with different serotypes (AAV9, AAV2-retro, AAV-PHP.S) in the posterior semicircular canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This viral approach infected populations of VG neurons of various sizes presumed to be a different population than those that express Cre in the Glt25d2 mouse line and was therefore a complimentary approach to label diverse VG neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâE</xref>).

They seldom branched as they projected along the white matter in the sagittal plane. The morphology of these primary afferents is compared directly with secondary afferents below.

Indeed, some UBCs that received direct primary afferents had ChR2-evoked fast disynaptic inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs) in addition to monosynaptic EPSCs. In many cases, activation of primary afferents evoked IPSCs alone in UBCs and granule cells, without a typical ON or OFF synaptic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The onset of these IPSCs occurred at a delay consistent with disynaptic inhibition in all cases (5.74Â Â±Â 1.42 ms (meanÂ Â±Â SD), nÂ =Â 23). In most of these UBCs some component of the IPSC was blocked by GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist SR-95531 and the remaining current was blocked by glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).

The UBCs that received secondary afferent input had larger dendritic brushes than UBCs that received primary input.

Secondary-receiving UBCs were more likely to contact a spherically shaped rosette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Measurements of the contact area between afferent and UBC, indicated that the area between primary afferents and UBCs was smaller than the contact area between secondary afferents and UBCs, likely due to the more complex rosettes made by secondary afferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Even the dendritic brush (including non-synaptic membrane) of secondary-receiving UBCs was larger in area and volume than the brushes of primary-receiving UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These differences were not due to OFF UBCs being larger than ON UBCs, because the secondary-afferent receiving ON UBCs were similar in size to the secondary-receiving OFF UBCs. The contact area between the brush and mossy fiber relative to the entire surface area of the brush was similar between primary and secondary-receiving UBCs (t-test, p=0.180, nÂ =Â 17).Â This suggests that the postsynaptic brush develops in such a way to match the anatomy of the earlier maturing mossy fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwell and Zhang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SekerkovÃ¡ et al., 2004</xref>).

Both currents were mediated by AMPARs, as they were blocked by GYKI.

At higher electrical stimulation intensity a generic ON UBC response appeared, but it could not be evoked by ChR2 stimulation. This may have been due to low ChR2 expression in the mossy fiber. In 3 UBCs with the build-up response to ChR2 stimulation, further electrical stimulation evoked an ON response. In no case did electrical stimulation evoke an OFF UBC response, and thus it may be that axosomatic synapses are only made onto ON UBCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The vestibular cerebellum is unique in its high density of UBCs, suggesting a cerebellar processing function of UBCs specific to the vestibular system. UBCs fall into two classes, ON and OFF, based on their response to mossy fiber input. This study demonstrates that different cerebellar input pathways differentially recruit these response classes based on extraordinary specificity of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Although ON and OFF cells are co-distributed in lobe X, primary afferents project to ON UBCs exclusively. These primary afferents specifically are the fibers of VG neurons whose peripheral endings are largely in the semicircular canals, and make both calyx and bouton endings (dimorphic VG fibers). Secondary afferents from MV contact OFF UBCs as well as ON UBCs. UBCs targeted by the primary vs secondary afferents also differed in synaptic and dendritic morphology, and even soma size. Finally, a build-up form of excitatory UBC response appeared to be due to synaptic contact between the mossy fiber and the postsynaptic soma. Thus, the specificity of vestibular projection includes not just the originating vestibular organ, but subtypes of VG and UBC cells, with corresponding anatomical and physiological refinements.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44964.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of results.</title><p>Vestibular ganglion (VG) neurons having dimorphic peripheral endings that receive input from Type I and II hair cells project their primary afferents directly to ON UBCs in lobe X of cerebellum, and do not target OFF UBCs. These primary afferents also project to granule cells as well as inhibitory interneurons (Golgi cells) that provide feed-forward inhibition to ON UBCs (not shown). This direct projection to cerebellum may coordinate ensembles of granule cell activities in a âlabeled lineâ representing acceleration or velocity of the head in a single direction. Secondary mossy fibers arising from neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (MV) project to both OFF and ON UBCs. MV neurons receive input from calretinin-expressing (CR+) VG neurons that make pure-calyx dendritic endings around Type I hair cells, in addition to dimorphic primary afferents. The signals carried by secondary afferents are integrated across vestibular end organs and processed by the local MV circuit. Thus, distinct anatomical pathways that vary in the convergence of inputs, level of processing and axon morphology target distinct UBC classes to transform specific sensory signals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44964-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>UBCs as an input layer preceding granule cells</title><p>Purkinje cells are considered the site of multimodal integration in the cerebellum, due to their enormous number of granule cell inputs. Recent studies have highlighted the integrative aspects of cells in the granule cell layer as well. Granule cells have multiple dendrites, allowing them to receive signals from multiple modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knogler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell, 2010</xref>). By contrast, UBCs receive only a single mossy fiber input to their dendritic brush and therefore do not integrate multiple modalities, instead maintaining the activities of ensembles of postsynaptic granule cells segregated in a âlabeled lineâ. Such an arrangement may be of particular advantage in cerebellar vestibular processing vs other cerebellar modalities. The typical pattern of integration by granule cells could disrupt vestibular processing by mixing inputs from the five vestibular end organs (per ear) that sense head movements in different directions. Instead, UBCs could act as an input layer prior to the granule cells to allow divergence to parallel ensembles of postsynaptic granule cells that each faithfully represent head movement along the axes of different end organs. Convergence must occur at some point to integrate signals from the canals and otoliths, which is necessary to estimate orientation relative to gravity, and this may happen at the granule cell and/or Purkinje cell level. Alternatively, or in addition, convergence occurring in the MV could be processed specifically by UBCs that receive secondary input. Further experiments are necessary to explore whether primary and secondary pathways target distinct populations of granule cells, either through UBCs or directly, and whether the primary and secondary-receiving granule cells vary in physiological response or morphology, as do UBCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Secondary mossy fibers from MV relay integrated signals to UBCs</title><p>MV neurons receive multiple primary afferent inputs, feedback inhibition from Purkinje cells, and can be inhibited by stimulation of the contralateral vestibular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimazu and Precht, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchino et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, secondary vestibular mossy fibers may carry signals integrated from multiple end organs and both hemispheres to both ON and OFF UBCs. This is a strikingly different pattern of connectivity than the ON UBCs that receive primary afferent input from a cluster of hair cells in a single end organ and a single VG subtype. OFF UBCs do not appear to receive input from primary afferents at all, and may therefore only process signals that have been integrated by MV. This circuitry indicates that OFF UBCs process bilateral vestibular signals to pause input to ensembles of granule cells, perhaps in a push-pull circuit that could contribute to reflexive eye movements.</p><p>The rate of input to secondary afferent-receiving UBCs may be preserved by MV neurons, which are known to respond to synaptic input with high-fidelity EPSCs whose amplitudes are rate-invariant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McElvain et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, granule cells respond faithfully to mossy fiber input in vivo, responding to a burst of mossy fiber input with a burst of action potentials that is similar in duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>). It is at UBCs where profound signal processing occurs through highly rate-dependent EPSC amplitudes and long duration responses that may even be inverted by OFF UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). This extended response could be particularly important in the cerebellum. A longer duration burst of action potentials conveyed to the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse will be more likely to drive the Purkinje cell because of facilitation at this synapse and would extend the window of integration within which climbing fiber activity can influence circuit learning.</p><p>At the level of the vestibular granule cell, it is likely that a single neuron integrates both primary and secondary inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>) but also intrinsic mossy fiber input from UBCs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>) emphasized that mossy fibers from different sources may exhibit different forms of short-term plasticity, and these characteristic time-dependent responses impact the integrative function of the granule cell. Given the radical transformation of mossy fiber input by UBCs, which results in prolonged or delayed firing, or cessation in activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>), granule cells that receive some dendritic input from a UBCâsÂ intrinsic mossy fiber likely will be dominated by that input while the UBC is active. However, paired recordings between presynaptic UBCs and postsynaptic granule cells will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Additionally, whether a single granule cell integrates input from multiple UBCs carrying primary and secondary signals will be an important next step to understanding the integration that occurs in vestibular cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Primary and secondary vestibular afferents have distinct morphologies in cerebellum</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodal and Drablos (1963)</xref> suggested that vestibular lobes of rat cerebellum contain a population of mossy fibers that differ from those of other lobes.

(1995)</xref>. Differences in morphology between mossy fibers based on their source have been reported in non-vestibular lobes of the cerebellum. Mossy fibers projecting from the deep cerebellar nuclei are larger, are more likely to have filipodia projecting from the rosette, and have more boutons, than those projecting from basal pontine nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmer and Person, 2017</xref>). While mossy fibers originating from different regions that project to lobe X vary in presynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>), we find that these axons also exhibit characteristic morphological features that may support differences in electrical activity level. Primary afferents were quite thick, projected along the white matter of lobe X, and only rarely branched. It is perhaps not surprising that the primary vestibular afferents in the cerebellum are large given that their diameter in the vestibular nerve is among the thickest in the brain (mean,Â ~3 Âµm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gacek and Rasmussen, 1961</xref>); notably, these also have elevated tonic firing rates ofÂ &gt;100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). The relatively thin diameter of the secondary afferents suggests lower firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perge et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, vestibular nucleus neurons that respond to vestibular stimulation in vivo have spontaneous firing rates between 0 and 30 Hz in cats andÂ ~65 Hz in squirrel monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cullen and McCrea, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimazu and Precht, 1965</xref>).

These EPSCs occurred atÂ ~13 Hz under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>), much lower than vestibular nerve fibers.</p><p>Some UBCs that were postsynaptic to primary afferents had their dendritic brush wrapping around smooth parts of the axon, providing anatomical evidence that synapses may exist along the length of the axon in addition to the terminal swellings. This is corroborated by the finding that smooth parts of the primary afferent contacting a UBC soma could evoke EPSCs. Such differences in <italic>en passant</italic> mossy terminal morphology might affect efficiency of propagating action potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Atypical synaptic input to UBCs</title><p>In build-up responses, contacts are made directly to the UBC soma, clearly out of reach of the dendrite. Previous descriptions of build-up responses in UBCs speculated that such responses might arise from misalignment of a mossy fiber active zone relative to anÂ AMPAR cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, the observation that build-up EPSCs occur specifically when mossy fibers appear to contact UBC somas demonstrates a novel basis for these synaptic currents. This conclusion depended upon recovering many filled cells after optogenetically stimulating labeled mossy fibers. Apparently, UBC somata express some AMPA receptors sufficient to respond to somatic inputs. Indeed, outside-out patch-clamp recording has previously shown that AMPARs do function in somatic membranes of UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>). Previous analysis of electron micrographs highlighted mossy fiber terminals that contacted Golgi cell somata, forming large convoluted â<italic>en marron</italic>â synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan-Palay and Palay, 1971</xref>), which are distinct from the club-like endings contacting UBCs. Mossy fibers touching granule cell somata have also been observed, although these same mossy fibers only made definitive synaptic contacts with nearby granule cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</xref>). The fortuitous observation of somatic contacts by mossy fibers that were associated with distinct postsynaptic responses suggests that somatic inputs could represent a previously unappreciated form of transmission in the granule region of the cerebellum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Tg(Colgalt2-cre)NF107Gsat/Mmucd</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Chip Gerfen (NIH) <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20023653">20023653</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2138232">MGI:2138232</ext-link></td><td>Referred to as Glt25d2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.TgN(grm2-IL2RA/GFP)1kyo</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Robert Duvoisin (OHSU) <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9778244">9778244</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">RBRC: RBRC01194</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai9(RCL-tdT)</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446880">22446880</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007909">IMSR_JAX:007909</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai32(RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP)</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446880">22446880</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:024109">IMSR_JAX:024109</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Cg-Et(tTA/mCitrine)TCGOSbn</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Adam Hantman (Janelia Farm) <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999799">26999799</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Chicken polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td valign="bottom">Aves Labs</td><td valign="bottom">Cat #

Images were processed in Zen Black or transferred to Imaris (Bitplane), a multidimentional analysis program based on fluorescence intensity data. Surfaces were created on the channels that contained the UBC and mossy fiber fluorescence to isolate the structure and extract the area and volume statistics and the 3D reconstructions. A surface calculation that is part of the Imaris software was used to create a one voxel thick contact layer between the UBC and mossy fiber surfaces and the contact area was calculated. To test the ability to measure surface areas and volumes accurately, fluorescent microspheres (Spherotech, FP4060-2) were imaged following the same procedures used for biocytin filled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To count UBCs innervated by primary or secondary mossy fibers, sagittal sections from Glt25d2::tdTomato mice or wild type mice that received MV injections (identical to those made for physiology experiments) were labeled with anti-DsRed, anti-mGluR1a and anti-calretinin as above. Hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the injection were separated by a cut down the midline. Every third 50 Âµm thick section was histologically labeled. Sections were sampled using a pseudorandom, systematic sampling scheme throughout the mediolateral extent of lobe X. Two fields per section were counted at a random location within the granule cell layer of lobe X. This sampling scheme ensured that every part of the granule cell layer of lobe X had an equal probability of being sampled. Counting was done on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using a 63 Ã 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. A 50 Âµm x 50 Âµm unbiased counting frame was used in which UBC somata touching two of the edges were omitted and somata touching the other two edges were included. Calretinin+Â or mGluR1+Â UBCs were first identified through the depth of the slice. Then whether tdTomato+Â mossy fibers innervated the brush of each UBC was noted. UBCs were only counted when both the brush and the soma were apparent, in order to avoid counting calretinin+Â or mGluR1+Â mossy fibers that often look similar to UBC brushes. Counts of both UBC types in the same fields ensured the ratios of UBC types would not be affected by their known differential distribution in dorsal vs ventral leaflets of lobe X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nunzi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In the experiment that used semicircular canal injections to label VG neurons, sections were prepared as above, with anti-GFP, anti-mGluR1a and anti-calretinin. The labeled afferents were more sparse than in Glt25d2, so every labeled terminal swelling was imaged along with mGluR1 and calretinin. Contacts between these virally-labeled primary afferents and mGluR1 or calretinin-expressing UBC brushes were counted in sections throughout lobe X, ipsilateral to the injected inner ear.</p><p>To measure primary afferent diameter, sections of lobe X from Glt25d2::ChR2-EYFP amplified with an anti-GFP antibody were imaged. To measure secondary afferent diameter, sections of lobe X from mice injected with AAV1-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry and amplified with an anti-DsRed or anti-mCherry antibody. Images were captured on a confocal microscope using 63 Ã 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Axon diametersÂ &gt;Â 10 Âµm from mossy fiber terminal rosettes were measured using ImageJ. 4â8 spans across the axon were measured atÂ ~5 Âµm intervals and the average was taken as the diameter. Post hoc imaging of axons that projected to biocytin filled UBCs from acute slice experiments were measured in the same way. One secondary afferent that projected to a recorded ON UBC was omitted because its 2.2 Âµm diameter wasÂ &gt;5 SD above the mean diameter (0.8 Âµm) of secondary afferents and larger than any measured primary afferent. This afferent may be from a cell type present in low number in the MV, but more work is needed to identify the origin of such fibers.</p><p>To count peripheral vestibular afferents, whole mounted end organs were imaged using aÂ Zeiss LSM 880 with fast Airyscan super-resolution and 25 Ã 0.8 NA oil immersion objective. Images were counted using ImageJ and the Cell Counter plugin. Dimorphic calyces counted when they had (1) a 3-dimentional calyx shape (2) at least one bouton process and (3) a labeled axon extending from its base. Calretinin staining clearly labeled pure-calyx afferents that are also distinguishable from their wider opening at the top. These counts are likely underestimates for the total number of retrolabeled afferents, due to tissue damage and inadequate fluorescence. More bouton-only endings may be present because they may be interpreted as being boutons extending from neighboring dimorphs. Afferent fibers were counted 10â50 Âµm distal to the base of the hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acute brain slice preparation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated.

In slices from mGluR2-GFP mice UBCs were identified by their GFP fluorescence. In slices from Glt25d2 mice UBCs were identified by their soma diameterÂ ~10 Î¼m in the granular cell layer in lobe X. All cells recorded were filled with 1 Î¼M Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide sodium salt (A10438, Molecular Probes) in order to confirm UBC or granule cell morphology. Pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (1.2 mm OD, WPI) to a tip resistance of 5â8 MÎ©. The internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 113 K-gluconate, 9 HEPES, 4.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GFP, with osmolality adjusted toÂ ~290 mOsm with sucrose and pH adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. In some experiments 0.1â0.5% biocytin (B1592, Molecular Probes) was added to the pipette solution. Reported voltages are corrected for a â10 mV liquid junction potential. Whole-cell recordings were amplified (10X), low-pass filtered (10 kHz Bessel, Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices) and digitized using pClamp software (20â50 kHz, Digidata 1550, Molecular Devices). Further digital filtering was performed offline, in most cases a 1 kHz low-pass Bessel 8-pole filter was applied. Series resistance was compensated with correction 20â40% and prediction 60â70%, bandwidth 2 kHz. Cells were voltage-clamped at â70 mV. Mossy fibers were stimulated extracellularly by applying voltage pulses (1â50 V, 100â250 Âµs) using a stimulus generator (Master 8, A.M.P.I.) via a concentric bipolar electrode (CBBPC75, FHC). ChR2 was activated using full-field blue LED light flashes (Lambda TLED+, Sutter) through a GFP filter set.</p><p>In some cases, a low concentration (50 ÂµM) of the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) was used to increase the reliability of ChR2-evoked transmitter release, presumably by lowering spike threshold. These cases are indicated in figure legends. Bath application of 4-AP increased the peak EPSC, increased synaptic depression and slowed the decay of the EPSC, but did not change the ON or OFF UBC response type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Additionally, OFF UBCs were recorded in these slices with electrical stimulation of the white matter and in the presence of 4-AP, indicating that OFF UBCs were present in these transgenic animals and that 4-AP did not block the inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels that mediate the OFF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Viral injections</title><p>Viral injections were made into the medial vestibular nucleus in P21-25 mGluR2-GFP mice using a stereotax (David Kopf) single axis manipulator (MO-10, Narishige) and pipette vice (Ronal) under isoflurane anesthesia. Glass capillaries (WireTrol II, Drummond Scientific) were pulled on a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter), beveled at aÂ ~45 degree angle with a 20â30 Î¼m inside diameter using a diamond lapping disc (0.5 Âµm grit, 3M DLF4XN_5661X) The scalp was cut and a small hole was drilled in the skull. The pipette was lowered into the brain atÂ ~10 Âµm / s. Five-min periods before and after injection were allowed. 20â50 nl of virus was injected using stereotaxic coordinates 6.1 mm caudal, 0.8 mm lateral to bregma and 3.75 mm ventral to the surface of the brain. AAV1-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry (2.92E12 GC/ml) virus from the University of Pennsylvania vector core was injected into MV to label and express ChR2 in secondary mossy fibers. AAV2-retro-CAG-Flex-GFP (9.86E12 GC/ml) or AAV2-retro-CAG-GFP (1.0E13 GC/ml) (Janelia Farm) was injected into lobe X of adult Glt25d2 mice (&gt;12 weeks) using stereotaxic coordinates 7.2 mm caudal, 0.5 mm lateral to bregma and 3.0 mm ventral to the surface of the brain. 200â400 nl of virus was used. Experiments were done 2â3 weeks after virus injection.</p><p>Semicircular canal injection was done following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al. (2017)</xref> using AAV2-retro-CAG-GFP (1.0E13 GC/ml,Â Janelia Farm), AAV2-retro-CAG-tdTomato (7.0E12 GC/ml, Addgene) or AAV-PHP.S-CAG-tdTomato (1.7E13, Addgene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2017</xref>), AAV9-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry (2.96E12 GC/ml, University of Pennsylvania) under isoflurane anesthesia. Briefly, a small hole was bored into the posterior semicircular canal using a 27 ga needle. After a 5-min period to allow the fluid leakage to slow, an injection pipette fused to PE10 tubing followed by polyimide tubing (0.0039â ID, 0.0049â OD) was inserted into the hole and secured in place with muscle and tissue adhesive (Vetbond). 2 Âµl volume of the virus was injected at 100 nl/min. After 5 min, the tube was removed, the hole was plugged with muscle and sealed with tissue adhesive. Mice were perfused two weeks later.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Sacha Nelson and Adam Hantman for the TCGO mice, Adam Hantman and

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vatsala Thirumalai as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Fabrice Ango.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrate remarkable specificity in connections from vestibular afferents to cerebellar uniploar brush cells (UBCs), representing parallel information streams. Using genetics, tract tracing, super-resolution microscopy and patch clamp recordings, they show that primary afferents from the vestibular end organs target ON UBCs while secondary projections from the vestibular nucleus contact both ON and OFF UBCs. Thus, their data suggest that distinct circuits are used to convey modality-specific information. The manuscript is written clearly and the figures are beautiful! Overall, this is an impressive piece of work and, it contributes largely to our understanding of the vestibulocerebellar circuit organization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A few improvements could be made, detailed below:</p><p>1) The authors use a Cre line in several experiments, Glt25d2-Cre that could be better characterized for the reader. The authors note that Cre-driven reporter expression is present in the somata of vestibular ganglia but not vestibular nuclei, but no mention is made of whether Cre expression is seen elsewhere in the brainstem or spinal cord where it could form other sources of mossy fibers. The experiments in which AAV-ChR2 is expressed directly in the VG mitigate some concerns associated with whether the main result of selective UBC innervation will hold, but it is still important for the authors to address more comprehensively the expression pattern of GLt25d2 if the crossed ChR2-reporter mice are used for physiological analysis to assess whether any other precerebellar structures possess somatic label. (i.e. Figure 3).</p><p>2) Figure 1: a better characterization of pure bouton single-end organs with anti-peripherin antibody can be performed to discriminate between dimorphic and pure bouton endings (A. Lysakowski et al., 1999). The authors do not detect pure Calyx ending with Glt25d2-Cre line using AAV virus but in Figure 1 Glt25d2::tdTomato colocalized with calretinin in VG. How do the authors interpret this discrepanciy? -The authors suggest somatic synapses on UBC, will it be possible to show post-synaptic receptors labeling on mGluR1 + UBC soma to strengthen the hypothesis?</p><p>3) The authors argue that primary afferent input to ON UBCs conveys angular acceleration information based on their innervation of the semi-circular canal hair cells and not the otoliths. But this seems to be true only in the Glt25d2 Cre line and not when retrograde viral tracers were injected into lobe X (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). In this case, several afferents were labeled in the otoliths also. We suggest that the authors address this point in the manuscript or soften the statement made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44964.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A few improvements could be made, detailed below:</p><p>1) The authors use a Cre line in several experiments, Glt25d2-Cre that could be better characterized for the reader.

The figure has been modified to include additional micrographs showing vestibular nuclei and NpH more clearly (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: a better characterization of pure bouton single-end organs with anti-peripherin antibody can be performed to discriminate between dimorphic and pure bouton endings (A.

Moreover, the low number of bouton-only afferents would make an experiment such as this difficult due to the low probability of infecting them with a virus. We agree that identifying the projections of peripherin expressing VG neurons is of interest. The experiment we would like to do and would be more likely to work would be characterizing the projections in a peripherin-cre mouse line, which have been made, but are not easily available. Thus, this experiment is unfortunately beyond the scope of the current project.</p><p>We interpret the lack of pure-calyx endings retrolabeled in the Glt25d2 line as a lack of projections of these afferents to lobe X. This agrees with several observations made in this paper. Central regions of the end organs where the pure-calyx endings are numerous did not appear to project to lobe X. The primary afferents in cerebellum labeled in the Glt25d2::tdTomato reporter cross were not immunoreactive for calretinin. Not shown in the manuscript is the observation that in a calretinin-cre (Calb2tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Zjh) crossed to a reporter no primary afferents are apparent in the cerebellum, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44964-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Many granule cells and UBCs are labeled and the UBCs mossy fibers can be seen in some cases. By comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> with Figure 1B, we suggest that the primary afferents are not labeled with this calretinin-reporter approach. This mouse line approach is complimentary to immunostaining, because the cells that express calretinin will be labeled throughout, whether or not calretinin protein is present in the afferent.</p><p>Shank1, a postsynaptic density protein that has been used to label postsynaptic areas in granule cells (Huang et al., 2013), was labeled in some experiments. Many puncta are labeled in locations expected along the brush of UBCs and granule cell dendrites. In agreement with the possibility of somatic synapses, puncta are also seen on the surface of UBC somata. This staining has been added to Figure 8E to show an example of a UBC that has these proteins on the soma at the interface with a primary afferent that appeared to elicit a somatic current.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that primary afferent input to ON UBCs conveys angular acceleration information based on their innervation of the semi-circular canal hair cells and not the otoliths.

However, we cannot conclude that the labeled afferents are from lobe X, as this experiment infected lobe IX and deep cerebellar nuclei as well. Indeed, there is evidence that lateral utricle afferents project to lobe IX, that medial utricle afferents project to vestibular nuclei, and that neither project many afferents to lobe X (Maklad and Fritzsch, 2003; Maklad et al., 2010). This suggests the otolith afferents labeled may be from lobe IX. This point has been clarified in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
