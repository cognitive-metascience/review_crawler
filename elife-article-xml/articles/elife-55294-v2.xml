is at the heart of treatments for anxiety disorders. Tremendous progress has been made in this regard through extinction training in which the aversive outcome is omitted. However, current progress almost entirely rests on this single paradigm, resulting in a very specialized knowledgebase at the behavioural and neural level of analysis. Here, we used a dual-paradigm approach to show that different methods that lead to reduction in learned fear in rats are dissociated in the cortex. We report that the infralimbic cortex has a very specific role in fear reduction that depends on the omission of aversive events but not on overexpectation. The orbitofrontal cortex, a structure generally overlooked in fear, is critical for downregulating fear when novel predictions about upcoming aversive events are generated, such as when fear is inflated or overexpected, but less so when an expected aversive event is omitted.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>extinction</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>infralimbic</kwd><kwd>orbitofrontal</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-NC-198182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iordanova</surname><given-names>Mihaela D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iordanova</surname><given-names>Mihaela D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iordanova</surname><given-names>Mihaela D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iordanova</surname><given-names>Mihaela D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lay</surname><given-names>Belinda PP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boulianne</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extinction and overexpectation lead to the same behavioural outcome, that is, reduction in learned fear, but engage different cortical areas.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extinction learning has captivated behavioural and neural science for more than a century. It has done so because it allows for the reduction of behaviours that were once adaptive but are no longer so, and gives the therapist a handle to combat others that were never adaptive in the first place. The most-widely used method for suppressing unwanted behaviour relies on the <italic>omission</italic> of the event that drives this behaviour; that is extinction. In the context of fear learning, extinction involves the dramatic reduction in fear-related behaviours typically observed after presenting a previously established signal for an aversive event (i.e., a tone paired with shock; tone →shock) in the absence of that event (tone presented alone; tone → nothing). Given its simplicity and effectiveness in the treatment of anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craske et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebrahimi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammoud et al., 2020</xref>), extinction has received significant attention in a quest to understand its underlying behavioural and neural mechanisms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung and Westbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung and Westbrook, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monfils et al., 2009</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Critically, although much progress has been made, this quest has focused on a single method for reducing learned fear: that involving outcome omission in the presence of a previously conditioned cue, while another, equally relevant method that drives reduction in conditioned behaviour; namely, overexpectation, remains largely unexplored. This single-paradigm approach is restrictive because at best it can oversimplify and at worst even misrepresent the function of brain areas implicated in extinction learning. Here, we move beyond this paradigm-specific approach and embark on an investigation into how the brain learns to reduce learned fear using two behavioural designs: extinction driven by the omission of an expected aversive event (described above) and overexpectation driven by generating novel predictions that surpass the delivered aversive event (described below).</p><p>In overexpectation, reduction in previously established fear responses ensue, strikingly, despite continued delivery of the aversive event. This is possible because separately established signals of a common aversive event (i.e., tone → shock; light→shock) can summate their fear-inducing properties when encountered simultaneously (tone+light), triggering a state of exacerbated fear. The presentation of the same (i.e., unintensified) aversive event in that state (tone+light →shock) engages a self-regulatory mechanism that lessens the exacerbated fear by partially extinguishing the fear elicited by each individual signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rescorla, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rescorla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rescorla, 2007</xref>). Since signals for threat often co-occur (think of the sight of a microphone and that of a staring crowd for a glossophobic), failure to reduce fear by overexpectation is a likely contributor to the aberrant and persistent fear characterizing anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>The infralimbic cortex (IL) is considered to be the key brain locus in learning to downregulate fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurent and Westbrook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lingawi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer and Bucci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, evidence for this role is exclusively derived from extinction designs. If the IL is critical for learning to reduce fear in general, then it should do so irrespective of the conditions that generate this reduction. It follows that in our dual-paradigm approach, the IL should mediate fear reduction in both extinction and overexpectation. Alternatively, the IL might have a paradigm-specific role in learning that leads to suppression of established behaviour when expected outcomes are omitted. To date, there is no evidence to bear on either alternative. To address this gap in knowledge, we first examined whether the IL is necessary for reduction in fear driven by overexpectation and then by extinction.</p><p>In our study of the neurobiology of fear reduction, we also chose to move beyond the traditional fear circuit. Our candidate was the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), a structure strongly linked to reward learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gardner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>). We targeted the OFC for three reasons. Firstly, it has dense reciprocal projections with the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmichael and Price, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Price, 2007</xref>), which has been extensively implicated in fear acquisition and extinction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Davis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laurent et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orsini and Maren, 2012</xref>). Secondly, the lOFC has been linked to fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zelinski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etkin and Wager, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Milad and Rauch, 2007</xref>). Finally, it supports learning from overexpectation of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we examined the role of the lOFC in reduction of learned fear responses in overexpectation and extinction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: The IL regulates learning from extinction but not overexpectation</title><p>Experiment 1 examined the effect of IL inactivation on reducing learned fear driven by overexpectation and extinction.

These results are intriguing in that they reveal a disruption in extinction in animals trained with an inactivated lOFC. However, the data also show there is a clear effect of extinction in the inactivated animals relative to the controls, suggesting that lOFC inactivation during extinction resulted in a mild and not catastrophic impairment in the retrieval of the extinction memory. This mild impairment is further put into context when considering the lack of change in the level of responding across test trials. The data suggest that both extinction groups are at performance floor. Therefore, the slightly higher level of responding in the extinction-drug animals compared to the extinction-vehicle animals is unlikely to be due to disruption in extinction learning or else we could see additional reduction in responding on Test.</p><p>Following initial extinction, the same rats took part in an additional extinction experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This was done by using extinction and overexpectation, two different experimental designs that attenuate learned fear. Our data confirm a well-established finding for the role of the IL in extinction of fear, but uncovered that the IL is not critical for all instances when learned fear is reduced. Specifically, inactivation of the IL during overexpectation learning left this effect intact. Inactivation of the lOFC, on the other hand, led to a catastrophic disruption of overexpectation but only a very mild, if any, actual impairment in extinction.</p><p>Our data replicate substantial prior work from the aversive domain showing that inactivation of the IL during extinction training disrupts extinction retrieval on Test (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurent and Westbrook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lingawi et al., 2017</xref>). The effect of IL inactivation on performance during extinction training, however, has yielded variable results: Some studies show little to no effect on responding (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>), while others report a retardation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>) or facilitation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendoza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lay et al., 2019</xref>). Our data are somewhat unclear in this regard. While we report a difference between the vehicle and inactivated extinction animals, this difference seems to be primarily driven by the controls, which show a reduced level of fear from conditioning to extinction training and compared to the vehicle extinction animals in the other experiments. While this difference is hard to interpret, our effect on Test is not, as revealed by the identical responding between the IL-inactivated animals relative to the non-extinction controls.</p><p>Our data on the role of the lOFC in extinction is particularly intriguing. We show an effect of lOFC inactivation only in initial extinction learning consistent with prior work (aversive: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>; appetitive: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panayi and Killcross, 2014</xref>) but not in subsequent extinction learning. However, our data provide an important control comparison that sheds fundamental light on the disruptive role of lOFC inactivation on initial extinction. lOFC inactivation during extinction did not prevent these animals from showing an extinction effect compared to the non-extinction controls and this difference was similar to that obtained from the vehicle animals. There was no additional reduction in conditioned responding during test in the extinction animals irrespective of drug infusion, suggesting that they had reached floor performance. This result is key because it shows that disrupting lOFC function did not abolish the ability to attenuate learned fear under extinction conditions. This is further supported by a complete lack of effect of lOFC inactivation on subsequent extinction learning. Noteworthy is the fact that our subsequent extinction is not equivalent to re-extinction as we use novel cues and do not re-condition and re-extinguish experienced cues. While these data provide evidence that the lOFC has a very limited, if any, effect on extinction learning, they must be taken with caution because we observed a substantial drop in performance at the outset of extinction training (Phase 2) seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of Experiment 3 .</p><p>The dissociation of function reported here flies in the face of a parsimonious explanation for fear reduction in the IL and lOFC. Specifically, both methods are underpinned by the same negative prediction error mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>), which is generated when expectations surpass reality. While this common process can account for the behavioural effect of reduced fear on Test, it is unlikely to be what is regulated by the IL and lOFC, or else we would have seen similar disruptions in both behavioural designs. Instead, our findings suggest that the IL and the lOFC are recruited under different task-dependent conditions to downregulate fear.</p><p>To understand the function of these brain areas, it is important to highlight that the discrepancy between real and expected events is generated differently in the two designs. In extinction, the learning discrepancy results from omitting the delivery of an expected (aversive) event, which results in inhibition of fear responding, and likely underlies the development of inhibitory cue-response associations. This is unlikely to be the case in overexpectation because responding is maintained at high levels due to shock delivery. Thus, the pattern observed in the IL inactivation animals is consistent with inhibitory learning that likely involves cue-response associations. In contrast, the role of the lOFC in overexpectation and its limited role in extinction suggest that the lOFC is unlikely to be involved in this form of inhibitory learning. Rather, in overexpectation the learning discrepancy depends on the summation of two individually trained associations with the aversive event, therefore the lOFC likely modulates fear reduction through cue-outcome inhibitory learning. It is noteworthy, however, that the lOFC did have a small effect on initial extinction. While this leaves open the possibility that inhibitory cue-outcome associations might contribute to extinction, they are unlikely to drive the majority of response loss reported in our studies. Finally, the dissociation of function between the IL and lOFC is in line with data implicating IL activation during reduction of conditioned fear using a habituation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furlong et al., 2016</xref>), as well as research implicating the lOFC in cue-outcome associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang and Li, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asok et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two further procedural differences between overexpectation and extinction warrant attention. The first relates to the number of trials necessary for learning in extinction and overexpectation. This difference is fundamental to the two designs and less easily subjected to analysis. Reducing the number of extinction trials can disrupt the effect and even create conditions for reconsolidation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), an altogether different phenomenon. On the other hand, increasing the number of compound presentations disrupts the overexpectation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garfield and McNally, 2009</xref>). Therefore, these differences are inherent to the behavioural effects in fear. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that evidence from appetitive studies shows that when training is somewhat equivalent in overexpectation and extinction, the IL continues to have a dissociable role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lay et al., 2019</xref>) as does the lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The second procedural difference relates to the mode of stimulus presentation. In extinction, animals learn about a single cue, whereas in overexpectation two different cues are presented in compound. To investigate the impact of this difference, it would be valuable to examine the contribution of the IL and lOFC to extinction learning using novel compounds comprising previously trained or pre-exposed cues. This line of research, however, carries many complexities. Stimuli presented in compound can interact in a variety of ways, one of which is summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rescorla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>). As a result, nonreinforced compounds can facilitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rescorla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung and Westbrook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McConnell et al., 2013</xref> or disrupt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rescorla, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McConnell and Miller, 2010</xref>) extinction learning, both of which likely depend on the lOFC. Relatedly, the lOFC may be required for keeping track of changes in associations across two or more stimuli, whether presented in compound or individually. These possibilities should be subjected to further investigation. In the present analysis, we focussed on examining the role of the lOFC in the traditional extinction procedure that does not require cue interaction such as summation.</p><p>Our findings in fear mirror those in reward learning. Disruption of IL function interferes with appetitive extinction (natural rewards: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rhodes and Killcross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rhodes and Killcross, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rhodes and Killcross, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lay et al., 2019</xref>; drug rewards: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaLumiere et al., 2010</xref>; for review of IL in fear and addiction see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peters et al., 2008</xref>) but not with appetitive overexpectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lay et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, a comparison across experiments suggests that the severity of the IL-dependent extinction deficit might be greater for the aversive (Experiment 1) relative to the appetitive case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lay et al., 2019</xref>). Related to what may be learned in extinction, the IL has a role in appetitive and aversive response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Rivera et al., 2019</xref>). In regard to the lOFC, electrophysiological and inactivation studies have linked it to appetitive overexpectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>), but not to response inhibition when a conditioned cue is followed by reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2009</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chudasama et al., 2007</xref>).

The grid floor was connected to a shock generator and delivered continuous scrambled foot-shock. Each chamber was enclosed in a ventilated sound attenuating cabinet. The back wall of each cabinet was equipped with a camera connected to a monitor located in another room of the laboratory where the behaviour of each rat was videotaped and observed by an experimenter. Illumination of each chamber was provided by a near-infrared light source (NIR-200) mounted on the back wall of each cabinet. Stimuli were presented through Med Associates software on a computer located outside the experimental room. The chambers had checkered or spotted wallpaper on the door and each wall with the exception of the back wall to allow for video viewing. Instead, the back wall of the holding cabinet was covered in either checkered or spotted wallpaper. The chambers (walls, ceiling, door, grid floor, and tray) were cleaned with 4% almond-scented solution (PC Black Label) after the removal of each rat. The chamber wallpaper was counterbalanced across groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Visual and auditory cues were used in the experiments. The visual cues consisted of a 4 Hz flashing light located on the left-hand side of the right wall and a steady light located on the right-hand side of the right wall. The auditory cues were a 70 dB tone and a 72 dB white-noise (measured inside the chamber) delivered through a loud speaker located outside the behavioural chamber. The background noise in the chamber was 48–50 dB. The background noise and experimental auditory cues were measured using a digital sound level meter (Tenma, 72–942). All cues were 30 s in duration and were fully counterbalanced. During Phases 1, 2, and 3, the cues terminated with the onset of a 1 s duration foot-shock at 0.5 mA intensity that was delivered to the floor of each chamber. The cues were controlled via a Med-Associates program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioural procedures</title><p>Each study was done in two replications. Allocation to groups was based on Conditioning (Phases 1 and 3) to ensure that all groups entered the critical part of training (Overexpectation and Extinction for Experiments 1 and 2, Initial Extinction and Subsequent Extinction for Experiment 3) with the same level of responding. The behavioural sequence for Experiments 1 and 2 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and Experiment three in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Behavioural sequence for Experiments 1–3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In Experiments 1 and 2, rats are trained to associate two individual cues (tone and light) with a shock during Phase 1 and their performance during this phase was used to determine group allocation such that fear acquisition was similar between the groups. Immediately prior to overexpectation training (Phase 2), the IL (Experiment 1) or lOFC (Experiment 2) was pharmacologically silenced with muscimol and baclofen (0.1 mM muscimol-1 mM baclofen, M/B). Rats in the overexpectation group (OE) received compound presentations of the two cues followed by the delivery of a shock. Rats in the control group (Control) were handled. All rats were then tested for conditioned responding (freezing) the following day to either the tone or the light (counterbalanced). Following the overexpectation experiment, the same rats received conditioning to a novel stimulus (white-noise or steady light, counterbalanced) paired with shock during Phase 3. Rats were reassigned to one of the four groups (counterbalanced for training and drug history) based on their responding during Conditioning. Prior to extinction in Phase 4, rats received an infusion of M/B or vehicle into the IL or lOFC. Rats in the extinction condition (EXT) received non-reinforced presentations of the target cue. Rats in the control condition (Control) were handled. All rats were then tested for conditioned responding to the target cue (counterbalanced) the following day. (<bold>B</bold>) In Experiment 3, rats were trained to associate a cue (steady light or white-noise, counterbalanced between rats) with shock during Phase 1. Prior to extinction training (Phase 2), rats received an infusion of M/B or vehicle into the lOFC. Rats in the extinction condition (EXT) received non-reinforced presentations of the fear-conditioned cue. Rats in the control condition (Control) were handled. All rats were then tested for conditioned responding to the target cue (counterbalanced) the following day. Following initial extinction, the same rats took part in a subsequent extinction experiment. Rats received conditioning to a novel stimulus (tone or flashing light, counterbalanced) paired with shock during Phase 3. Rats were reassigned to groups based on their responding during Conditioning. Immediately prior to extinction training in Phase 4, the lOFC was pharmacologically silenced in the same manner as described above. Again, rats in the extinction condition (EXT) received non-reinforced presentations of the target stimulus while rats in the control condition (Control) were handled. All rats were then tested for conditioned responding to the target cue the following day.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55294-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experiments 1 and 2</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Phase 1 Conditioning</title><p>On days 1 to 6, rats were placed into the conditioning context for 20 min sessions.

It was defined as the absence of all movements except those related to breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow, 1980</xref>) and exhibited a hunched posture. Each rat was observed every 2 s and scored as either freezing or not freezing by two observers, one of whom was blind to group assignment. The correlation between the scores were high (Pearson r &gt; 0.9). A percentage score was calculated for the proportion of the total observation each rat spent freezing during the total duration of each stimulus presentation. The levels of freezing do not include freezing during the ITI. Data were analysed in SPSS 25.0 (IBM, New York, USA) using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was set at α = 0.05. Where appropriate, adjustments with Bonferroni were made for multiple comparisons. Effects of trial, where reported, were measured with contrasts testing for the presence of a linear trend. Standardized confidence intervals (CIs; 95% for the mean difference) and measures of effect size (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for ANOVA and Cohen’s d for contrasts; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen, 1988</xref>) are reported for each significant comparison.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mathieu Wolff as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gregory Quirk (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Lay et al. uses rats to examine the roles of the infralimbic cortex (IL) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) in extinction and overexpectation of Pavlovian conditioned fear, relying on reversible inactivation of these cortical areas in rats. Using two distinct paradigm to assess fear extinction, the authors provide convincing support for a double dissociation at the cortical level: the infralimbic cortex appears to be necessary for extinction by omission (i.e. the most classic way to assess extinction), but not by overexpectation, while the lateral orbitofrontal cortex seems to support extinction by overexpectation but not omission. These results are important for understanding the dissociability of these two forms of fear reduction as well as the differential contribution of cortical subregions to fear reduction. This double dissociation was recognized as original and of interest for the field by the three reviewers. Some issues related to the interpretation of the data however require clarification before the work can be considered for publication. We produce below a list of essential revisions that the authors must address, together with a number of smaller issues that the authors are encouraged to consider.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Research Article</p><p>Since addressing some of the points will require to expand the Discussion and/or to include additional analyses, we suggest the authors to submit their revision as a Research Article, not a brief communication. This way, all necessary information can be conveniently incorporated into the main text. Statistical analyses in particular could therefore be presented in full where relevant (as data are being described, instead of at the end of the document as is presently the case).</p><p>2) Tasks order</p><p>The order of the task is a likely confound to interpret the data, especially for the extinction experiment. The within-experiment nature of the assessments conducted here indeed means that there was no pure assessment of the role of the OFC in initial extinction. What has been done could be interpreted as some assessment of the role of the OFC in re-extinction (especially as the stimuli used in the second part of each experiment were in the same modality as those used in the first part), which has been shown to differ in important respects from initial extinction. While some additional experiments could possibly address this issue, it may not be mandatory if the authors can maybe provide some additional analyses of freezing to strengthen the interpretations. This could possibly include freezing during the ITI, or prior to the first tone, or anything that could clarify this issue. It is clear that a more thorough Discussion around these points is expected in the revised paper.</p><p>3) Interpretation of the data</p><p>In line with the above, the extinction and over-expectation sessions differed in numerous respects other than the presence vs. absence of the shock: e.g., (1) number of stimuli presented, (2) number of presentations of those stimuli, (3) presentations of stimuli in compound, etc. These differences could well contribute to the differential effects of the IL and OFC manipulations on the two protocols that have been examined, and it would be worth knowing whether this is the case or not, and if so, exactly how/why. So again, additional analyses may help to address these issues which should also be properly discussed. When doing the latter, please consider that the language/descriptions used at several places in the paper could be revised to improve the clarity of its central message, and to avoid the potential over-stating of findings: (i) the second-half of the final paragraph is a bit distracting.

However, in Figure 3F, there seems to be a much smaller difference in the SAL groups, i.e. no clear effect of overexpectation training.

As we deemed this to be fundamental, we decided to run the experiment. This additional study (Experiment 3) assessed the role of the OFC in initial extinction and during subsequent extinction (as in Experiments 1 and 2). Our results show that lOFC inactivation had a disruptive effect on initial extinction similar to that reported by Zimmerman et al., 2018. However, our inclusion of non-extinction controls showed that this disruption was not indicative of a lack of extinction learning. Responding in the lOFC-inactivated extinction animals was much lower compared to the non-extinction controls, we did not get a significant interaction, and there was no additional decline in responding on test suggesting that no further extinction took place across the non-reinforced trials on test. This very modest effect of lOFC inactivation in extinction is clearly very distinct to the catastrophic effect of IL inactivation on extinction (as well as the catastrophic effect of lOFC inactivation on overexpectation). We also replicated our lack of lOFC inactivation on subsequent extinction. We address this in the Discussion by discussing what the likely role of the lOFC may be and what types of associations are likely to drive the reduction in conditioned fear in extinction (and overexpectation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Interpretation of the data</p><p>In line with the above, the extinction and over-expectation sessions differed in numerous respects other than the presence vs. absence of the shock: e.g., (1) number of stimuli presented, (2) number of presentations of those stimuli, (3) presentations of stimuli in compound, etc. These differences could well contribute to the differential effects of the IL and OFC manipulations on the two protocols that have been examined, and it would be worth knowing whether this is the case or not, and if so, exactly how/why.

The first paragraph of the main text also has this problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that there are noteworthy procedural differences other than the presence and absence of shock that may account for the differential cortical effects. We address those in two paragraphs in the Discussion. While the number of trials are inherent to the tasks in fear, there is no evidence from the appetitive literature (where more trials are often necessary for learning) that trial number determines IL or OFC involvement. We also explain in the Discussion that decreasing the extinction trials would likely lead to reconsolidation, which would be valuable to explore but is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Increasing the overexpectation trials has been shown to disrupt the overexpectation effect (Garfield and McNally, 2009). The role of compound presentation is a particularly interesting question. We actually think that the lOFC should have a role in regulating extinction when compounds are used because of the role of summation in associative strength between cues and the competition for extinction learning between cues. To elaborate on this point, presenting two previously trained cues together in compound and not reinforcing the compound leads to potentiated extinction, this will likely be regulated by the lOFC because we think that, like in overexpectation, the lOFC will be necessary for summation and thus augmentation of the error term. Presenting a compound that consists of a reinforced and a non-reinforced cue can result in protection from extinction, which may also depend on the lOFC because of the competition for development in inhibitory associative strength, and if the non-reinforced cue is an inhibitor (true protection from extinction) then again summation (of excitatory and inhibitory associative strengths) is likely to be modulated by the lOFC. This is related to the number to stimuli presented as the lOFC may be required to keep track of the changes in associations across stimuli. We are 100% committed to conducting these studies but we are not able to do this as part of the present investigation. Here we wanted to focus on the more traditional procedures used in the field. To further understand the role of the lOFC in fear reduction we will undertake these hybrid studies of extinction and overexpectation as soon as the pandemic conditions ease and our institution allows for animal orders.</p><p>As a result of the reviewers’ comments and the potential stimulus compounding effects in extinction that could be lOFC-dependent, we have modified the narrative of the manuscript to focus on fear reduction and not on different types of extinction and the presence vs. absence of shock. This has been done throughout the manuscript and in the title. We have also emphasized the likely involvement of the lOFC in summation conditions. We thank the reviewers for this and we agree that this change was an excellent idea, while still preserving the main point of the manuscript that downregulation in learned fear can be obtained in distinct ways and this is dissociable in the IL and lOFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overexpectation data</p><p>Comparison of Figures 1F and 3F seems to show a problem with the overexpectation.
