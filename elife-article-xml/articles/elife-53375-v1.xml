in the control of gene expression. In human, H2A.Z is encoded by two genes expressing two isoforms, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 differing by three amino acids. Here, we undertook an integrated analysis of their functions in gene expression using endogenously-tagged proteins. RNA-Seq analysis in untransformed cells showed that they can regulate both distinct and overlapping sets of genes positively or negatively in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, they have similar or antagonistic function depending on genes. H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can replace each other at Transcription Start Sites, providing a molecular explanation for this interplay. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 have specific interactors, which can mediate their functional antagonism. Our data indicate that the balance between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 at promoters is critically important to regulate specific gene expression, providing an additional layer of complexity to the control of gene expression by histone variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H2A.Z histone variant</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>genome-wide analyses</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cote</surname><given-names>Jacques</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme ARC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trouche</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe labellisée</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trouche</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bourse de post-doc</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamaa</surname><given-names>Assala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The two H2A.Z isoforms have specific interactors which mediate their differential effects on gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The H2A.Z histone variant is one of the two histone variants conserved from yeast to human. It is enriched at the −1 and +1 nucleosomes surrounding the nucleosome-depleted region of active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). It can play positive or negative roles in specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramanian et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to transcriptional control, H2A.Z is important for genetic stability and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billon and Côté, 2012</xref>), although its exact function is somewhat controversial in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taty-Taty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). H2A.Z is incorporated in chromatin by specialized machinery relying on the ATPase SWR1 in yeast and its orthologs in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billon and Côté, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>). In mammals, both SWR1 orthologs, SRCAP and p400 belong to multimolecular complexes that have been shown to mediate incorporation of the H2A.Z histone variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gévry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruhl et al., 2006</xref>). H2A.Z removal can be mediated by the ANP32E chaperon protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, H2A.Z is encoded by two different genes, <italic>H2AFZ</italic> and <italic>H2AFV</italic>, leading to the production of three proteins, one produced from the <italic>H2AFZ</italic> gene, called H2A.Z.1, and two splicing variants produced from <italic>H2AFV</italic>, called H2A.Z.2 and H2A.Z.2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bönisch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>H2AFZ</italic> gene is essential for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faast et al., 2001</xref>), and conditional deletion of <italic>H2AFZ</italic> in the brain leads to neurogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2018</xref>), highlighting the importance of H2A.Z in mammals. Intriguingly, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 proteins are highly similar, differing by only three amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryhurst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eirín-López et al., 2009</xref>). They are expressed at different levels as shown by the analysis of their expression in human embryonic and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryhurst et al., 2009</xref>). It was recently found that they have overlapping function or can compensate each other since depleting both isoforms in the mouse intestine leads to severe homeostasis defects whereas individual mutants have no phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). However, it was shown by ChIP-Seq analysis of exogenously expressed GFP-tagged isoforms that their genomic localisation is similar but not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pünzeler et al., 2017</xref>). This could indicate that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 functions could be divergent. Indeed, specific functions and/or expression of these isoforms in human cancer cells have been described. For example, despite the fact that the mRNA for both isoforms are overexpressed in human melanoma, only depletion of H2A.Z.2 was found to favour melanoma cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vardabasso et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, H2A.Z.1 is specifically overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Differences in the physiological roles of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 have also been documented. In highly recombinogenic DT40 chicken cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishibuchi et al. (2014)</xref> found that H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1, is recruited to and functionally important for the repair of double strand breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunn et al., 2017</xref>). However, no study has extensively investigated the independent and interdependent roles of both isoforms in their physiological context in specific gene expression in non-transformed cells. Furthermore, the lack of specific antibodies, preventing the investigation of endogenous proteins, is a strong limitation to understand the molecular bases of these differences.</p><p>Here, we performed an integrated study of H2A.Z.1- and H2A.Z.2-dependent gene expression in untransformed cells by combining RNA-seq, RT-qPCR and ChIP assays. This unveiled the parallel and antagonistic functions of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 in gene regulation. Furthermore, by tagging endogenous H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 isoforms, we were able to identify proteins interacting specifically with one isoform or the other. Our study thus reveals major antagonism between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regarding control of gene expression, mediated by specific interactors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 are major regulators of gene expression</title><p>In an effort to identify genes regulated by H2A.Z isoforms H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 in non-transformed cells, we transfected Telomerase-immortalized WI38 human primary fibroblasts with specific siRNAs silencing either H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2, or both at the same time. Analysis of each H2A.Z isoform mRNA expression by RT-qPCR indicated that both siRNAs are efficient and specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), although transfection of the H2A.Z.2 siRNA slightly affected the expression of H2A.Z.1 mRNA. Using U2OS cells in which the two alleles coding for H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 were tagged with a 3xFlag-2xStrep tag by genome editing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the characterization of the cell lines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalvai et al., 2015</xref>), we found that siRNA-mediated depletion efficiently decreased the expression of one isoform without affecting the expression of the other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for a H2A.Z western blot and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> for a Flag western blot). Note that in these western blots, we observed a band migrating above H2A.Z and decreasing upon siRNA depletion. This band probably corresponds to a post-translational modification of H2A.Z, most likely its ubiquitination (see below). No obvious difference could be observed between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 with respect to this band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By performing a western blot analysis using an antibody recognising total H2A.Z, we found that the strong depletion of total H2A.Z in WI38 cells required transfection of both siRNAs together, as we observed only a moderate or weak effect upon H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 depletion, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantification of this experiment is consistent with the interpretation that total H2A.Z is composed of about 2/3rd of H2A.Z.1 and 1/3rd of H2A.Z.2 in WI38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion on gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WI38 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. 72 hr later, total RNA was prepared.

Two entirely independent experiments were performed and differential analysis showed that the expression levels of 3573 mRNAs were significantly affected upon H2A.Z.1 depletion and 1500 upon H2A.Z.2 depletion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref> for the list of deregulated genes). 41.5% and 50.4% of regulated genes were activated upon H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion, respectively. In addition, 691 mRNAs were significantly affected only upon depletion of the two isoforms together (371 activated and 320 repressed) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), suggesting that at these promoters H2A.Z isoforms can compensate each other. These results indicate that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 are major regulators of gene expression in non-transformed cells, both acting as gene activators or repressors. Note that the expression of H2A.Z isoforms is strongly reduced but not abolished upon transfection of the siRNAs. We thus may have missed some H2A.Z-regulated genes in this analysis, when a residual amount of H2A.Z is sufficient to bring about the correct regulation.</p><p>Gene ontology analyses indicate that genes activated upon H2A.Z1 knock-down are enriched in negative regulators of cell proliferation whereas genes repressed are mostly enriched in mitosis-linked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in agreement with the known cell proliferation arrest observed upon H2A.Z.1 depletion. Genes induced upon H2A.Z.2 knock-down are also enriched in cell cycle-linked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although no obvious effect on cell proliferation could be observed upon H2A.Z.2 depletion (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 isoforms regulate both distinct and overlapping sets of genes</title><p>We next analysed whether H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate the same set of genes. We found that among the 3573 genes regulated by H2A.Z.1, 759 are also regulated by H2A.Z.2 (Fig.ure 2A), whereas the expected overlap for random lists of gene of the same size would be 255. Actually, more than half of the genes regulated by H2A.Z.2 are also regulated by H2A.Z.1. This intersection is highly significant (p value<italic> = 9,38E<sup>−283</sup></italic>), indicating that H2A.Z isoforms regulate overlapping sets of genes. However, they also have independent functions, since 2814 and 741 genes are regulated specifically by H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 respectively. The lists of genes up-regulated or down-regulated upon H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 depletion in WI38 cells are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>.</p><p>We next crossed the lists of genes regulated by each H2A.Z isoform considering whether the genes were activated or repressed. We found 325 genes activated and 192 repressed by both H2AZ.1 and H2A.Z.2, both overlaps being highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Taking into account the 691 genes which were found deregulated only when we depleted the two isoforms, H2A.Z isoforms regulate 1208 genes in a similar way. This result indicates that both H2A.Z isoforms can play similar roles in the regulation of specific genes. However, we also found 72 genes repressed by H2A.Z.1 and activated by H2A.Z.2 and 170 activated by H2A.Z.1 and repressed by H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This latter overlap is much more than expected by chance and is also highly significant, indicating that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can also regulate gene expression in an opposite fashion for a significant proportion of genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate both distinct and overlapping sets of genes.</title><p>RNA-Seq data was analysed for differential gene expression in samples transfected with either H2A.Z.1 siRNA or H2A.Z.2 siRNA versus the control siRNA sample.

This showed a striking similarity with RNA-Seq results, validating the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, results concerning the effects of H2A.Z.2 were confirmed with a second independent siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), ruling out the possibility of off-target effects at least for H2A.Z.2. Note however that we have not been able to find another efficient and specific siRNA against H2A.Z.1 (they were either inefficient or also decreased H2A.Z.2 levels). Some individual genes we identified here as regulated by H2A.Z.1 could thus be due to off-target effects. However, the highly significant intersection between genes differentially-expressed upon H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion that we observed in WI38 as well as following experiments (see below) strongly suggests that off-target effects are modest. In particular, data on the ZDHHC20, RRM2 and PLAT gene were reproduced using a siRNA targetting a H2A.Z.1 interactor (see below), ruling out the possibility of off-target effects at least for these genes.</p><p>Importantly, very similar results were observed in RNA-Seq data obtained following depletion of H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 in tumoral U2OS cells. We found more genes regulated by H2A.Z.1 (5196), less by H2A.Z.2 (673) than in WI38 cells, with roughly an equivalent number of activated and repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The lists of genes up-regulated or down-regulated upon either H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2 or both depletion in U2OS cells are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary files 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">10</xref>. Again, crossing the results obtained for H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 indicated that, besides genes regulated by only one isoform, significantly enriched gene populations are activated or repressed by both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, or activated by H2A.Z.1 and repressed by H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), confirming that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can regulate specific gene expression similarly or in an opposite way.</p><p>Finally, we crossed the results obtained in U2OS cells with those obtained in WI38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Despite significant overlap, these lists were mostly different, indicating that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate different sets of genes in different cells, consistent with the fact that transcription regulation by H2A.Z isoforms H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 is highly specific of the promoter context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The presence of H2A.Z isoforms at TSS does not determine their transcriptional effect</title><p>We next tested whether genes specifically regulated by a given isoform were characterized by a specific feature with respect to the presence of this isoform at their promoters. Thanks to the U2OS cells lines with tagged endogenous isoforms, we performed H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 ChIP-Seq experiments. ChIP-Seq profiles on the <italic>CDKN1A/p21</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic> genes were very similar and showed accumulation of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 signal mostly at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then integrated these data with the RNA-Seq following depletion of H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 in the same cells. Metadata analyses showed that both isoforms accumulate around the Transcription Start Sites (TSS) of expressed genes at the −1 and +one nucleosome surrounding the Nucleosome Depleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as already shown for total H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, binding of H2A.Z.1 appeared to be similar on genes that were unchanged upon depletion of H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 than on genes which responded to H2A.Z.1 depletion, either positively or negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Although genes which are repressed by H2A.Z.1 depletion showed a slightly higher level of H2A.Z.1, they also showed a higher level of H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Similarly, genes responding to H2A.Z.2 depletion do not show major differences in the amount of H2A.Z.2 bound to their promoters. These data thus indicate that genes affected by the depletion of a given isoform are not characterized by the amount of this isoform around the TSS. A recent report described a higher H2A.Z.2/H2A.Z.1 ratio at active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenberg et al., 2019</xref>). To test whether this is also true in U2OS cells, we recovered U2OS enhancers through enhancer atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.enhanceratlas.org/">http://www.enhanceratlas.org/</ext-link>). We next computed the ratio of H2A.Z.1 to H2A.Z.2 ChIP-Seq signals at these enhancers as well as at all TSS or on control genomic regions. As previously found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenberg et al. (2019)</xref>, we found that the H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z.2 ratio was significantly lower at enhancers than at TSS (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B and C</xref> for box plots and metadata). However, it was even lower at regions chosen arbitrary along the genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). To rule out any effect due to differences in the total amount of H2A.Z, we calculated this total amount by adding the H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 signal (which is feasible following internal spike-in normalisation) and sorted enhancers and promoters according to this amount. Strikingly, we did not observe a lower H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z.2 ratio at enhancers compared to promoters, whichever the class we considered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D and E</xref> for box plots and metadata) for the class with the highest level of total H2A.Z). Thus, in U2OS cells, the ratio H2A.Z.2/H2A.Z.1 is dependent on the total amount of H2A.Z present but not on any functional differences between enhancers and promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 isoforms can have antagonistic roles</title><p>We next asked whether the depletion of both isoforms together in WI38 non-transformed cells could lead to cumulative effects, as could be guessed if the total amount of H2A.Z was functionally important. As mentioned, only upon transfection of both siRNAs could we achieve efficient inhibition of total H2A.Z expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We thus tested whether depletion of H2A.Z.2 could amplify the effects observed upon depletion of H2A.Z.1 alone. For the genes up-regulated upon H2A.Z.1 depletion, we plotted the effect of H2A.Z.1 depletion alone for each gene (calculating Log2 (siH2A.Z.1/siCtrl) for each gene) and the effect of both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion (Log2 (siH2A.Z.1+.2)/siCtrl)). Strikingly, we observed no cumulative effect of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). On the contrary, the effect of the double depletion was significantly lower than the effect of depleting H2A.Z.1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, similar findings were observed when analysing genes down-regulated upon H2A.Z.1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and genes up- or down-regulated upon H2A.Z.2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, on these genes, the transcriptional effect of depleting one isoform on gene expression is attenuated upon depletion of the other isoform. This is not due to a lower siRNA effect upon co-transfection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These results suggest that the effect of the loss of one H2AZ isoform on gene expression depends on the presence of the other H2AZ isoform. Thus, altogether these data uncover an antagonistic function of both H2A.Z isoforms on specific gene expression. Importantly, these findings were confirmed by RT-qPCR for the PLAT, AKAP12, ADAMTS1 and COLEC12 mRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>H2A.Z isoforms exert an antagonistic regulation on gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For each gene up-regulated (left) or down-regulated (right) upon H2A.Z.1 depletion, we calculated the ratio between its expression in either H2A.Z.1 depleted cells (siZ1/siC) or cells depleted for H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 versus control cells (siZ1+2/SIC).

H2A.Z is proposed to regulate specific gene expression by binding around gene Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramanian et al., 2015</xref>). One possibility could be that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can compete with each other for binding to the same promoters, with one isoform replacing the depleted one. Indeed, this would result in compensatory mechanisms where they play similar roles or in an antagonism where they bring about a different consequence regarding gene expression.</p><p>In agreement with this hypothesis, analysis of ChIP-Seq profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) and ChIP-qPCR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) using Flag antibodies indicate that both isoforms are recruited to the <italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>CDKN1A/p21</italic> promoters in U2OS cells expressing endogenous H2A.Z with a 3xFlag-2xStrep tag. Moreover, at the genome-wide level, we observed a strong correlation between the levels of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 binding to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, these data indicate that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 bind to the same genomic regions. We next tested whether depletion of one isoform could result in its replacement by the other. We transfected U2OS cells expressing 3xFlag-2xStrep-tagged H2A.Z.2 with siRNA against H2A.Z.1 and analysed chromatin recruitment of tagged H2A.Z.2 by performing a ChIP assay with Flag antibodies. Spike-in DNA was added to increase accuracy of the ChIP results. We found that H2A.Z.2 levels strongly increased upon H2A.Z.1 depletion at two loci at which H2A.Z.1 was bound, that is the <italic>CDKN1A/p21</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoters, underlining the replacement of H2A.Z.1 by H2A.Z.2 upon H2A.Z.1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In reciprocal experiments, we did not observe a significant increase in Flag-tagged H2A.Z.1 occupancy following depletion of H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), most likely because H2A.Z.2 is less expressed than H2A.Z.1 so that replacement of a significant amount of H2A.Z.2 by H2A.Z.1 does not increase much the total amount of H2A.Z.1. Nevertheless, these data suggest that H2A.Z isoforms can replace each other at TSS, therefore explaining the complex interplay we observed between H2A.Z isoforms for specific gene regulation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 replace each other at genes promoters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells expressing endogenously tagged H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 as indicated were subjected to a ChIP assay using the Flag antibody or no antibody as a control.

We thus asked whether they could be associated with different proteins and whether this could lead to different outcomes regarding gene expression. We tagged either isoform with a 3xFlag-2xStrep tag through genome editing in K562 cells (see the characterisation of both cell lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalvai et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, since these cells are non-adherent cells, they are much more convenient to grow in amounts large enough to purify and identify by mass spectrometry interactors of endogenous proteins. Flag western blots on these clones indicate that, like in U2OS cells, a band of higher molecular weight can be observed with both isoforms <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, most likely representing ubiquitinated H2A.Z considering its size and the fact that it represents 20% to 25% of non ubiquitinated H2A.Z when extraction is performed in the presence of DUB inhibitors (data not shown). ChIP-Seq analysis indicate that in this cell line as in U2OS cells, the two isoforms localise at the TSS of active genes and we observed a strong correlation between levels of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 around TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next performed mass spectrometry analysis of proteins interacting with each isoform expressed at endogenous levels. Since endogenous H2A.Z.2 is less expressed than H2A.Z.1, we used clones heterozygously-tagged H2A.Z.1 vs homozygously-tagged H2A.Z.2 to adequately compare interactomes with similar expression levels of the bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). We found that the tandem affinity purification of each isoform from soluble nuclear extracts led to the co-fractionation of the previously characterized H2A.Z-incorporating complexes, that is p400- and SRCAP-containing complexes, and H2A.Z/H2B histone chaperones (see protein gel, mass spectrometry and western blot analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), in agreement with our findings that both isoforms can be incorporated at the same locations. Strikingly though, some proteins are found at higher levels in H2A.Z.1 purifications, such as chromatin proteins PHF14, HMG20A/iBRAF, TCF20 and RAI1, which were already found co-purifying together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eberl et al., 2013</xref>), whereas others, such as SIRT1 are found at higher levels in H2A.Z.2 purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We thus tested fractionation conditions in which we extract proteins from chromatin using high salt conditions (420 mM NaCl). In these conditions, we observed that PHF14 is present both in the chromatin fraction and in the soluble nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Depletion of H2A.Z.1 (see the H2A.Z western blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) does not lead to a reproducible decrease of PHF14 in the chromatin fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> for the quantification and a replicate). However, we consistently observed an increase of PHF14 amounts in the soluble nuclear fraction. Since there is no PHF14 in the cytoplasmic fraction in any of the conditions tested, this fractionation procedure resulted in higher PHF14 extraction from chromatin upon H2A.Z.1 knockdown, suggesting that H2A.Z.1 favours the interaction of PHF14 with chromatin.</p><p>Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2-containing nucleosomes provide docking sites in chromatin for PHF14 and SIRT1 respectively.</p><p>To investigate whether PHF14 and SIRT1 could be responsible for the effect of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 on gene expression, we analysed whether PHF14 and SIRT1 depletion could phenocopy H2A.Z isoform depletion. To do so, we transfected immortalized WI38 human primary fibroblasts with siRNAs against SIRT1 or PHF14. These siRNAs were efficient as verified at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR and at the protein level by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore they had no effect on total H2A.Z or H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysis of specific gene expression by qPCR indicated that on four out of the five genes we analysed, PHF14 depletion induces changes in a similar way compared to H2A.Z.1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained when comparing the effects of SIRT1 depletion with H2A.Z.2 depletion, with three out of the five analysed genes regulated in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Note however that fold changes on these genes upon depletion of H2A.Z isoforms or their effectors can be very different, indicating that other mechanisms may take place.</p><p>To confirm this finding at the genome wide level, we performed RNA-Seq analysis following depletion of SIRT1 and PHF14. We found 4189 and 2405 genes significantly regulated by PHF14 and SIRT1 respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary files 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">12</xref> for the complete list of de-regulated genes upon PHF14 and SIRT1 depletion, respectively). Strikingly, we observed that 30.6% of up-regulated genes and 38.5% of down-regulated genes in the siH2A.Z.1 condition were similarly regulated when PHF14 was silenced, which is a highly significant intersection (p=8,4*10<sup>−197</sup>and 0 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Likewise, 24.7% of up-regulated genes and 27.2% of down regulated genes in the siH2A.Z.2 condition were de-regulated in a similar way in the siSIRT1 condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, taken together, these data indicate that PHF14 and SIRT1 are major mediators of H2A.Z.1- and H2A.Z.2-specific gene regulation, since i) depletion of H2A.Z isoforms specifically affects their localisation ii) they affect transcription of a significant proportion of H2A.Z-regulated genes in a manner similar to the H2A.Z isoforms. Given that these effects can be positive or negative, our data further underline the function of PHF14 and SIRT1 in mediating the context-dependent regulation of specific gene transcription by H2A.Z isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>PHF14 and SIRT1 can mediate the antagonistic relationship between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2</title><p>Strikingly, when we analysed the PLAT mRNA, we found that co-depletion of SIRT1 along with H2A.Z.1 or PHF14 also abolishes the effects of H2A.Z.1 and PHF14 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This shows that SIRT1 mediates the antagonistic effect of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 on PLAT expression. Very similar results were observed for the AKAP12 mRNA concerning it specific repression by H2A.Z.2 (which is mimicked by depletion of SIRT1). Indeed, not only is this repression attenuated upon co-depletion of H2A.Z.1 along with H2A.Z.2 or SIRT1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but also upon co-depletion of PHF14 along with H2A.Z.2 or SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Given that SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase, we tested whether PHF14 could favour protein acetylation. Indeed, PHF14 and associated proteins were already proposed to function by counteracting the function of the repressive LSD1-CoREST complex, which contains histone deacetylases along the H3K4 demethylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wynder et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we depleted PHF14 using a specific siRNA and assessed whether it affected global site-specific histone acetylation by western blot analysis. Importantly, depletion of PHF14 strongly decreased global histone H3K9 acetylation, a known SIRT1-target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaquero et al., 2004</xref>), while it had only a mild effect, if any, on histone H3K14 acetylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> for a replicate) To test whether this global change in H3K9 acetylation could also be observed at promoters regulated by H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, we performed a ChIP assay against this acetylation mark. Spike-in chromatin was added to the samples as an internal control to increase accuracy of the ChIP measurements. We found that PHF14 depletion led to a decrease in H3K9 acetylation at two promoters regulated by H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, the <italic>RRM2</italic> and <italic>AKAP12</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

If we take into accounts all genes differentially regulated upon depletion of H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2 or both together, we found that 5005 and 6317 genes are deregulated in WI38 and U2OS cells, which represent roughly 1/4th of all expressed genes. Interestingly, the number of genes activated by either H2A.Z isoform is roughly equivalent to the number of genes they repress, in agreement with previous studies underlining a positive and negative role for H2A.Z in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramanian et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also found that there are many genes at which H2A.Z isoforms play similar roles including some on which they can compensate each other.

At these promoters, the presence of H2A.Z could regulate gene expression by affecting nucleosome structure or stability, or by recruiting proteins leading to similar outcomes on gene expression.</p><p>We further found that both isoforms regulate different sets of genes, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenberg et al., 2019</xref>), again confirming that despite their high similarity, they can play different roles. Finally, we found that on a significant number of genes, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can play opposite roles, with H2A.Z.1 acting as an activator and H2A.Z.2 as a repressor. Interestingly, at these two gene populations, analysis of the double depleted samples uncovers a general antagonism between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2.</p><p>Altogether, these data underline that H2A.Z isoforms H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can regulate gene expression similarly and antagonistically depending on the gene, uncovering a complex interplay.</p><p>We also provide major insights into the mechanism of this interplay. By ChIP-Seq analysis, we found H2A.Z isoforms are present on most promoters of expressed genes or genes prone to be expressed, as already shown for total H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). Clearly, the presence of a H2A.Z isoform around a TSS is not sufficient to predict the effect of this isoform on gene transcription. Rather, our ChIP-Seq data indicate that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.1 are incorporated at the same promoters and we found that they can replace each other. This replacement could explain the compensation between the two isoforms we observe for the regulation of many promoters.</p><p>These data also suggest that the two isoforms compete each other for the binding to gene promoters. As a consequence, at a promoter specifically regulated by a given isoform, the presence of the other isoform would counteract the presence and the function of the regulatory isoform. Such a model would explain the rather general antagonism we observe on genes specifically regulated by an isoform. It underlines the functional importance of the relative levels between the two isoforms.</p><p>Thus, the same mechanism, that is the ability to be incorporated at the same promoters, could explain both the compensation between H2A.Z isoforms at some promoters and their antagonism at others. It also fits with the fact that they can both interact with incorporation machineries (p400- and SRCAP complexes).</p><p>We next investigated how H2A.Z isoforms could differentially regulate gene expression. We identified proteins interacting preferentially with one isoform or the other, that is PHF14 with H2A.Z.1 and SIRT1 with H2A.Z.2. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that endogenous H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can differentially bind to proteins. Note however that it was previously found using overexpressed proteins that H2A.Z.1 nucleosomes were slightly more efficient than H2A.Z.2 nucleosomes in interacting with BRD2 as well as with PHF14, HMG20A and TCF20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Draker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pünzeler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A functional interaction between H2A.Z and SIRT1 in the nucleus was also already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baptista et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). The authors propose that deacetylation of H2A.Z by SIRT1 leads to its destabilization. However, we did not find any effect of SIRT1 depletion on H2A.Z expression in our hands. Moreover, such a mechanism would not explain the similarities in gene expression control by H2A.Z.2 and SIRT1. We rather found that depletion of H2A.Z.2 decreased the nuclear retention of SIRT1, in agreement with the interpretation that the H2A.Z.2/Sirt1 interaction is required for recruitment of SIRT1 in the nucleus.</p><p>Functional analysis of PHF14 and SIRT1 indicates that they can mediate, at least in part, the specific effects of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 on gene expression. In particular, we provide evidence that PHF14 and SIRT1 can mediate the functional antagonism between both H2A.Z isoforms. These two proteins would function as readers of the presence of a specific H2A.Z isoform at gene promoters. Upon depletion of one isoform, the other isoform takes over, resulting in changes in the amount of promoter-bound PHF14 and/or SIRT1. These changes may in turn affect gene expression in a context-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that PHF14 favours acetylation of histones, at least on H3K9 residues at its target promoters. Thus, this may provide a mechanism by which PHF14 and SIRT1 mediate opposite effects on gene expression: when H2A.Z.1 is depleted, there is less recruitment of PHF14 and more recruitment of SIRT1, shifting the balance towards local deacetylation, whereas when H2A.Z.2 is depleted, the balance is shifted towards local acetylation. Such changes in acetylation of histones or non-histone proteins could mediate the context-dependent regulation of gene expression. However, the fact that there are many genes regulated by H2A.Z isoforms H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 but not by PHF14 and SIRT1 suggests that other mechanisms mediate H2A.Z gene expression regulation, such as changes in nucleosome stability, as previously proposed, or interaction with other specific effectors.</p><p>Our data thus indicate that the relative levels of H2A.Z isoforms is probably a major determinant of gene regulation and that changes in these levels lead to important changes in gene expression. Interestingly, the two H2A.Z isoforms are produced by two genes with two independent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>), providing a basis for the regulation of the relative isoforms levels by signaling pathways. In this respect, it will be of great interest to decipher the transcription factors and the signalling pathways regulating H2A.Z promoters. For example, we recently showed that the <italic>H2AFZ</italic> promoter is a direct target of the Wnt signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rispal et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, it is known that the expression of both isoforms is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage- dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryhurst et al., 2009</xref>). Our data suggest that these changes are essential for establishing the correct gene expression pattern associated with specific developmental pathways.</p><p>In addition to regulation of the H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z.2 relative levels, the potential regulation of the association between PHF14, SIRT1 or other readers with H2A.Z isoforms is clearly worth investigating. Our work points to the importance of the three residues differing between the two isoforms in the binding of specific partners. Strikingly, one of these differences (T14 in H2A.Z.1, A14 in H2A.Z.2) is located in the N-terminal tail basic patch important for H2A.Z function and target of multiple post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation or ubiquitylation. Furthermore, T14 of H2A.Z.1 could itself be phosphorylated which would likely affect adjacent lysine modifications (K13/15). Acetylation of H2A.Z has indeed been linked to transcriptional activation by many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valdes-Mora et al., 2012</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that post-translational modifications of this T in H2A.Z.1 or surrounding amino acids in H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 could regulate the recruitment of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 effectors, among which PHF14 and SIRT1, and therefore participate in the regulation of specific gene expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, the PHF14-complex contains many different PhD fingers, suggesting that it could function as a reader of H2A.Z.1 post-translational modifications.</p><p>Interestingly, a recent study showed that a S38T substitution in H2A.Z.1, mimicking T38 found in H2A.Z.2, rescues the SRCAP-dependent Floating-Harbor Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenberg et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the molecular determinants of PHF14 complex and SIRT1 binding to H2A.Z isoforms will be a first step towards the identification of the mechanisms underlying the context-dependent regulation of transcription by H2A.Z isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell cultures and transfections</title><p>Lung Fibroblastic cells WI38 hTERT RAF1-ER, which are immortalized by hTERT expression and contain an inducible RAF1 oncogene fused to estrogen receptor (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeanblanc et al., 2012</xref>), were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids and penicillin-streptomycin, in normoxic culture conditions (5%O2).</p><p>Osteosarcoma U2OS cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown in DMEM media with Glutamax (1 g/L glucose), supplemented with 10% of FBS, sodium pyruvate and penicillin-streptomycin.</p><p>K562 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Wisent) and GlutaMAX.

related isoforms of the variant histone H2A.Z. By engineering cells to allow the targeted depletion of one or both of these isoforms, the authors show, surprisingly, that these two nearly identical proteins work antagonistically, and make progress towards understanding the molecular basis of this interaction. The antagonism of two forms of the same histone variant/reader combination represents a novel mechanism for modulating gene activity, and should be of broad interest.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Integrated analysis of H2A.Z isoforms function reveals a complex interplay in gene regulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript deals with the functional analysis of the two histone variant H2A.Z isoforms. These isoforms are highly similar with only three amino acid differences, but have been recently shown to play distinct roles in tumor development, gene regulation and DNA repair. The authors have used siRNAs against edited epitope-tagged versions of the isoforms to disentangle their individual roles in gene regulation. H2A.Z occupies nucleosomes that flank active promoters and enhancers and has long been enigmatic in its effects on gene regulation, showing up-regulation at some genes and down-regulation at others. Here this finding is confirmed by isoform depletions in two different human cell lines, but the unexpected result is that depletion of both isoforms results in effects opposite to expectation, namely depletion of both isoforms restores a more wild-type-like situation.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers judged that the authors made important observations that are of interest for the histone variant and chromatin research field. There was some discussion of whether additional replicates and therefore more robust statistical analysis is required. Recognizing that doing such experiments might take more than 2 months and would therefore be inconsistent with <italic>eLife</italic> policy not to request such experiments, we are leaving the inclusion of additional data to the authors' discretion.</p><p>The reviewers made specific comments and questions listed below that we request be addressed in the revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figures 2 and 6 Venn diagrams are shown to indicate the number of genes showing effects caused by knockdown of either isoform and the overlap indicates the number of genes affected by both, with p-values based on Chi-square tests. However, astronomical p-values are the norm for such comparisons involving changes in thousands of genes, and the p-values are potentially sensitive to minor technical biases. Also p-values compare observations to random expectation, which is not the same as asking how different the results are from what no treatment would show. However, each experiment included a control siRNA, and so the degree to which technical variation might have inflated these p-values can be estimated by comparing each to its siRNA control as was done in the histograms and box-plots.</p><p>It is not always clear how many replicates are being analyzed, or what kind of statistics are being used to report on the data (c.f. Figure 1C). In some places it appears that error bars are being used for two samples.</p><p>Figure 1B: What is the band observed at around 20 kDa? Could this be modified, possibly ubiquitinated or sumoylated, endogenous protein? In this case, is such a shift also observed with the Flag-tagged histones? A larger view of the blot would be helpful, as well as blots with a Flag antibody.</p><p>Why do the authors use K562 cells instead of the in the study well-characterized U2OS cells for protein-pull-down assays? Do K562 cells show a similar effect in deregulated genes upon H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 depletion?</p><p>What is the experimental difference compared to previously performed mass-spectrometry-based identifications of H2A.Z interactors? The authors should indicate in the Results section whether they used nuclear extracts, chromatin-fractions, mononucleosomes, whole cell extracts or others. Why were the authors not able to identify direct and strong H2A.Z interacting proteins such as e.g. BRD2 (Draker et al., 2012), PWWP2A (Pünzeler et al., 2017), but were able to identify the p400 chaperone complex that interacts mostly with free nuclear H2A.Z proteins? Did the authors use chromatin-free nuclear extracts?</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: The figure legend is not sufficient to describe the experimental data in a way that it is understandable. What does NT mean? Not transfected, no tag? It would be good to show where the primers bind to explain the size differences between H2AFZ and H2AFV PCR products. Ideally, the authors would include western blot analysis with H2A.Z antibody for these cells as done for U2OS cells in Figure 1.</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1E: The legend describes 5 classes, shown are 4 groups labelled with G1-G4. Are these groups labelled according to gene expression levels: G1 is lowest and G4 highest? More information is required to understand the figure.</p><p>Figure 6: the authors should indicate how many times these experiments were repeated. In A) H2A.Z western blots should be shown to document knock-down efficiency. Also, H2A.Z.1 seems to lead to an increase in Flag-PHF14 while H2A.Z.2 depletion to a decrease. The authors should quantify this result and, if reproduced, check whether PHF14 RNA transcripts are also affected. Hence, more experiments are required to strengthen the statement: &quot;Thus H2A.Z.1 favours the interaction of PHF14 with chromatin&quot;, especially since there is no difference observed in PHF14 levels in the chromatin fraction upon H2A.Z.1 depletion. Similar for SIRT1 (Figure 6B).</p><p>Figure 6C and Figure 1D: when comparing the effects of PHF14 or SIRT1 depletion on the expression of those six gene with the effects observed with H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 depletion, I do not agree with the conclusions made by the authors in the subsection “PHF14 and SIRT1 are major H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z.2 effectors”. The authors should use the same axis values to better compare the results. It appears that only the PLAT and AKAP12 genes shows a similar trend, all other genes look different. ZDHHC20 shows only minimal increase when PHF14 is depleted (4-fold in siZ1 conditions), RRM2 is not much lower in siSIRT1 conditions, but half the amount in siZ2, COLEC12 and ADAMTS1 do not show any change, but 3/4-fold increases in siZ2 treatments. Also, while there is some overlap of deregulated genes in Figure 6D, E, the statement &quot;Thus, taken together, these data indicate that PHF14 and SIRT1 are major mediators of H2A.Z.1- and H2A.Z.2-specific gene regulation…&quot; is an over-interpretation of the data. The conclusion should be toned down or other data should be included that strengthen this statement.</p><p>Figure 7: Additional replication would be ideal for 7B and additional targets, including ones not dependent on isoform, for 7C.</p><p>The authors state: &quot;The conclusion from these experiments is that PHF14 and SIRT1 could have antagonistic effect on local protein acetylation balance, providing a molecular mechanism by which PHF14 and the SIRT1 deacetylase can mediate H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 antagonism&quot;. This is a too strong conclusion, as no experiments have been performed to show that H3K9ac changes upon PHF14 depletion are due to SIRT1 activity at those sites. Many other proteins can contribute to the observed effects. In order to make such a statement, the authors need to perform PHF14 and SIRT1 ChIP-seq experiments to show their localization at H2A.Z sites and how their localization changes when H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2, PHF14 or SIRT1 are depleted. Hence, I would also remove the model in Figure 7D.</p><p>Discussion: This is not the first study showing that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 bind differentially to proteins. Draker et al. already showed a preference of BRD2 binding to H2A.Z.1, an observation also confirmed by Pünzeler et al. Further, in Pünzeler et al., PHF14, HMG20A, TCF20 and RAI1 were seen to be enriched on H2A.Z.2 nucleosomes when compared to H2A.Z.1 nucleosomes, as was also seen for other interacting proteins. The authors should rephrase their conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53375.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figures 2 and 6 Venn diagrams are shown to indicate the number of genes showing effects caused by knockdown of either isoform and the overlap indicates the number of genes affected by both, with p-values based on Chi-square tests.

Differentially expressed genes were then identified compared to these two control samples (i.e., for example, PHF14 and SIRT1 RNA-Seq were analyzed compared to two controls transfected in parallel, which are different from the two controls used for H2A.Z isoforms depletion. We modified the Materials and methods section to clarify this point.</p><p>We next tested whether the regulation of genes after H2A.Z.1 depletion is independent, or not, with the regulation of genes after H2A.Z.2 depletion. We also tested whether the regulation of genes after H2AZ.1 or H2AZ.2 depletion is independent, or not, with the regulation of genes after PHF14 or SIRT1 depletion, respectively. The Chi-square testprovides a method for testing the association between 2 variables in a two-way table. The null hypothesis H0 assumes that there is no association between the 2 variables (In other words, one variable does not vary according to the other variable), while the alternative hypothesis H1 claims that some association does exist. In all the dependencies we tested (except one shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), the tests indicated that we can reject the H0 hypothesis.</p><p>However, we do agree with the reviewer that the Chi-square test gives astronomical p values when analyzing large populations. As the reviewer says, it compares to random expectations. In order to clarify how different the result is from random, we now indicate in all Venn diagrams of the revised manuscript the expected number of common genes in the case of random intersection, providing the quantitative data requested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not always clear how many replicates are being analyzed, or what kind of statistics are being used to report on the data (c.f.

Note that in the original manuscript (as well as in data added for revision), all histograms presenting qPCR data were calculated on three entirely independent experiments. The only exception were histograms comparing RT-qPCR with RNA Seq data (now Figure 2—figure supplement 1), given that in this figure, we analyzed by RT-qPCR the two experiments used for RNA-Seq. We now show the RT-qPCR results from the two samples side-by-side.</p><p>The only other experiment where error bars were calculated using two replicates was the quantification of the western blot shown in Figure 1C.

These data indicate that in these two cell lines this band is present, confirming that it is indeed produced from endogenous H2A.Z, and that it is observed with the two isoforms. It most likely corresponds to ubiquitinated H2A.Z, in a ratio that has been reported before in the literature. This Flag western blot in U2OS cells is shown in the revised manuscript in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and the Flag western blot in K562 cells is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. The text of the manuscript has been changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why do the authors use K562 cells instead of the in the study well-characterized U2OS cells for protein-pull-down assays?

This was actually indicated in the Materials and methods section, but we agree with the reviewer that it is important. Indeed, it explains why we detect the p400, SRCAP and chaperone complexes but not BRD2 and PWWP2A proteins which were identified in over-expressed H2A.Z nucleosome pull-downs from digested chromatin fractions. Accordingly our mass spec data indicates a majority of H2A.Z-H2B dimers compared to octamers. In the revised manuscript, we modified the Results section to indicate the different purification approach compared to what has been reported in other studies. At the same time our different approach provides a new distinct interactome dataset, in a completely physiological setting since we purified endogenous H2A.Z isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C: The figure legend is not sufficient to describe the experimental data in a way that it is understandable.
