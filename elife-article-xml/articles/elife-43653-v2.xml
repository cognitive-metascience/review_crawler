This latency suggests that a population of residual tumor cells can survive treatment and persist in a dormant state for many years. The role of the microenvironment in regulating the survival and proliferation of residual cells following therapy remains unexplored. Using a conditional mouse model for Her2-driven breast cancer, we identify interactions between residual tumor cells and their microenvironment as critical for promoting tumor recurrence. Her2 downregulation leads to an inflammatory program driven by TNFα/NFκB signaling, which promotes immune cell infiltration in regressing and residual tumors. The cytokine CCL5 is elevated following Her2 downregulation and remains high in residual tumors. CCL5 promotes tumor recurrence by recruiting CCR5-expressing macrophages, which may contribute to collagen deposition in residual tumors. Blocking this TNFα-CCL5-macrophage axis may be efficacious in preventing breast cancer recurrence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43653.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Recurrence of breast-cancer five or more years after initial diagnosis and treatment causes more than half of these deaths. This suggests that some tumor cells survived treatment and persisted undetected. These residual tumor cells may not grow for years and are often surrounded by other cells, including immune system cells. What role these surrounding immune cells play in triggering future growth of these residual tumor cells is not clear.</p><p>Many breast cancer patients receive chemotherapy, which kills all quickly dividing cells. Targeted therapies, which block signals necessary for cancer cell growth, are also used often. More recently, scientists have developed treatments that use a patients own immune system to fight off cancer. Scientists are currently studying whether combining these immunotherapies with chemotherapy or targeted therapies increases the likelihood of eliminating cancer. Learning more about the role surrounding immune cells play in allowing residual tumor cells to persist and regrow is important to understanding how to treat cancer more successfully and prevent recurrence.</p><p>Now, Walens et al. show that immune cells called macrophages supply residual breast cancer cells in mice with a protein called collagen that they need to grow. In the experiments, mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer called Her2 received targeted cancer therapy. After the treatment, tumor cells in the mice released small molecules called cytokines that attract immune system cells. Levels of one cytokine called CCL5 rose after treatment and remained high in residual tumors in the mice. The experiments also revealed that CCL5 levels were high in residual breast cancer tumors collected from women.</p><p>This shows that high levels of CCL5 appear to shorten the amount of time between tumor treatment and recurrence because CCL5 attracts macrophages that deposit collagen in the residual tumors. Scientists believe collagen promotes tumor growth because recurrent tumors have high levels of collagen and breast cancer patients with high levels of collagen in their tumors often have worse outcomes. Treatments that prevent or block the release of CCL5 or that stop macrophages from supplying the residual tumor cells with collagen may help prevent recurrence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>CCL5</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 CA220957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walens</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA208042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>James V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006512</institution-id><institution>Duke University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>James V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CCL5-dependent macrophage recruitment drives breast cancer recurrence through collagen deposition in residual tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2018, it is estimated that approximately 270,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 41,000 women will succumb to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siegel et al., 2018</xref>). Historically, over half of these deaths are due to recurrence 5 or more years after initial diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that in a subset of patients, there is a population of clinically undetectable residual tumor cells that survive therapy, and may serve as a reservoir for eventual relapse. The long latency of recurrence has led to speculation that residual tumor cells are slowly growing or even dormant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hölzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein, 2009</xref>). Understanding how residual cells survive therapy, persist in a non-proliferative state, and eventually resume proliferation to form recurrent tumors is critical for preventing recurrences.</p><p>Much of the work examining mechanisms of tumor cell survival and recurrence following therapy has focused on tumor cell-intrinsic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sosa et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic mutations that render cells resistant to therapy represent an important mechanism of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>), but there is emerging evidence that non-genetic pathways can also promote survival in response to therapy. For instance, a population of cells called drug-tolerant persisters has been shown to survive therapy through epigenetic adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has been shown to promote cell survival in response to EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, alterations in apoptotic pathways within tumor cells can promote cell survival in response to both chemotherapy and targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damrauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabe et al., 2018</xref>). In spite of this extensive literature on cell-intrinsic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, much less is known about tumor cell-extrinsic contributions to cell survival following therapy. Specifically, while there has been some recent focus on how the tumor microenvironment can promote tumor cell survival in response to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meads et al., 2009</xref>), little is known about whether the microenvironment regulates tumor cell survival, dormancy, and eventual recurrence.</p><p>We used a conditional mouse model of Her2-driven breast cancer to examine interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment during tumor dormancy and recurrence. In this model, administration of doxycycline (dox) to bitransgenic MMTV-rtTA;TetO-Her2/neu (MTB;TAN) mice leads to mammary gland-specific expression of epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) and the development of Her2-driven tumors. Removal of dox induces Her2 downregulation and tumor regression. However, a small population of residual tumor cells can survive and persist in a non-proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moody et al., 2002</xref>). These cells eventually re-initiate proliferation to form recurrent tumors that are independent of Her2. Using this model, we sought to understand how the interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment regulates residual cell survival and recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Her2 downregulation induces an inflammatory gene expression program driven by the TNFα/IKK pathway</title><p>To understand how interactions between tumor cells and their environment change in response to therapy, we first examined gene expression changes following Her2 downregulation in Her2-driven tumor cells. Two independent cell lines derived from primary Her2-driven tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moody et al., 2002</xref>) were cultured in the presence of dox to maintain Her2 expression, or removed from dox for 2 days to turn off Her2 expression. Changes in Her2 expression following dox withdrawal were confirmed by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Changes in gene expression were measured by RNA sequencing. Her2 downregulation led to widespread changes in gene expression in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that an E2F signature was the most highly enriched gene set in cells with Her2 signaling on (+dox; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with previous literature and the observation that Her2 is required for the proliferation of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the gene sets most significantly enriched in cells following Her2 downregulation (-dox) were an inflammatory gene signature and a TNFα/NFκB gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These gene sets comprised genes encoding chemokines in the CCL family (CCL2, CCL5, and CCL20) and CXCL family (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL10), proteins that mediate cell-cell interactions (TLR2, ICAM1, and CSF1) as well as signaling components of the NFκB pathway (NFΚBIA and NFΚBIE).

Although the concentrations of dox (2 μg/ml) we use to culture primary tumor cells are well below these levels, we wanted to confirmed that the NFκB pathway activation observed following dox withdrawal was due to loss of Her2 signaling. To do this, we treated primary tumor cells with Neratinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Her2, to inhibit Her2 signaling without removal of dox. Neratinib treatment led to an increase in phospho-p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), increased expression of TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and increased expression of the NFκB targets CXCL5 and CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). To further confirm that the low concentrations of dox used to culture primary tumor cells do not directly inhibit the NFκB pathway we treated NIH3T3 cells with TNFα in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml dox and measured NFκB target genes. Dox treatment had no effect on the induction of NFκB target genes following TNFα treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Her2 inhibition leads to activation of the NFκB pathway.</p><p>Given the coordinated upregulation of these NFκB target genes, we reasoned that their expression may be induced by a common upstream secreted factor acting in an autocrine manner. To test this, we collected conditioned media from primary tumor cells grown in the absence of dox for 2 days. This conditioned media was supplemented with dox to maintain Her2 expression and added to naive primary tumor cells. Treatment with conditioned media led to a time-dependent upregulation of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). One common upstream mediator of this cytokine response is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and we found that TNFα expression is increased between 10-fold and 100-fold following Her2 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To test whether this is sufficient to activate downstream signaling pathways, we examined activation of the NFκB pathway following treatment with conditioned media from cells following Her2 downregulation. Indeed, we found that treatment of naive cells with Her2-off (–dox) conditioned media led to rapid, robust, and prolonged activation of the NFκB pathway as assessed by phosphorylation of p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, Her2 levels remained high in these target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), indicating that Her2-off (–dox) conditioned media can activate the NFκB pathway even in the presence of Her2 signaling. In contrast, conditioned media from Her2-on (+dox) cells had no effect on p65 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Finally, we tested whether the induction of chemokine genes following Her2 downregulation was dependent upon the NFκB pathway by treating cells with the IKK inhibitor, IKK16. We found that blocking IKK activity blunted the induction of all chemokine genes following dox withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Her2 downregulation leads to the induction of a pro-inflammatory gene expression program, likely driven by autocrine-acting TNFα and mediated through the IKK-NFκB pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Immune cell infiltration during tumor regression and residual disease</title><p>Her2 downregulation in Her2-driven tumors in vivo induces apoptosis and growth arrest, ultimately leading to tumor regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moody et al., 2002</xref>). However, a small population of tumor cells can survive Her2 downregulation and persist for up to 6 months before resuming growth to form recurrent tumors. These residual tumors can be identified histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Many of the cytokines and chemokines induced shortly after Her2 downregulation function as chemoattractants for various immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binnewies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López et al., 2017</xref>). This led us to speculate that Her2 downregulation in vivo may promote infiltration of immune cells into the tumor. We therefore asked whether the immune cell composition of tumors changed during tumor regression and in residual tumors. CD45 staining showed that leukocyte infiltration increased dramatically following Her2 downregulation as compared to primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, leukocytes remained high in residual tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Masson’s trichrome staining revealed prominent collagen deposition in residual tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with a desmoplastic response in residual tumors. Staining for the macrophage marker F4/80 showed a dramatic increase in macrophage abundance during tumor regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and macrophage levels remained elevated in residual tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). CD3 staining showed increased T cell infiltration in regressing and residual tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Her2 downregulation leads to the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes, and specifically F4/80+ macrophages. Residual tumors contain high numbers of macrophages and abundant collagen deposition, consistent with a desmoplastic response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43653.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Immune cell infiltration during tumor regression and residual disease.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) H and E-stained section of a representative residual tumor from a previously tumor-bearing MTB/TAN mouse.

The large number of immune cells present in residual tumors suggests that these cells may function to regulate the behavior of residual tumor cells. To begin to address this, we sought to identify secreted factors that are expressed in residual tumors. Residual tumor cells in the autochthonous MTB;TAN model are unlabeled and are diffusely scattered throughout the mammary gland, precluding their isolation. Therefore, we used an orthotopic model in which residual tumors can be easily isolated. In this model, primary Her2-driven tumors are digested, cultured, and infected with GFP. Cells are then injected into the mammary fat pad of recipient mice on dox to generate an orthotopic primary tumor. Following dox withdrawal, the fluorescently labeled residual tumors can be easily microdissected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We first confirmed that the orthotopic model exhibited similar patterns of immune cell infiltration as the autochthonous model. Indeed, we found that macrophage staining increased dramatically during tumor regression and in residual tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), suggesting the orthotopic model is appropriate for identifying secreted proteins present in these residual tumors.</p><p>We generated a cohort of orthotopic primary tumors (n = 4) and residual tumors at 28 days (n = 6) and 56 days (n = 6) following dox withdrawal. Residual tumors were microdissected using a fluorescent dissecting microscope. We then made protein lysates from all samples and measured the expression of cytokines and chemokines using antibody-based protein arrays. Four primary tumors and four 28 day residual tumors were profiled using a commercially available cytokine array, which measures the expression of 20 secreted factors. We then used a second commercially available cytokine array, which measures 40 cytokines and chemokines, to measure cytokine expression in the whole cohort of tumors. This analysis identified eight cytokines that were upregulated in residual tumors as compared to primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; fold change &gt;2, p &lt; 0.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), including CCL5, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We found that only two cytokines, CCL5 and OPG, fulfilled these criteria. Given that OPG has previously been associated with dormancy, we focused our attention on CCL5. We then wanted to determine if CCL5 expression was elevated in human residual breast tumors following treatment. We analyzed a gene expression dataset of residual breast tumors that remain following neoadjuvant targeted therapy. A number of secreted factors were upregulated in residual tumors as compared to primary tumors, and CCL5 was one of the most significantly upregulated cytokines in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–M</xref>).

We found that CCL5 knockout had no effect on the latency of recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We observe an increase in CCL5 levels during tumor regression and in residual tumors that is concomitant with immune cell infiltration. We therefore reasoned that the effect of CCL5 overexpression on recurrence may be mediated through its ability to recruit one or more of these cell types to residual lesions and recurrent tumors. CCL5 can signal through multiple receptors, including CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, but it predominately acts through CCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soria and Ben-Baruch, 2008</xref>). We therefore examined CCR5 expression on various immune and stromal cells in primary tumors (+dox), regressing tumors (5 days –dox), residual tumors (69 days –dox), and recurrent tumors by flow cytometry. As expected, Her2 was downregulated following dox withdrawal in all tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For each cell type, we measured the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CCR5 staining in CCR5+ cells.

To address this, we sorted CD45+/CD11b+/F4/80+ macrophages from primary, residual and recurrent tumors from the autochthonous MTB;TAN model by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and then isolated RNA from the sorted cell populations for RNAseq. Residual tumor-associated macrophages did not yield sufficient RNA for RNAseq, but we were able to sequence RNA from primary, regressing, and recurrent tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Examination of differentially expressed genes between primary and recurrent TAMs suggested that FACS-sorted TAMs may have been partially contaminated with tumor cells. For instance, we detected Her2 expression at high levels in primary TAMs and low levels in recurrent TAMs. Therefore, we used a gene expression dataset of primary and recurrent tumor cells cultured in vitro to filter the TAM expression list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). After filtering, we were left with approximately 200 genes that were differentially expressed between primary and recurrent tumor macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, genes encoding fibrillar collagen and collagen deposition proteins were more highly expressed in the recurrent TAMs than the primary TAMs or regressing tumor TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These genes include Collagen alpha-1(V) chain (COL5A1), Collagen type XXIV alpha 1 (COL24A1), Procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 (PCOLCE), and Asporin (ASPN). COL5A1 and COL24A1 encode fibrillar collagens, PCOLCE encodes a glycoprotein that binds and drives the cleavage of type one fibrillar procollagen, and ASPN encodes a protein that binds to fibrillar collagens to regulate mineralization. We next sought to validate these findings by performing qPCR analysis on primary, regressing, residual, and recurrent TAMs. This analysis showed that the expression of these genes progressively increased during tumor regression, residual disease, and recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, qPCR on RNA isolated from bulk tumors showed higher expression of COL5A1 and COL24A1 in recurrent tumors, while a subset of recurrent tumors had high expression of ASPN and PCOLCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with this, Masson’s trichrome staining showed increased collagen deposition in residual and recurrent tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, middle and bottom). In order to see if similar gene expression patterns are observed in residual disease in breast cancer patients, we examined gene expression data from residual tumors after neoadjuvant targeted therapy. Indeed, expression of these four collagen genes increased in residual tumors following therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we asked whether CCL5 regulates collagen deposition by comparing collagen levels in control and CCL5-expressing recurrent tumors. While control recurrent tumors had uniform levels of collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), a subset of CCL5-expressing tumors had very high levels of collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CCL5 promotes macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition. Given the importance of collagen for regulating tumor cell function, this may be one mechanism by which CCL5 expression accelerates recurrence. This is reminiscent of findings in colorectal cancer, where collagen deposition can be mediated in part through CCR2+ macrophages, and depletion of these macrophages inhibits tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afik et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43653.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Macrophages express collagen and collagen deposition factors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RNA-seq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from primary (n = 3), regressing (5 days -dox; n = 3), and recurrent (n = 3) tumors.

Understanding the pathways that promote residual cell survival – and that induce the reactivation of these cells to generate recurrent tumors – is critical for designing therapies to prevent breast cancer relapse. There has been extensive focus on tumor cell-intrinsic pathways that allow cells to survive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>). However, the role of tumor cell-extrinsic factors, including the tumor microenvironment, in regulating the survival and recurrence of residual cells has not been extensively explored.</p><p>Here, we used a conditional mouse model to investigate how interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment change during tumor regression, residual disease, and recurrence, and in turn how the microenvironment regulates tumor recurrence. We found that Her2 downregulation led to induction of a pro-inflammatory gene expression program comprising a number of chemokines and cytokines, including CCL5. This program was mediated by autocrine TNFα and dependent upon IKK/NFκB signaling. Notably, a recent study identified a similar gene expression program in EGFR-mutant lung cancer following treatment with EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this pro-inflammatory gene expression program, we observed differences in immune and stromal cell infiltration during tumor regression. Both adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and innate (macrophages) immune cells were recruited to regressing tumors. The residual tumor microenvironment is markedly different from that of primary tumors, with high numbers of macrophages and fibroblasts, abundant collagen deposition, and differential expression of a suite of cytokines, including CCL5. Functionally, CCL5 overexpression promotes macrophage recruitment, collagen deposition, and promotes tumor recurrence. These results identify CCL5 as a critical regulator of crosstalk between residual tumor cells and the residual tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor recurrence.</p><p>A number of studies have found that Her2 signaling directly activates the NFκB pathway, and that this is functionally important for tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed basal levels of p65 phosphorylation in primary tumor cells. Surprisingly, we found that Her2 inhibition further activates the NFκB pathway, and that this occurs through an autocrine pathway that is likely mediated by increased TNFα expression. Hyperactivation of the NFκB pathway in turn leads to the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines which may contribute to the recruitment of immune cells. These findings are consistent with prior work showing that the NFκB pathway is required for macrophage recruitment in a similar Her2-driven mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings add to these previous studies by showing that Her2 inhibition leads to hyperactivation of the NFκB pathway and increased macrophage recruitment.</p><p>CCL5 has been shown to play an important role in many facets of tumor progression, such as invasion, metastasis, neoangiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinucci and Colombatti, 2014</xref>). In glioblastoma, CCL5 upregulation has been correlated with recurrence in post-treatment tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudson et al., 2018</xref>). In triple-negative breast cancer, CCL5 expression has also been correlated with residual tumor size and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araujo et al., 2018</xref>). However, CCL5 has not previously been implicated in residual cell survival or recurrence in Her2+ or hormone receptor positive breast cancer. By analyzing gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant targeted or chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Creighton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stickeler et al., 2011</xref>), we show here that CCL5 expression is elevated in residual tumor cells that survive therapy. A notable observation in our study is that while CCL5 expression promoted recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), knockout of CCL5 in tumor cells did not delay recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggests that CCL5 may be at least partially redundant with other chemokines, such as CCL2 and CXCL1 and 2, in recruiting macrophages to promote recurrence.</p><p>Mechanistically, we show that CCL5 acts to recruit CCR5+ macrophages to residual tumors, consistent with its known role as a chemoattractant factor for macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mantovani et al., 2017</xref>). RNAseq analysis of primary and recurrent TAMs suggested that recurrent TAMs have high expression of genes encoding fibrillar collagen and proteins required for collagen deposition. qPCR analysis indicated that residual TAMs shared this gene expression program. Consistent with this, collagen deposition is high in residual and recurrent tumors, and CCL5 expression promotes collagen deposition. Collagen deposition is traditionally thought to be driven by fibroblasts in the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thannickal, 2012</xref>). However, a recent report showed that macrophages are responsible for collagen deposition in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afik et al., 2016</xref>). Collagen deposition is important for tumor progression and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Provenzano et al., 2008</xref>). Collagen bundles can potentiate cell migration and increase tissue stiffness, and enzymes which crosslink collagens are often upregulated in breast cancer and are correlated with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that collagen deposition may promote the survival or proliferation of residual tumor cells, and that this mediates the effect of CCL5 on tumor recurrence.</p><p>The findings reported here suggest that efforts to block CCL5-driven macrophage infiltration and subsequent collagen deposition may have therapeutic benefit. Possible therapies include the use of Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Velasco-Velázquez et al., 2012</xref>), and agents that block macrophage infiltration or function, such as the CSF-1R inhibitor PLX3397 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeNardo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strachan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). It is also possible that, because CCL5 is sufficient but not necessary for tumor recurrence, it would be preferable to block the induction of the pro-inflammatory program that is induced following Her2 downregulation using agents targeting TNFα or the NFκB pathway.</p><p>It is important to note that while our studies focus on the function of CCL5 in recruiting CCR5+ macrophages, breast cancer cells themselves can also express CCR5. Indeed, previous studies have found that CCR5 acts in tumor cells to promote stem cell expansion and metastasis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Velasco-Velázquez et al., 2012</xref>). Although in the current study we find that in residual tumors CCR5 is expressed at higher levels in macrophages than on tumor cells, it is possible that tumor cell-expressed CCR5 may mediate at least some of the effects of CCL5 on tumor recurrence. Future work with mice lacking CCR5 on specific cell types will clarify the relative important of CCR5 on macrophages and tumor cells.</p><p>The survival and recurrence of residual tumor cells is a critical clinical problem in breast cancer. The results identified here show that interactions between residual tumor cells and their microenvironment are critical for recurrent tumor formation. Targeting tumor cell-microenvironment interactions may hold promise for preventing recurrent breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Briefly, cohorts of 6-week-old recipient mice (nu/nu or TAN) on doxycycline were injected bilaterally in the #4 inguinal mammary fat pad with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> primary tumor cells (expressing either a control sgRNA, a sgRNA targeting CCL5, CCL5 cDNA, or GFP cDNA). Once tumors reached 5 mm (2–3 weeks), doxycycline was removed to initiate oncogene down-regulation and tumor regression. Mice were palpated biweekly to monitor tumor recurrence, and sacrificed when recurrent tumors reached 10 mm. Differences in recurrence-free survival between control and experimental cohorts were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>) and evaluated by the p-value from a log-rank test and the hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard regression, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Power calculations were used to determine cohort size for each in vivo experiment.

We enrolled extra mice in each cohort to account for tumor take rates and unexpected mortality.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Päivi Ojala as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a conditional mouse model of Her2-driven breast cancer Walens et al. purports to show that Her2 downregulation in the cancer cells leads to an inflammatory program and they start to express a TNFa-NFkB-driven chemokine CCL5 thereby promoting immune cell infiltration in regressing and residual tumors. This increases the survival and recurrence of dormant residual breast cancer cells through the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The results are consistent with many reports that the progression of breast and other cancers involves macrophage activation and recruitment. By utilizing an orthotopic primary tumor model of GFP- or CCL5-transduced Her2-driven tumor cells, they demonstrate that CCL5 is sufficient but not necessary to shorten time to recurrence, and that the recruited TAMs express high levels of collagen thereby possibly contributing to the observed high collagen deposition in the recurrent tumors. Overall the authors need to separate out their original work from the previously published studies, by citing the prior studies by others that are directly relevant to their work. Moreover, the impact of the manuscript would be substantially improved by finding a more specific, direct mechanistic connection to Her2, and further evidence of clinical and human relevance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the experimental setup the authors use + dox, which regulates the transgene (Her2/Erbb2) expression, and draw conclusions about NFkB signaling. However, tetracyclines per se inhibit NFkB profoundly, and have been shown to recapitulate many of the effects seen by the authors upon Her2 expression in the + dox samples. Therefore, further evidence that the effect of Her2 is to inhibit NFkB is required.</p><p>2) As most of the non-Tet system effects occur at µg/ml, and most of the Tet-system specific regulation occurs at the ng/ml level, the authors should address this important control, by confirming at which levels of dox they are seeing their effects.</p><p>3) The authors first conclusion that Her2 downregulation in mammary tumors increases NFkB mediated tumor inflammation is the opposite to current thinking based on previous studies which had shown, (using ponasterone inducible IKBSra transgenic mice and cell lines derived from such mice), that Her2 in mammary tumors induces NFkB and thereby recruits F4/80+ macrophages (PMID:19349372, PMID:21159656). This principle has been supported in about 400 subsequent citations. Thus, it is important to determine the validity of each step in the new claims and it is also important for the authors to place their findings in the context of the current understanding of this field and provide a clear explanation of the reason for the differences. For example, dox is known to inhibit NFkB signaling including most of the cytokines noted in the current study (Tang et al., Molecular Cancer 2017, 16:36 and references therein; DOI: 10.1007/s12640-015-9592-2 and PMID: 27732942). In order to show that downregulation of Her2 causes an increase in NFkB, more direct evidence is needed including but not limited to:. 1) 1A. (1C,D) Her2 levels should be shown. 2) 1F + dox conditioned medium control must be shown, 3). Evidence that the inhibition of NFkB (Figure 1) is not due to the known ability of dox to inhibit NFKB signaling. 4). Reference prior original literature i.e. Her2 induces E2F signaling (original reference; Lee et al. 1999 (DOI: 10.1128/MCB.20.2.672-683.2000).</p><p>4) It is not clear why the authors initially focused their attention on CCL5 in the validation experiment described in Figure 1D as CCL5 was not among the most differentially regulated genes in the RNASeq analysis shown in Figure 1B-C. Moreover, in the cytokine profiling assays (Figure 3A) CCL5 was again expressed at the lowest levels (3-6 pg/ml) compared to the others which were 100-1000-fold more abundant. Therefore, it would be necessary to explain and justify why they chose to concentrate on CCL5, and not the other more abundant chemokines in the inflammatory signature found in residual tumors after Her2 down-regulation.</p><p>5) In relation to CCR5 in macrophages, CCR5 is known to be expressed in breast cancer epithelial cells, TAMs and CAFs. Analysis of 2,200 human breast cancers showed a substantial number of Her2+ breast cancers expressing CCL5 and CCR5 and that CCR5+ cells give rise to new tumors and metastasis when compared with CCR5- cells (PMID:29358169, PMID:22637726). In drawing their conclusions about CCR5 on macrophages being central, the authors need to determine CCR5 expression in their breast cancer cells (at the very least in Figure 2). Moreover, in Figure 2B-D the data needs to be quantified.</p><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Shows expression of several genes in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors. The P values need to be cited, and relevance to the current studies need to be clarified.</p><p>7) Figure 5 is thought to reflect the relationship of Her2 and CCR5 in the tumor. What is CCR5 expression in the breast cancer cells herein? The assumption of the studies is that Her2 levels changes with dox withdrawal. What is Her2 abundance in primary tumor, 5 days after dox withdrawal, residual tumor and recurrence? The proportion of CCR5+ macrophages increases as does the mean intensity of fluorescence. Does MFI reflect the receptor number? 5 days after dox removal, assuming Her2 abundance is decreased, the proportion of CCR5+ and CCR5- cells' MFI is discordant for the cells examined (macrophages, CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and fibroblasts). Please explain and provide similar data for the CCR5 on the breast cancer cells.</p><p>8) The text describing the collagen deposition in the control (GFP) tumors as compared to the CCL5-expressing recurrent tumors in Figure 6F (subsection “Macrophages express and secrete collagen and collagen deposition factors”) is a bit controversial. Shouldn't abundant collagen deposition be seen also in the recurrent control tumors if they are due to CCL5-attracted TAMS as shown in Figures 2D and 5A? One would assume that CCL5-overexpressing tumors just have more.</p><p>9) The authors statement that &quot;CCL5 had not previously been implicated in residual cell survival and recurrence&quot; is not entirely accurate. E.g. Araujo et al. (Sci. Rep 2018; PMID:29559701) showed that in triple negative breast cancer tumor infiltrating lymphocyte recruitment was correlated with residual tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and CCL5 expression. Moreover, Hudson et al. (Front. Oncol. 2018; PMID: 30151353) have recently shown a correlation between glioblastoma recurrence and CCL5 up-regulation in the post-treatment tumors. This statement should be rephrased accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43653.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the experimental setup the authors use + dox, which regulates the transgene (Her2/Erbb2) expression, and draw conclusions about NFkB signaling.

We have performed two new experiments that we believe address this point, and support the conclusion that Her2 inhibition leads to NFkB pathway activation:</p><p>i) We have used the small-molecule dual Her2/Her3 inhibitor Neratinib as an alternative means of inhibiting Her2 signaling. These results demonstrate that, even in the presence of doxycycline, Her2 inhibition leads to induction of phospho-p65 and an increase in NFkB target genes CCL5, TNFa, and CXCL5. These results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-F.</p><p>ii) We have treated NIH 3T3 cells with TNFa in the presence or absence of 2 ug/ml doxycycline, which is the dox concentration we use to culture primary Her2-driven tumor cells in vitro. These results demonstrate that this low dox concentration has no effect on TNFa-mediated expression of NFkB target genes. These results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G.</p><p>iii) Finally, we note that the experimental design for the conditioned media experiments presented in Figure 1D and 1F suggest that NFkB pathway activation is due to Her2 inhibition rather than due to a direct effect of dox on NFkB pathway. Specifically, in these experiments we conditioned media in the absence of dox, collected this conditioned media, and then replenished the media with dox prior to adding it to primary tumor cells. This indicates that Her2 inhibition leads to the production of a secreted factor(s) that can activate the NFkB pathway even in the presence of doxycycline. We have clarified the experimental setup and elaborated upon this point on Pages 6-7. In addition, we have added qRT-PCR analysis of Her2 transgene levels in this conditioned media experiment to Figure 1—figure supplement 1H to demonstrate that dox replenishment maintains Her2 levels in target cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As most of the non-Tet system effects occur at µg/ml, and most of the Tet-system specific regulation occurs at the ng/ml level, the authors should address this important control, by confirming at which levels of dox they are seeing their effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the dox concentrations used for these experiments (Page 6). For in vitro experiments, dox was used at 2 μg/ml. This is well below the dox concentrations that have been shown to inhibit NFkB signaling. For instance, in Santa-Cecília et al. (PMID 26745968) the lowest concentration of dox that inhibits the NFkB pathway is 200 μM, which is 103 μg/ml (see Figure 5 of Santa-Cecília et al.). In Alexander-Savino et al. (PMID 27732942) dox was used at concentrations between 5-40 μg/ml, and the most potent inhibition of NFkB targets (e.g. Bcl2, see Figure 6A in Alexander-Savino et al.) occurred at 40 μg/ml. These concentrations are 8-fold to 50-fold higher than the concentration we use to culture primary tumor cells. The lowest concentrations of dox that have been shown to inhibit NFkB pathway are from Tang et al. (PMID: 28178994). This paper showed that 5 ug/ml dox led to a ~20% decrease in basal levels of the NFkB target gene CCL2 levels, and did not affect LPA-induced CCL2 levels (see Figure 4 in Tang et al.). In addition, this concentration of dox had very modest effects on nuclear translocation of NFkB (see Figure 5 in Tang et al.). In contrast, dox withdrawal in primary Her2-driven tumor cells led to ~10-fold induction of CCL2 (Figure 1G) and a marked increase in p65 phosphorylation (Figure 1F). In combination with the results described in Point #1 above, we believe this argues that the NFkB pathway activation observed following dox withdrawal is due to loss of Her2 signaling rather than a consequence of dox-mediated inhibition of the NFkb pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors first conclusion that Her2 downregulation in mammary tumors increases NFkB mediated tumor inflammation is the opposite to current thinking based on previous studies which had shown, (using ponasterone inducible IKBSra transgenic mice and cell lines derived from such mice), that Her2 in mammary tumors induces NFkB and thereby recruits F4/80+ macrophages (PMID:19349372, PMID:21159656).

Specifically, Liu et al., 2009 (PMID 19349372) nicely show that Her2 activation leads to an increase in NFkB transcriptional activity, and that this is required for transformation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. However, we note that we do observe basal p65 phosphorylation in Her2-driven tumor cells (see Figure 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Based on this, we propose a model wherein Her2-driven mammary tumor cells have NFkB pathway activation, consistent with previous literature. Her2 inhibition (through either dox withdrawal or Neratinib treatment) leads to TNFa secretion and <italic>hyperactivation</italic> of the NFkB pathway. We have added text to the Discussion (third paragraph) that both cites this very important literature, and attempts to put our findings in the context of what was previously known about the relationship between Her2 and NFkB.</p><p>In addition, we agree that each of the specific points raised here by the reviewers is important. We address each point individually:</p><p>Subpoint #1: We have included qRT-PCR data showing Her2 transgene expression for the experiment shown in Figure 1A, 1C, and 1D. These results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Subpoint #2: We have performed the conditioned media experiment as requested. These results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, and support our conclusion that the NFkB pathway is activated by conditioned media from cells following Her2 downregulation but from cells cultured with Her2 signaling on.</p><p>Subpoint #3: Please see our response to Point #2, above.</p><p>Subpoint #4: We apologize for the omission. We have added this reference to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear why the authors initially focused their attention on CCL5 in the validation experiment described in Figure 1D as CCL5 was not among the most differentially regulated genes in the RNASeq analysis shown in Figure 1B-C.

We were interested in cytokines that fulfilled two criteria: (1) were acutely upregulated following Her2 downregulation (Figure 1); and (2) were persistently elevated in residual tumors compared to primary tumors (Figure 3). We reasoned that these cytokines were most likely to influence the behavior of tumors throughout the duration of residual disease and recurrence. Only two cytokines – CCL5 and OPG – fulfilled both criteria. Given that the function of OPG in regulating dormant cell proliferation has been described, we focused on CCL5. We have explained our reasoning in the second paragraph of the subsection “Cytokine profiling of residual tumors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In relation to CCR5 in macrophages, CCR5 is known to be expressed in breast cancer epithelial cells, TAMs and CAFs.

To address this, we directly compared CCR5 expression between macrophages (CD45+ / CD11b+ / F4/80+ cells) and tumor cells. (We have found that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of CD45– cells are tumor cells (data not shown)). We used qRT-PCR on sorted populations of macrophages and tumor cells from primary, regressing, residual, and recurrent tumors. These data show that CCR5 is consistently expressed at higher levels in macrophages as compared to tumor cells, though tumor cells from both regressing and residual tumors do express some CCR5. These data are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. While these data support the importance of macrophage-expressed CCR5, we agree that our data do not exclude a role for CCR5 expression on tumor cells as mediating some of the effects of CCL5. We have added text to the Discussion highlighting this fact, and citing the relevant papers mentioned by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Shows expression of several genes in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors. The P values need to be cited, and relevance to the current studies need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added P-values to Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and expanded upon the relevance of the gene expression changes in residual human breast cancers in the last paragraph of the subsection “Cytokine profiling of residual tumors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5 is thought to reflect the relationship of Her2 and CCR5 in the tumor. What is CCR5 expression in the breast cancer cells herein? The assumption of the studies is that Her2 levels changes with dox withdrawal. What is Her2 abundance in primary tumor, 5 days after dox withdrawal, residual tumor and recurrence? The proportion of CCR5+ macrophages increases as does the mean intensity of fluorescence. Does MFI reflect the receptor number? 5 days after dox removal, assuming Her2 abundance is decreased, the proportion of CCR5+ and CCR5- cells' MFI is discordant for the cells examined (macrophages, CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and fibroblasts). Please explain and provide similar data for the CCR5 on the breast cancer cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5, we intended to demonstrate that there is an increase in CCR5 expression on macrophages in residual tumors. We apologize for any confusion caused by the presentation of the data. To clarify these results, and to address the reviewers’ questions, we have made the following changes:</p><p>- We have added a panel showing CCR5 expression on tumor cells to Figure 5E, and included the flow histograms in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>- We have performed qRT-PCR for the Her2 transgene on primary, regressing (5d –dox), residual, and recurrent tumors to confirm Her2 downregulation; this is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>- As described in Point #5 above, we also measured CCR5 expression on tumor cells using qRT-PCR; these results are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>- We originally presented CCR5 staining in two ways: first, by showing the percentage of each cell type that expressed CCR5; and second, by showing the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CCR5 staining in the CCR5+ population. We did this because some of the cell types exhibited a biphasic pattern of CCR5 expression, such that presenting the MFI of the entire population would not be informative. However, we recognize that this caused confusion, and so in the revised Figure 5 we show only the MFI of the CCR5+ population for each cell type. We believe this accurately and concisely demonstrates the point the there is an increase in CCR5 expression on macrophages in residual tumors.</p><p>- As described in Point #5 above, we recognize that CCR5 expression on tumor cells (and, to a lesser extent, fibroblasts) may also mediate some of the effects of CCL5. We have added text highlighting this point to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The text describing the collagen deposition in the control (GFP) tumors as compared to the CCL5-expressing recurrent tumors in Figure 6F (subsection “Macrophages express and secrete collagen and collagen deposition factors”) is a bit controversial. Shouldn't abundant collagen deposition be seen also in the recurrent control tumors if they are due to CCL5-attracted TAMS as shown in Figures 2D and 5A? One would assume that CCL5-overexpressing tumors just have more.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ point. We have amended the text (Discussion) to make clear that CCL5-expressing tumors have more collage deposition than control recurrent tumors, but that overall collagen deposition is high in both cohorts for the reason articulated by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors statement that &quot;CCL5 had not previously been implicated in residual cell survival and recurrence&quot; is not entirely accurate. E.g. Araujo et al. (Sci. Rep 2018; PMID:29559701) showed that in triple negative breast cancer tumor infiltrating lymphocyte recruitment was correlated with residual tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and CCL5 expression. Moreover, Hudson et al. (Front. Oncol. 2018; PMID: 30151353) have recently shown a correlation between glioblastoma recurrence and CCL5 up-regulation in the post-treatment tumors. This statement should be rephrased accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight. We have rephrased this section per the reviewers’ suggestion and added the relevant citations (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
