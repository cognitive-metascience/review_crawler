conformations when bound to transcriptional co-regulators. Many transcription factors contain a negative regulatory domain (NRD) that suppresses recruitment of transcriptional machinery through autoregulation of the TAD. We report the solution structure of an autoinhibited NRD-TAD complex within FoxM1, a critical activator of mitotic gene expression. We observe that while both the FoxM1 NRD and TAD are primarily intrinsically disordered domains, they associate and adopt a structured conformation. We identify how Plk1 and Cdk kinases cooperate to phosphorylate FoxM1, which releases the TAD into a disordered conformation that then associates with the TAZ2 or KIX domains of the transcriptional co-activator CBP. Our results support a mechanism of FoxM1 regulation in which the TAD undergoes switching between disordered and different ordered structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>Cdk</kwd><kwd>Plk1</kwd><kwd>nuclear magnetic resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benanti</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM125034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sgourakis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI143997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sgourakis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD018455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sgourakis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-12-131-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001445</institution-id><institution>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analysis reveals that two intrinsically disordered domains of the transcription factor FoxM1 co-fold to form an autoinhibited conformation, which is disrupted by a specific activating phosphorylation event.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transactivation domains (TADs) of transcription factors are responsible for recruiting transcriptional machinery to target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ptashne and Gann, 1997</xref>). TADs consist of structurally disordered domains, which facilitate adaptable association with multiple protein partners and, in some contexts, form interaction network hubs within liquid condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minezaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wright and Dyson, 2015</xref>). Considering their intrinsic disorder, it is critical to understand how TAD accessibility is restricted to regulate transcription factor activity. Accessibility can be modulated through cellular localization, co-factor binding, ligand binding, posttranslational modifications, protein stability, phase separation, or oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wright and Dyson, 2015</xref>). Many transcription factors, including critical regulators of cell division, contain a negative regulatory domain (NRD) that is thought to bind and inhibit the TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramsay and Gonda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spengler and Brattain, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wierstra and Alves, 2006a</xref>). Little is understood about how the NRD blocks accessibility of the intrinsically disordered TAD and how TAD release is achieved. Here we have identified the structural mechanisms underlying regulation of the mammalian Forkhead box M1 transcription factor (FoxM1).</p><p>FoxM1 is critical for dividing cells, as it activates expression of genes that facilitate mitotic entry, the mitotic program, and proper cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korver et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korver et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laoukili et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wonsey and Follettie, 2005</xref>). FoxM1 expression is normally confined to dividing cells and is found most commonly in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korver et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramakrishna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ustiyan et al., 2009</xref>). FoxM1 is essential for proper development; null mice exhibit an embryonic lethal phenotype due to liver, blood, heart, and lung abnormalities resulting from proliferation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramakrishna et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Aberrant expression and misregulation of FoxM1 are associated with multiple cancers and are directly related to increased proliferation, metastasis, chemoresistance, and poor therapeutic prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myatt and Lam, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raychaudhuri and Park, 2011</xref>). FoxM1 misregulation at both the transcriptional and protein level has been observed in adenocarcinomas, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinomas, leukemia, lymphoma, and many additional malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwok et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raychaudhuri and Park, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have shown that FoxM1 activates tumor metastasis, mediates drug resistance, and regulates pluripotency-associated genes responsible for maintaining tumor cells in their undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwok et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raychaudhuri and Park, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weigelt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xie et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, deletion of FoxM1 in cancer cells inhibits tumor development and growth and leads to increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalinichenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wonsey and Follettie, 2005</xref>). Chemical inhibition of FoxM1 has become an important therapeutic strategy that would benefit from further definition of FoxM1 structure and the biochemical mechanisms that control activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gormally et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Radhakrishnan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Structural characterization of transcription factors remains challenging as they are enriched in low complexity or intrinsically disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). Transcription factors may have folded domains, such as a DNA binding domain (DBD), but these domains are typically modular and interspersed among disordered sequences. FoxM1 contains four distinct functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): a negative regulatory domain (NRD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a region containing several cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) consensus sites (called here the Cdk site region or CSR) and a TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wierstra and Alves, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wierstra and Alves, 2006b</xref>). The DBD is the only region with a known well-ordered structure; it binds to promoter sequences of many cell-cycle regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littler et al., 2010</xref>). The NRD suppresses FoxM1 activity in transcription reporter assays, and it has been proposed that the NRD binds and sequesters the TAD from its association with the co-activators CBP and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laoukili et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wierstra and Alves, 2006a</xref>).

To confirm a direct interdomain association and to define more precisely the NRD and TAD domain boundaries, we purified recombinant protein constructs of various lengths and assayed their association in trans using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We first used an NRD-containing construct that includes the entire N-terminus of FoxM1 up until near the start of the DBD (residues 1–203 in human isoform FoxM1b) and a long C-terminal construct (residues 526–748) including the Cdk-site rich region (CSR) and putative TAD. We observe binding between these protein fragments and measured an affinity of K<sub>d</sub> = 2 ± 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Using sequence conservation we designed a minimal NRD (1-114) and minimal TAD (696-748) and found that they associate with comparable affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 3 ± 2 µM). When we attempted to shorten the constructs further, we found loss of affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), so we conclude that these fragments contain the approximate sequences necessary and sufficient for interdomain association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NMR structure of the NRD-TAD interface</title><p>We combined NMR with Rosetta structural modeling to understand how the FoxM1 NRD binds the TAD in the autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nerli and Sgourakis, 2019</xref>).

We found that spectra of the human NRD-TAD complex assembled from independently purified domains were generally of poor quality. We alternatively purified a protein construct for structural studies in which the minimal NRD and TAD were fused by a short cleavable linker (1-117/694-748).

We then combined the chemical shifts, NOE restraints, and RDCs to generate a set of structures using customized RASREC-Rosetta calculations, as described in Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We included only the core, structured sequences of each domain in the calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Sequences outside the core region are likely disordered, as suggested by no observable NOEs and low order parameters for assigned residues in the flanking regions. The structural ensemble of the NRD-TAD complex, which consists of ten top scoring models based on Rosetta energy function and good overall fit to the experimental data, showed high convergence with heavy atom root mean square displacements of 0.48 Å for core residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The NRD-TAD interface therefore consists of interstrand backbone hydrogen bonds between NRD β3 and TAD β4 and several van der Waals contacts between sidechains in those β−strands and the NRD helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). The backbone hydrogen-bonding network is supported by unambiguously assigned interstrand amide-amide NOE cross-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and, likewise, the sidechain interactions are supported by methyl-methyl NOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Interestingly, even when interacting with the NRD,~20% of the TAD is structurally well defined, while the majority of the TAD remains intrinsically disordered.

For these experiments, we used the TAD (696-748) and a longer NRD (1-203), which were the most stable constructs containing each domain in solution and the simplest to purify. We expressed and purified NRD constructs (residues 1–203) containing mutations in each of the three β-strands. These mutations, which replace hydrophobic sidechains for alanine, were made to residues on either the face of the β-sheet that interacts with the helix (proximal) or the face pointing away from the helix (distal). We find that mutations on the β-sheet face that is proximal to the helix all inhibit binding with the TAD, with mutations on the two strands closest to the TAD (V76A/I78A in β2 and F106A/L108A in β3) having the greatest effects. We find that mutations to the hydrophobic face of the NRD helix (I88A and L91A) also disrupt TAD binding. In contrast, mutations to the distal side of the NRD β-sheet only result in a modest decrease in affinity (I65A or V75A) or no change in affinity (I107A/I109A). We also substituted alanines for sidechains in the TAD near the NRD interface. We found that three mutations have strong effects on binding (V708A, L709A, L716A), while mutation at one sidechain that points toward the distal side of the sheet (M712A) has a modest effect.</p><p>We next tested the effects of mutations to the NRD-TAD interface on FoxM1 activity in U2OS osteosarcoma cells using a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We expressed WT and mutant FoxM1 together with a plasmid that contains six tandem Forkhead-response elements (6DB) or the promoter of PLK1 (PLK1p), a FoxM1 target gene, upstream from the luciferase gene. As previously described, luciferase activity increases upon expression of WT FoxM1 compared to transfection of empty vector, which reflects the ability of FoxM1 to transactivate luciferase expression from the promoters in the reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laoukili et al., 2005</xref>). We found that this activity is further increased upon expression of FoxM1 harboring mutations that destabilize the NRD-TAD interface. The cell reporter data generally correlate well with our in vitro ITC binding data. For example, a β1 strand mutant (I62A/I64A), which only produces a modest loss of binding affinity, does not significantly change FoxM1 activity in the cell assay. In contrast, mutations closer to the interface in NRD strands β2 and β3, the NRD helix, and the TAD have strong effects. We conclude that the WT FoxM1 activity in this assay is mitigated by autorepression and that, by destabilizing the NRD-TAD structure and association, these mutations inhibit autorepression and result in higher activity. One interesting exception to the observed correlation between the biochemical and cellular assays is the L716A mutation. This mutation results in complete loss of affinity but has a more modest activating effect in the luciferase assay compared to other TAD mutations. We explore below an additional role for this residue in activation through recruitment of CBP/p300 co-activator.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phosphorylation of Cdk consensus sites in FoxM1 does not modulate NRD-TAD affinity</title><p>In the current accepted model for FoxM1 activation, Cdk phosphorylation relieves NRD inhibition by directly destabilizing the NRD-TAD association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laoukili et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wierstra and Alves, 2006b</xref>). Deletion of the NRD in cells results in constitutively active FoxM1 independent of Cdk activity, and adding back of the NRD in trans restores the autoinhibition. Previous work has highlighted the importance of specific Cdk sites; for example, alanine mutations of T585, T596, S623, and S678 result in decreased FoxM1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lüscher-Firzlaff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2004</xref>). However, other results suggest a cumulative effect of Cdk phosphorylation activity on FoxM1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lüscher-Firzlaff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wierstra and Alves, 2006b</xref>). We addressed with purified domains whether phosphorylation of Cdk sites in human FoxM1 directly affects the inhibitory NRD-TAD association. For these assays, we phosphorylated Cdk consensus sites using Cdk2-Cyclin A (Cdk2-CycA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGrath et al., 2017</xref>), we verified phosphorylation by electrospray mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we measured affinities using the ITC assay. We first observed that phosphorylation of the NRD, which contains a single conserved consensus Cdk site (S4), has minimal effect on the affinity of the NRD for the CSR-TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While there are no consensus Cdk sites in the TAD, there are several sites in the Cdk site region (CSR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test if Cdk phosphorylation of this region directly affects the NRD-TAD association, we generated protein constructs in which the CSR is included with the TAD or fused to the NRD. The CSR-TAD construct (amino acids 526–748) binds the NRD with similar affinity whether or not it is first phosphorylated with Cdk2-CycA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The NRD-CSR fusion protein (amino acids 1–114 + 526–674) binds the TAD with similar affinity as the NRD alone and with similar affinity whether or not it is first phosphorylated with Cdk2-CycA. These measurements are consistent with the lack of Cdk sites near the NRD-TAD interface in our structural model. The observation here that phosphorylation of Cdk consensus sites has no direct effect on the repressive NRD-TAD interaction suggests that Cdk phosphorylation is not sufficient for activation of the FoxM1 transcription factor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46131.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Plk1 phosphorylation of Ser715 inhibits NRD-TAD association.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ITC binding affinities of NRD and TAD-containing FoxM1 fragments following Cdk phosphorylation as indicated.

We observed that the Plk1 phosphorylated-TAD no longer binds the NRD by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Of the four Plk1 sites, Ser715 is the only site that appears near the structured NRD-TAD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using TAD constructs with serine to alanine mutations, which cannot be phosphorylated, we tested the importance of specifically phosphorylating Ser715 on the NRD-TAD affinity. When the three other Plk1 sites are mutated, the phosphorylated TAD still lacks any detectable affinity for the NRD. In contrast, phosphorylation of a Ser715A construct results in no change in affinity. We conclude that Ser715 phosphorylation by Plk1 is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting the NRD-TAD association. These results are consistent with and explain the previous report that an Ser715A/Ser724A mutation decreases FoxM1 activation of several mitotic genes in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>). Ser715 is in strand β5 near the NRD-TAD interface; however, the sidechain is exposed to solvent, and it is not certain that phosphorylation directly inhibits the association through electrostatic repulsion. We suggest that phosphorylation destabilizes the β-hairpin conformation and/or stabilizes an alternative conformation of the TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrew et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riemen and Waters, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We used the luciferase reporter assay to probe how Plk1 phosphorylation of Ser715 influences autoinhibition in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar to as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>), we find that expression of Plk1 along with WT FoxM1 increases the 6DB-reporter expression 2.5-fold. No significant increase in reporter expression is observed if Plk1 is expressed with a FoxM1 S715A mutant, which is consistent with our in vitro data demonstrating that S715 phosphorylation is necessary for TAD-NRD inhibition. As above, we again observe that mutations to the NRD (I88A) or TAD (V708A/L709A) result in increased expression of reporter relative to WT. However, we only observe a slight 1.3-fold additional increase in reporter expression when Plk1 is co-expressed with FoxM1 I88A and no significant increase with FoxM1 V708A/L709A. We conclude that because the NRD-TAD interface is already destabilized in these mutants, phosphorylation does not result in additional activity. These results support our model that Plk1 phosphorylation of Ser715 activates FoxM1 by dissociating the repressive NRD-TAD interface.</p><p>Our results show that Plk1 phosphorylation and not Cdk directly inhibits the NRD-TAD association, yet strong evidence points to Cdk phosphorylation as an important step in the activation of FoxM1 during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laoukili et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lüscher-Firzlaff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wierstra and Alves, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wierstra and Alves, 2006b</xref>). In the CSR of FoxM1, there are two Cdk sites that when phosphorylated create canonical binding sites for the Plk1 polobox domain. These sites have been shown to recruit Plk1 to FoxM1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>). We also found using purified proteins that Cdk phosphorylation of the CSR induces Plk1 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming that the Plk1-FoxM1 association is direct and phosphorylation dependent. These results suggest that Cdk phosphorylation primes the polobox binding sites and enhances Plk1 binding and phosphorylation of the TAD. We propose that phosphorylation of the TAD by Plk1 ultimately inhibits the autorepressive NRD-TAD interaction, freeing the TAD to bind to co-activator CBP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The dissociated FoxM1 NRD and TAD domains are largely unstructured</title><p>To probe the structures of the NRD and TAD once they are dissociated, we acquired circular dichroism (CD) spectra on isolated human NRD (residues 1–114) and TAD (694-748) domains and compared them to the human homolog of the NRD-TAD fusion construct used for NMR (1-117/694-748; Δ25–50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Consistent with the NMR model, the spectrum of the fusion reflects the presence of structure. In contrast, the TAD and NRD spectra indicate relatively greater disorder, although they do reflect some secondary structure content. Because we could not efficiently phosphorylate the fusion in vitro with Plk1, we mimicked the dissociative effect of phosphorylation by introducing the V76A/I78A mutation. Like phosphorylation, this interface mutation inhibits NRD-TAD association in the ITC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CD spectrum of the V76A/I78A fusion protein also reflects significant disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which supports the conclusion that NRD-TAD binding and structure formation are interdependent. This interdependence is further supported by the observation that the structural core of the NRD-TAD complex is formed by hydrophobic residues from both domains. Notably, introduction of the same destabilizing V76/I78A mutation in the NRD alone has modest effects on the CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the conclusion that the WT NRD alone is already considerably disordered.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46131.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The dissociated NRD and TAD domains are intrinsically disordered.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) CD spectra of the indicated purified proteins.

Binding typically entails contacts from hydrophobic residues along the face of one or more short amphipathic helices in the TAD. Motifs such as ΦXXΦΦ or ΦΦXXΦ (Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue and X is any residue) are commonly observed in the TAD interacting sequences. Two sequences in the FoxM1 TAD contain such a motif and appear amenable to forming amphipathic helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We tested a L716A TAD mutant and found no detectable binding to TAZ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The importance of L716 for CBP association explains how NRD binding inhibits CBP association and likely explains why the L716A mutation did not result in similar increased FoxM1 activity in the luciferase assay as other mutations in the TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In its autoinhibited conformation, the NRD binds the TAD via a structured interface and stabilizes a β-hairpin conformation that is incompatible with co-activator binding. Cdk phosphorylation of the CSR domain induces Plk1 docking to FoxM1 and subsequent phosphorylation of Ser715. Phosphorylation destabilizes the TAD β-hairpin, which releases from the NRD, and both the NRD and TAD become disordered.

Whereas structural disorder is required for function, it follows that the induction of structure could be used to negatively regulate transcription factor activity by restricting accessibility, particularly of the transactivation domain. Indeed, our results show that the NRD of FoxM1 is able to bind the TAD and induce a structured conformation that is incompatible with its binding to co-activator protein. Interestingly, the repressed TAD has a β-hairpin structure, while the CBP bound state likely contains α-helical structures and involves a TAD sequence near the Ser715 phosphorylation site that overlaps with the NRD-binding sequence. Thus, FoxM1 regulation entails secondary structure switching of the TAD between strand, coil, and helical structures.</p><p>We find that Ser715 phosphorylation destabilizes the NRD-TAD association and that the dissociated TAD is intrinsically disordered and capable of binding CBP. Phosphorylation has been observed to control structural transitions as a means to regulate other intrinsically disordered proteins. For example, both the transcription factor Ets-1 and the translation regulator 4E-BP2 undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon phosphorylation, while the nucleophosmin protein dissociates from a structured pentamer to a disordered monomer upon phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitrea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pufall et al., 2005</xref>). FoxM1 demonstrates a new example in which the order-to-disorder transition occurs coincident with modulation of an intramolecular association between domains. This plasticity of disordered domains and the ability to regulate the plasticity through posttranslational modifications explains why intrinsically disordered proteins are so well suited to regulate biological function.</p><p>Unexpectedly, our data indicate that in the active FoxM1 conformation, in which phosphorylation inhibits the repressive NRD-TAD association, the NRD is largely disordered as well as the TAD. We propose that this additional disorder may be important to increase conformational flexibility within the context of chromatin, to promote regulation of FoxM1 stability, or to contribute to the formation of low complexity domain condensates as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laoukili et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minezaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wright and Dyson, 2015</xref>).

This result clarifies an indirect role for Cdk in driving FoxM1 activity through priming the CSR for Plk1 docking and further phosphorylation of the TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2008</xref>).

For data fitting in experiments involving the FoxM1 NRD, we adjusted NRD concentration such that the stoichiometry was close to 1. We chose this approach for the fitting, because we otherwise noticed variability in the n value that we attribute to difficulty measuring the NRD concentration from its low extinction coefficient. If no significant heat was detected above background, we conclude no association. In the case of titrating the TAD fragment 694–726 into 1–203, we observed small heats but could not fit the data, so we conclude the affinity must be weaker than 10 μM.</p><p>Equilibrium dissociation constants for CBP domain binding to FoxM1 TAD were obtained using ITC with Micro Cal VP-ITC system.

RASREC-Rosetta is a Monte Carlo-based fragment assembly approach that utilizes NMR chemical shifts to guide the conformation search for a near-native structure. Together with NMR chemical shifts, which aid in the selection of accurate secondary structural elements, we utilized NOE and RDC measurements that helped identify the correct fold of the two domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nerli et al., 2018</xref>). Alongside NMR data, RASREC-Rosetta uses optimized algorithms across six stages of resampling in a parallelized manner to achieve high structural convergence. During the initial stages of the protocol, various β-sheet topologies are sampled. In the subsequent stages, fragments derived from (i) high-resolution X-ray structures, and (ii) preliminary low-resolution conformations (from the initial sampling stages), are applied to intensify and finalize the folds of a target protein. In the final stages of the protocol, the low-resolution models generated during the initial and intermediate stages are refined in the Rosetta force field to produce high-resolution structures.</p><p>Structure calculations were set up with automated Python scripts available at the CS-Rosetta website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://csrosetta.chemistry.ucsc.edu">https://csrosetta.chemistry.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Prior to setting up these calculations, we (i) removed flexible end regions in the target sequence based on TALOS-N RCI-S<sup>2</sup> predictions, and (ii) used the trimmed target sequence and chemical shift values to pick structural fragments of amino acid lengths 3 and 9 (standard lengths). After these steps, we used the protein sequence, structural fragments, chemical shift, NOE and RDC measurements as input to the RASREC-Rosetta protocol. From a set of 100 models generated by RASREC-Rosetta in its final stage, we selected 30 lowest energy models from which we filtered ten converged structures that fit the experimental RDC data. We subsequently refined the final ensemble twice (first, using NOE and RDC data sets and second, without any data sets to eliminate heavy bias from NMR data) using Rosetta’s relax protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tyka et al., 2011</xref>). The structures of NRD-TAD domains were calculated by treating the protein as a single polypeptide chain with the TEV site as a linker, which was later removed from the models.</p><p>To calculate the structural models of the FoxM1 NRD-TAD domains, we used a total of 64 NOE distance restraints derived from highly sensitive SOFAST-based experiments recoded with short inter scan delays (200 msec) and long (300 msec) mixing times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These distance restraints consist of (i) 14 amide to amide, (ii) 11 amide to methyl, and (iii) 39 methyl to methyl NOEs. The observed intensities of the NOEs can be affected by distance-independent processes such as T1 relaxation and spin diffusion during the long NOE mixing time. Accordingly, we considered several additional parameters, alongside the signal intensities of the NOEs (relative to their diagonals), to calibrate upper distance bounds for all the three classes of NOE restraints described above. In particular, we performed an analysis of distance statistics within β-sheet structures in the PDB, and used preliminary models of the NRD-TAD domains calculated using more generous (7 Å), uniform NOE distance limits as benchmarks. First, we filtered NOEs based on high signal intensities. From a non-redundant set of 5 β-sheet X-ray structures in PDB, we found that anti-parallel β-strands have NOEs between pairs of amide protons within ~3 Å or ~5 Å and parallel β-strands within ~3 Å or ~4 Å. We then used the approximate relation that NOE signal intensities are inversely proportional to sixth power of distances (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the NOE signal intensity, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the proportionality constant and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the distance) to obtain estimates of upper distance bounds. To determine the proportionality constant, we used the strongest-intensity NOE and approximate distances between the amide protons from β-sheet X-ray structures in PDB. Further, we applied the estimated proportionality constant and measured signal intensities to generate upper distance bounds for other amide-amide NOEs. Similarly, we used preliminary models computed using fixed distance bounds to calibrate distances of amide-methyl and methyl-methyl NOEs. Using this process, we observed that the resulting convergence of NRD-TAD ensemble calculated by RASREC-Rosetta increased progressively, together with the optimization of structural quality parameters such as Rosetta energies and MOLPROBITY scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1x Penicillin Streptomycin and split every 2–3 days.

Lysates were added to 4X SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer (0.25 M Tris pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated to 95°C for 5 min. 10–20 μg total protein was then subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blotting with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-FoxM1 (Bethyl A301-533A-M), mouse anti-actin (Sigma A1978), mouse anti-Flag (Sigma F1804). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 ˚C overnight. Cells were then centrifuged, washed with PBS, washed with PBS with 0.5% Tween20, then incubated with IFA 5 μg/ml RNaseA for 30 min at 37 ˚C. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Data were collected using a Guava EasyCyte HT (Millipore) and analyzed with FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data availability</title><p>NMR backbone assignments for zebrafish FoxM1 TAD and phosphorylated TAD are available from the BMRB with accession number 27763 and 27764 respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lewis E Kay as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see the reviewers all agreed that the work is of high quality and general interest.</p><p>Marceau et al. reveal how the accessibility of a transactivation domain (TAD) that is predicted to be intrinsically disordered can be blocked by a negative regulatory domain (NRD), and the different roles that phosphorylation can play in regulating TAD access. These domains are contained in FoxM1, a critical activator of mitotic gene expression normally expressed in dividing cells, and a target for therapeutic intervention due to its role in multiple cancers. Solution NMR and CD spectroscopy showed that both the TAD and NRD undergo a disorder-to order transition to interact in a globular structure. Phosphorylation at a single site in the TAD by Plk1 kinase was sufficient to disrupt this interaction giving rise to a model where FoxM1 activation requires phosphorylation by Cdk to create a binding site for Plk1, which then phosphorylates the TAD, disrupting its interaction with NRD. This model is well supported by binding affinities measured by ITC, and FoxM1 transactivation assays in osteosarcoma cells. Overall, a detailed understanding of the inhibition of FoxM1 transactivation by NRD, and the role of phosphorylation in this process is well supported by the data. The authors took advantage of appropriate labeling and structure calculation strategies to use the limited amount of data that could be obtained from this challenging system to determine structures of sufficient quality to reveal these insights. Overall, the paper is clearly written, the figures are well-presented, and the data is of good quality, with analysis of interactions relevant for both FoxM1 activation and its transactivation activity. The work is novel for the binding-induced structure revealed in 2 intrinsically disordered domains for the activation of a key transcriptional activator in mitosis.</p><p>1) There is a minor issue with the CD data (Figure 5) that clearly shows a structural difference between the NRD-TAD fusion and isolated TAD and NRD, consistent with the proposed binding-coupled folding. Specifically, the shape of the spectra for isolated domains seem to reflect significant secondary structure content, which would be interesting to compare to the fusion by secondary structure deconvolution. In addition, there is a statement that the CD spectrum of the NRD-TAD fusion shows both α helical and β structure, which is difficult to see from the data shown, but would be better supported if the secondary structure deconvolution were done. This would require that protein concentrations be accurately determined. Some description of how protein concentrations were measured for spectra would be useful to assess the accuracy of the intensities shown. (The signal intensities are surprisingly different between these different constructs, as well as the reference spectra shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A.)</p><p>2) The figure legend for 2 (A) does not indicate the reason for boxed residues in the TAD sequence alignment.</p><p>3) Is it possible, through the addition of large excess amounts of co-activator domains to shift the equilibrium towards the active state. That is, while phosphorylation is clearly required for the physiological response, in a test-tube can large amounts of co-factor overcome the thermodynamic barrier? Or does phosphorylation (in addition to leading to unfolding) also increase binding in another way? Is there any evidence of a skewed equilibrium between inactive (NRD-TAD bound) and a minor state involving an activated complex? Have the authors tried relaxation dispersion experiments to test for this?</p><p>4) There is a concern in the use of the NRD-TAD fusion construct to solve the structure of the interdomain interaction. While the fusion construct is a better mimic of the native modular architecture of the protein, the authors should indicate potential caveats with using the fusion. For example, as demonstrated here, and in many instances in the literature, IDPs/IDRs' are very plastic, with seemingly little changes (i.e. solution conditions, PTMs, binding partner, protein expression tags) having significant effects on their conformation state. To make sure that the presence and/or the nature of the linker is not what is inducing this structure it is suggest that the authors think of a way of comparing the spectra (NMR, CD, Fluorescence, DSC thermogram or any technique that's sensitive to structure) of the apo NRD, apo TAD, complex NRD + TAD (i.e. trans) with that of the fusion NRD-TAD construct (i.e. cis). Can the authors show data of the labeled isolated NRD (TAD) titrated with unlabeled isolated TAD (NRD) and show that spectra obtained overlay with that of the NRD-TAD fusion. This should demonstrate the presence of the co-disorder-to-order transition upon binding.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the enrichment of IDRs in transcription factors to show that these proteins are truly modular with all (or most) consisting of folded domains intersperse with IDRs. The following review could be of interest (Babu et al., 2012).</p><p>6) The results in this manuscript should be discussed in the context of other published PTM-mediate disorder-to-order (Pufall et al., 2005; Bah et al., 2015) and/or order-to-disorder transitions (Mitrea et al., 2014), to demonstrate the universality of IDR-folding plasticity for mediating biological function.</p><p>7) The authors may wish to perform bioinformatics disorder prediction of the NRD and TAD to complement the NMR/CD experiments. The program IUPRED will do (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot).</p><p>8) The authors should provide a table that shows all the thermodynamic parameters derived from the ITC data (i.e. the stoichiometry, enthalpy and entropy changes) in addition to the KDs.</p><p>9) It's difficult to follow which constructs are used for which assay and why. Sometimes it's the two minimal (or longer) constructs being tested in one assay, but at other times, it's one longer and one minimal (in the section of &quot;Disruption of the NRD-TAD interaction activates FoxM1&quot;). In the Reporter assays, FoxM1c isoform was used.</p><p>10) In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;Our observation of specificity in the effects of FoxM1 phosphorylation more resembles what has been proposed for the Cdk inhibitor Sic1&quot;. I don't think this statement is accurate enough. In the Sic1 story, multiple phospho-motifs bind to the same site on the Cdc4 using the same phospho-motifs themselves, resulting in a dynamic complex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46131.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is a minor issue with the CD data (Figure 5) that clearly shows a structural difference between the NRD-TAD fusion and isolated TAD and NRD, consistent with the proposed binding-coupled folding.

In agreement with the reviewers’ expectations, we found foremost that both the quality of the fit and the output secondary structure composition were highly sensitive to small changes in input concentration. We note in the experimental section that we measure concentrations using UV 280 nM absorption, but we have concerns of the accuracy of NRD and NRDTAD fusion concentrations because of the low extinction coefficient of the NRD. We also learned that performance of the deconvolution alogrithim is hampered by the noise in our data below 200 nM. For these reasons, we are hesitant to quantify composition and prefer to keep our interpretation focused on comparing qualitatively the degree to which the domains appear structured or not. The analysis did agree with the reviewer observation that the shapes of the isolated TAD and NRD domain spectra reflect the presence of some secondary structure, and we now note this point in the relevant Results section:</p><p>“In contrast, the TAD and NRD spectra indicate relatively greater disorder, although they do reflect some secondary structure content.”</p><p>Because we feel we cannot accurately perform the secondary structure deconvolution, we removed the comment that the fusion spectrum indicates both α and β structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The figure legend for 2 (A) does not indicate the reason for boxed residues in the TAD sequence alignment.</p></disp-quote><p>The boxed residues are the Plk1 phosphorylation sites.

We did observe perturbations in the spectrum upon addition of 500 µM TAZ2 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), which suggest weak affinity (we estimate Kd ~0.1-1 mM). As the reviewers propose, we conclude in the figure caption that even in the unphosphorylated, “inactive” state, there is likely an equilibrium that is modulated by the activting phosphorylation:</p><p>“The observation that TAZ2 binds at high concentration indicates that the TAD is in an equilibrium between a sequestered and accessible state even when FoxM1 is unphosphorylated and that phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a concern in the use of the NRD-TAD fusion construct to solve the structure of the interdomain interaction.

While the quality of the uncleaved fusion is relatively poor with some peaks missing, it is clear that the dispersion and pattern of the peaks are similar, and we feel confident that the linker does not drastically perturb the overall structure. We agree that we cannot be certain that the structural model presented here is exactly the same as in the full-length protein (a problem often faced by structural biologists!); however, we emphasize that the structural model strongly correlated with the mutagenesis results from the functional assay in cells.</p><p>We realize in light of the reviewers’ comments that we were not clear enough in the manuscript that the structure was solved with the linker cleaved, and we have tried to make this more explicit in the main text and in the new supplemental figure.</p><p>We have faced a technical challenge preventing us from doing the titration experiments as suggested. We cannot express soluble zebrafish NRD on its own. We can for the human protein, allowing us to do the in trans ITC binding experiments, but the human protein does not produce NMR data of sufficient quality. It is for this reason that the final zebrafish construct for structure determination was expressed as a fusion and then cleaved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss the enrichment of IDRs in transcription factors to show that these proteins are truly modular with all (or most) consisting of folded domains intersperse with IDRs.

For example, both the transcription factor Ets<sup>-1</sup> and the translation regulator 4E-BP2 undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon phosphorylation, while the nucleophosmin protein dissociates from a structured pentamer to a disordered monomer upon phosphorylation (Bah et al., 2015; Mitrea et al., 2014; Pufall et al., 2005). FoxM1 demonstrates a new example in which the order-to-disorder transition occurs coincident with modulation of an intramolecular association between domains. This plasticity of disordered domains and the ability to regulate the plasticity through posttranslational modifications explains why intrinsically disordered proteins are so well suited to regulate biological function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors may wish to perform bioinformatics disorder prediction of the NRD and TAD to complement the NMR/CD experiments. The program IUPRED will do (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/plot).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed IUPRED analysis as suggested. IUPRED predicts disorder in the NRD but predicts the TAD to be rather ordered. This resuls is at odds with the experimental NMR data (Figure 5C and 5D), which demonstrates the TAD alone is predominantly disordered. It is likely the structural propensity reflected in the TAD sequence is present because it forms structure upon binding the NRD or coactivator. We have chosen not to include the IUPRED analysis, as we find the experimental data more convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should provide a table that shows all the thermodynamic parameters derived from the ITC data (i.e. the stoichiometry, enthalpy and entropy changes) in addition to the KDs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included values for Kd, n (stoichiometry), and ΔH for each ITC experiment in an additional supplementary table (now Supplementary file 1). We choose not to report ΔS. While entropy could be calculated from the fit parameters for Kd and ΔH, we do not interpret ΔS or ΔH values to draw any conclusions in the manuscript, and we do not want to imply any interpretation. We include ΔH, because it is a fit parameter in determining the binding affinity from ITC data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It's difficult to follow which constructs are used for which assay and why. Sometimes it's the two minimal (or longer) constructs being tested in one assay, but at other times, it's one longer and one minimal (in the section of &quot;Disruption of the NRD-TAD interaction activates FoxM1&quot;). In the Reporter assays, FoxM1c isoform was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done our best to clarify where possible in the text. For the TAD, we use the short construct (696-748) in all assays except when fusions are made to the CSR region to look at effects of Cdk phosphorylation. For the NRD, we used the short construct (1-114) in all structural assays, e.g. CD and NMR, and the long construct (1-203) in all ITC binding assays.</p><p>We explained this construct choice for ITC assays in the “Disruption of the NRD-TAD interaction…” section:</p><p>“For these experiments, we used the TAD (696-748) and a longer NRD (1-203), which were the most stable constructs containing each domain in solution and the simplest to purify.”</p><p>We added the following rationale for construct choice in the CD experiments:</p><p>“We used the minimal NRD construct (1-114) for CD analysis, because sequence analysis and NMR data suggest the region between 115-203 is disordered.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;Our observation of specificity in the effects of FoxM1 phosphorylation more resembles what has been proposed for the Cdk inhibitor Sic1&quot;. I don't think this statement is accurate enough. In the Sic1 story, multiple phospho-motifs bind to the same site on the Cdc4 using the same phospho-motifs themselves, resulting in a dynamic complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the Sic1 story is complex, as Sic1 phosphorylation has elements of both specificity and redundancy. In order to avoid confusion, we have removed Sic1 as an example.</p></body></sub-article></article>
