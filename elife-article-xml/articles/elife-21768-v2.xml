and cargo transport. These functions are spatially regulated by association of dynein and its accessory complex dynactin with dynamic microtubule plus ends. Here, we elucidate in vitro the roles of dynactin, end-binding protein-1 (EB1) and Lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) in the interaction of end tracking and minus end-directed human dynein complexes with these sites. LIS1 promotes dynactin-dependent tracking of dynein on both growing and shrinking plus ends. LIS1 also increases the frequency and velocity of processive dynein movements that are activated by complex formation with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. This stimulatory effect of LIS1 contrasts sharply with its documented ability to inhibit the activity of isolated dyneins. Collectively, our findings shed light on how mammalian dynein complexes associate with dynamic microtubules and help clarify how LIS1 promotes the plus-end localisation and cargo transport functions of dynein in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21768.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21768.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>dynamic microtubules</kwd><kwd>lissencephaly-1</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd><kwd>EB1</kwd><kwd>cargo adaptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105178790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bullock</surname><given-names>Simon L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BA 5802/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumbach</surname><given-names>Janina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoang</surname><given-names>Ha Thi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An in vitro reconstitution approach reveals context-dependent roles of Lissencephaly-1 in the regulation of dynein-dynactin behaviour on dynamic microtubules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (hereafter referred to as dynein) is a 1.4 MDa, multi-subunit motor complex that is responsible for the vast majority of cargo transport towards the minus ends of microtubules in eukaryotic cells. Dynein’s cargoes include organelles, vesicles, aggregated proteins, mRNAs and pathogenic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodding and Way, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>). In addition to its function on motile cargoes, dynein plays important roles in organising microtubules in mitotic and interphase cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bader and Vaughan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dujardin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dujardin and Vallee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koonce et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Varma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Dynein – like all cytoskeletal motors – functions within cells on a dynamic network of tracks. Whereas the microtubule minus ends are often stabilised in vivo, the plus ends alternate between phases of polymerisation (‘growth’) and depolymerisation (‘shrinkage’)—a process known as dynamic instability. Microtubule plus ends are stabilised during growth by a cap of tubulin-GTP, with depolymerisation triggered when the GTP bound to β-tubulin at the microtubule tip is hydrolysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlier, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). The dynamic nature of microtubules facilitates exploration of the cytoplasm in order to establish and remodel contacts with cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lomakin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mimori-Kiyosue and Tsukita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tamura and Draviam, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Dynein is detected along the lattice of the microtubule, but is enriched at the plus end in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi and Murayama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma and Chisholm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schuster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaughan et al., 1999</xref>). Association of the motor complex with the plus end is important for its microtubule organising functions at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markus and Lee, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>) and for efficient initiation of retrograde cargo transport in polarised cells, including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Cellular and biochemical experiments have provided insights into how dynein is recruited to microtubule plus ends in mammalian cells. A key player in this process is p150<sup>Glued</sup> (hereafter p150), a subunit of the dynactin complex. Dynactin is a 1.1 MDa complex of 11 distinct components that co-precipitates with dynein and is critical for its plus-end targeting and cargo transport functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schroer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). p150 contains a CAP-Gly domain that can bind directly to members of the end-binding (EB) protein family such as EB1 or EB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjelić et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honnappa et al., 2006</xref>). EB proteins dynamically track polymerising plus ends through repeated transient binding events on a structure associated with the GTP- or GDP.Pi-tubulin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). p150 can also contact the intermediate chain of the dynein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karki and Holzbaur, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). These data suggest a mechanism for linking dynein to growing plus ends in which p150 acts as a bridge between EB proteins and the motor complex. Consistent with this model, a truncated version of a tissue-specific p150 isoform induces tracking of the human dynein complex on EB1-associated plus ends of growing microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duellberg et al., 2014</xref>). However, these experiments did not address how dynein associates with the plus ends of microtubules in the presence of the full dynactin complex.</p><p>It is also not clear how dynein complexes that undergo processive, minus end-directed motion are recruited to dynamic microtubules in mammalian cells. Reconstituting this process in vitro has been very challenging because individual mammalian dynein complexes rarely exhibit processive motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>). However, a way of activating minus end-directed motion of single mammalian dynein complexes in vitro has been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Olenick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schroeder and Vale, 2016</xref>). Association of dynein with both the dynactin complex and a cargo adaptor results in frequent processive movements along microtubules. In the context of a dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor complex, the motor also translocates faster and has a greater force output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>). Activation of dynein by dynactin and a cargo adaptor presumably allows robust minus end-directed motion to be coupled to the availability of cargo. The activating cargo adaptor that is best characterised is Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2), a coiled-coil protein that links dynein to several cargoes, including Golgi-derived vesicles and nuclear pore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). BICD2 uses its N-terminal regions (BICD2N) to associate with dynein and dynactin and its C-terminal regions to recruit cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) protein is another key player in the regulation of dynein function. Reduced expression of LIS1 causes the neurodevelopmental disease type 1 lissencephaly in humans by perturbing neuronal proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moon and Wynshaw-Boris, 2013</xref>). LIS1 forms a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2004</xref>) that interacts directly with the dynein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>) and is essential for its enrichment at dynamic microtubule plus ends in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). LIS1 is not, however, needed for association of dynactin with plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a specific role in recruitment of dynein to these sites. LIS1’s role in plus-end tracking of mammalian dynein has also not been addressed in previous in vitro reconstitution assays.</p><p>In addition to regulating association of dynein with microtubule plus ends, LIS1 is required for efficient transport of many dynein-associated cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pandey and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yi et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). In vitro experiments have shown that LIS1 increases the affinity of the isolated motor complex for microtubules and suppresses its mechanochemical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Torisawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">2008</xref>). The findings that LIS1 inhibits the activity of isolated dyneins in vitro yet promotes cargo transport by the motor in vivo appear somewhat contradictory. To reconcile these observations, it was proposed that LIS1 improves ensemble function of dynein on high-load cargoes by allowing the motor to enter into a persistent force producing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yi et al, 2011</xref>). This model cannot, however, readily account for the observation that LIS1 also promotes the transport of small cargoes in at least some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egan et al., 2012</xref>). An alternative model is that LIS1 promotes cargo transport by targeting dynein complexes to the microtubule, with transport initiation triggered by dissociation of LIS1 from the cargo-motor assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lammers and Markus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Markus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). This model has predominantly received support from elegant imaging and genetic studies in fungal systems, and it is not clear if LIS1 functions equivalently in mammalian cells. These models for LIS1 regulation of dynein activity are, of course, not mutually exclusive. Moreover, LIS1 could have additional roles in regulating dynein transport in vivo that were not evident in the in vitro reconstitution assays performed to date.</p><p>Here, we use total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-microscopy to investigate in vitro the roles of EB1 and LIS1 in plus-end tracking of human dynein in the presence of the full dynactin complex. We also investigate the influence of these proteins on interactions of minus end-directed dynein complexes with dynamic microtubules by including dynactin and BICD2N in the assay system. Our approach elucidates how mammalian dynein function is spatially regulated on dynamic microtubules and reveals context-dependent effects of LIS1 that help clarify its in vivo functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LIS1 stimulates plus-end tracking of dynein complexes on growing microtubules in the presence of EB1 and dynactin</title><p>We developed assay conditions that are permissive for the interaction of non-processive and minus end-directed mammalian dynein complexes with microtubules exhibiting dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; Materials and methods).

In the presence of both EB1 and dynactin there is an ~2–2.5-fold increase in the likelihood of landing on the plus end vs the lattice site; this behaviour is not influenced by the presence of LIS1 or BICD2N. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we observed an approximately six-fold preference for initiation of minus end-directed dynein complexes at the plus end vs an equivalently-sized GDP lattice site when BICD2N, dynactin and EB1 were present.

We therefore investigated if LIS1 can enhance the association of mammalian dynein with growing microtubule plus ends in a minimal in vitro system. It was previously shown that LIS1 cannot autonomously bind microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tai et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this finding, hardly any dynein tracking events were observed when the motor complex was mixed with LIS1 alone or LIS1 and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). LIS1 did, however, strongly increase the number of plus-end tracking events induced by the combination of dynactin and EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), without changing the duration of microtubule growth phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The duration of dynein tracking events on the growing plus end in the presence of EB1 and dynactin was also strongly increased by LIS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>); the mean duration of tracking events increased by more than three-fold, with a subset of motor complexes remaining bound to the growing plus ends for longer than 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We conclude from these experiments that LIS1 strongly increases the frequency and duration of tracking events of dynein on the plus end of growing microtubules in conjunction with EB1 and dynactin.</p><p>We next investigated if LIS1 increases the frequency of plus-end tracking events by dynein at the growing plus end by promoting the initial landing of the motor complex at this site. In order to do this, we compared the incidence of dynein complexes landing on the growing plus end vs an equivalently-sized site on the GDP lattice. The presence of both EB1 and dynactin in the chamber made dynein approximately twice as likely to land at the plus-end site than at the lattice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The addition of LIS1 to these proteins did not further increase the frequency of dynein complexes landing on the plus end vs the lattice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that LIS1 increases the frequency of tracking events by prolonging the association of dynein with the growing plus end after it has been targeted to this site by EB1 and dynactin.</p><p>Interestingly, in the same assays in which LIS1 increased the duration of plus-end tracking events by dynein in the presence of EB1 and dynactin, there was no significant change in the duration of lattice binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, LIS1 specifically increased the persistence of EB1- and dynactin-dependent binding of dynein at the plus end of growing microtubules. To determine if this effect was due to preferential association of LIS1 with dynein at the growing plus end, co-localisation experiments were performed with Alexa647-dynein and Tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR)-labelled LIS1 in the presence of dynactin and EB1. TMR-LIS1 was detected with the vast majority of Alexa647-dynein complexes tracking the growing plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that LIS1 directly regulates dynein behaviour at this site. TMR-LIS1 was also detected on a large proportion of dynein complexes that were associated with the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We conclude that LIS1 can associate with dynein at the growing plus end and on the lattice, but increases the duration of microtubule binding events only at the former site.</p><p>The observation that LIS1 does not influence the dwell time of human dynein on the microtubule lattice was unexpected as yeast LIS1 strongly increases the dwell time of monomeric yeast dynein on stabilised microtubules in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported using a bulk co-sedimentation approach that LIS1 can increase the association of porcine or bovine dynein with stabilised microtubules, which lack a dynamic plus end, in the absence of EB1 and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). To attempt to reconcile our findings with those of the previous studies, we investigated in more detail the influence of LIS1 on the interaction of single human dynein complexes with the microtubule lattice in the absence of EB1 and dynactin. These experiments used microtubules that were stabilised with taxol and GMPCPP, which facilitated the analysis of binding events by dynein. Using the same relative concentration of LIS1 to dynein used in our dynamic microtubule assays, we again detected no influence of LIS1 on the dwell time of the motor complex on the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The rate at which dynein complexes landed on microtubules was also not significantly influenced by LIS1 in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Even a 300-fold molar excess of LIS1 to dynein did not increase the dwell time of the motor complex on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in this condition, there was an approximately three-fold increase in dynein’s landing rate on the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Thus, a high relative concentration of LIS1 to dynein can increase the association of single motor complexes with microtubules by increasing the on-rate. This finding is compatible with the previous observations that LIS1 promotes the co-sedimentation of other mammalian dyneins with microtubules. The basis of the concentration-dependent effects of LIS1 on the association rate of human dynein with microtubules is unclear but could conceivably be related to more than one binding site for LIS1 on the dynein complex (see Discussion). Collectively, our data suggest that, unlike the situation with yeast proteins, human LIS1 is not sufficient to increase the dwell time of individual human dynein complexes on microtubules. LIS1 can, however, increase the dwell time of human dynein complexes at the plus ends of growing microtubules, which are recruited through EB1 and dynactin.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21768.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of the influence of LIS1 on the interaction of individual human dynein complexes with microtubules in the absence of other factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kymographs showing examples of dynein behaviour on taxol/GMPCPP-stabilised microtubules in the presence of the stated molar excess of LIS1 to dynein.

In order to investigate how mammalian dynein complexes that undergo minus end-directed motion are targeted to dynamic microtubules, both dynactin and the N-terminal region of BICD2 (BICD2N) were included in the in vitro assay. This region of BICD2 is sufficient to associate with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>) and stimulate processive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>).

We therefore investigated whether LIS1 can modulate EB1’s ability to target initiation of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N transport events to the plus end of growing microtubules. In the presence of EB1, dynactin, BICD2N and LIS1, we again observed a six-fold higher frequency in the initiation of processive dynein movements from the plus end vs an equivalently-sized GDP lattice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Thus, LIS1 did not alter EB1’s ability to bias transport initiation to the plus end. LIS1 did, however, stimulate both the frequency and duration of plus-end tracking events on growing microtubules in the presence of EB1, dynactin and BICD2N, without affecting the duration of static binding events by the motor on the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). No end tracking of dynein was observed when the motor complex was mixed with only EB1, BICD2N and LIS1 (32 growth phases analysed), confirming the essential role of dynactin in inducing this behaviour. Thus, LIS1 can promote EB1- and dynactin-dependent tracking of dynein on growing plus ends in the presence and absence of BICD2N in the assay chamber.</p><p>CLIP-170 can contact EB1, LIS1 and p150 and plays an important role in enriching dynein at microtubule plus ends in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lansbergen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Watson and Stephens, 2006</xref>). We therefore asked if, in vitro, CLIP-170 can stimulate the EB1-mediated targeting of processive dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes to growing plus ends in the presence of LIS1. The inclusion of both CLIP-170 and LIS1 did not alter the site of transport initiation of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes in the presence of EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, CLIP-170 did not affect the frequency or duration of plus-end tracking events of dynein observed in the presence of EB1, dynactin, BICD2N and LIS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). This latter finding is consistent with the observation that CLIP-170 does not influence the EB1-mediated plus-end tracking of a truncated p150 isoform in vitro unless competing EB1-binding peptides are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duellberg et al., 2014</xref>). We conclude that EB1, but not LIS1 or CLIP-170, is a key factor in targeting processive dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes to the plus ends of growing microtubules in our assay system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>End tracking dynein complexes are rarely a source of motor for minus end-directed movements</title><p>It has been hypothesised that tracking of dynein on the plus ends of growing microtubules in vivo produces a loading zone for cargo that is destined for minus end-directed transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vaughan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaughan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">2002</xref>). The finding that LIS1 can strongly increase the frequency and duration of dynein tracking events at the plus end without increasing the initiation of minus end-directed movements from this site suggests that such a mechanism is not at work in our experimental system. Indeed, further analysis revealed that in the presence of EB1, dynactin, BICD2N and LIS1, only 10% of minus end-directed movements from the plus end initiated from a plus-end tracking event of dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Instead, minus end-directed movements from the plus end almost always occurred immediately after engagement of the motor complex with this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was also the case when CLIP-170 was included in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, dynein complexes that track the plus ends of microtubules rarely act directly as a source of motors for minus end-directed transport in our assay conditions.</p><p>Plus-end tracking events may not be converted into minus end-directed transport events because dynein complexes are in a state that cannot accommodate BICD2N. To test this possibility, we produced Alexa647-labelled BICD2N and analysed its localisation on microtubules in the presence of EB1, dynactin, LIS1 and TMR-labelled dynein. As expected, Alexa647-BICD2N was detected on almost all minus end-directed TMR-dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), including those that initiated movement immediately after engaging with the growing plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Alexa647-BICD2N was also detected on ~40% of events in which TMR-dynein tracked the growing plus ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). The dual-labelled complexes that tracked the plus end never gave rise to minus end-directed transport events; all 38 dual-labelled complexes that initiated minus end-directed transport from the plus end did so immediately after docking at this site. Because dynein cannot track growing plus ends without dynactin, we conclude that the end tracking complexes containing Alexa647-BICD2N and TMR-dynein are dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes that are not capable of minus end-directed movement. The frequency of co-localisation of BICD2N with dynein complexes engaged in plus-end tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) was similar to that observed for static dynein complexes on the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This finding raises the possibility that end tracking behaviour of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes results from the recruitment of the non-processive subset of these complexes to the plus end, and that additional factors are required for transport of end tracking dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor complexes from this site in vivo (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LIS1 increases the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements</title><p>Our earlier results showed that LIS1 does not regulate the site of initiation of minus end-directed dynein-dynactin-BICD2N movements on dynamic microtubules. We next asked if LIS1 has any influence on the motility of dynein along microtubules in the presence of dynactin and BICD2N. Interestingly, LIS1 increased the proportion of microtubule-associated dynein complexes that underwent minus end-directed motion from 45% to 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When the relative concentration of BICD2N was reduced 10-fold, we observed hardly any dynein complexes exhibiting minus end-directed transport in the absence of LIS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In the presence of LIS1, however, a sizeable fraction of dynein complexes were transported towards the microtubule minus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Thus, LIS1 can induce dynein transport with dynactin and BICD2N concentrations that are otherwise insufficient to elicit this behaviour. We conclude that although LIS1 is not essential for minus end-directed movements of dynein when incubated with dynactin and BICD2N, it can strongly stimulate the frequency of these events.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21768.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>LIS1 promotes the frequency of processive minus end-directed movement of dynein in the presence of dynactin and BICD2N.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of the effect of LIS1 on the motile behaviour of microtubule-associated dynein complexes in the presence of BICD2N and dynactin.

We hypothesised that LIS1 promotes minus end-directed motion of dynein in the presence of dynactin and BICD2N in vitro by stimulating formation of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex. Quantification of fluorescent signals on microtubules revealed that LIS1 strongly increased the association of Alexa647-BICD2N with TMR-dynein in the presence of dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). Coupled to previous reports that dynactin is required for association of BICD2N with dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>), these data indicate that LIS1 promotes the assembly of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex.

Addition of LIS1 to dynein during the surface adsorption step did not inhibit the subsequent association of microtubules with the glass surface but did result in a dose-dependent inhibition of microtubule translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). As microtubules do not adhere to the surface in the absence of dynein in these assay conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoang et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that LIS1 does not inhibit microtubule gliding by displacing the motor complex from the glass. Confirming this notion, LIS1 could strongly inhibited microtubule gliding without reducing the amount of fluorescently labelled dynein on the glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We also confirmed that microtubules did not stably associate with glass surfaces incubated with only LIS1 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This finding corroborates the results of previous studies showing that LIS1 does not directly interact with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, LIS1 does not inhibit microtubule gliding by human dynein indirectly by providing a strong independent attachment between microtubules and the glass surface. We conclude that LIS1 can directly inhibit the ability of human recombinant dynein to glide microtubules. Thus, LIS1 exerts different functional effects on ensembles of isolated human dynein complexes in a gliding assay and on individual dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes running along immobilised microtubules.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21768-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21768.019</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>LIS1 inhibits microtubule gliding by surface-immobilised human dynein complexes.</title><p>Microtubules are labelled with HiLyte488-tubulin.

We confirmed that EB proteins do not track shrinking ends in our assay conditions, including those bound to dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This was achieved using an mCherry-tagged EB3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duellberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>), which induced tracking of dynein on growing plus ends in the presence of dynactin and LIS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate that although an EB protein is required for dynein to track the plus end during growth, this is not the case during shrinkage. Interestingly, we never observed dynein tracking on a shrinking microtubule plus end in the absence of dynactin (0/103 retention events following encounters of dynein with a shrinking end in the absence of dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) vs 123/228 events in the presence of dynactin <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">(Figure 8B</xref>)). Thus, dynactin appears to be required for the association of dynein with dynamic plus ends during bouts of shrinkage as well as growth.</p><p>We next asked whether LIS1 regulates association of dynein with the plus end of the microtubule during shrinkage. We first used fluorescently labelled proteins to determine if LIS1 is present on dynein that tracks shrinking ends. TMR-LIS1 was detected with Alexa647-dynein in 20 of 22 events analysed in which the motor remained associated with the plus end during shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Further analysis revealed that, although LIS1 was not essential for maintenance of dynein on the plus end after encountering a shrinking end, it did significantly increase the frequency of this behaviour in combination with (i) dynactin, (ii) EB1 and dynactin and (iii) EB1, dynactin and BICD2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We did not, however, observe an altered frequency of shrinking end tracking events of dynein when LIS1 was added to a combination of dynactin and BICD2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This result raises the possibility that LIS1 has context-dependent effects on dynein’s ability to track shrinking ends. Overall, however, our data provide evidence for a function of LIS1 in stabilising dynein complexes on the plus end of microtubules during shrinkage.</p><p>We next considered the possibility that dynein transitions to an active, minus end-directed stepping mechanism in order to remain attached to the plus end during shrinkage. To test this notion, we performed assays in the presence of ATP and vanadate. Vanadate leads to the formation of a stable complex (dynein-ADP·Vi), which mimics the ADP·Pi transition state and hence the pre-powerstroke conformation of the motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shimizu and Johnson, 1983</xref>). The experiment was performed in the presence of EB1, dynactin, BICD2N and LIS1, a condition in which tracking events on the shrinking end are frequently observed in the presence of ATP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Vanadate strongly inhibited the minus end-directed transport of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>), providing an internal control for its inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, association of dynein with the plus ends of shrinking microtubules was frequently observed in the presence of vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), with no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of these events compared to in the presence of only ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We also noted that vanadate did not disrupt end tracking of the full dynein complex during growth phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, the association of dynein with microtubule plus ends during both growth and shrinkage is not dependent on the ATP hydrolysis cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used an in vitro reconstitution approach to shed light on how mammalian dynein complexes interact with microtubules undergoing growth and shrinkage.

LIS1 also increases the velocity of minus end-directed dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes by associating with them. (<bold>C</bold>) The presence of LIS1 can increase the likelihood of dynein remaining associated with the microtubule upon encountering a shrinking plus end. (<bold>A, C</bold>) The tracking of dynein on both growing and shrinking microtubule plus ends appears to be mediated by indirect coupling of the dynein tail to these sites by dynactin. During growth phases, coupling of dynein to the plus end involves microtubule binding by EB1, which in turn uses its EEY/F and EB homology motifs to recruit the CAP-Gly of p150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honnappa et al., 2006</xref>). During shrinkage, the coupling is independent of EB1 and presumably involves the microtubule binding activity of dynactin, which also involves the CAP-Gly domain of p150. The microtubule-binding domains of dynein could conceivably stabilise the dynactin-dependent association of dynein with growing and shrinking plus ends (<bold>?</bold>). Note that LIS1 has not been placed in a specific position on the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex as previous studies have provided evidence for more than one binding site (see Discussion).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21768.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21768.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21768-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Insights into plus-end tracking of dynein complexes and the relationship to cargo transport</title><p>The targeting of mammalian dynein complexes to the plus ends of dynamic microtubules was previously investigated in vitro with a truncated version of a tissue-specific p150 isoform, which has the unusual property amongst p150 variants of only binding to microtubules in the presence of EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duellberg et al., 2014</xref>). It was found that this p150 fragment induces robust targeting of dynein complexes to the plus end of growing microtubules by providing a link between EB1 and the dynein tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duellberg et al., 2014</xref>). However, this study did not discriminate between maintenance of dynein at the growing plus end through rapid turnover of motor complexes, or through persistent individual binding events. We have analysed single binding events of dynein at the plus end of growing microtubules in the presence of EB1 and the native brain dynactin complex and found a mean duration of tracking events of ~4 s, with addition of LIS1 increasing this value to ~14 s. These dwell times are much longer than those reported for individual EB1 molecules at the growing plus end, which rarely exceed 1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixit et al., 2009</xref>). In the filamentous fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, EB1- and dynactin-dependent association of dynein with plus ends at the hyphal tip was also characterised by a slow turnover of individual motor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schuster et al., 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that persistent association of dyneins with dynamic microtubule plus ends could be an intrinsic property of the EB1/dynactin/dynein system. It remains to be determined whether dynein remains bound to the polymerising plus end through dynamic interactions with exchanging EB1 molecules, or whether EB1 is only required for the initial recruitment of the motor complex to this site.</p><p>Our study also provides insight into the contribution of other proteins to the association of mammalian dynein with EB1-bound plus ends. Whereas dynactin is essential for tracking of dynein at these sites, BICD2N is not. This observation suggests that dynein and dynactin associate with each other during tracking events in the absence of BICD2N. It was previously reported that in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>), as well as on stabilised microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>), the presence of an adaptor protein such as BICD2N is required for formation of a stable complex between dynein and dynactin. Our data suggest that the formation of the dynein-dynactin complex is possible at EB1-bound microtubule plus ends in the absence of a cargo adaptor. Strikingly, in conjunction with EB1 and dynactin, LIS1 strongly increases the duration of binding events of human dynein at the growing plus end without affecting the duration of binding to lattice sites. This could conceivably be related to LIS1’s ability to promote the association of dynein with the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), which is expected to be enriched at the plus ends of growing microtubules through its interaction with EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honnappa et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that LIS1 can promote the assembly of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex in vitro is consistent with a role in stimulating the association of dynein with dynactin.</p><p>Our results also shed light on the influence of proteins that bind the growing plus end on the behaviour of minus end-directed transport complexes. EB1 made minus end-directed movements of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes six times more likely to initiate at the plus end than a GDP lattice site of the same length. The ability of EB proteins to bias the initiation of processive transport to the plus ends of microtubules could play a particularly important role in axons, where is has been proposed that the initiation of motility in distal regions is a rate-limiting step in retrograde transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this notion, mutations in the CAP-Gly domain of p150 – which associates with EB1 – compromise the initiation of retrograde motility in distal axons and are associated with human neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has been hypothesised that tracking of dynein on plus ends of growing microtubules serves to efficiently capture cargoes destined for minus end-directed transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vaughan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaughan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">2002</xref>). We rarely observed plus-end tracking events of dynein being converted into minus end-directed transport events of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes. Instead, the initiation of minus end-directed transport from the growing plus end was almost always co-incident with initial engagement of the motor complex with this site. Factors not included in our in vitro experiments may be able to promote the conversion of plus-end tracking events to minus end-directed transport events in vivo. Candidate factors include proteins that link cargoes to BICD2, such as Rab6 and other adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>). Post-translational modifications of tubulin, which have emerged as important regulators of dynein behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McKenney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nirschl et al., 2016</xref>), could also play a role in activation of minus end-directed movement from dynein-tracking events. Alternatively, tracking of dynein on the plus ends of microtubules could have a role other than determining the initiation site of cargo transport. We did not detect changes in microtubule growth rates co-incident with binding and unbinding of dynein complexes. Thus, we have no evidence that plus-end tracking behaviour of dynein serves to directly regulate microtubule dynamics. Another possibility is that tracking of a subset of dynein complexes on dynamic microtubules helps deliver the motor to other sites in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mimori-Kiyosue and Tsukita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tamura and Draviam, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mammalian LIS1 enhances the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements</title><p>We found that LIS1 significantly increases the proportion of microtubule-associated dynein complexes that undergo minus end-directed transport in the presence of BICD2N and dynactin, without influencing the site of transport initiation on growing microtubules bound by EB1. Our data indicate that stimulation of minus end-directed transport by LIS1 is associated with an ability to promote the assembly of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex. Consistent with an in vivo role for LIS1 in promoting processive movement of dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor complexes, knockdown of LIS1 in mammalian cells strongly inhibits the pericentrosomal relocalisation of cargoes that is induced upon artificial tethering to BICD2N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We also found that LIS1 associates with dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes during minus end-directed motion and increases their velocity. The changes in speed induced by LIS1 are sizeable, with mean velocity increases in the range of 60–175% depending on the experimental conditions. LIS1 may therefore contribute to the high velocities exhibited by dynein-associated cargoes in vivo, which often exceed those of minimal motor complexes in vitro. For instance, several dynein-bound cargoes in mammalian cells have a mean velocity of 0.6–2 μm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flores-Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ori-McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rai et al., 2013</xref>), whereas in vitro movements of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes in the absence of LIS1 have a mean velocity of 0.3–0.6 μm/s ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Olenick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>]; this study). The ability of LIS1 to stimulate dynein velocity is all the more remarkable because several in vitro studies have shown that LIS1 inhibits the activity of dynein complexes in the absence of other co-factors. It was reported that LIS1 reduces the velocity of microtubule gliding by surface immobilised yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Torisawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>) or bovine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) dynein, and we found that this is also the case in gliding assays with the human motor complex. LIS1’s inhibition of microtubule translocation by dynein is presumably related to its ability to increase the interaction between the motor complex and the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of mammalian dynein, LIS1 may exert this effect by prolonging the interaction of dynein with microtubules under load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>), increasing the association rate of dynein for microtubules when in a large molar excess (this study), or a combination of these mechanisms. Intriguingly, the velocity of single yeast dynein complexes, which move processively without dynactin or a cargo adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), was also reduced by increasing the concentration of LIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), as was that of isolated mammalian dynein complexes attached to beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>). Our data do not contradict these findings, which were made with significantly different experimental systems. However, they do paint a more complex picture of LIS1 function, in which it has very different effects on dynein behaviour in the presence and absence of activators of processive minus end-directed motion.</p><p>How might LIS1 stimulate dynein velocity in the context of processive dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes? There is a consensus in the literature that LIS1 does not significantly increase the ATPase activity of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the large velocity increase induced by LIS1 is unlikely to be due to a general stimulation of the motor’s ATPase rate. It is, however, conceivable that LIS1 stimulates ATPase activity of dynein specifically when the motor complex is associated with dynactin and BICD2N. Alternatively, LIS1 could boost translocation rates without changing the kinetics of the ATP cycle, for example by increasing the step size of dynein within the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tracking of dynein on plus ends during microtubule shrinkage</title><p>We observed that, in the presence of dynactin, motor complexes can remain attached to the microtubule plus end during shrinkage phases. In another example of its ability to regulate association of dynein on a specific site of the microtubule, LIS1 increased the probability of microtubule-associated motor complexes retreating with the shrinking end in several contexts. Dynein can associate with both growing and shrinking microtubule ends in budding yeast and filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>). Association of dynein with dynamic plus ends in these systems involves CLIP-170 and LIS1 orthologues, which can couple the motor complex to plus-end-directed kinesin motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Efimov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the mammalian dynein complex can associate with shrinking ends for prolonged periods without CLIP-170 and a plus-end-directed motor. What then is the underlying basis of this behaviour? We show that end tracking of the motor complex during microtubule shrinkage is not dependent on ATP hydrolysis or an EB protein, but is dependent on dynactin. These observations point towards a biased diffusion mechanism for retention of dynein, presumably involving the microtubule-binding activities of p150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayloo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Culver-Hanlon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lazarus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Waterman-Storer et al., 1995</xref>) and/or dynein. As is the case on growing plus ends, tracking of dynein on shrinking plus ends is not dependent on BICD2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This result again points towards context-dependent mechanisms for dynein-dynactin complex formation in the absence of a cargo adaptor.</p><p>Our in vitro studies of dynein tracking on shrinking ends pave the way for investigations into the relevance of this behaviour for dynein function in vivo. By prolonging the interaction with dynamic microtubules, an ability of mammalian dynein-dynactin complexes to track shrinking ends would be expected to increase the delivery of the motor complex to other cellular sites. Association of dynein with shrinking ends may also be beneficial in other contexts, such as when the cortically anchored dynein exerts a pulling force on depolymerising microtubules in mitotic or interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burakov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dujardin and Vallee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Perspective</title><p>Much of our thinking about LIS1 function has been influenced by in vitro studies in the presence of isolated dynein complexes and artificially stabilised microtubules. Our experiments in the presence of dynamic microtubules and other important dynein regulators have provided additional insights into the function of LIS1 in mammalian systems (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our finding that LIS1 can stimulate the frequency and velocity of processive movement of a dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor complex offers another explanation for the basis of dynein-activating functions of LIS1 that are often observed in vivo. It has also been shown recently in mammalian cells that LIS1, but not dynactin, contributes to the ability of dynein on a cellular cargo to adapt to forces exerted by an optical trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>). A key question for the future is how LIS1 exerts its context- and concentration-dependent effects on dynein complexes. Several publications have demonstrated that LIS1 can bind to the isolated motor domain of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tai et al., 2002</xref>), with a structure of the yeast proteins revealing association of LIS1 with the junction of the dynein AAA3 and AAA4 domains in proximity to the linker element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Toropova et al., 2014</xref>). Differential effects of LIS1 could be related to occupancy of this binding site on one versus two of the dynein heads. Another possibility is suggested by earlier yeast two hybrid and pulldown experiments examining the interaction between LIS1 and mammalian dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tai et al., 2002</xref>). This work provided evidence that LIS1 can contact the AAA1 domain and tail region of dynein heavy chain, as well as dynein intermediate chain and the p50 subunit of the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tai et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore speculate that interactions of LIS1 with different parts of the dynein complex contribute to the contrasting regulatory effects observed in this and other studies. Future experiments should be aimed at understanding the structural basis of LIS1’s regulation of dynein behaviour in different contexts. It will also be important in the future to build further complexity into in vitro studies of dynein’s interactions with dynamic microtubules. It will be particularly interesting to assess the function of NudE and NudEL in our in vitro reconstitution system, as these proteins can strongly influence the interactions of dynein with both dynactin and LIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and protein production</title><p>The human dynein complex (which consists of six subunits, each present in two copies per complex) was expressed in Sf9 cells (from <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>; ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) (Cat.

Second, the final ‘chamber mix’ contained a dilution of the assembly mix in 2.5 mM ATP, 10 mM KOAc, 10 mM KCl, 1250 nM glucose oxidase, 140 nM catalase, 71 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 24.9 mM glucose, 80 mM PIPES pH 6.85, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 1 mM DTT. The dynein concentration in the assembly mix for these experiments was also 20 nM, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> when it was 100 nM (see legends for experimental details).</p><p>Chamber mixes were introduced into flow chambers, which were subsequently sealed with nail polish. Flow chambers were then visualised by TIRF microscopy. Acquisition parameters were typically as follows: 100 ms exposures for one-colour imaging with a total acquisition time per frame of 0.137 s; 100 ms exposures per channel for two-colour imaging and a total acquisition time for both channels of 0.6 s; 50 ms exposure per channel for three-colour imaging and a total acquisition time for all three channels of 0.66 s. The exception was for the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, when the exposure time and total acquisition times were 100 ms and 0.5 s/frame, respectively. In experiments with stabilised microtubules, the positions of microtubules were recorded by capturing a single image of the fluorescent tubulin signal before acquiring a time series in the other channel(s). For each chamber, three movies (each of a different region of the chamber) were recorded, each lasting ~5 min. Kymographs of dynein complexes on five randomly selected microtubules per movie were generated with FIJI software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>) and analysed manually.</p><p>In dynamic microtubule assays, the microtubule plus end was identified by its substantially faster growth rate compared to the minus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Summers and Kirschner, 1979</xref>). We classified dynein-binding events on growing microtubule ends as ‘tracking’ if they overlapped with the trajectory of the growing microtubule tip for three or more frames (≥1.8 s). For consistency, events that lasted &lt;1.8 s were also excluded from the analysis of the duration of dynein binding events on the microtubule lattice, when categorising dynein complexes as static, diffusive and processive in the presence of dynactin and BICD2N, and when counting landing events in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. For run length analysis, a run was defined as a bout of unidirectional, minus end-directed motion that could be terminated by either detachment from the microtubule or a pause (including at the minus end of the microtubule). Because a small subset of dynein complexes switched velocities during a run, mean velocities were calculated from individual constant velocity segments, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). The automatic tracking software FIESTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ruhnow et al., 2011</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014990">SCR_014990</ext-link>) was used to determine fluorescent intensity of minus end-directed Alexa647-dynein complexes on microtubules directly from the original image series. Fluorescence intensities of all unidirectional, minus end-directed dynein complexes were calculated as the volume under the Gaussian function. Velocities were also determined automatically with FIESTA for this analysis.</p><p>The following procedure was performed to determine the ratio of initial dynein docking events on the growing plus end versus an equivalently sized lattice site. A diagonal line ~0.1 pixels wide was drawn on a kymograph in FIJI to demarcate the plus end of the growing microtubule. Docking events at the plus end were then scored manually as the initial appearance of a dynein signal (regardless of the dwell time) that overlaps with the diagonal line. Docking events on the GDP lattice were scored with the same procedure using a parallel line of the same thickness that was positioned randomly (i.e., without previous visualisation of the dynein signal). The overlaps of dynein signals with diagonal lines drawn at growing plus end and randomly selected GDP lattice sites were also used to evaluate the initiation site of minus end-directed dynein movements.</p><p>Throughout the study, each chamber utilised a unique assembly mix. In experiments used for statistical evaluations different experimental conditions within one series were typically assayed in an interleaved manner on the same day with at least two days of experimentation in total. Data were analysed to confirm that there was no significant day-to-day variability between results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microtubule gliding assays</title><p>Hilyte488-labelled microtubules were polymerised as described above, except that biotin-tubulin was not added to the polymerisation mix. Polymerised microtubules were resuspended in BRB80 containing 40 μM taxol that was prewarmed to 37°C. Flow chambers assembled from untreated glass surfaces were passivated for 5 min with 1% (w/v) pluronic F-127 in dH<sub>2</sub>O, placed on an ice-cold metal block and washed with Assay Buffer. The following procedure was followed for all gliding assays except those documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>. Proteins were diluted in Assay Buffer to give solutions containing 30 nM Alexa647-dynein alone, or 30 nM Alexa647-dynein with 0.6 μM or 6 μM LIS1 dimers. When making dilutions, LIS1 storage buffer alone was used to ensure equivalent buffer conditions in all cases. Solutions of dynein or dynein plus LIS1 were incubated for 2 min on ice before introduction into the imaging chamber. Following a 5-min incubation on a metal block in ice, imaging chambers were allowed to warm up to room temperature by removal from the ice block for 2 min. Excess protein was then removed by one wash with 20 μl Assay Buffer. A solution (Microtubule Mix) containing a 1:10 dilution of Hilyte488-labelled microtubules in 2.5 mM ATP, 10 mM KOAc, 10 mM KCl, 1250 nM glucose oxidase, 140 nM catalase, 71 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 24.9 mM glucose, 80 mM PIPES pH 6.85, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 1 mM DTT was flowed into the chamber, which was promptly sealed with nail polish.</p><p>For the experiments documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>, LIS1 was added at a subsequent step to dynein in order to eliminate the risk that LIS1 interferes with microtubule gliding by competing with dynein for initial binding to the glass surface. The procedure above was followed except for the following modifications: glass surfaces were incubated with 300 nM Alexa647-dynein in Assay buffer for 5 min on ice and washed twice with Assay Buffer before blocking of any exposed surfaces with 20 mg/ml α-casein in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 for 5 min and a further two washes in Assay Buffer. 30 μM LIS1 dimers in Assay Buffer (or the equivalent volume of LIS1 storage buffer diluted in Assay Buffer) was then flowed into the chambers, followed by a 5 min incubation on ice. Following a subsequent incubation for 2 min at room temperature, the LIS1 solution was replaced with Microtubule Mix. An identical procedure was followed for the LIS1 only control documented in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, except dynein storage buffer alone was used in the place of the dynein solution.</p><p>In all gliding assays, microtubules were visualised by TIRF microscopy for no longer that 15 min (during which time three regions of the chamber were imaged), with a 100 ms exposure and a frame interval of 1 s. The time between addition of microtubules and the start of imaging was kept constant (2 min) within each experimental series in order to control for any effects of gradual dissociation of LIS1 from dynein. However, we observed no decrease in the inhibitory effect of LIS1 on microtubule gliding by dynein during the period of image acquisition. This finding indicates that sufficient LIS1 associated with dynein for a strong inhibitory effect for the duration of the gliding assay.</p><p>Velocities of gliding microtubules were determined by manual analysis of kymographs with FIJI. In the gliding assays documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref> the intensity of Alexa647-dynein on glass surfaces was also quantified. After collecting each time series of Hilyte488-microtubules, Alexa647-dynein signal was quickly captured from 10 to 14 randomly selected 80 μm x 80 μm regions of each imaging chamber. For each image, FIJI was used to measure the mean intensity of Alexa647 per pixel following background subtraction using a rolling ball with 50-pixel-radius.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Prism 6 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) (GraphPad (La Jolla, CA)) was used for data plotting and statistical analysis.

By using in vitro reconstitution experiments, the authors systematically determine the requirements for dynein delivery to and tracking with the plus end of both growing and shrinking microtubules. Their experiments lead to several novel and surprising findings about dynein's interaction with microtubule plus ends. Key findings described here include: 1) While EB1 and dynactin are required for plus end targeting of dynein, the addition of LIS1 increases the frequency and duration of dynein's interactions with growing microtubule plus-ends. 2) Dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes, which are capable of long distance processive motility, are more likely to begin a run at the microtubule plus end in the presence of EB1, but EB1 does not alter the complexes velocity or run length. 3) Dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes that track with the growing microtubule plus end are rarely competent to engage in minus-end-directed motility. 4) LIS1 co-migrates with moving minus-end-directed dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes and increases the velocity of these complexes. This is a surprising finding as previous studies on LIS1 suggested that LIS1 decreases velocity. 5) LIS1, in conjunction with EB1 and dynactin, promotes dynein association with shrinking microtubules. In summary, this study defines novel ways in which Lis1 can impact on dynein motor behaviour.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report a surprising ability of LIS1 to activate both the frequency and velocity of dynein-dependent runs. This observation appears to directly contrast with previous studies showing that LIS1 leads to dynein inhibition during gliding assays, and that the binding of LIS1 enhances the development of an ATPase insensitive state in which dynein remains bound to the microtubule. To the credit of the investigators, they repeat the gliding assay inhibition, which suggests that the difference is not due to differential activities of the purified dyneins used in the various labs. However, they provide no significant insights into the dramatic differences between their single molecule and gliding data, nor any insights into how their new observations can be reconciled with the many previous single molecule studies on LIS1 from the Reck-Peterson, Vallee, and Gross labs. Some explanation of the discrepancy between the single molecule and gliding assays should be provided. The authors should also provide much better controls and description for both the single molecule and gliding assays:</p><p>A) The authors should investigate whether Lis1 has an effect on human dynein microtubule interactions at the single molecule level, in the absence of other regulators (landing rate, dwell time, balance of static vs. diffusive events). The focus of this study is on more complex reconstitutions, but these data are fundamental and it seems very likely the authors already have them. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compares dynein behaviour +/- Lis1 and dynactin, but the crucial +Lis1 kymograph seems to be missing from panel A.</p><p>B) A major experimental concern relates to the microtubule gliding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which the authors use to report that their Lis1 preparation reduces the velocity of microtubule gliding driven by human dynein. Apparently, dynein was non-specifically adsorbed to the flow chamber either alone or in the presence of 6 μm or 60 μm Lis1. Unbound proteins were then washed out. This approach raises two substantive concerns.</p><p>First, did the presence of Lis1 (up to ~2.7 mg/ml) reduce the amount of dynein that non-specifically adsorbed to the surface? Lis1 is a sticky protein, so this seems plausible, especially at the 200-fold Lis1 molar excess. The presence of microtubules on the surface does not rule this out, as microtubules adsorb to many surfaces, including those lacking motors. Either the consistency of dynein surface density in the different conditions needs to be confirmed (e.g. using fluorescent dynein) or, to avoid this danger entirely, the authors could specifically immobilize dynein, then subsequently add the desired concentration of Lis1.</p><p>Second, washing the chamber in a solution lacking Lis1 means that the dynein-Lis1 binding reaction will not have been at the desired equilibrium during the experiment: Lis1 will have been gradually dissociating in the time post wash out, and thus the fraction of dynein molecules with Lis1 bound will have depended critically on the time that elapsed between the washout and the start of the data acquisition. Was this elapsed time kept constant? It would be much safer to include Lis1 at the desired concentration in the final assay mixture.</p><p>2) The experiments with the dynein tail construct are somewhat confusing. Is the tail alone sufficient to track growing and shrinking plus ends? What is the minimum set of proteins required to allow the tail to track growing and shrinking ends? Can this tracking be seen with purified dynein, or is it limited to recombinant forms? Does Lis1 influence the frequency/duration of tracking events for the dynein tail, or is the motor domain required? (Alternatively, mutations that prevent Lis1 binding at the AAA4 site are known, and could be tested in the tracking assay.)</p><p>The authors propose the model that the different effects of Lis1 may arise from different binding sites, invoking interactions reported between Lis1 and various fragments of dynein and dynactin. However, interactions reported from the cited yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down experiments have not all been reproduced with intact proteins, so it is necessary to exercise caution before setting the field off down this path. Importantly, it seems that the authors may already have the data to test this model in their end-tracking experiments with the dynein tail construct. i.e. if Lis1 influences the frequency/duration of tracking events for the dynein tail, this would provide strong evidence for a functional binding site outside the characterised one in the dynein motor domain.</p><p>3) It is possible that dynein-dynactin-BICDN complexes that track the plus end contain a &quot;dead&quot; motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or a dynein motor that can bind, but not be activated by BICDN and dynactin. What is the percentage of dynein motors that are not able to be activated, but co-localize with dynactin and BICDN in a single molecule assay on taxol-stabilized microtubules?</p><p>4) Despite the general high quality of the experimental data, the apparent number of experimental repeats is low. The authors state that the values shown represent 4 chambers per condition, with 15 microtubules analysed per chamber. But this doesn't clarify how many independent experiments were performed (should be a minimum of 3 independent experimental repeats, not just 3-4 chambers from a single experiment – perhaps they did this but it is unclear from their descriptions), and they do not specify the number of total events measured for each experiment.</p><p>5) Throughout the manuscript, protein levels are reported as molar ratios rather than absolute concentrations. However, a 1:10 dynein:Lis1 ratio can result in essentially all the dynein having Lis1 bound (if the concentrations are well above the Kd) or essentially no dynein having Lis1 bound (if the concentrations are well below the Kd). Therefore, it is essential to state the absolute final concentration of all species in the reactions in order to interpret them. This is especially important when comparing single-molecule and microtubule-gliding assays, in which the concentrations are presumably quite different.</p><p>6) Binding to the plus end is expressed per growth phase, rather than per unit time. This seems problematic for experiments +/- EB1, as EB1 substantially shortens the duration of the growth phase as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>?</p><p>7) Please include additional, or higher quality kymographs of dynein and BICD2 moving towards the minus end of dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> appears confusing. It would help to break it into separate figures or change the presentation strategy.</p><p>9) It is well established that Clip170 interacts with LIS1 and the p150 subunit of dynactin (Lansbergen, et al. J. Cell. Biol., 2004) and that Clip170 plays an important role in dynein localization to microtubule plus ends (Roberts, et al. <italic>eLife</italic>, 2014; Duellberg, et al. Nat. Cell. Biol., 2014). The authors have purified and functional Clip170 in hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Have they tried to add it in their in vitro reconstitutions? In principle, it would be nice to know whether Clip170 affects the number and duration of dynein plus end tracking events in the presence of LIS1, dynactin, and EB1? If the authors have reasons not to include these experiments, they should at least include some discussion on this issue.</p><p>10)&quot;Dynein complexes that track the plus ends of microtubules are unlikely to act directly as a source of motors for minus end-directed transport.&quot; This statement has the potential to mislead. While it may be true under these assay conditions (i.e. in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of a constitutively active cargo adaptor fragment), the situation in the cell (where cargoes with bound adaptors are likely to be limiting) might be very different indeed. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>11) The discussion of the literature is selective, with the potential to mislead:</p><p>Nudel/NudE are not mentioned. However, these proteins are known to be critical for Lis1 functions in vivo, and relieve Lis1's inhibitory effect on mammalian dynein in vitro, and must be discussed.</p><p>The major of models of McKenney et al. (2010) and (2011) are not mentioned i.e. that Lis1 and NudE induce a persistent force-generating state in mammalian dynein, and that this is mutually exclusive with dynactin regulation.</p><p>Treatment of the yeast literature seems selective, with the inhibitory effects of Lis1/Pac1 in vitro played up but the substantial body of work elucidating Lis1/Pac1's role in vivo (consistent with a targeting/inhibitory function) played down. Notably, Lis1/Pac1 is absent from dynein's site of action in yeast, and evidence suggests it must be displaced in order to activate yeast dynein.</p><p>&quot;It is unclear how [Lis1's] activities can account for the reduction in dynein-based processes that is generally observed when LIS1 function is inhibited in cells.&quot; This seems an oversimplification, as incorrect targeting/inhibitory regulation can perturb motor processes as much as loss of an activator.</p><p>&quot;However, LIS1's specific function in plus end tracking of dynein was also not addressed in previous in vitro reconstitution assays.&quot; This is true for mammalian proteins, but Lis1/Pac1's role has been addressed in reconstitutions with yeast proteins.</p><p>&quot;However, this [search-and-capture] mechanism has not been visualised directly.&quot; Plus-end capture and minus-end directed motility of melanophores has been visualized directly (Lomakin et al., 2009). Transfer of yeast dynein from the plus end to the cell cortex has been visualized directly (Markus et al., 2011).</p><p>There are other factors that could make plus end localization more complex in vivo as well. There are also additional mechanisms of dynein recruitment to the plus end and many other plus end binding proteins. Additional discussion of this complexity would strengthen the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21768.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors report a surprising ability of LIS1 to activate both the frequency and velocity of dynein-dependent runs.

The authors should also provide much better controls and description for both the single molecule and gliding assays:</italic> </p><p>We regret that we did not state explicitly that our results do not contradict the findings of previous studies in the literature, which were generated with very different experimental systems. For example, the work of McKenney, Gross, Vallee and colleagues assayed dynein behaviour in the absence of processivity activators and predominantly under load. Huang, Roberts, Reck-Peterson and colleagues studied yeast dynein, which has features distinct from mammalian dynein (dramatically reduced velocity and robust processive movement without other co-factors). We have now stated that our findings do not contradict those in the literature (subsection “Mammalian LIS1 enhances the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements”, second paragraph). We believe that our improved coverage of the existing literature on LIS1’s regulation of dynein, which was requested by the reviewers, also helps clarify the relationship between our findings and those of other groups.</p><p>Most importantly, we have now performed two types of experiments that clarify the different effects of LIS1 in different assays. One set of experiments provides evidence that LIS1 stimulates the assembly of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This exciting finding offers an explanation for the ability of LIS1 to increase the frequency of minus end-directed transport in the presence of dynactin and BICD2N. Because dynactin and BICD2N were not included in previous single molecule studies of dynein, this effect of LIS1 would not have been evident. Our observation is, however, consistent with the previous finding by our group and the Zheng group that LIS1 can promote complex formation between dynein and dynactin in cells or cell extracts (Dix et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Our data indicating that LIS1 is in fact sufficient to stimulate dynein-dynactin-BICD2N assembly are described in the second paragraph of the subsection “LIS1 increases the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements”.</p><p>The mechanism by which mammalian LIS1 increases the velocity of dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes will require a separate in depth study, although our new data demonstrating that LIS1 can influence the interaction of dynein with dynactin and BICD2N suggests an exciting route for investigation. The second set of new experiments that address the effects of LIS1 in different types of assays is described in response to point 1A. Collectively, our results are consistent with LIS1 exerting different effects on the activity of mammalian dynein in the presence and absence of dynactin and BICD2N.</p><p><italic>A) The authors should investigate whether Lis1 has an effect on human dynein microtubule interactions at the single molecule level, in the absence of other regulators (landing rate, dwell time, balance of static vs. diffusive events). The focus of this study is on more complex reconstitutions, but these data are fundamental and it seems very likely the authors already have them. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compares dynein behaviour +/- Lis1 and dynactin, but the crucial +Lis1 kymograph seems to be missing from panel A.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have performed a set of new experiments investigating the effects of LIS1 on the single molecule interactions of human dynein complexes with microtubules (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These experiments use stabilised microtubules, which facilitates quantification of dynein binding events.</p><p>The published in vitro studies of the influence of LIS1 on interactions of yeast dynein with microtubules seemingly used a large molar excess of LIS1. Our new experiments therefore not only used the relative concentrations of LIS1 and dynein used in the rest of our single molecule experiments, but also a 15-fold further excess of LIS1 to dynein. There was no significant influence of the lower concentration of LIS1 on the interactions of dynein with the microtubule lattice. This finding is consistent with our observations with dynamic microtubules. However, the higher concentration of LIS1 significantly increased the landing rate of dynein on microtubules without a detectable effect on the dwell time of the motor. (Diffusive events of dynein were very rare in the presence and absence of LIS1 and therefore analysis of static vs diffusive behaviour of the motor complex was not appropriate.)</p><p>Our finding that LIS1 can increase the landing rate of dynein is compatible with previous observations that LIS1 increases the association of other mammalian dyneins with microtubules in co-sedimentation assays (subsection “LIS1 stimulates plus end tracking of dynein complexes on growing microtubules in the presence of EB1 and dynactin”, last paragraph). We point out that our results with human proteins differ from those of the study with yeast proteins (Huang, Roberts et al. 2012), which found that LIS1 increases the dwell time of monomeric dynein on microtubules. This finding suggests that LIS1 can exert different effects on dynein’s interactions with microtubules in yeast and mammals, a potentially significant finding when seeking to reconcile results from these systems.</p><p>Although further mechanistic studies need to be performed in the future, we believe our new experiments also offer a possible explanation for the effects of LIS1 on mammalian dynein in different assays. We speculate that the ability of high relative concentrations of LIS1 to increase the association of human dynein with microtubules contributes to the inhibitory effect of LIS1 on microtubule translocation (subsection “Mammalian LIS1 enhances the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements”, second paragraph). At lower relative concentrations of LIS1, such as those used in our other single molecule assays, there is no effect on the interaction of dynein with microtubules unless co-factors, such as plus end-associated dynactin complexes, are also present. We also point out that the ability of LIS1 to prolong the interaction of mammalian dynein with microtubules under load (McKenney et al. 2010) may also contribute to the inhibition of microtubule gliding by LIS1.</p><p>We have now added representative kymographs of dynamic microtubules incubated with human dynein alone and in the presence of LIS1 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, as requested. We observed no effect of LIS1 on the interactions of dynein with microtubules from inspection of many kymographs. We have also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> to include our failure to observe end tracking of dynein in these conditions.</p><p><italic>B) A major experimental concern relates to the microtubule gliding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which the authors use to report that their Lis1 preparation reduces the velocity of microtubule gliding driven by human dynein. Apparently, dynein was non-specifically adsorbed to the flow chamber either alone or in the presence of 6 μm or 60 μm Lis1. Unbound proteins were then washed out. This approach raises two substantive concerns.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, did the presence of Lis1 (up to ~2.7 mg/ml) reduce the amount of dynein that non-specifically adsorbed to the surface? Lis1 is a sticky protein, so this seems plausible, especially at the 200-fold Lis1 molar excess. The presence of microtubules on the surface does not rule this out, as microtubules adsorb to many surfaces, including those lacking motors. Either the consistency of dynein surface density in the different conditions needs to be confirmed (e.g. using fluorescent dynein) or, to avoid this danger entirely, the authors could specifically immobilize dynein, then subsequently add the desired concentration of Lis1.</italic> </p><p>We mixed dynein with LIS1 prior to washing off unbound motor from the glass surface as we thought that this was the best way to combine the proteins in a defined molar ratio. Controlling molar ratios is not practical when LIS1 is added to chambers with prebound dynein because the amount of motor complex bound to the surface cannot be readily quantified. Nonetheless, the reviewers’ comments made us appreciate that additional controls are needed to support our interpretations of the gliding assays.</p><p>In the assay conditions employed, microtubules do not associate with the glass surface when dynein is omitted. We now cite a recent publication from our group that includes this control (Hoang et al. 2017). This finding suggests that LIS1 did not inhibit gliding by causing strong dissociation of the motor complex from the glass, as this would inhibit microtubule association. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now investigated directly the effects of LIS1 on the association of dynein with the surface using the fluorophore on the heavy chain. We show that in conditions in which LIS1 strongly inhibits microtubule gliding there is no reduction in the amount of motor complex on the glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In these experiments LIS1 was added to dynein that was already immobilised on the surface to rule out competition for initial binding to the glass, as recommended by the reviewers.</p><p>We also performed an additional control showing that LIS1 alone does not cause microtubules to adhere to the glass surface in our assay buffer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This finding, which was also reported in Yamada et al. (2008) in their study with porcine dynein, is valuable as it indicates that LIS1 does not indirectly inhibit microtubule gliding by dynein by providing a strong independent attachment between microtubules and the glass surface. These results are also consistent with those of Vallee, Gross and colleagues (McKenney et al. 2010), who used other methods to show that LIS1 does not interact with microtubules. We therefore show with two different experimental configurations that in the presence of LIS1 microtubules associate with the glass surface through human dynein but are translocated inefficiently. The new experiments have led to several modifications to this section of the Results (subsection “LIS1 increases the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements”, last paragraph).</p><p>One of the reviewers’ comments led us to check the concentrations of dynein and LIS1 in our previous experiments. There was an unfortunate miscalculation when compiling the previous Materials and methods; the concentration of dynein in the solution incubated with the glass surface was 30 nM, and the concentration of LIS1 was 0.6 or 6 μM. This error has been corrected and we have confirmed that protein concentrations in all other assays are stated correctly.</p><p><italic>Second, washing the chamber in a solution lacking Lis1 means that the dynein-Lis1 binding reaction will not have been at the desired equilibrium during the experiment: Lis1 will have been gradually dissociating in the time post wash out, and thus the fraction of dynein molecules with Lis1 bound will have depended critically on the time that elapsed between the washout and the start of the data acquisition. Was this elapsed time kept constant? It would be much safer to include Lis1 at the desired concentration in the final assay mixture.</italic> </p><p>We kept the time between addition of proteins and imaging constant in our previous image series and observed no diminution over time of the inhibitory effect of LIS1 on microtubule gliding. This was also the case in our new experimental series. We illustrate this point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref> using data from the new gliding assays.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21768.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of microtubule gliding velocity during the first and second 5 minutes after the beginning of image acquisition.</title><p>Magenta circles: values for individual microtubules.

Including LIS1 with the microtubules in the final assay mixture is therefore not necessary (it is also not practical due to the requisite dilution factor for LIS1). We have now made it clear in the Materials and methods that the time between protein addition and image acquisition was kept constant and that there was no reduction in LIS1’s inhibitory effect over the time course of the experiment.</p><p><italic>2) The experiments with the dynein tail construct are somewhat confusing. Is the tail alone sufficient to track growing and shrinking plus ends? What is the minimum set of proteins required to allow the tail to track growing and shrinking ends? Can this tracking be seen with purified dynein, or is it limited to recombinant forms? Does Lis1 influence the frequency/duration of tracking events for the dynein tail, or is the motor domain required? (Alternatively, mutations that prevent Lis1 binding at the AAA4 site are known, and could be tested in the tracking assay.)</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors propose the model that the different effects of Lis1 may arise from different binding sites, invoking interactions reported between Lis1 and various fragments of dynein and dynactin. However, interactions reported from the cited yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down experiments have not all been reproduced with intact proteins, so it is necessary to exercise caution before setting the field off down this path. Importantly, it seems that the authors may already have the data to test this model in their end-tracking experiments with the dynein tail construct. i.e. if Lis1 influences the frequency/duration of tracking events for the dynein tail, this would provide strong evidence for a functional binding site outside the characterised one in the dynein motor domain.</italic> </p><p>The observation with the tail was a minor part of the study and was not emphasised in the Discussion because of several open questions, which were also picked up on by the reviewers. We could not previously address the minimal requirements for tracking of the dynein tail as the lack of a fluorescently labelled tail construct meant that the behaviour of the tail had to be visualised by fluorescent BICD2N, which only associates with the tail in the presence of dynactin. In this assay configuration it was also not possible to determine if LIS1 promotes end tracking of the isolated dynein tail; altered end tracking behaviour of labelled BICD2N could also result from an affect of LIS1 on the association of the dynein tail with BICD2N and dynactin. We also could not compare the efficiency of tracking by the dynein tail versus the full complex using labelled BICD2N as the results could be confounded by any differences in the efficiency of dynactin-dependent binding of BICD2N to the tail compared to the full dynein complex. We agree that the experiments with the dynein tail construct were therefore confusing and unsatisfactory. We were unable to convincingly address the questions raised above in the time available for revision, and have therefore decided to remove the two panels in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that refer to the tail. We believe this makes this section of the manuscript much clearer.</p><p>We have retained some discussion in the Perspective about the possibility of LIS1 having more than one binding site on the dynein-dynactin complex as we think this is an attractive hypothesis for how LIS1 exerts context-dependent (and concentration-dependent) effects. We have now stated that the earlier evidence for LIS1 interactions with the tail and p50 was from yeast two hybrid and pulldown methods, which should allow the reader to exercise appropriate caution when reading this section. We now make it clear that this section is speculation and not a proposed model. Incidentally, we would not have been able to address the reviewers’ question about the tracking behaviour of the native dynein tail, as we can only produce the tail in a recombinant form.</p><p><italic>3) It is possible that dynein-dynactin-BICDN complexes that track the plus end contain a &quot;dead&quot; motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or a dynein motor that can bind, but not be activated by BICDN and dynactin. What is the percentage of dynein motors that are not able to be activated, but co-localize with dynactin and BICDN in a single molecule assay on taxol-stabilized microtubules?</italic> </p><p>We had also considered this possibility but not looked into it further. We have now followed the reviewers’ helpful suggestion and quantified the percentage of all static dynein motors on the lattice that co-localise with BICD2N (and therefore dynactin). Quantification was performed using our previous kymographs of dynamic microtubules, so that the results could be compared directly to our analysis of BICD2N and dynein co-localisation on plus end tracking complexes in the presence of dynactin. Approximately 60% of static dynein complexes on the lattice had a BICD2N signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4 —figure supplement 3C</xref>), which is not dissimilar to the percentage of plus end tracking dyneins that co-localised with BICD2N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes that track the plus end in the presence of EB1 could contain a dynein motor that cannot be activated by dynactin and BICD2N alone. This point is now made in the last paragraph of the subsection “End tracking dynein complexes are rarely a source of motor for minus end-directed movements”. The revised manuscript has much less discussion of potential mechanisms underlying initiation of processive movement from plus end tracking events as we agree with the reviewers that it will be important to model this process in vitro with additional factors, including native cargo, cargo adaptors and NudE (subsection “Insights into plus end tracking of dynein complexes and the relationship to cargo transport”, last paragraph and subsection “Perspective”). We have instead emphasised the functions of LIS1 in regulating dynein activity, including the results of new experiments and analyses suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>4) Despite the general high quality of the experimental data, the apparent number of experimental repeats is low. The authors state that the values shown represent 4 chambers per condition, with 15 microtubules analysed per chamber. But this doesn't clarify how many independent experiments were performed (should be a minimum of 3 independent experimental repeats, not just 3-4 chambers from a single experiment – perhaps they did this but it is unclear from their descriptions), and they do not specify the number of total events measured for each experiment.</italic> </p><p>We apologise for not including this information in the first submission. Each chamber is derived from a unique assembly mix, which we operationally define as an independent experiment. For each chamber, movies of three different regions were acquired. Different experimental conditions in the same series where typically performed in an interleaved manner on the same day. The data set for each experimental condition comprises chambers from at least two different days, and all the data were analysed carefully to check that there is no significant day-to-day variability between results. This information is now included in the Materials and methods. Information on the number of events analysed per condition is now included in each figure legend. A very large number of events was analysed throughout the study, and all of this was done manually. Consistent effects in the presence and absence of LIS1 were also seen in independent experimental series (e.g. ± BICD2N, stabilised versus dynamic microtubules).</p><p><italic>5) Throughout the manuscript, protein levels are reported as molar ratios rather than absolute concentrations. However, a 1:10 dynein:Lis1 ratio can result in essentially all the dynein having Lis1 bound (if the concentrations are well above the Kd) or essentially no dynein having Lis1 bound (if the concentrations are well below the Kd). Therefore, it is essential to state the absolute final concentration of all species in the reactions in order to interpret them. This is especially important when comparing single-molecule and microtubule-gliding assays, in which the concentrations are presumably quite different.</italic> </p><p>We have now added information to the Materials and methods and figure legends on the concentration of dynein in the assembly mixes.</p><p><italic>6) Binding to the plus end is expressed per growth phase, rather than per unit time. This seems problematic for experiments +/- EB1, as EB1 substantially shortens the duration of the growth phase as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>?</italic> </p><p>We confirmed that the duration of growth phases is not significantly different between conditions in key experiments comparing the frequency of dynein binding events per growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We did not perform this analysis for some of the conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> in which end tracking was essentially not observed through the entire field in several movies. However, the lack of tracking events in the presence or absence of EB1 when dynactin is omitted indicates that this result is independent from effects of EB1 on the duration of growth phases.</p><p><italic>7) Please include additional, or higher quality kymographs of dynein and BICD2 moving towards the minus end of dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We have now included an additional kymograph of dynein and BICD2N complexes moving towards the minus end of dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Please note that the quality of these kymographs is not as high as of those obtained from single or dual colour imaging as the overall acquisition rate is reduced by the capture of another channel.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> appears confusing. It would help to break it into separate figures or change the presentation strategy.</italic> </p><p>We now see that the inclusion of the shrinking end analysis with the labelled BICD2N and the dynein tail in the same figure with the results of the experiments with labelled full-length dynein was confusing. This is no longer an issue as the tail experiments have been removed from the manuscript for the reasons described above. To further simplify the figure, we have moved the data for experiments without dynactin to the supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) It is well established that Clip170 interacts with LIS1 and the p150 subunit of dynactin (Lansbergen, et al. J. Cell. Biol., 2004) and that Clip170 plays an important role in dynein localization to microtubule plus ends (Roberts, et al. eLife, 2014; Duellberg, et al. Nat. Cell. Biol., 2014). The authors have purified and functional Clip170 in hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Have they tried to add it in their</italic> in vitro <italic>reconstitutions? In principle, it would be nice to know whether Clip170 affects the number and duration of dynein plus end tracking events in the presence of LIS1, dynactin, and EB1? If the authors have reasons not to include these experiments, they should at least include some discussion on this issue.</italic> </p><p>We had performed experiments with CLIP-170 but had not analysed the experiments as we planned to focus on the effects of this protein in a future study. The reviewer’s comment made us appreciate that readers would be interested in the effects of CLIP-170 in the current study. We have now analysed the experiments and added the data to the manuscript. We show that, in the presence of LIS1, CLIP-170 has no detectable effect on the ability of EB1 to target the initiation of processive transport events to dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complexes to growing plus ends, or on the frequency and duration of plus end tracking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding is compatible with the conclusion of Duellberg et al. (2014) that CLIP-170 only becomes important for plus end tracking of p150 in the presence of competing EB1-binding peptides (subsection “EB1 can direct dynein-dynactin-BICD2N transport initiation to growing plus ends but this is not influenced by LIS1 or CLIP-170”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>10)&quot;Dynein complexes that track the plus ends of microtubules are unlikely to act directly as a source of motors for minus end-directed transport.&quot; This statement has the potential to mislead. While it may be true under these assay conditions (i.e. in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of a constitutively active cargo adaptor fragment), the situation in the cell (where cargoes with bound adaptors are likely to be limiting) might be very different indeed. This should be acknowledged.</italic> </p><p>This is another very good point. We now make it explicit that we are referring to the findings in our assay conditions. We agree with the reviewer that several other factors could influence the initiation of processive movement from the plus end in vivo. We discuss the possibility that the cargo or microtubule modifications could be involved in a physiological setting (subsection “Insights into plus end tracking of dynein complexes and the relationship to cargo transport”, last paragraph). In response to the reviewers’ comments we now also include experiments assaying the effects of CLIP-170 (see above), and mention the importance of assessing the effects of NudE proteins in the future (subsection “Perspective”).</p><p><italic>11) The discussion of the literature is selective, with the potential to mislead:</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions for improving the discussion of the literature. We have made several changes.</p><p><italic>Nudel/NudE are not mentioned. However, these proteins are known to be critical for Lis1 functions</italic> in vivo<italic>, and relieve Lis1's inhibitory effect on mammalian dynein</italic> in vitro<italic>, and must be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We now mention prominently in the Perspective section that addressing the role of NudE/NudEL is a priority for future experiments (see above).</p><p><italic>The major of models of McKenney et al. (2010) and (2011) are not mentioned i.e. that Lis1 and NudE induce a persistent force-generating state in mammalian dynein, and that this is mutually exclusive with dynactin regulation.</italic> </p><p>We had cited the McKenney et al. (2010) paper but realise that we should have introduced the model explicitly. We now do so in the Introduction (seventh paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “Mammalian LIS1 enhances the frequency and velocity of minus end-directed dynein movements”, second paragraph). The 2011 McKenney et al. paper focuses on the competition between NudE and dynactin. In the absence of NudE experiments in our study, we had not cited this paper in our first submission. The one experiment with LIS1 in the 2011 study shows that it promotes the ability of the CC1 domain of p150 to release dynein from NudE, which suggests a complex set of interactions between these factors. The revised manuscript introduces the need to study NudE/NudEL in our reconstitution assays in the future and we now cite the McKenney et al. 2011 paper in this context.</p><p><italic>Treatment of the yeast literature seems selective, with the inhibitory effects of Lis1/Pac1 in vitro played up but the substantial body of work elucidating Lis1/Pac1's role in vivo (consistent with a targeting/inhibitory function) played down. Notably, Lis1/Pac1 is absent from dynein's site of action in yeast, and evidence suggests it must be displaced in order to activate yeast dynein.</italic> </p><p>We now emphasise in the Introduction that there is substantial evidence for a targeting/inhibitory function of Lis1/Pac1 from different studies. This section includes citations to papers that elucidate the effect of Lis1/Pac1 on dynein in yeast. These citations are also used in the Results and Discussion. We expand on the findings of the Roberts et al. study from 2014 to state that the LIS1 and CLIP170 orthologues from yeast can couple dynein to a plus end-directed motor, Kip2.</p><p><italic>&quot;It is unclear how [Lis1's] activities can account for the reduction in dynein-based processes that is generally observed when LIS1 function is inhibited in cells.&quot; This seems an oversimplification, as incorrect targeting/inhibitory regulation can perturb motor processes as much as loss of an activator.</italic> </p><p>We include more discussion of other models for how LIS1 can promote dynein cargo transport in vivo (Introduction, seventh paragraph). We have been careful not to give the impression that our results contradict these models. However, they do offer an additional explanation for how LIS1 promotes cargo transport in the presence of processivity activators, which we find exciting. We believe our new evidence that LIS1 can promote the assembly of the dynein-dynactin-BICD2N complex strengthens this aspect of the manuscript significantly.</p><p><italic>&quot;However, LIS1's specific function in plus end tracking of dynein was also not addressed in previous</italic> in vitro <italic>reconstitution assays.&quot; This is true for mammalian proteins, but Lis1/Pac1's role has been addressed in reconstitutions with yeast proteins.</italic> </p><p>We now refer specifically to mammalian proteins in this section. We also mention in the Discussion specific findings of the reconstitution studies with yeast proteins.</p><p><italic>&quot;However, this [search-and-capture] mechanism has not been visualised directly.&quot; Plus-end capture and minus-end directed motility of melanophores has been visualized directly (Lomakin et al., 2009). Transfer of yeast dynein from the plus end to the cell cortex has been visualized directly (Markus et al., 2011).</italic></p><p><italic>There are other factors that could make plus end localization more complex in vivo as well. There are also additional mechanisms of dynein recruitment to the plus end and many other plus end binding proteins. Additional discussion of this complexity would strengthen the paper.</italic> </p><p>The restructuring of the Introduction to give more emphasis to existing models of how LIS1 regulates dynein (in response to the points above) has resulted in the section on visualisation of search-and-capture by plus end-associated dynein in vivo being removed. We now make it more explicit in the Discussion and the Perspective that additional factors could be involved in regulating transport initiation and plus end localisation in vivo. The Lomakin et al. and Markus et al. studies are cited elsewhere in our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
