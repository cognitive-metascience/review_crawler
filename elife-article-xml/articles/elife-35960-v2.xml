reproductive behavior. PACAP global knockout mice have decreased fertility and PACAP modulates LH release. However, its source and role at the hypothalamic level remain unknown. We demonstrate that PACAP-expressing neurons of the ventral premamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus (PMV<sup>PACAP</sup>) project to, and make direct contact with, kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and AVPV/PeN nuclei and a subset of these neurons respond to PACAP exposure. Targeted deletion of PACAP from the PMV through stereotaxic virally mediated cre- injection or genetic cross to LepR-i-cre mice with <italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice led to delayed puberty onset and impaired reproductive function in female, but not male, mice. We propose a new role for PACAP-expressing neurons in the PMV in the relay of nutritional state information to regulate GnRH release by modulating the activity of kisspeptin neurons, thereby regulating reproduction in female mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group

regulated throughout development to ensure the proper timing of puberty onset and attainment of fertility. Metabolic cues play a critical role in this regulatory process by modulating the release of kisspeptin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) at the hypothalamic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navarro and Kaiser, 2013</xref>). Situations of energy deficit and surfeit are known to cause fertility impairments (e.g. hypothalamic amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa) through the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion, but the mechanism by which metabolic factors regulate gonadotrophic axis function is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laughlin et al., 1998</xref>). Kisspeptins, secreted from kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the arcuate (ARC), anteroventral periventricular and periventricular (AVPV/PeN), are the main secretagogues of GnRH. Kiss1 neurons convey most of the regulatory cues of the gonadotropic axis, which determines the proper pulsatile or surge-like pattern of release of GnRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2016</xref>). Despite this primary role of kisspeptin and GnRH neurons in regulating the HPG axis, the signal transduction of metabolic information to these neurons is yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p>In this context, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, official gene symbol <italic>Adcyap1</italic>) has emerged as a neuroendocrine factor involved in the regulation of food intake and gonadotropin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Resch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halvorson, 2014</xref>). PACAP has been implicated in central processes such as development of anxiety behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mustafa, 2013</xref>) and circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mertens et al., 2007</xref>) and, importantly, both the ligand and the receptor are present in a number of metabolic and reproductive nuclei in the hypothalamus, including the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vaudry et al., 2000</xref>). The presence of PACAP in these nuclei has been linked to the anorectic action of leptin at the hypothalamic level by modulating the activity of POMC neurons directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Resch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mounien et al., 2006</xref>), but this has not been linked to its role in fertility. It is known that whole body deletion of PACAP signaling decreases fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jamen et al., 2000</xref>) and central PACAP administration delays puberty onset in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabó et al., 2002</xref>); however, its action on gonadotropin release remains controversial as both stimulatory and inhibitory actions have been reported in rodents after central PACAP infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Köves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Köves et al., 1998</xref>), indicating a degree of complexity that may be species- and/or sex-specific. Interestingly, a number of studies have invoked PACAP in the metabolic role of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanida et al., 2013</xref>); however, whether this action is direct (PACAP released from leptin receptor (LepR) expressing neurons) or indirect remains to be determined. In the context of reproduction, while LepR is expressed in a subset of kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), genetic studies have demonstrated that the main site of leptin’s action to regulate reproduction is not on kisspeptin neurons directly, but rather through cells in the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavalcante et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cravo et al., 2013</xref>). We observed that PACAP is highly expressed in this nucleus and therefore we sought to investigate if PACAP in the PMV is important in the regulation of reproductive function and whether it serves as a mediator of leptin to exert its reproductive role.</p><p>We generated conditional PACAP knockout (<italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice that allow for the deletion of the PACAP gene in the presence of cre-recombinase by genetic cross and viral injection, and we investigated whether PACAP is essential for full reproductive capabilities of female mice. We also used PACAP-i-cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krashes et al., 2014</xref>) that allowed us to investigate whether PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons synaptically connect to kisspeptin neurons at different neuroanatomical levels (i.e. ARC and AVPV/PeN) to determine how these PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons fit into the central regulation of the reproductive axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PACAP release from leptin-responsive neurons is essential for normal timing of puberty onset and fertility</title><p>An intact PMV is required to transduce metabolic information through leptin signaling to allow for HPG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the PMV is the region of the brain with the highest level of co-localization of pStat3 (an indirect marker of LepR activity) and PACAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>); approximately 87% of the PACAP neurons also express pStat3 in that region, though only 70% of the LepR neurons co-express PACAP. There are two other regions, both in the hypothalamus, that also show co-localization of pStat3 and PACAP, although to a lesser extent: the central nucleus of the ventromedial hypothalamus and the supramammillary nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate if PACAP is an important relay for leptin we produced mice with PACAP deleted conditionally from leptin receptor expressing neurons using the leptin receptor cre knock-in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leshan et al., 2006</xref>) crossed to the <italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse that we made. The LepR-i-cre mouse expresses cre recombinase in cells that produce the long-form of the leptin receptor, which are found primarily in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leshan et al., 2006</xref>), thus producing a conditional knockout of PACAP from neurons that express the leptin receptor. We validated this conditional knockout by qPCR and by RNA in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35960.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PACAP release from leptin-responsive neurons is essential for normal timing of puberty onset and fertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative microphotograph of a coronal section depicting PACAP (green) and pSTAT (red) immunoreactivity in the PMV of adult female PACAP-i-cre;L10-GFP mice treated with 5 mg/kg leptin two hours before perfusion.

There was no significant change in body weight in any of the animals on regular chow or high fat diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

The LepR-i-cre;<italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> animals showed a blunted LH surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>), which correlates with the dysregulated estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). They also had a blunted response to ovariectomy and fewer pups per litter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h,j</xref>). Since neurons located in the PMV have been described to contact GnRH neurons in addition to kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donato et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that GnRH neurons require either PACAP or other PMV signals to elicit a proper response to kisspeptin, which could lead to the reproductive impairment seen in these mice. Therefore, in order to determine if the function of GnRH neurons (and gonadotropes) remains intact in this model, we administered kisspeptin intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to these animals and compared LH release with their corresponding controls. Kisspeptin administration led to a similar induction of LH in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). This provides further evidence that GnRH neurons are able to respond normally to kisspeptin and, therefore, the reproductive impairment observed in these mice must rely on, or relay through another neuron that stimulates kisspeptin release. Finally, leptin administration to these animals in the morning after a fast, induced a lower than expected rise in LH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>); by comparison to the littermate controls, the LH induction in response to leptin treatment was blunted by 30%. This indicates that PACAP is responsible for transducing some, but not all, of the metabolic information relayed by leptin to the HPG axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PACAP deletion from the PMV in adulthood leads to impaired gonadotrophic function</title><p>Because the PMV is the site of greatest co-localization of LepR activity and PACAP, and prior studies detailed the importance of the region to the reproductive action of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donato and Elias, 2011</xref>), we investigated the role of PACAP in the PMV directly.

Males were removed after this period. Nearly all control mice became pregnant and successfully produced litters within 21 days of mating, indicating successful copulation on the first day of mating to the male. In contrast, the PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> KO mice had reduced fecundity, with decreased capacity to produce a litter after mating, and significant delay in the time to become pregnant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Furthermore, those pups that were produced by the PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> KO females did not survive more than one day post partum (data not shown), which was thought to be due to neglect/infanticide by the dam based on observation of the animals in their home cages. Though we could not assess the litter size, we observed a decrease in the number of corpora lutea in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which suggests an impairment in ovulation, consistent with a smaller number of follicles maturing per cycle, as a consequence of reduced gonadotropins. In control-injected animals the increase in LH between baseline (10:00) and surge (19:00) is significant, whereas for the KO animals only a trend to increased LH was observed at 19:00, suggesting an alteration in the ability of these mice to mount a normal ovulatory LH surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). On the other hand, the compensatory rise in LH after ovariectomy was not different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), indicating that the circuitry downstream of gonadal feedback, particularly the ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> population, responds normally to the absence of sex steroids.</p><p>Similar to what we observed in response to kisspeptin administration in the LepR-i-cre; <italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> ablated mice, PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> KO mice had a normal response to kisspeptin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), indicating intact signaling between kisspeptin and GnRH neurons, and supporting a role for PACAP to modulate kisspeptin release.

Unexpectedly, the LH response was not reduced, instead there was a slight but significant increase in LH induction by leptin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>).

Together, with the channelrhodopsin circuit mapping experiments, these findings indicate that PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons project directly to kisspeptin neurons, but PACAP has direct stimulatory effect on a subpopulation of neurons located in the caudal aspect of the ARC, and interspersed through the AVPV/PeN. Furthermore, PACAP has a net inhibitory effect on another subpopulation of AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons. Our experiments cannot distinguish if this PACAP activity originates from a particular population of PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons (e.g. LepR), yet this is further evidence of the important role of the complex interactivity of kisspeptin neurons in generating both pulsatile and surge LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that a large percentage of PMV neurons express PACAP (and glutamate), which modulates kisspeptin neurons, thus affecting fertility, estrous cycle, and puberty onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The most striking finding is that deletion of PACAP from the PMV of adult female mice leads to &gt;50% reduction in fecundity, a novel role for the neuromodulator specific to the PMV.

Interestingly, in this study, we observed that deletion of PACAP from the leptin-responsive neurons in female mice leads to delayed vaginal opening and delayed first estrus, both indirect markers of puberty onset, despite both groups having similar body weight. These data point to a crucial role of PACAP in the timing of sexual maturation in female mice, and aver the importance of future studies in males.</p><p>Because PACAP and LepR are expressed in the gonads and other peripheral tissues, the potential deletion of PACAP from those areas could be possible in our LepR-i-cre; <italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse model. Use of the LepR-i-Cre mouse should mostly restrict deletion of PACAP to the brain, however, the long form of the leptin receptor may be expressed at low levels in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leshan et al., 2006</xref>) and use of genetic cre-dependent manipulations can also lead to off-target deletion in neurons that express the LepR promoter during development but not in adulthood. Interestingly, in the gonads, LepR and PACAP are expressed in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duggal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reglodi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ryan et al., 2003</xref>). There is a chance as well for off-target deletion of PACAP from cells (central or peripheral) that do not express LepR in adult animals. Still, both the LepR-i-cre mediated deletion of PACAP and the central AAV-delivery based manipulations recapitulate the effects of previously published ablation of PMV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donato et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, our study demonstrates that the role of PACAP on the HPG axis is centrally mediated, specifically at the PMV.</p><p>As described above, PACAP seems to mediate the action of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Köves et al., 2003</xref>). Circulating levels of leptin are essential for gonadotropin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>) and, as such, acute decreases in circulating leptin during fasting or undernourishment lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In this study, removal of PACAP from leptin-responsive neurons blunted the ability of exogenous leptin to increase LH levels after fasting, but direct deletion of PACAP from the PMV did not, suggesting that PACAP from the PMV is only partially necessary for the normal permissive role of leptin on the gonadotropic axis. We surmise that other factors (neuromodulators or neurons), or other leptin-responsive, PACAP-expressing regions of the brain, such as the VMH or supramammillary nucleus are likely involved in the transmission of the reproductive role of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padilla et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, PACAP neurons—and the PMV in general—are predominantly glutamatergic, yet our recent studies indicated that leptin’s metabolic and reproductive actions are mediated by GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vong et al., 2011</xref>). While the absence of marked metabolic differences in these mice is in line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vong et al., 2011</xref>), the hypogonadism observed in these mice are the first evidence of a divergent pathway of leptin to regulate metabolism and reproduction. Our data indicate that PACAP likely acts together with other neuromodulators produced in the same or separate LepR-expressing neurons through which leptin exerts its reproductive effect. Given that only a subset of kisspeptin neurons are directly activated by PACAP, and that a subpopulation of kisspeptin neurons is GABAergic, it is possible that these two populations of neurons (i.e. PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> and kisspeptin neurons) work in concert in response to different types of input from the PMV (i.e. PACAP-ergic or glutamatergic). Kiss1 and GnRH neuron firing patterns are very tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2016</xref>) and further studies focusing on the neuromodulatory effects of PACAP (and other co-expressed peptides from the PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons) will be required to disentangle the role of PMV neurons in the control of GnRH release.</p><p>We observed that the majority of AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> and ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons tested receive direct contact from PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons, supporting a role for this neuropeptide in the control of the LH surge in females. Indeed, deletion of PACAP from the PMV either through viral delivery of cre recombinase to <italic>Adcyap1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice or through crossing with LepR-i-cre mice led to a blunted LH surge and a smaller litter size, indicating an impairment in the ability of the mouse to ovulate and the presence of fewer mature follicles, which is also reinforced by fewer corpora lutea in the AAV-cre injected model. Moreover, the subfertility induced by both models of PACAP deletions led to irregular estrous cycles, indicating a role in LH pulsatility. Estrous cyclicity is determined by the ability of the mouse to mount an ovulatory process in the afternoon of proestrus and is the result of increasing levels of estradiol as a consequence of low frequency GnRH/LH pulses during diestrus (thought to be driven by ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>), which drives more follicles to mature. The maturing follicles in turn synthesize more estradiol, which stimulates AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pinilla et al., 2012</xref>), inducing an LH surge. These reproductive impairments suggest that PACAP from the PMV plays a role in both pulsatile and surge-like release of GnRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Within ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons, the direct response to PACAP is specific to regional clusters of the caudal arcuate. These subpopulations of ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> cells have not been separately defined from the rest of the ARC population and this is the first time that PACAP activity has been shown to directly affect the activity of the ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> population, which express PACAP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>). ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons are primarily involved in setting the tone for GnRH pulsatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>), a requisite for normal HPG axis function, therefore indicating a likely role of PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> in the fine tuning of kisspeptin and GnRH pulses. Similarly, the AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons are a heterogenous group based on their response to PACAP. This indicates that there are likely different receptors and second messenger systems activated by PACAP in subpopulations of AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons that may play different roles in the timing and magnitude of the preovulatory LH surge. As above, the ability of GnRH neurons to respond normally to kisspeptin in the absence of PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> signaling, strongly suggests an action on (as evidenced by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or upstream of Kiss1 neurons. Furthermore, the compensatory LH rise in response to ovariectomy in these animals is also intact suggesting that PMV<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons are not required for sex steroid negative feedback, but instead may be involved in a separate pathway, such as the nutritional regulation of reproductive function. Together, these data indicate the neuromodulatory role of PACAP in the HPG axis is likely more subtle than the steroid hormone feedback, but remains important in its function.</p><p>In summary, we document the first evidence of a role for PACAP from the PMV in ovulatory cycling and subsequent fertility in females, which is required for normal reproduction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PACAP may also contribute to the reproductive role of leptin through the activation of glutamatergic, PACAPergic, leptin responsive neurons, but within the PMV, leptin signal transduction does not require PACAP expression. We also show for the first time that ARC<sup>kisspeptin</sup> and AVPV/PeN<sup>kisspeptin</sup> neurons are both heterogeneous populations, which can be defined by their response to PACAP, and this circuit is likely important for fine tuning of the HPG axis. These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms that underlie the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction and may offer the platform to develop new treatments for reproductive disorders associated with metabolic impairments, such as anorexia nervosa, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgeries</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the National Institute of Health, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women’s Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, protocol #05165.

Prior to hybridization, sections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), equilibrated in 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0), and acetylated in triethanolamine containing 0.25% acetic anhydride. Standard in vitro transcription methods were used to generate both sense and antisense riboprobes recognizing PACAP transcript, which were subsequently diluted in hybridization cocktail (Amresco) with tRNA. Sections were hybridized overnight at 60°C with either digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled riboprobes. After hybridization, slides were treated with RNase A and stringently washed in 0.5x SSC at 56°C for 30 min. Slides were then incubated with an antibody against DIG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Roche) overnight at 4°C. Riboprobe signal was further enhanced using the TSA-Plus fluorophore system with Alexa Fluor conjugated streptavidin (LifeTechnologies). Image capture was performed using fluorescent microscopy (Olympus VS120 slide scanner microscope) and analyzed with image J software. The primer sequences for the riboprobe generation are 5’-ccaatgaccatgtgtagcg and 5’- atcagaccagaagacgaggc. For dual fluorescence ISH, we used probes for <italic>Adcyap1</italic> and <italic>Vglut2</italic> obtained from ACDBio and used the RNAscope method per their protocol (ACDBio).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Brain tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry</title><p>Animals were terminally anesthetized with 7% chloral hydrate diluted in saline (350 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (PFA). Brains were removed, stored in the same fixative for 2 hr, transferred into 20% sucrose at 4°C overnight, and cut into 30 mm sections on a freezing microtome (Leica) coronally into four equal series. A single series of sections per animal was used in the histological studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brain sections were washed in PBS with Tween-20, pH 7.4 (PBST) and blocked in 3% normal donkey serum/PBST for 1 hr at room temperature.

The next morning sections were extensively washed in PBS and then incubated in Alexa- fluorophore secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:1,000) for 1 hr at room temperature. After several washes in PBS, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and fluorescence images were captured with Olympus VS120 slide scanner microscope.</p><p>For pStat3 immunohistochemistry studies, Mice were injected with 5 mg/kg recombinant leptin 2 hr before perfusion (as above). Brain sections were washed in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by incubation in 5% NaOH and 0.3% H2O2 for 2 min, then with 0.3% glycine (10 min), and finally with 0.03% SDS (10 min), all made up in PBS. Sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum/0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated overnight at room temperature in blocking solution containing 1/250 rabbit anti-pStat3 (Cell Signaling, #9145) and 1/1,000 chicken anti-GFP (Life Technologies, #A10262). The next morning sections were extensively washed in PBS and then incubated in 1/250 donkey anti-rabbit 594 (Molecular Probes, R37119) and 1/1,000 donkey anti-chicken 488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 703-545-155) for 2 hr at room temperature.

Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system, and analyzed using ABI Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min incubation at 95°C (hot start), 45 amplification cycles (95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 45 s at 75°C, with fluorescence detection at the end of each cycle), followed by melting curve of the amplified products obtained by ramped increase of the temperature from 55°C to 95°C to confirm the presence of single amplification product per reaction. <italic>Adcyap1</italic> expression was detected using primers PACAP F- GAA ACC CGC TGC AAG ACTT/PACAP R – CGA CAT CTC TCC TGT CCGC and was normalized with housekeeping gene <italic>Rpl19</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM for each group.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ross and colleagues investigated the role of PACAP expressing neurons in the ventral premamillary nucleus (PMV) in regulating parameters of reproductive function. They used a combination of genetic, optogenetic, and physiological approaches to demonstrate that PACAP neurons in the PMV express leptin receptors and innervate Kisspeptin neurons to regulate reproduction. Deletion of PACAP from the PMV, either by crossing with leptin receptor-Cre mice, or through viral-mediated expression of Cre in the PMV, caused changes in gonadotropin secretion and reduced fecundity. Deleting PACAP in the PMV delays puberty onset and reproductive function in females.</p><p>Electrophysiological studies and calcium imaging confirmed alterations of postsynaptic kisspeptin neurons that likely contribute to the observed reproductive dysfunction. The authors propose a sex specific role of PACAP neurons in the PMV to relay nutritional state to regulate GnRH release by modulating the activity of kisspepting neurons, thereby regulating reproduction. Collectively, the studies are well described, provide novel data and are of potential interest. However, several issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors propose a sex specific role of PACAP and allude to neural circuit differences, but only show results from females. The authors show that in female mice there is connectivity between PMV PACAP neurons and ARC Kisspeptin neurons. Is this the same in males? And could that connectivity difference explain the lack of effect on male fertility (this sexually dimorphic response is very interesting, and explaining the circuitry that underlies it would be phenomenal)? Likewise, is there different PACAP or PACAP-Leptin expression in M v F mice? If male data is not formally included, the sex difference assertion should be removed.</p><p>More details regarding the anatomic experiments are needed. Were the AAV injections unilateral or bilateral? If the latter, how were &quot;hits&quot; defined? In addition, more photomicrographs and/or drawings would help in assessment of the degree of deletion and/or placement of the channel rhodopsin.</p><p>Please define in more detail the control groups used in the PACAP deletion studies. Similarly, what was the control virus expressing? What age was this done? Since the lepR deletion suggests a developmental deficit, how does one reconcile these findings?</p><p>The data in this manuscript add to the expanding literature identifying circuits that convey metabolic signals to hypothalamic regions that regulate various aspects of reproduction. The array of technical approaches is impressive and the direct interrogation of cellular relationships and neuronal signaling has provided data that supports the authors' conclusions. The results are clearly illustrated, and the supplementary data is warranted. The channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping studies provide strong evidence of direct projects from PACAP neurons to kisspeptin neurons. The quantitative comparisons in relative frequency of inputs to kisspeptin neurons in the ARH and AVPV/PeN are welcome, but the sampling does not seem sufficient to support some of the statements. For example, recording from 13 neurons is insufficient to state that, &quot;a small fraction of non-kisspeptin neurons showed direct connectivity…&quot; or that recording from 18 neurons supports the statement that, &quot;the majority of AVPV/PeN kisspeptin neurons received direct input from PMV PACAP neurons…&quot; (Discussion section). It is also surprising that calcium imaging was not used to evaluate responses to PACAP in the AVPV/PeN, as it was in the ARC.</p><p>The methods are clearly described, and sufficient detail is provided. However, the figure legends are wholly inadequate. The reader should have a much better idea what they are looking at without having to combine comments in the text with sections of the methods. What is listed here is more of a series of titles for figures, rather than an explanation of what is depicted. This is likely a minor oversight because these authors have included informative figure legends elsewhere.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35960.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors propose a sex specific role of PACAP and allude to neural circuit differences, but only show results from females.
