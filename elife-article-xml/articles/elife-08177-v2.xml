The inner hair cells (IHCs) are the primary sensory receptors adapted for rapid auditory signaling, but they are not thought to be intrinsically tuned to encode particular sound frequencies. Here I found that under experimental conditions mimicking those in vivo, mammalian IHCs are intrinsically specialized. Low-frequency gerbil IHCs (~0.3 kHz) have significantly more depolarized resting membrane potentials, faster kinetics, and shorter membrane time constants than high-frequency cells (~30 kHz). The faster kinetics of low-frequency IHCs allow them to follow the phasic component of sound (frequency-following), which is not required for high-frequency cells that are instead optimally configured to encode sustained, graded responses (intensity-following). The intrinsic membrane filtering of IHCs ensures accurate encoding of the phasic or sustained components of the cell’s in vivo receptor potential, crucial for sound localization and ultimately survival.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08177.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08177.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08177.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals’ survival depends on them accurately and quickly identifying sounds in their environment. In animals with backbones, cells with hair-like projections (called hair cells) inside the ear convert information collected from sound waves into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted to the brain, which processes the information further.</p> <p>Animals like bullfrogs are adapted to hearing low frequency sounds, like their own mating calls. These frog’s hair cells are individually tuned so that they can capture sounds in this low frequency range. Mammals, on the other hand, have evolved to hear a much wider range of sounds from loud and low frequency sounds, such as thunder, to soft and high frequency sounds, like the cries of their young. In mammals, the part of inner ear involved in hearing (called the cochlea) has an elaborate spiral-like shape. The structure of the cochlea results in different frequencies of sound being transformed by the hair cells into electrical signals at different points around the spiral. Because of this, most researchers didn’t think that hair cells in mammals were individually tuned like those in bullfrogs.</p> <p>Now, Stuart Johnson demonstrates that hair cells in different parts of the gerbil’s cochlea are specialized for encoding sounds of specific frequencies. In conditions that mimic the environment inside the ear, a very precise jet of fluid was used to stimulate single hair cells in a similar way to a sound wave. The experiments then compared how hair cells from the upper and lower parts of the cochlea’s spiral responded. Johnson found that hair cells from the upper portion of the gerbils’ cochlea are specialized to capture low frequency sounds. They have electrical properties that allow them to quickly transmit information to the brain about low frequency sounds. In the lower portion of the cochlea, hair cells are specialized to capture high frequency sounds. That is, their electrical properties make it easier for these hair cells to transmit detailed information to the brain about the volume of high frequency sounds. Together, these findings help explain how these animals are able to localize sounds, which requires capturing both the timing and intensity of different types of sounds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08177.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08177.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>gerbil</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Stuart L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian primary sensory inner hair cells play an active role in auditory information processing, such that they show a preference for either timing or intensity coding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sound pressure waves are used by many animal species to gain sensory input from their environment that is vital for their survival and communication. The sensory receptors of the auditory system, the hair cells, are responsible for the transduction of sound waves into electrical signals that travel along the auditory pathway. The mechanosensory apparatus of hair cells is the stereociliary hair bundle that protrudes from their apical surface in the form of a staircase-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwander et al., 2010</xref>). Mechano-sensitive ion channels are positioned near the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>), the opening of which initiates a receptor potential that is shaped by voltage and ion-gated ion channels in the hair cell’s basolateral membrane. The receptor potential activates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the basal pole of the cell that trigger the release of neurotransmitter onto afferent terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>), so that sound information is conveyed to the higher auditory brain areas.</p><p>Auditory hair cells in lower vertebrates such as the turtle and bullfrog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fettiplace and Fuchs, 1999</xref>), where the hearing sensitivity spans a generally low-frequency range (from around 100 Hz to 1 kHz), show intrinsic membrane tuning such that the membrane potential oscillates at the cells’ characteristic frequency (CF). In these animals, the interplay between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, which are differentially expressed along the auditory organ, are thought to be the main mechanism determining hair cell frequency selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudspeth and Lewis 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). The mammalian auditory system has evolved to be able to encode a much wider dynamic range of sound frequencies and intensities. In order to do this, mammals have developed an elaborate auditory organ where much of the frequency tuning is carried out by the mechanics of the basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robles and Ruggero, 2001</xref>) and electromotility of the outer hair cells (OHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brownell et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashmore, 1987</xref>) driven by the motor protein prestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liberman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dallos et al., 2006</xref>). These morphological and functional differences along the mammalian cochlea produce a tonotopic place-frequency map that is preserved throughout the auditory pathway. Thus the main sensory receptors, the inner hair cells (IHCs), are believed not to show intrinsic tuning in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcotti et al., 2003</xref>), although recent studies have shown tonotopic differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson and Marcotti, 2008</xref>), the size of Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots at ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) along the cochlea. Moreover, the in vivo receptor potentials of low and high-frequency mammalian IHCs differ because of the relative filtering properties of the cells’ basolateral membrane. Low-frequency IHCs (up to a few kilohertz) have a predominantly phasic (AC) component that follows the stimulation frequency and is graded in size to the intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallos, 1985</xref>). The receptor potentials of high-frequency cells cannot follow the sound stimulus and as such do not have a large phasic component. Instead, they have a predominantly sustained (DC) component that is the average depolarization resulting when there is an asymmetric transduction current and it oscillates too fast for the cell membrane potential to keep up. The DC component is graded in size to sound intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Russell and Sellick, 1978</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, I have investigated the biophysical properties of mature gerbil IHCs under near physiological recording conditions in low-frequency (apical turn: ~300 Hz) and high-frequency (basal  turn: ~30 kHz) regions of the cochlea. The results show that the size of the resting mechanotransducer (MT) current and the composition of basolateral membrane currents are optimized to confer low- and high-frequency IHCs with different resting membrane potentials (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) and kinetics in vivo. These biophysical differences allow apical IHCs to follow precisely the phasic component of sound, while basal cells are able to accurately encode the sustained and graded component of high-frequency stimuli, providing direct evidence for the existence of intrinsic filtering in mammalian cochlear IHCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MT currents in mature gerbil apical and basal coil IHCs</title><p>MT currents from apical (~300 Hz) and basal (~30 kHz) coil IHCs of the mature gerbil (P17–P25) were elicited by displacing their hair bundles along their axis of mechanosensitivity with a 50 Hz sinusoidal stimulus using a piezoelectric fluid jet stimulator. The fluid jet produces a uniform deflection of the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corns et al., 2014</xref>) and for IHCs, which are stimulated in vivo by fluid motion within the cochlear partition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>), it provides a near-physiological stimulation without affecting their resting position. To mimic in vivo conditions as closely as possible, recordings were obtained from IHCs maintained at body temperature and their hair bundles were perfused with an extracellular solution containing an endolymphatic low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (40 µM: see Materials  and methods). The same low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution was also used inside the fluid jet. A large inward MT current was elicited in both apical (1.1 ± 0.1 nA, n = 5, P20–P25: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and basal coil IHCs (1.0 ± 0.2 nA, n = 6, P17–P25: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) upon moving their bundle in the excitatory direction (i.e., towards the taller stereocilia using positive driver voltages). Apical cells had a significantly larger resting MT current (464 ± 29 pA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>P<italic>&lt;</italic></italic>0.0001), which shut off during inhibitory phases of the stimulus, than that recorded from basal cells (70 ± 17 pA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This difference was also observed with FM1-43, a styryl dye that permeates the open transducer channels and accumulates inside the hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furness et al., 2013</xref>).

The opposite was observed in the OHCs, consistent with the fact they have larger resting MT currents in the basal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08177.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The resting mechanotransducer (MT) current in apical and basal inner hair cells (IHCs) from adult gerbils.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Saturating MT currents recorded from an apical (<bold>A</bold>) and a basal IHC (<bold>B</bold>) by applying 50 Hz sinusoidal force stimuli to the hair bundles at the membrane potential of –84 mV.

Current clamp recordings were performed on mature apical and basal coil gerbil IHCs (P17–P22) in response to current injection steps of up to 1 nA from their resting potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In the presence of 1.3 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is normally used when studying basolateral membrane currents, the resting potentials of apical (–68.6 ± 1.3 mV, n = 12) and basal (–71.7 ± 0.6 mV, n = 11) IHCs were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>), and within the same range previously found in mature IHCs from mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marcotti et al., 2004</xref>). The low (40 µM) extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution caused apical IHCs to depolarize (–56.1 ± 1.5 mV, n = 12) significantly more than basal IHCs (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; –65.8 ± 1.3 mV, n = 11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). The voltage responses of apical IHCs showed an initial decline and compression for the larger depolarizing current steps, whereas basal were larger, more sustained, and graded to the stimulus, especially in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). In the presence of the MT channel blocker dihydrostreptomycin (DHS) (100 µM) the voltage responses returned to control levels (40 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + DHS: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), indicating that the shift in the resting membrane potential in low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> was due to the increased MT channel open probability. These findings demonstrate that the resting membrane potential of apical IHCs is likely to be substantially more depolarized than that of basal cells in vivo, which would speed up their membrane time constant. The time constant of the voltage rise, following 100 pA depolarizing current injections, were significantly more rapid in apical than in basal IHCs in both control 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; apical: 1.03 ± 0.11 ms, n = 12; basal: 1.89 ± 0.19 ms, n = 11) and low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0005; apical: 0.44 ± 0.08 ms, n = 12; basal: 1.07 ± 0.13 ms, n = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Both apical and basal IHCs responded with very small changes in membrane potential when small amplitude sinewaves were applied from the estimated in vivo resting V<sub>m</sub> (100 pA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). However, the more depolarized V<sub>m</sub> of apical IHCs, and the consequently larger resting membrane conductance, made positively going responses to stimulation generally smaller than in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). The hyperpolarizing phase of apical IHCs was more pronounced than in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). For larger stimuli, at frequencies approaching (2 kHz) or exceeding (10 kHz) the maximum limit for phase locking in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>), the first phase of the responses in apical IHCs reached its maximum value immediately after the onset of stimulation. By contrast, the responses of basal cells built up to reach a peak after a few cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) because they are superimposed on a rising DC response that grows with timing set by the membrane time constant. While apical IHCs appear to be suited for phasic signaling, basal cells are more adept at signaling graded responses to high-frequency stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>) since their receptor potential builds up to represent stimulus intensity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08177.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Voltage responses of apical and basal inner hair cells (IHCs) to sound-like stimulation of different intensity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Voltage responses of apical and basal IHCs to 100 pA, 300 Hz sinewave stimulation.

The time differences are also shown as phase angle shifts, calculated based on the size of the time difference and the stimulus frequency. At 300 Hz the timing was generally more advanced in apical IHCs for the lower stimulus levels (100 pA: closed symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The same also occurred at 1 nA for the first peak, after which positive peaks in basal IHCs occurred sooner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but this made the half-cycle width much less accurate  in  basal  cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). At 300 Hz the half-cycle error was generally lower at each stimulus level in apical IHCs. At 2 kHz, where the timing and accuracy of the phasic component would be vital in vivo, the peak responses of apical IHCs again occurred generally more rapidly than in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In contrast to 300 Hz the timing difference at 2 kHz declined with progressive peaks to a stable level, but remained with an apical advance. This stable apical lead seems to be due to the underlying basolateral current differences between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>), because when apical and basal cells were stimulated with the same apical-like 2 kHz 1 nA protocol a similar stable apical lead was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>). Additionally, when the outward linopirdine-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current, present only in apical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), was blocked, the voltage responses became more basal-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>). The 2 kHz responses of apical cells were very accurate at each stimulus level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), whereas basal cells began with a large half-cycle error that improved progressively, as seen for the timing differences. The decline in basal cell half-cycle error is likely to reflect the decrease in cell membrane time constant, to a fairly steady value, as depolarization activates the K<sup>+</sup> currents. Therefore, the intrinsic characteristics of apical IHCs seem to be  best suited for the accurate representation of the phasic component of the receptor potential.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08177.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The timing of phasic responses to sound-like stimulation is faster and more accurate in apical inner hair cells (IHCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IHC responses to a 1 nA, 2 kHz stimulus showing the relative timing shift between apical and basal cells (above) to the sinewave stimuli (below; apical black and basal grey).

The emphasized ‘off’ periods in apical IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) would provide greater contrast for accurate phase-locking.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study I have shown that the biophysical characteristics of IHCs are specialized according to their frequency position within the gerbil cochlea. Using physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and body temperature, low-frequency (apical) IHCs had a significantly larger resting MT current than high-frequency (basal) cells. A large difference in the resting MT current was observed using three independent methods: direct MT current recordings, FM1-43 labeling, and shifts in the holding current in whole cell and perforated patch clamp. The physiological consequence of differences in the resting MT current is that the IHC resting membrane potential in vivo, in the absence of sound stimulation, is likely to be around –55 mV in apical and –65 mV in basal cells. This, combined with their different complement of basolateral membrane currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>), indicates that low- frequency and high-frequency IHCs are intrinsically specialized to their location. The gerbil was the preferred model for this study because of its extended low-frequency hearing range (0.1–60 kHz: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller, 1996</xref>) where phase-locking to auditory stimuli occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Versteegh et al., 2011</xref>), compared to the predominantly high-frequency hearing of the mouse (2–100 kHz: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenwood, 1990</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the CF</title><p>The sound induced receptor potentials of low-frequency (below a few kilohertz) and high-frequency IHCs are very different. While low-frequency cells have a predominant sound frequency-following, or phase-locked, AC component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallos, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheatham and Dallos, 1993</xref>), the main component of high-frequency cells is a graded and sustained DC shift in potential in proportion to sound intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Russell and Sellick, 1978</xref>). Mammals use two main strategies to localize sounds of different frequency. Low frequencies are localized by principal cells in the medial superior olive (MSO) that compare the inter-aural timing differences (ITDs) of phase-locked activity in auditory afferents from the two ears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirila et al., 2007</xref>). High-frequency sounds are localized by principal cells in the lateral superior olive (LSO) that compares inter-aural level differences (ILDs) arising from the graded responses of IHCs of each ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caird and Klinke, 1983</xref>). Therefore, the biophysical properties of low-frequency and high-frequency IHCs should be best suited to maximize the accuracy of response-timing in apical cells and response-level in basal cells to allow the detection of ITDs down to 10 µs and ILDs of only 1–2 dB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grothe et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study I found that low-frequency IHCs have a significantly more depolarized resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> than basal cells arising from the large resting MT current, which increases their resting conductance and speeds up their voltage responses. In response to simulated sound stimuli, apical IHCs were faster and preserved the phase width of the stimulus better than basal cells up to around the maximum frequency for phase-locking. However, the superior speed and timing of apical cells is not just down to their more depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> since basal cells remained slower even when depolarized at similar values to those of apical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>). I found that the differential expression of the K<sup>+</sup> current <italic>I</italic><sub>K,n</sub> in apical and basal IHCs was a major determinant for response speed and timing at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>).</p><p>The depolarized resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> of apical cells (about –55 mV) caused their ‘off’ response to sound-like stimulation to be larger than their ‘on’ component (responses to positive phases of the sinusoidal currents) for moderate stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is comparable to the visual system where photons of light cause a hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor et al., 1979</xref>) and a reduction in the release of glutamate. This ‘backwards’ mechanism introduces much less noise into the signal and enhances contrast, which would be favorable for phase-locking to auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>). The high-order Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of synaptic vesicle release in apical gerbil IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) enhances these ‘off’ periods when <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> is transformed into <italic>P</italic><sub>Release</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which would further increase the signal contrast as it is relayed onto afferent fibers and push the boundary for phase-locking up to a higher frequency. The smaller overall <italic>P</italic><sub>Release</sub> of apical IHCs to the maximal predicted stimulation would be compensated by multivesicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>) or uniquantal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapochnikov et al., 2014</xref>) release at individual ribbon synapses, generating large excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the afferent terminals, the size of which has been shown to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent and larger ones show more accurate phase-locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant and Glowatzki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Recent findings have shown that a more depolarized membrane potential in hair cells leads to the facilitation of glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>), which would have important consequences for IHC neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity, and spike adaptation during a sound stimulus. However, a generally smaller exocytotic response, as calculated for the maximal <italic>P</italic><sub>Release</sub> in apical IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E and F</xref>), would again be favorable for maximizing response speed, at the expense of accurately signaling intensity. This could explain why sound intensity discrimination is better towards the higher frequencies (1–6 kHz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fletcher and Munson, 1933</xref>).</p><p>While apical cells are adapted for response speed, basal cells are specialized for intensity coding. Their more hyperpolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (about –65 mV), due to the much smaller resting MT current, and consequently greater membrane time constant, means that the responses of basal cells to even low level sounds summate into a DC membrane potential shift that is proportional to stimulus intensity. By contrast, apical IHCs only showed signs of a DC component for large stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). The lower resting conductance of basal cells also means that their response amplitudes are bigger, although slower, than apical cells and are more spread out giving better discrimination between stimulus levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The overall linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of neurotransmitter release in adult gerbil basal IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) would extend the dynamic range, enabling cells to accurately relay information from both low and high intensity sounds into afferent activity.</p><p>The differences in mature gerbil IHCs seen here are opposite to what we previously observed in mature OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). In OHCs it is the high-frequency basal cells that have the fastest membrane properties and largest currents. This is important because they follow sound up to the highest frequencies in order to drive the prestin motors on a cycle-by-cycle basis for cochlear amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dallos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fettiplace and Hackney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashmore, 2008</xref>). In order for IHCs to be fast enough to encode the phasic component of high-frequency sounds, the size of the receptor potential would be so small that the graded component would be lost and the response would be too fast to be encoded by the release of synaptic vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>IHCs play a crucial role in auditory information processing</title><p>Classical in vivo sharp electrode recordings of IHC receptor potential responses to sound reveal similar distinctions between apical and basal IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheatham and Dallos, 1993</xref>). Low-frequency guinea pig IHCs respond to sound with a predominant AC component and a large hyperpolarization from rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dallos, 1986</xref>). By contrast, the responses in high-frequency cells are dominated by the DC component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Russell and Sellick, 1978</xref>), although when stimulated with low-frequency sound they also show an AC component but with little hyperpolarization from rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>), indicative of a smaller resting MT current in basal cells. In vivo studies on IHCs and afferent fibers have independently suggested that there are intrinsic differences between apical and basal regions, which generate a resting bias for apical cells towards the ‘on’ or depolarized condition and basal cells to the ‘off’ hyperpolarized condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohlemiller and Siegel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheatham and Dallos, 1993</xref>). A different resting bias would result from differences in the standing current through the IHCs (i.e., resting MT current), such that the larger current in apical cells would reduce the DC component to favor AC responses, whereas the smaller current in basal cells would enhance the DC <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> shifts. A different resting bias would also explain why afferent fibers in the gerbil generally have a higher spontaneous firing rate (SR) at the apex than those at base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohlemiller et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohlemiller and Siegel, 1994</xref>). Therefore, both low-frequency and high-frequency IHCs are specialized for their respective tasks, showing a preference for either timing or intensity coding, respectively. While low-frequency cells are able to respond rapidly and accurately to phasic stimuli at around the phase-locking limit, high-frequency cells show clearly defined graded shifts in membrane potential over an extended dynamic range. Evidence in support of a specialization of apical cells for phase-locking comes from in vivo recordings from chinchilla auditory nerve fibers showing that the strength of phase-locking in high-CF fibers starts to deteriorate at lower stimulus frequencies than that in low-CF fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Temchin and Ruggero, 2010</xref>). The findings presented here show that the primary sensory IHCs play a more active role in auditory information processing than previously thought.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Gerbil cochlear IHCs (<italic>n</italic> = 115) were studied in acutely dissected organs of Corti from postnatal day 17 (P17) to P40, where the day of birth is P0.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Andrew King), and three reviewers, two of whom have agreed to reveal their identity: Ruth Anne Eatock and Henrique von Gersdorff.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>Your paper has been considered by three reviewers, who agree that your study is technically proficient and that the differences you report in the transduction currents and input resistance between apical and basal inner hair cells potentially have important functional implications for sensory coding. In particular, they noted that characterizing ionic currents in isolated cochleas of adult gerbils under conditions comparable to those in vivo is a significant accomplishment. Concern was expressed, however, that the observed differences in the probability of opening of the transducer channel at rest might be due to the recording conditions used. Consequently, this and several other issues will need to be addressed before a final decision can be made.</p> <p>1) The possibility that the difference in channel open probabilities could be attributable to differences in intracellular calcium buffering, as seen in other hair cells, needs to be addressed. The reviewers discussed the value of using perforated-patch recordings, where the cytoplasmic proteins are not washed out, or of using various calcium buffer concentrations in conjunction with whole-cell recording to address this issue. The same point was raised in the context of measurements of resting potential and membrane time constants. While they agreed that perforated-patch recordings present their own difficulties and are not essential for this study, the possibility that differences in calcium loading between basal and apical inner hair cells have to be considered. One of the reviewers also noted that there is a prior report of a tonotopic gradient in calcium-binding proteins (Pack and Slepecky, 1995).</p> <p>2) The reviewers stated that the use of current injection may not have been the best approach for characterization of the difference in sound-evoked receptor potentials, since this is not accompanied by the related conductance change, and whether direct stimulation of the hair bundle or dynamic clamp would have been better. You will need to address this issue in any revision.</p> <p>3) All the reviewers thought that the FM1-43 results are important and need to be illustrated in the manuscript.</p> <p>4) One of the reviewers questioned the use of frequency domain (sines) to study signaling and then analysis of the results exclusively and seemingly laboriously in the time domain. You should consider whether the effects of various cellular processes on timing and linearity of the response could be efficiently measured as phase angles and the presence of harmonics in the receptor potential. These numbers could then be compared to analogous numbers from in vivo responses of auditory afferents.</p> <p>5) Please consider your findings in relation to the phase-locking of auditory nerve fibres: does previous evidence show that if you drive a basal high-CF cochlear fibre with a loud, low-frequency tone, its phase-locking is worse than that of a low-CF fiber at low frequencies?</p> <p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p> <p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Membrane properties specialize mammalian inner hair cells for frequency or intensity encoding&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers agree that the addition of the perforated patch experiments has strengthened the manuscript and that the technical issues previously raised have been dealt with satisfactorily. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. In particular, the reviewers found the Results section hard to follow in places and have made the following specific comments:</p> <p>1) Your global replacement of &quot;tuning&quot; with &quot;specialization&quot;, in response to a reviewer's suggestion, works in some contexts, but, in other cases, &quot;filtering&quot; would do the job better – it gets across the idea of frequency (which specialization does not) without implying sharp tuning.</p> <p>2) Your response to the suggestion to use dynamic clamp has been questioned: It may not be easy to implement dynamic clamp at these frequencies, and is not certain to substantially affect the data.</p> <p>3) In paragraph two of the Introduction, do you mean &quot;too fast to fully charge the cell membrane&quot; or &quot;too fast for the cell membrane potential to keep up&quot;?</p> <p>4) In paragraph two of the subsection “Tonotopic differences in IHC basolateral membrane currents,” the statement that DHS prevented the increase in holding current (i.e. depolarization of resting potential) is true for the apical cells, but is not shown to be true in the basal cell exemplar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Are there other examples for which adding DHS did a good job of blocking the &quot;leak&quot; conductance at –64 mV (as is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>)? Otherwise you may need to back off on that assertion for basal cells.</p> <p>5) Paragraph four of the subsection “Voltage responses of IHCs to sound-like stimulation” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. The large &quot;error&quot; at the start of the tone burst stimulus presumably reflects the rapid decrease in tau-m as depolarization activates K currents – affecting the timing of the response even in the course of one stimulus cycle. The cycle width accuracy improves once tau-m has a new fairly steady value, so that the same phase lag (delay) holds throughout the cycle. The text currently does not make this clear.</p> <p>6) Paragraph five, subheading “Voltage responses of IHCs to sound-like stimulation”. Don't you mean the larger &quot;standing&quot; in vivo MT current – rather than &quot;asymmetric&quot;? (A steady current can never be symmetric, at least in the way &quot;symmetric&quot; has been used in this paper, so the use of the term &quot;asymmetric&quot; is puzzling).</p> <p>7) In paragraph seven of the same subsection, indicate what the Prelease levels at resting potential are, perhaps on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>. The troughs of the Prelease plots are both so close to zero, it is hard to see that there is a significant difference between apical and basal cells in this regard.</p> <p>8) In paragraph one of the Discussion, a reference is given as a number (29).</p> <p>9) Paragraph two, subsection “The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the characteristic frequency”: Sometimes the writing is too telegraphic for me to follow. Are you again commenting on the observation that as frequency increases, there is little DC component to drive release in the apical hair cells, in contrast to the basal cells?</p> <p>10) Paragraph three, subsection “The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the characteristic frequency”. When you say that the more hyperpolarised <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> acts to create a DC shift, do you mean that the hyperpolarised <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> does this by keeping ion channels closed and thereby increasing tau-m or is any additional mechanism implied here?</p> <p>11) I'm not sure &quot;on-like&quot; and &quot;off-like&quot; will be clear to the reader. How about just stating somewhere in a legend or in the text that by &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; you mean responses to positive and negative phases of the sinusoidal currents, respectively?</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08177.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>[…] Consequently, this and several other issues will need to be addressed before a final decision can be made.</italic> </p> <p><italic>1) The possibility that the difference in channel open probabilities could be attributable to differences in intracellular calcium buffering, as seen in other hair cells, needs to be addressed. The reviewers discussed the value of using perforated-patch recordings, where the cytoplasmic proteins are not washed out, or of using various calcium buffer concentrations in conjunction with whole-cell recording to address this issue.

While they agreed that perforated-patch recordings present their own difficulties and are not essential for this study, the possibility that differences in calcium loading between basal and apical inner hair cells have to be considered. One of the reviewers also noted that there is a prior report of a tonotopic gradient in calcium-binding proteins (Pack &amp; Slepecky, 1995).</italic> </p> <p>I agree that possible differences in the buffering capability could affect the main conclusions. However, published data from IHCs of the adult gerbil cochlea has demonstrated that the buffering strength is likely to be similar between apical and basal cells (Johnson et al., 2008). Despite this, I decided to verify this previous finding by recording voltage responses from mature apical and basal gerbil IHCs (P29-P36) using new perforated patch experiments. Rather than performing MT current recordings on mature IHCs using the fluid jet, which are extremely complex experiments even in whole-cell configuration, I used the cells holding current at -64 mV as a measure of the resting transducer current, which is responsible for determining the level of depolarization of the IHC at rest. The new data show that the holding current measured in endolymphatic extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was much larger in apical cells than basal cells. This holding current was linked to the MT current because it was selectively abolished by the application of the MT channel blocker DHS, indicating that the results in whole-cell are a true representation of the physiological condition in mature IHCs. This also shows that, as previously demonstrated (Johnson et al., 2008), the observed differences between apical and basal IHCs are not a direct consequence of possible differences in the endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer along the cochlea. Of course, this is unlikely to apply to OHCs (Johnson et al., 2011, Neuron). The new data are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, described in the Results section (paragraphs two and three, subsection “Tonotopic differences in IHC basolateral membrane currents”) and detailed in the second paragraph of the Methods.</p> <p><italic>2) The reviewers stated that the use of current injection may not have been the best approach for characterization of the difference in sound-evoked receptor potentials, since this is not accompanied by the related conductance change, and whether direct stimulation of the hair bundle or dynamic clamp would have been better. You will need to address this issue in any revision.</italic> </p> <p>I believe that current injection was the best approach to characterise the difference in sound evoked potentials since the protocols were designed to mimic the MT current. Direct stimulation of the hair bundle would not be appropriate for this experiment mainly because the tall hair bundle of adult IHCs are easily damaged by repeated stimulation, which was a requirement for to collecting accurate and reliable data. Hair bundle damage would lead to differences in the stimulus intensity within the same cell and from cell to cell, making it very difficult to compare apical and basal cells. Dynamic clamp would do the same thing as injecting current in this case since it predicts the resulting current through the MT channels and applies it as a current injection. Dynamic clamp uses the conductance values to work out the current through the channel at different potentials, so effectively adds the channel to the cell. However, I just want to mimic the transducer current from the resting potential of the cell, so if I know what it should be at rest and during stimulation I can apply it to the cell and see how it responds. So, in some respect I am already doing dynamic clamp.</p> <p><italic>3) All the reviewers thought that the FM1-43 results are important and need to be illustrated in the manuscript.</italic> </p> <p>The FM1-43 results have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>.</p> <p><italic>4) One of the reviewers questioned the use of frequency domain (sines) to study signaling and then analysis of the results exclusively and seemingly laboriously in the time domain. You should consider whether the effects of various cellular processes on timing and linearity of the response could be efficiently measured as phase angles and the presence of harmonics in the receptor potential. These numbers could then be compared to analogous numbers from in vivo responses of auditory afferents.</italic> </p> <p>As suggested, I have provided the phase angles in degrees for the timing differences as well so readers can make a comparison with the auditory nerve literature. These are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and E</xref> where I have included an additional y-axis on the graphs showing phase angles. Regarding harmonics, I haven't done a Fourier analysis of the data because the non-linearities that I report are strongly time-dependent (as can be seen from panels B-E in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Fourier analysis provides a plot of frequency components of recording, but works only with steady-state responses.</p> <p><italic>5) Please consider your findings in relation to the phase-locking of auditory nerve fibres: does previous evidence show that if you drive a basal high-CF cochlear fibre with a loud, low-frequency tone, its phase-locking is worse than that of a low-CF fiber at low frequencies?</italic></p> <p>This is a very interesting remark. A recent study by Temchin and Ruggero in JARO (2010) has mentioned that phase-locking of high-CF fibres starts to deteriorate at lower stimulus frequencies than that of low-CF fibres. This paper is now mentioned in the Discussion (in the subsection “IHCs play a crucial role in auditory information processing”).</p> <p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p> <p><italic>The reviewers agree that the addition of the perforated patch experiments has strengthened the manuscript and that the technical issues previously raised have been dealt with satisfactorily.

In particular, the reviewers found the Results section hard to follow in places and have made the following specific comments:</italic> </p> <p> <italic>1) Your global replacement of &quot;tuning&quot; with &quot;specialization&quot;, in response to a reviewer's suggestion, works in some contexts, but, in other cases, &quot;filtering&quot; would do the job better – it gets across the idea of frequency (which specialization does not) without implying sharp tuning.</italic> </p> <p>I have changed “specialization” to “filtering” in two places (at the end of the Abstract and Introduction).</p> <p> <italic>2) Your response to the suggestion to use dynamic clamp has been questioned: It may not be easy to implement dynamic clamp at these frequencies, and is not certain to substantially affect the data.</italic> </p> <p>I agree with the comment and this is the reason why I used current injection to mimic the transducer current.</p> <p> <italic>3) In paragraph two of the Introduction, do you mean &quot;too fast to fully charge the cell membrane&quot; or &quot;too fast for the cell membrane potential to keep up&quot;?</italic> </p> <p>As suggested, I have added “potential” to the sentence.</p> <p> <italic>4) In paragraph two of the subsection “Tonotopic differences in IHC basolateral membrane currents,” the statement that DHS prevented the increase in holding current (i.e. depolarization of resting potential) is true for the apical cells, but is not shown to be true in the basal cell exemplar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Are there other examples for which adding DHS did a good job of blocking the &quot;leak&quot; conductance at</italic> </p> <p><italic>–64 mV (as is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>)? Otherwise you may need to back off on that assertion for basal cells.</italic> </p> <p>I do not agree with this comment since the use of DHS is only aimed at blocking the transducer channel component of the holding current (not “leak” current). The reason why in basal IHCs there is a larger “leak” compared to control is because DHS is present together with Low Ca, which per se will reduce a BK current (Marcotti et al., 2004). Indeed, DHS does reduce the holding current in basal cells, although to a lesser extent to apical IHCs due to a much smaller resting transducer current. However, we have now modified the text to clarify that the reduced holding current in DHS refers to the transducer current component (paragraph two, subsection “Tonotopic differences in IHC basolateral membrane currents”).</p> <p> <italic>5) Paragraph four of the subsection “Voltage responses of IHCs to sound-like stimulation” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. The large &quot;error&quot; at the start of the tone burst stimulus presumably reflects the rapid decrease in tau-m as depolarization activates K currents – affecting the timing of the response even in the course of one stimulus cycle. The cycle width accuracy improves once tau-m has a new fairly steady value, so that the same phase lag (delay) holds throughout the cycle. The text currently does not make this clear.</italic> </p> <p>This is a good point and I have now added a sentence to explain this more clearly.</p> <p> <italic>6) Paragraph five, subheading “Voltage responses of IHCs to sound-like stimulation”. Don't you mean the larger &quot;standing&quot; in vivo MT current – rather than &quot;asymmetric&quot;? (A steady current can never be symmetric, at least in the way &quot;symmetric&quot; has been used in this paper, so the use of the term &quot;asymmetric&quot; is puzzling).</italic> </p> <p>I changed “asymmetric” to “standing”.</p> <p> <italic>7) In paragraph seven of the same subsection, indicate what the Prelease levels at resting potential are, perhaps on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>. The troughs of the Prelease plots are both so close to zero, it is hard to see that there is a significant difference between apical and basal cells in this regard.</italic> </p> <p>I added the values for Prelease at rest and during the troughs (paragraph seven, same subsection).</p> <p> <italic>8) In paragraph one of the Discussion, a reference is given as a number (29).</italic></p> <p>Thank you for spotting this oversight, which I have amended (the reference is to Muller, 1996).</p> <p> <italic>9) Paragraph two, subsection “The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the characteristic frequency”: Sometimes the writing is too telegraphic for me to follow. Are you again commenting on the observation that as frequency increases, there is little DC component to drive release in the apical hair cells, in contrast to the basal cells?</italic> </p> <p>My intension was to highlight the fact that the change in Prelease in apical cells doesn’t reach the same maximal values as those in basal cells, which is due to the smaller <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> changes combined with the high-order Ca dependent exocytosis. I now mention in the text that this refers to the smaller maximal Prelease calculated for apical IHCs.</p> <p> <italic>10) Paragraph three, subsection “The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the characteristic frequency”. When you say that the more hyperpolarised</italic> V<italic><sub>m</sub> acts to create a DC shift, do you mean that the hyperpolarised</italic> V<italic><sub>m</sub> does this by keeping ion channels closed and thereby increasing tau-m or is any additional mechanism implied here?</italic></p> <p>The DC shift for even low levels of stimulation is mainly due to the much smaller resting MT current in basal cells, which also contributes to the larger tau-m. Therefore once the MT current is larger than 100pA (twice the resting MT current) there will be a DC shift in <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. I now mention it is due to the small resting MT current in the text.</p> <p> <italic>11) I'm not sure &quot;on-like&quot; and &quot;off-like&quot; will be clear to the reader. How about just stating somewhere in a legend or in the text that by &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; you mean responses to positive and negative phases of the sinusoidal currents, respectively?</italic> </p> <p>I have defined “off” and “on” in the text (paragraph seven, subsection “Voltage responses of IHCs to sound-like stimulation” and paragraph two, subsection “The biophysical properties of IHCs are specialized for the characteristic frequency”) and in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
