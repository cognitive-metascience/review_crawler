methyltransferases are hallmark enzymes at mammalian heterochromatin. We show here that the mouse Suv39h2 enzyme differs from Suv39h1 by containing an N-terminal basic domain that facilitates retention at mitotic chromatin and provides an additional affinity for major satellite repeat RNA. To analyze an RNA-dependent interaction with chromatin, we purified native nucleosomes from mouse ES cells and detect that Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 exclusively associate with poly-nucleosomes. This association was attenuated upon RNaseH incubation and entirely lost upon RNaseA digestion of native chromatin. Major satellite repeat transcripts remain chromatin-associated and have a secondary structure that favors RNA:DNA hybrid formation. Together, these data reveal an RNA-mediated mechanism for the stable chromatin interaction of the Suv39h KMT and suggest a function for major satellite non-coding RNA in the organization of an RNA-nucleosome scaffold as the underlying structure of mouse heterochromatin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25293.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25293.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Suv39h1</kwd><kwd>Suv39h2</kwd><kwd>major satellite repeat</kwd><kwd>pericentric heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA:DNA hybrids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institue of Immunobiology and Epigenetics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jenuwein</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jenuwein</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Marie Curie European fellowship program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamalinda</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An RNA-mediated mechanism that stabilizes association of the Suv39h enzymes at mouse heterochromatin is defined.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The classic distinction between euchromatin and heterochromatin is used to define decondensed, gene-rich and transcriptionally active regions of the genome vs. more compacted, gene-poor and transcriptionally silent domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heitz, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huisinga et al., 2006</xref>). However, heterochromatin is not transcriptionally inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huisinga et al., 2006</xref>). Mouse heterochromatin contains large portions of non-coding major satellite repeat DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hörz and Altenburger, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vissel and Choo, 1989</xref>). In early mouse development, transcription from the major satellite repeats (MSR) is required to establish heterochromatin formation in the zygote and the 2 to 4 cell embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Probst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casanova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2014</xref>). Failure of MSR transcription will not allow heterochromatin establishment and results in abrogation of the development of the early mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Probst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2014</xref>). In somatic mouse cells, heterochromatic transcription is cell cycle regulated and MSR transcripts transiently increase in the late G1/early S phases and persist during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Gilbert, 2007</xref>). Moreover, RNaseA treatment of permeabilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) weakens heterochromatin and leads to dispersion of key heterochromatic factors, such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maison et al., 2002</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that mouse heterochromatin contains an RNA component(s) that is required for the initiation and probably also structural stability of heterochromatin.</p><p>Nuclear non-coding RNA have been proposed to facilitate recruitment of chromatin factors by serving as guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>) and/or to constitute a structural component of a distinct chromatin configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rodríguez-Campos and Azorín, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mondal et al., 2010</xref>). For heterochromatin factors, RNA binding has been shown for HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muchardt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maison et al., 2011</xref>), the Suv4-20h KMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bierhoff et al., 2014</xref>) and also for other heterochromatin-related proteins that are involved in X inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moindrot and Brockdorff, 2016</xref>) and Polycomb-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonasio et al., 2014</xref>). RNA association has been proposed to provide an additional affinity, next to DNA and protein-protein interaction and recognition of histone modifications. Several low-affinity interactions can work together and stabilize chromatin association of components of the Polycomb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Non-coding RNA as a structural chromatin entity is well documented for telomeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoeftner and Blasco, 2009</xref>), has been implicated to be involved in forming DNA:RNA hybrids that could mediate RNAi-directed heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakama et al., 2012</xref>) and has also been shown to be important for centromere function to ensure kinetochore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rošić et al., 2014</xref>). RNA preparations from cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and chromatin fractions display distinct distributions of a variety of RNA populations that differ in their content for processed messenger RNA, long non-coding RNA and many heterogeneous nuclear transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt et al., 2012</xref>). However, the analysis of repeat-rich RNA in this and other genome-wide expression profiles has largely been ignored or understudied. Recent work has documented that repeat-rich RNA sequences that are present in the rapidly reannealing (CoT-1) fraction of the genome extensively decorate nearly all euchromatic regions of interphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). This result exposes a general architectural function for non-coding RNA in chromosome organization that extends previous findings for chromatin association of <italic>Xist</italic> and long intergenic nuclear element (LINE) transcripts during X inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall and Lawrence, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chow et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of how repeat-rich, non-coding RNA initiate and maintain mammalian heterochromatin remain unclear. Here, we address two major questions and examine first whether the chief enzymes for mouse heterochromatin, the Suv39h KMT, contain an RNA binding affinity for major satellite repeat transcripts. Second, we analyze the molecular properties and secondary structures of major satellite repeat RNA and study their association with mouse heterochromatin. We show that the Suv39h2 KMT contains an N-terminal basic domain that confers preferred binding to single-stranded MSR-repeat RNA in vitro. To characterize the association of Suv39h enzymes with chromatin, we purified native nucleosomes from mouse ES cells by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and fractionation in sucrose density gradients. The Suv39h KMT exclusively accumulate in the poly-nucleosomal fractions and this association was attenuated upon RNaseH incubation and entirely lost upon RNaseA digestion of the MNase-processed input chromatin. These data reveal an RNA component to be important for the recruitment of the Suv39h KMT and suggest that an RNA-nucleosome scaffold is the physiological template for the stable association of Suv39h enzymes to chromatin. In addition, RNA preparations that were purified from MNase-solubilized chromatin display sensitivity towards RNaseH, when they are examined with MSR-specific DNA probes. We propose a model, in which mouse heterochromatin is composed of a higher order RNA-nucleosome scaffold that contains MSR RNA:DNA hybrids and significant portions of single-stranded MSR-repeat RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and characterization of the full-length mouse Suv39h2 protein</title><p>The mouse Suv39h enzymes are presented by two genes, <italic>Suv39h1</italic> and <italic>Suv39h2</italic>.

We conclude that Suv39h2 (477 aa) is distinct from Suv39h1 (412 aa) and that the Suv39h2 protein contains three conspicuous domains, the N-terminal basic domain, the chromo domain and the catalytically active SET domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 can independently re-establish H3K9me3 and silence MSR transcription in interphase mouse ES cells</title><p>To examine the functional roles of Suv39h1 or Suv39h2 independently and to dissect a possible contribution of the basic domain of Suv39h2, we re-introduced epitope-tagged (EGFP) full-length Suv39h1 or full-length Suv39h2 into <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn mouse ES cells with plasmid constructs that drive expression under the control of the β-actin promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we generated a Suv39h2 mutant that lacks the basic domain from threonine 3 to lysine 81 (T3K81) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Whole cell extracts were analyzed from unsynchronized and nocodazole-arrested cells by western blot with an α-GFP antibody. Similar expression levels were observed between full-length Suv39h2-EGFP and the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant in unsynchronized cell extracts, while the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP signal is increased in mitotically enriched extracts. Expression of full-length Suv39h1-EGFP was appreciably higher, both in comparison with the Suv39h2-EGFP products and with regard to endogenous Suv39h1 in wt ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant and full-length Suv39h2-EGFP showed similar or lower expression levels as compared to endogenous Suv39h2 in wt ES cells. Importantly, these data indicate that there is no massive overexpression of the reintroduced Suv39h-EGFP products and that full-length Suv39h2-EGFP is not dominating the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant or the full-length Suv39h1-EGFP protein expression levels.</p><p>We then analyzed the potential of the different Suv39h-EGFP products to restore heterochromatin. For this, we compared bulk H3K9me3 levels, localization of the Suv39h-EGFP products at DAPI-positive heterochromatic foci and silencing of major satellite repeat sequences. All Suv39h-EGFP products can re-establish H3K9me3 to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and independently localize to heterochromatic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

It should be noted, however, that silencing of another prominent Suv39h target, long intergenic nuclear elements (LINE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>), was not restored by any of the Suv39h-EGFP products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in contrast to MSR, de novo silencing of intact LINE elements may require the synergistic activity of both Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The basic domain of Suv39h2 strengthens retention at mitotic heterochromatin</title><p>Heterochromatin is not transcriptionally inert and major satellite expression transiently increases at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Gilbert, 2007</xref>), with MSR transcripts accumulating at pericentric regions of condensing chromosomes at the G2 phase preceding mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Gilbert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, several key components of heterochromatin, such as SUV39H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 2000</xref>) and HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeRoy et al., 2009</xref>) are subject to post-translational modifications that impair mitotic chromatin association or are released by Aurora-dependent histone phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirota et al., 2005</xref>). To address whether the different Suv39h-EGFP products may have distinct functions at heterochromatin when cells enter mitosis, we used nocodazole synchronization to enrich ES cells at the G2/M phase (Materials and methods). The FACS profile indicates that 89.3% of cells are in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, below) with around 55% of the nocodazole-arrested cells displaying condensing or mitotic chromosomes (data not shown).</p><p>At condensing chromosomes and during pro-metaphase, full-length Suv39h1-EGFP exhibits a broad and diffuse chromosomal pattern (data not shown), but then is largely absent from mitotic chromosomes, although pericentric H3K9me3 persists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In striking contrast, Suv39h2-EGFP displays focal accumulation with the pericentric regions of mitotic chromosomes that is accompanied by higher levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant is still enriched at some, but not all, pericentric regions of mitotic chromosomes, it also displays a broader distribution along the chromosomal arms. Larger images of this high resolution microscopy confirm that the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant has partially lost the focal accumulation at pericentric heterochromatin of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>In nocodazole-synchronized <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn ES cells, MSR transcripts are similarly derepressed as compared to interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). While both full-length Suv39h1-EGFP and full-length Suv39h2-EGFP products silence MSR expression to levels even lower than those observed in wild type ES cells, the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant could only repress transcription to levels near to wild type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The H3K9me3 ChIP signal at the MSR was also modestly reduced in the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>We next wished to analyze chromatin association of the Suv39h-EGFP products with a biochemical assay that allows a better quantification. We prepared whole cell extracts from interphase and nocodazole-synchronized mouse ES cells and incubated them with 10U of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for increasing time points (Materials and methods). Recovered proteins from the soluble (S) and insoluble (P=pellet) fractions were isolated for further analysis by Western blotting. For this, we included wild type ES cells as a source to compare the endogenous Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 enzymes. Progressive solubilization from chromatin by MNase digestion was quantified by measuring the relative presence of the endogenous or of the Suv39h-EGFP products in the soluble (S) versus the insoluble (P) fraction. A low S/P ratio indicates chromatin retention whereas a high S/P ratio would reveal chromatin release.</p><p>In interphase cells, neither endogenous Suv39h1 or Suv39h2 nor full-length Suv39h1-EGFP or full-length Suv39h2-EGFP were significantly released into the supernatant, even after 10 min incubation with MNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant displayed a modestly increased chromatin release.</p><p>We then analyzed the MNase mediated chromatin release profile in nocodazole-arrested cells. In pronounced difference to interphase, endogenous Suv39h1 and Suv39h1-EGFP showed rapid solubilization already during the first 4 min of MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). By contrast, endogenous Suv39h2 and Suv39h2-EGFP largely remained chromatin associated, even after 10 min of MNase digestion. Noticeably, the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant was rapidly released into the soluble fraction, with more than 50% of the protein being recovered in the supernatant after 4–6 min of MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These results show that Suv39h2 and, to a much lesser degree Suv39h1, robustly interacts with mitotic chromatin and resists solubilization by MNase digestion. In addition, the data also indicate a role for the basic domain of Suv39h2 in stabilizing the association of the Suv39h2 enzyme with mitotic chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The basic domain of Suv39h2 confers preferred binding to single stranded MSR RNA</title><p>The basic domain of Suv39h2 harbors 22 basic residues, of which 19 are arginines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Such an approach has been used to demonstrate nucleosomal interaction of DNMT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>) and of other chromatin factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kfir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Postnikov et al., 2012</xref>). Purified mouse ES cell nuclei were subjected to partial digestion with 50U of MNase, which cuts linker DNA to generate nucleosomal fragments. The soluble nucleosomal fragments were then either untreated or digested with RNaseH or RNaseA before fractionation on a linear sucrose sedimentation gradient. DNA was extracted from individual fractions and separated on an agarose gel to visualize nucleosome-free (fractions 1–7) and mono- to poly-nucleosomes (fractions 8–17) fractions. In parallel, proteins were recovered, concentrated with affinity columns and processed for Western blotting.</p><p>For this nucleosome association analysis, we compared the Suv39h-EGFP products with endogenous Dnmt3a and HP1α. In RNase-untreated samples, all three Suv39h-EGFP products are primarily enriched in poly-nucleosomal fractions and not in the nucleosome-free fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, first panel). Suv39h2-EGFP and the Suv39h2(T3K81)-EGFP mutant display preference for association with higher-order nucleosomes (fractions 12–17), whereas Suv39h1-EGFP shows a broader fractionation profile that extends into mono-nucleosomes. In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>), Dnmt3a also accumulates with nucleosomes (fractions 11–15), but much less with the higher-order poly-nucleosomes. By contrast, HP1α sedimented in the nucleosome-free fractions and was only marginally distributed with nucleosomes.

The nucleosomal ladder could clearly be separated and Dnmt3a accumulates with poly-nucleosomes and HP1α is present in the nucleosome-free fractions. While full-length Suv39h2-EGFP still segregated into poly-nucleosomal fractions 12–15, the Suv39h2(T3K81)-EGFP mutant sedimented in fractions 10–14 and a portion of full-length Suv39h1-EGFP was now also found in nucleosome-free fractions. Although this represents only a slight sedimentation shift, the data can be interpreted to suggest that RNA:DNA hybrids contribute to the interaction of Suv39h enzymes to poly-nucleosomes. In addition, RNaseH treatment resulted in the buildup of the three Suv39h-EGFP constructs and of H3K9me3, but not of Dnmt3a and HP1α, in the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, second panel).</p><p>We then analyzed RNaseA-treated samples that had been digested under two distinct salt conditions. At 350 mM salt, RNaseA has an attenuated activity that will primarily degrade ssRNA, whereas at 100 mM salt RNaseA will remove ssRNA, dsRNA and the RNA strand of RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNaseA (350 mM salt) digestion of MNase solubilized chromatin resulted in partial dissolution of the nucleosomal ladder and the loss of higher-order nucleosomes in fractions 14–17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, third panel). While the sedimentation of Dnmt3a and HP1α remained largely unaltered, both full-length Suv39h1-EGFP and full-length Suv39h2-EGFP were significantly shifted towards mono- and di-nucleosomes and into the highest molecular weight fraction of the nucleosome-free material. Remarkably, RNaseA (350 mM salt) digestion specifically abrogated chromatin association of the Suv39h2(T3K81)-EGFP mutant, which could no longer be detected in the nucleosomal or nucleosome-free fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, third panel). These data provide evidence for a function of the basic domain of Suv39h2 in conferring ssRNA-mediated nucleosome association. The RNaseA (350 mM salt) digestion also induced accumulation of all three Suv39h-EGFP constructs, but not of Dnmt3a and HP1α, in the pellet. Finally, we examined RNaseA (100 mM salt) digestion of MNase solubilized chromatin. This low salt condition enhances the activity of RNaseA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and resulted in a nearly full collapse of the nucleosomal ladder where all but mono- or residual di-nucleosomes can be recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, fourth panel). Further, none of the Suv39h-EGFP products could be detected in the nucleosomal or the chromatin-free fractions and all accumulate in the pellet. HP1α was also significantly shifted to the nucleosome-free fractions 1–3 and became enriched in the pellet. Importantly, not all nucleosome association was lost upon RNaseA (100 mM salt) digestion, since Dnmt3a was still detected in the fractions containing residual amounts of di- to tri-nucleosomes and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, fourth panel).</p><p>We confirmed these results with a different approach and generated DNase1-solubilized nucleosomes that again revealed association of the Suv39h-EGFP constructs with higher-order nucleosomes and disruption of this interaction following incubation with RNaseA (100 mM salt), although parts of the nucleosomal ladder persist this RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data reveal that an RNA component, which appears to be physically bound to nucleosomes, is intrinsically involved in the organization of bulk chromatin. In addition, the data also indicate that an RNA-nucleosome scaffold is the physiological template for the stable association of Suv39h enzymes to chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MSR repeat RNA is chromatin associated</title><p>We next performed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with MSR- and LINE L1MdA 5'UTR- specific primers on nucleic acid material that was purified from MNase solubilized nucleosomal fractions. As above, nucleosomal fractions were separated on a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the associated nucleic acids were purified. These were then digested with TurboDNase and the remaining RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (RT). Reactions with and without RT confirm the detection of RNA sequences. This analysis identified progressive enrichment of MSR RNA in the nucleosome fractions but not in the nucleosome-free fractions and also revealed higher MSR signals with material from <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn ES cells as compared to wild-type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

To quantify the abundance of distinct RNA repeat classes in an unbiased manner, we performed Hiseq RNA sequencing of chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic RNA populations (Materials and methods). High-coverage, non-poly(A) selected cDNA libraries (&gt;80 million reads per sample) were analyzed for the presence of MSR, minor satellite, LINE L1MdA and SINE B1 transcripts. Although MSR reads are around 10–20 fold below the LINE L1MdA reads and significantly less than the more than 100 fold higher amount of SINE B1 reads, it is only the MSR transcripts that give rise to elevated reads in the chromatin-derived (1800 mean counts) as compared to the nucleoplasmic (450 mean counts) material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). LINE L1MdA and SINE B1 transcripts show similar mean counts in both chromatin-derived and nucleoplasmic cDNA libraries, whereas minor satellite repeat RNA is the least abundant in chromatin but enriched in the nucleoplasm. It is important to note that this analysis required cDNA libraries from non-poly(A) selected RNA, as both minor and major satellite transcripts largely lack a poly(A) signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MSR transcripts are RNaseH sensitive and form RNA:DNA hybrids</title><p>Hiseq RNA sequencing data with nuclear RNA preparations from mouse ES cells further show that major satellite repeats are expressed from both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that the MSR display multiple transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>).

While the chromo domain of SUV39H1 has been shown to bind to H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), the chromo domains of a number of proteins, for example MSL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhtar et al., 2000</xref>) and Chp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>) can also bind RNA in addition to their interaction with modified histones.</p><p>In our study, we identified the extended basic domain of Suv39h2 (aa 1–117) as a novel RNA interaction motif that binds with high affinity to single-stranded transcripts from the MSR RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Preliminary mutational analyses suggest that the first 50 amino acids (aa 1–50) of Suv39h2 confer a generic RNA interaction activity, whereas aa 50–117, which have a partial overlap with the very N-terminus of Suv39h1 including three conserved cysteines, determine selectivity of RNA binding (K. S.-R. and TJ, unpublished). The basic domain also protects Suv39h2 from RNaseA-mediated dissociation of native poly-nucleosomes under conditions where RNaseA primarily digests ssRNA, as the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant protein is much more sensitive to this RNaseA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, third panel). Another function of the basic domain is indicated by strengthening chromatin retention of Suv39h2 with mitotically enriched chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) and by ensuring focal accumulation of Suv39h2 with the pericentric regions of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Although these data indicate some possible roles of the basic domain to allow for robust heterochromatin accumulation of Suv39h2 during mitosis, we did not detect major defects in heterochromatin association or MSR silencing with the Suv39h2-D(T3K81)-EGFP mutant. Thus, while the basic domain donates an additional RNA affinity, other mechanisms act redundantly to stabilize Suv39h2 association to heterochromatin. Independent work by other groups shows RNA binding activity of the chromo domains of the related mouse Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shirai et al., 2017</xref>) and human SUV39H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>) enzymes.</p><p>Together, the cumulative data indicate that the association of the Suv39h KMT to native chromatin is governed by an RNA-mediated process. We suggest that non-coding MSR RNA will organize a higher-order RNA-nucleosome scaffold as the physiological template for the Suv39h enzymes (see below). The RNA dependence of association with poly-nucleosomes is much less pronounced for HP1α and not observed for Dnmt3a (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In fact, HP1α accumulates in the nucleosome-free fractions. Recent studies show that HP1γ, but not HP1α has a preference to interact with nucleosomal H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishima et al., 2015</xref>). Since MSR RNA decorated heterochromatin will provide multiple affinities, such as ssRNA and RNA:DNA hybrids (this study), H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamamoto and Sonoda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maison et al., 2011</xref>), additional chromatin factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maison et al., 2016</xref>) and histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2013</xref>), pericentric accumulation of the Suv39h KMT appears to be maintained by a variety of mechanistic interactions.</p><p>These multiple interactions may also explain that we could not observe dispersion of Suv39h1-EGFP or Suv39h2-EGFP from heterochromatic foci in interphase upon RNaseA incubation of permeabilized mouse ES cells, nor define conclusive in vivo interaction of Suv39h enzymes and MSR RNA (rather than MSR DNA) by using PAR-CLIP and RNA-IP. This difficulty may be further complicated by the inherent property of the MSR sequences to form RNA:DNA hybrids. In independent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2017</xref> describe dissociation of human SUV39H1 from the pericentric regions of mitotic chromosomes following RNaseA treatment. Human SUV39H1 has been shown to be subject to cell-cycle dependent phoshorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 2000</xref>). It is currently unresolved whether mitotic (phosphorylated) SUV39H1 is more sensitive to RNaseA treatment as compared to interphase SUV39H1, Suv39h1 or Suv39h2. Also, whether or not Suv39h2 undergoes cell cycle dependent modifications has not yet been analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An RNA-nucleosome scaffold as the underlying structure of mouse heterochromatin</title><p>Mouse pericentric heterochromatin has long been described to have an RNA component important for the localization of HP1α and for the accumulation of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maison et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2011</xref>). We show here that MSR transcripts largely remain chromatin-associated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) and can be detected in poly-nucleosomal fractions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, MSR transcripts are sensitive to RNaseH digestion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and have a secondary structure with extended stretches of unpaired RNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) that is compatible with the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids. The reiterated major satellite repeats are transcribed from both strands by RNA polymerase II and MSR-repeat RNA does not contain a 5'cap and largely lack a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal that heterochromatic MSR-repeat RNA is significantly distinct from a euchromatic messenger RNA that is processed from initiation at a transcriptional start site (TSS) of a dominant gene promoter, to elongation, correct splicing and poly(A)-mediated 3'end formation and then export to the cytoplasm.</p><p>RNA-FISH analyses have shown that a sizeable fraction of MSR transcripts remain associated with the pericentric regions of mouse chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Gilbert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>). Although we did not directly address the in vivo stability of MSR transcripts, we propose that these distinct molecular properties of the MSR RNA will induce the formation of a higher-order RNA-nucleosome scaffold that would represent the underlying structure of mouse heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). MSR repeat elements are full of embedded transcription factor binding sites and harbor several TSS that drive transcription of forward (purine-rich) and reverse (pyrimidine-rich) RNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>). Both MSR RNA strands can form RNA:DNA hybrids (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), most likely at the inter-nucleosomal regions. Other non-canonical nucleic acid structures, such as RNA:DNA:DNA triple helices are less likely, although RNA:DNA:DNA triple helices may participate in the regulation of LINE 1 transcription in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>) and in the recruitment of DNMT3b to rDNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmitz et al., 2010</xref>). An RNA:RNA:RNA triple helix has been shown to stabilize the 3'end of lncRNA that lack a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilusz et al., 2012</xref>). While we have no evidence for direct interaction of Suv39h enzymes or of the basic domain of Suv39h2 with MSR RNA:DNA hybrids or with dsRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), several zinc finger transcription factors have been described to interact with RNA:DNA hybrids with affinities comparable or greater than binding to dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi and Berg, 1995</xref>). The major function of the intrinsic property of the MSR RNA to engage in RNA:DNA hybrid formation may thus reside in the organization of a distinct higher-order nucleosomal structure at pericentric heterochromatin and would be consistent with a proposed role for DNA:RNA hybrids to help directing RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakama et al., 2012</xref>). Additional single-stranded portions of MSR RNA that are not occupied by RNA:DNA hybrid formation will further enforce this higher-order RNA-nucleosome scaffold and provide ssRNA affinity for the basic domain of Suv39h2 or other RNA-binding chromatin factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Heterochromatin is molecularly defined by the abundance of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me), to which several H3K9me-binding proteins bind, recruiting silencing activities. The Suv39 family of lysine methyltransferases (KMT) catalyze H3K9 methylation in eukaryotes. How Suv39h proteins are recruited to heterochromatin has been the subject of several studies in plants, the fission yeast. and germ cells of flies, worms and mammals. These studies have shown that small and long nuclear noncoding RNAs cooperate to recruit the Suv39 family proteins to repetitive DNA elements, but whether and how nuclear RNAs also play a role in the recruitment of Suv39 proteins in mammalian somatic cells remains unknown. The paper by Camacho et al. addresses this question in mice, demonstrating that the mouse Suv39h2 N-terminal region possesses an RNA binding domain, which can bind to single-stranded long heterochromatic transcripts (such as major satellite repeat (MSR) and TERRA) with high affinity in vitro. They also show that MSR RNAs are tethered to chromatin and that these chromatin-associated RNAs are required for the stable association of Suv39 KMTs to polynucleosomes. These experiments are generally well-controlled and redundantly support each other, and the data are of excellent quality. Unfortunately, these data indicate no functional role for the N-terminal RNA binding domain of Suv39h2 in vivo. However, there is a concern that potential overexpression of the reintroduced Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 may have obliterated the ability to observe a functional requirement for both Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 or to see the functional requirement for the N-terminus of Suv39h2 in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How do the expression levels of the reintroduced GFP tagged Suv39h1 and h2 proteins compare to endogenous levels, given that they have more robust silencing and more H3 K9 methylation of major satellites in NZ arrested cells than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)? It would seem likely that the levels may be a lot higher than endogenous levels given that they lead to a much greater silencing of transcription, while the basic domain deletion was reduced to wild type levels. Western blotting with an antibody against Suv39h1 and 2 needs to be included on these westerns. If the levels of the ectopic proteins are a lot higher than endogenous levels, the results need to be discussed and considered in light of this. It would be very unfortunate, because this could explain why either Suv39h1 (which lacks the exon including the N-terminal RNA binding domain) or Suv39h2 can complement the Suv39h1/2 double null mouse cells. This would also explain the ability of Suv39h2 with the N-terminal mutants to restore silencing and methylation. It would have been much better to generate constructs that express normal levels of these two proteins, because their data at present show no functional role for Suv39h1 nor its N-terminal domain in vivo.</p><p>2) With regards to 1, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref> show that Suv39h2 N term is not required for repression of MSR RNAs or for full levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). In these experiments, the authors introduce wild type or mutant Suv39h2 D(T3K81)-EGFP, into Suv39h1/h2 double knockout cells. So, the result cannot be explained by possible redundancy in RNA binding activity between Suv39h1 and h2. What then is the physiological significance of the described RNA binding activity and its contribution to stable retention of Suv39h2 at heterochromatin?</p><p>3) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> nicely use a biochemical assay to show that Suv39h1 and h2 associate with polynucleosomes in an RNase-sensitive manner. One concern here is that the Suv39h2 N term mutant shows association with poly-nucleosomes that is similar to the WT protein. This complicates the conclusion of the assay regarding the role of the N term in RNA binding, since association is not affected by deletion of the domain that mediates RNA binding. The authors do see higher sensitivity of the N term mutant to RNase treatment at 350 mM salt and interpret this to mean a role for the N term in ssRNA binding (which is digested by RNase A even at 350 mM salt). This doesn't make sense, unless we are missing something. The result could also be interpreted to mean that the N term is involved in chromatin association independently of RNA. The mutant may be more sensitive to RNase digestion because another domain mediates the RNA-sensitive interaction. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>4) How does Suv39h1 achieve repression of major satellites in NZ arrested cells without it binding to mitotic chromosomes? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>5) It will be important for them to show that RNaseH /A treatment of cells leads to loss of Suv39h1 and 2 from heterochromatin by immunofluorescence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25293.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The compaction of repetitive DNA elements into heterochromatin is critical for genome stability in eukaryotes.

We have now clearly explained this in a new paragraph of the Discussion (subsection “MSR RNA govern stable association of Suv39h enzymes with chromatin”, second paragraph). In addition, although the analysis on the basic domain of Suv39h2 is a significant part of the study, another major part of our work provides detailed and novel insight into the chemical properties and biochemical functions of the MSR non-coding RNA that, we feel, is another important advance.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) How do the expression levels of the reintroduced GFP tagged Suv39h1 and h2 proteins compare to endogenous levels, given that they have more robust silencing and more H3 K9 methylation of major satellites in NZ arrested cells than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)?

We clearly state that several modules in the Suv39h proteins contribute to RNA interaction and also cite the independent work by the laboratories of Yoichi Shinkai and Aaron Straight that shows RNA binding by the chromo domain of mouse Suv39h1 and of human SUV39H1. In our work, we have focused on the definition of the basic domain of Suv39h2 as a novel RNA interaction motif that donates an additional RNA affinity to Suv39h2.</p><p><italic>4) How does Suv39h1 achieve repression of major satellites in NZ arrested cells without it binding to mitotic chromosomes?

We have revisited this and repeated RNaseA and RNaseH treatments under various salt and pH buffer conditions, but again have not seen dispersion from heterochromatic foci in interphase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> documents these experiments. We have not done these experiments with mitotic chromosomes. We do know from informal exchange with Aaron Straight (independent manuscript) that human SUV39H1 is dispersed from mitotic chromosomes upon RNaseA treatment. As there is cell-cycle regulated phosphorylation of SUV39H1 (Aagard et al. 2000), mitotic (and phosphorylated) SUV39H1 may be more sensitive to RNaseA treatment as compared to interphase Suv39h1 or Suv39h2. We have clarified this in the Discussion (subsection “MSR RNA govern stable association of Suv39h enzymes with chromatin”, last paragraph).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25293.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25293.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25293.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25293-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
