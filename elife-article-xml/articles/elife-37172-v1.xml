bacteria requires a moderated immune response to control bacterial population size without eliciting excessive inflammation that could harm both partners. Little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms utilized by bacterial mutualists to temper their hosts’ responses and protect themselves from aggressive immune attack. Using a gnotobiotic larval zebrafish model, we identified an <italic>Aeromonas</italic> secreted immunomodulatory protein, AimA. AimA is required during colonization to prevent intestinal inflammation that simultaneously compromises both bacterial and host survival. Administration of exogenous AimA prevents excessive intestinal neutrophil accumulation and protects against septic shock in models of both bacterially and chemically induced intestinal inflammation. We determined the molecular structure of AimA, which revealed two related calycin-like domains with structural similarity to the mammalian immune modulatory protein, lipocalin-2. As a secreted bacterial protein required by both partners for optimal fitness, AimA is an exemplar bacterial mutualism factor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37172.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, including humans, harbor vast numbers of bacteria inside our digestive tracts. But rather than wage constant war, we have learned to coexist peacefully, and many of these bacteria are important to keep us healthy. Our immune system controls the number of bacteria, but in some diseases, this balance fails, and immune cells called neutrophils start a defense response. However, such attacks also cause inflammation in our guts, which can damage the tissues and organs.</p><p>Understanding the delicate balance between immune cells and individual bacteria in humans remains a challenge. Our gut bacteria live in complex communities with many species of microorganisms. Using animals like zebrafish can help to find out if gut bacteria are able to prevent such inflammation. These fish can grow under sterile conditions in the laboratory, allowing the study of added individual bacteria and the molecules they release. They are also transparent, making it easy to capture images of their organs under the microscope. In the wild, they live side-by-side with a type of bacteria called <italic>Aeromonas</italic>.</p><p>Here, Rolig et al. added <italic>Aeromonas</italic> bacteria to sterile zebrafish and observed how they interacted with the fish immune system. This revealed that the bacteria produce a protein to pacify immune cells, named 'Aeromonas immune modulator' (AimA). The sequence of this new protein did not look like any known molecules, but its 3D structure resembled a protein found in animals called lipocalin. AimA dampened inflammation in the gut.</p><p>When <italic>Aeromonas</italic> without AimA colonized the zebrafish, their neutrophils went to war. Their guts became inflamed and the bacteria started to die. But when the zebrafish had no neutrophils in their gut, nothing could stop the AimA-deficient bacteria and they grew too much. They produced toxic products, triggering septic shock and killing the fish. Adding AimA back into the fish stopped the inflammation and prevented septic shock, restoring balance. Both partners need AimA to survive. The bacteria need it to shield them from the immune response and the fish need it for protection against toxic products made by the bacteria.</p><p>Understanding proteins like AimA could help us to control bacteria and gut inflammation. Further work could reveal ways to use similar molecules to treat inflammation or to boost the growth of friendly bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>lipocalin</kwd><kwd>Aeromonas</kwd><kwd>mutualism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM098911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guillemin</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DK098884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolig</surname><given-names>Annah S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01HD22486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guillemin</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These microbial communities are not only tolerated by their hosts, but are also required for normal host development and physiology, highlighting the intimacy of these mutualisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>). How these host-microbe mutualisms are established and maintained is unresolved. Understanding these processes will require identifying the molecular mechanisms by which resident microbes modulate the host immune system and defining the benefit these microbes derive from investing in such interactions. This knowledge is critical to dissect the microbial etiology of a range of diseases associated with excessive inflammation, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttenhower et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wen et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, a thorough understanding of these host-microbe mutualisms will accelerate the development of effective treatments for these inflammatory diseases. Here, we explore the host-bacterial mutualism between zebrafish and their prominent colonizer, <italic>Aeromonas,</italic> and identify a secreted bacterial protein that promotes both bacterial colonization and host survival by preventing excessive inflammation.</p><p>Pathogenic bacterial species are often defined by unique virulence factors that enable host colonization and determine the severity of host disease symptoms. Much less well known are the unique factors produced by anti-inflammatory bacterial species, which likely play a key role in establishing host-bacterial mutualism and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. One such factor is the zwitterionic polysaccharide, PSA, produced by the human symbiont <italic>Bacteroidetes fragilis,</italic> that induces a toleragenic T cell profile and protects against intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazmanian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mazmanian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Round and Mazmanian, 2010</xref>). The anti-inflammatory properties of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> have been attributed to secreted proteins p75 and p40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> secretes an anti-inflammatory 15 kDa protein called microbial anti-inflammatory molecule or MAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quévrain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sokol et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martín et al., 2014</xref>). These secreted proteins reduce inflammation in mouse models of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2011</xref>), which suggests their therapeutic potential, but we do not yet understand how these proteins aid the bacteria that produce them. Investigating the bacterial fitness benefits for producing anti-inflammatory activities is critical for developing approaches to promote membership of these immunoregulatory bacterial species in chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD and to use bacterial immune modulators as therapeutics to shape microbiota composition.</p><p>The investigation of microbiota-derived immunomodulatory factors is challenging because their effects on the host are subtler then those of disease-causing toxins and they are produced by complex and genetically intractable microbial consortia. We used the zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio,</italic> as a high-throughput, gnotobiotic model vertebrate system to identify individual bacterial products with immunomodulatory properties and understand how those products promote host-bacterial mutualism. Zebrafish have long been used as a vertebrate model for developmental biology because of their optical transparency, high fecundity, and rapid early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grunwald and Eisen, 2002</xref>). Zebrafish embryos develop ex-utero within their protective chorions and first encounter environmental microbes when they hatch as larvae between 2 and 3 days post fertilization (dpf). By 5 dpf the animals have a fully functional digestive tract that is colonized with bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallace et al., 2005</xref>). The larvae are also equipped with a functional innate immune system with highly dynamic neutrophils and macrophages that serve as the primary cellular defenses before the emergence of adaptive immune cells at approximately 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renshaw and Trede, 2012</xref>). The zebrafish is an excellent model for studying the establishment of host-bacterial symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns and Guillemin, 2017</xref>) because hundreds of zebrafish can be easily derived and maintained in a gnotobiotic state with defined microbial isolates during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melancon et al., 2017</xref>). The large population sizes of animals allow for the analysis of the subtle effects of resident microbes on host phenotypes. For example, we have shown that intestinal neutrophil populations in larval zebrafish range from an average of 3 cells in germ free (GF) animals to 7 cells in conventionally reared (CV) animals, a difference that can be readily detected in well-powered experiments despite extensive inter-host variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>). Our use of gnotobiology to assay the effect of individual microbes and their products on the host has been aided by the fact that many zebrafish bacterial isolates are culturable, have known genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>), and are genetically tractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiles et al., 2016</xref>). This gnotobiotic approach, however, fails to capture the complexity of naturally occurring vertebrate microbiota. Additionally, in the zebrafish we are largely limited to using gnotobiology to study the larval period because we have yet to develop adequate nutritional and husbandry approaches to promote the growth of GF zebrafish to adulthood.</p><p>In this study we focused on the mutualism established between larval zebrafish and their resident <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species. <italic>Aeromonas</italic> is an important symbiont of the zebrafish and the sole bacterial genus that we found present in 100% of individuals at all developmental time points in a comprehensive longitudinal study of zebrafish gut microbiomes across their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that in mono-associations, representatives of the <italic>Aeromonas</italic> genus can fully rescue defects in glycan expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2006</xref>), epithelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheesman et al., 2011</xref>), innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>), and pancreatic beta cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2016</xref>) that are characteristic phenotypes of GF fish. We have examined the dynamics of the <italic>Aeromonas</italic>-zebrafish mutualism, taking advantage of the optical transparency of the larvae to monitor both bacterial and host cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taormina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jemielita et al., 2014</xref>). Here we specifically quantified the innate immune response against <italic>Aeromonas</italic> bacterial genetic variants, using GFP-expressing intestinal neutrophils as a metric of the host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renshaw et al., 2006</xref>). Neutrophils are a primary component of the initial inflammatory response and are responsive to both infecting pathogens and resident intestinal microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harvie and Huttenlocher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanther et al., 2014</xref>). This responsiveness makes the intestinal neutrophil population an ideal readout of the host-microbe mutualism between zebrafish and <italic>Aeromonas</italic>.</p><p>Using the gnotobiotic zebrafish model, we identified a potent immune modulatory protein secreted by <italic>Aeromonas,</italic> which we named Aeromonas immune modulator A (AimA) because it reduces intestinal inflammation. To understand the molecular mechanism of AimA’s function, we determined the protein crystal structure, which revealed two related calycin-like domains that are structurally similar to the immune modulatory factor found in mammals, lipocalin-2 (LCN2). Consistent with AimA targeting the host immune response, as opposed to counteracting a specific bacterial product, we showed that purified AimA, and each of its subdomains, prevents chemically induced intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, we found that this activity is blocked by exogenous mouse LCN2 (mLCN2), implying a shared mechanism of action between these structurally similar bacterial and mammalian proteins. However, AimA does not appear to function like LCN2 as a binding protein for bacterial siderophores. To understand AimA’s function for <italic>Aeromonas</italic>, we generated mutants lacking <italic>aimA</italic> and its homologue <italic>aimB</italic>. In mono-associations with <italic>aim</italic> mutants, we found that both the host and bacterial partners suffered reduced viability, which could be rescued with exogenous AimA protein. We showed that the fitness cost to the bacteria was due to excessive inflammation because the <italic>aim</italic> mutant survival deficit was erased in an immunocompromised host. In parallel, we showed AimA’s benefit to the host extended to protection from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intoxication. Together, these data provide an exemplar of a bacteria immune modulatory factor that is beneficial for both partners in a bacterial mutualism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aeromonas secretes a protein that modulates the intestinal neutrophil response</title><p>Based on the mutualism between <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stephens et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>Aeromonas</italic> would use specific secreted factors to co-exist with its host. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the zebrafish intestinal neutrophil response to mono-association with an <italic>Aeromonas</italic> isolate, <italic>A. veronii</italic> strain Hm21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maltz and Graf, 2011</xref>), versus mono-association with an isogenic mutant lacking the type two secretion system (T2SS)(ΔT2)(<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), a major system for secretion in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maltz and Graf, 2011</xref>). We colonized each bacterial strain in zebrafish from 4 dpf to 6 dpf and measured the number of intestinal neutrophils that accumulated in response to each colonizing bacterial strain. In these experiments we compared the ΔT2 strain to a genetically complemented strain, ΔT2C, previously shown to restore T2SS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maltz and Graf, 2011</xref>), which allowed us to rule out the possibility that phenotypes associated with the ΔT2 strain were due to polar or second site mutations. The ΔT2C and ΔT2 colonized the zebrafish intestine to similar levels in mono-associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), however the ΔT2 mutant induced a greater intestinal neutrophil response than the ΔT2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>A. veronii</italic> strain Hm21 secretes a product that decreases the neutrophil response to its colonization. The increased neutrophil response to ΔT2 was rescued by concurrent treatment with cell-free supernatant (CFS) collected from the ΔT2C strain, but not CFS collected from ΔT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify the factor produced by ΔT2C and not from the ΔT2 strain that resulted in fewer intestinal neutrophils, we performed mass-spectrophotometry on the CFS from these two strains and determined which proteins were enriched in the ΔT2C compared to the ΔT2 strain. This analysis resulted in a list of 22 proteins that were enriched by greater than 10 counts in the ΔT2C CFS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental file 1</xref>). We narrowed down the potential candidates further by performing ammonium sulfate fractionation on the ΔT2C CFS and adding fractions to fish mono-associated with ΔT2. We found neutrophil modulating activity primarily in the 40–60% salt fraction, but also saw some activity in the 20–40% salt fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An SDS PAGE gel of these fractions revealed a similar banding pattern for each fraction, except the bands in the 20–40% fraction were considerably weaker. We observed two prominent bands at 33 kDa and 55 kDa. These sizes corresponded to two proteins on our list of proteins enriched in the ΔT2C CFS, an uncharacterized protein (UP) and a chitin binding protein (CBP), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental file 1</xref>). To test whether either of these proteins modulated the neutrophil response to ΔT2 colonization, we cloned the sequence for each gene into an overexpression vector and induced expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, resulting in <italic>E. coli</italic> CFS that was heavily dominated by the protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We treated zebrafish mono-associated with ΔT2 with the CFS resulting from overexpression of each protein of interest and found neutrophil modulating activity in the <italic>E. coli</italic> CFS with the 33 kDa UP and not with CBP or control CFS from <italic>E. coli</italic> containing an empty expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Lipocalins are defined by three key structurally conserved regions, SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3; of these, SCR1 contains four key residues and is the most conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flower, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lakshmi et al., 2015</xref>). The SCR1 in the C-term domain of AimA overlaps structurally with the SCR1 of mouse lipocalin-2 (mLCN2) and shares some related amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given this structural similarity, we hypothesized that AimA may function in the same pathways as mLCN2. Thus, we asked whether the presence of mLCN2 protein would alter the capacity of AimA to reduce the neutrophil response to soysaponin. We found that the addition of mLCN2 concurrently with soysaponin did not influence the neutrophil response to soysaponin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); however, addition of mLCN2 in conjunction with AimA blocked the protective effect of AimA against soysaponin-induced inflammation. This result suggests that mLCN2 may interfere with AimA’s activity by direct binding, competing for the same host receptor, or acting in a competing pathway.</p><p>LCN2’s immunomodulatory activity is mediated, at least in part, by binding iron-sequestering siderophores, including enterobactin from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), thus we explored whether AimA had a similar enterobactin-binding activity. The original evidence for LCN2’s enterobactin binding came from the protein crystal structure of human LCN2, in which enterobactin was co-crystalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goetz et al., 2002</xref>). We did not find enterobactin in the AimA structure, which was expected because the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, BL21 DE3, which we used to express AimA, does not produce enterobactin. However, in comparison to the wide enterobactin-binding cleft (calyx) of LCN2, the homologous regions of the N- and C-term domains of AimA are much narrower, are occluded by loops or a helix, and lack the enterobactin-interacting residues of LCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). To test whether AimA binds enterobactin, we grew <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain (MG1655) under iron limiting conditions that make it dependent on the siderophore function of its secreted enterobactin, which can be sequestered by exogenously added LCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goetz et al., 2002</xref>). As predicted, when we grew <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 in the presence of the iron chelator dipyridyl to limit available iron, we observed a dose dependent inhibition of <italic>E. coli</italic> growth upon addition of purified mouse LCN2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In contrast, when we added the same range of concentrations of purified AimA protein to the <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, we saw no growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that AimA does not bind and sequester enterobactin in a similar manner to LCN2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Each individual domain of AimA retains neutrophil regulating capacity</title><p>Human LCN2 exists both as a monomer and a homodimer, and while the functional distinction between the two forms is unknown, the homodimer is the major molecular form secreted by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2010</xref>). Both the C- and N-terminal domains of AimA have structural homology to proteins in the calycin superfamily. Although they share only 17% amino acid identity, a structural overlay between the two domains reveals some structural conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because human LCN2 exists as both a monomer and homodimer and the two domains of AimA each have a lipocalin-like fold, we asked if each domain alone was sufficient to alter the intestinal neutrophil response. The individual domains were not as soluble as full-length AimA, but we were able to crudely purify each domain. Concurrently with soysaponin, we added approximately 100 ng/mL of the domain of interest to zebrafish from 4 to 6 dpf. We found that both the N- and C-term domains alone were sufficient to reduce the neutrophil response in the soysaponin model of intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). An in depth analysis of the structural overlay between the N- and C-term domains revealed that seven out of eight β-strands in the barrels align well; however, only seven total residues are in analogous functional positions across the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these seven residues, two—Val 60/201 and Thr 117/265—stand out as possible candidates to interact with a hydrophobic ligand that could bind inside the barrel cavity. The other five residues may overlap by coincidence or they may be positioned to interact with a promiscuous protein or ligand partner. Furthermore, given the overall structural similarity between the N- and C-term domains, it is possible that critical residues are in a flexible loop region that could become structured upon binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, both AimA domains have comparable structural similarity with mLCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While the mLCN2 binding cleft for enterobactin is not conserved in the domains of AimA, the majority of the β-strands in the barrels overlap in all three domains, which suggests these domains could interact with the same binding partner(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37172.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Both domains of AimA retain neutrophil modulating function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of C-term and N-term domains of AimA using PDBeFold.

By 72 hr post-inoculation, the survival rate of zebrafish colonized with wild-type Aer was 92% (n = 163). We observed a significant decline in the survival of fish mono-associated with <italic>Aeromonas</italic> lacking Aim genes [Aer Δ<italic>aimA</italic> (n = 139), Aer Δ<italic>aimB</italic> (n = 174), and Aer Δ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> (n = 148)], with survival rates of 64%, 73%, and 55%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Remarkably, this decreased survival rate was rescued back to 90% by the presence of purified AimA protein (n = 60; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the Aim proteins act to promote both bacterial colonization and host survival, identifying AimA as a key mediator of host-bacterial mutualism.</p><p>To test whether AimA benefits both the bacteria and the host by controlling the neutrophil response to bacterial colonization, we evaluated the importance of Aim proteins in a colonization model lacking intestinal neutrophils. We reasoned that in the absence of intestinal inflammation, bacteria possessing or lacking Aim proteins would have a similar capacity to survive in the intestine. For these experiments, we used <italic>myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant fish lacking the adaptor protein for inducing many toll-like receptor and IL-1 dependent pro-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larsson et al., 2012</xref>); these fish have a severely attenuated intestinal neutrophil response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) that is indistinguishable from GF wild-type zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as we have reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2017</xref>). We found that both Aer Δ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> and wild-type Aer colonized <italic>myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish to equivalent levels, which were significantly higher than in wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that the decreased colonization of Aer Δ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> compared to wild-type <italic>Aeromonas</italic> in wild-type fish is due to the increased inflammatory response to the mutant bacteria, and moreover suggest that the hosts’ innate immune response contributes to limiting bacterial colonization.

Notably, the <italic>myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish mono-associated with either wild-type or Aer Δ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> perished at higher rates than wild type fish, indicating that there is a host fitness cost to failing to control <italic>Aeromonas</italic> levels.</p><p>Given the increase in bacterial colonization and fish death in the <italic>myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish, regardless of the colonizing strain, we hypothesized that these fish may be dying of septic shock as a result of bacterial overgrowth.

To test this, we treated fish with 100 ng/mL AimA on 4 dpf and then challenged them with 600 μg/mL LPS on 5 dpf and tracked their survival over the subsequent 60 hr. The median survival time post LPS treatment was 32 hr, which we found was extended to 47 hr in the presence of AimA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Using the same treatment paradigm, we found that purified AimB also extended the median survival of LPS-exposed zebrafish to 47 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, treatment with mLCN2 had no effect on zebrafish survival (median survival 34 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, AimA and AimB, but not mLCN2, significantly extend the survival of zebrafish in an LPS intoxication model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A universal feature of animals is their co-existence with resident microbial communities.</title><p>Appropriate modulation of host immune responses to resident microbes is critical for maintaining health, with too muted a response leaving hosts susceptible to microbial overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dukowicz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolig et al., 2017</xref>) and too aggressive a response wreaking havoc on both host tissue and resident microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttenhower et al., 2014</xref>). Fitness effects of host-bacterial interactions are often considered from the host perspective, yet it is essential to examine both sides of these partnerships to understand how these interactions evolve and persist. Here we describe the discovery of AimA, a bacterial immunomodulatory protein secreted by <italic>Aeromonas</italic> that is required during bacterial colonization of larval zebrafish to prevent an intestinal inflammatory response that is detrimental to both partners. We determined the molecular structure of AimA and show that it consists of two structurally similar lipocalin-like domains, each of which acts to suppress intestinal inflammation. We demonstrate that purified AimA protein is protective against host intestinal inflammation and LPS intoxication and simultaneously rescues <italic>Aeromonas</italic> growth in the context of inflammation. When the inflammatory response is attenuated in <italic>myd88</italic> deficient hosts, then the bacterial colonization advantage associated with AimA production is eliminated, indicating that it is AimA’s anti-inflammatory activity that benefits <italic>Aeromonas</italic>.</p><p>All resident bacteria produce microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are inherently pro-inflammatory, as we have shown in zebrafish larvae for LPS, which elicits intestinal neutrophil influx, proinflammatory cytokine gene expression, and endotoxemia in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2007</xref>). However, our analysis of dose response curves to resident bacteria revealed that few zebrafish microbiota members elicit dose-dependent inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolig et al., 2017</xref>). We did identify a few examples of bacteria with potent and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on intestinal neutrophil influx. These dose-dependent inhibitory effects were exploited to identify an immunoregulatory <italic>Shewanella</italic> strain that produces a secreted, heat-labile, anti-inflammatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>) and an <italic>Escherichia</italic> strain that reduces intestinal inflammation through a secretion-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolig et al., 2017</xref>). However, the majority of zebrafish gut bacteria we surveyed, including <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species, showed no correlation between their bacterial load and the number of neutrophils they elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolig et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that most gut bacteria posses both pro-inflammatory products, like LPS, along with neutralizing mechanisms to counteract the effects on their hosts. AimA, which decreases intestinal neutrophil influx and septic shock elicited by both <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and LPS, represents such a neutralizing activity. Future studies will determine whether AimA acts primarily by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit neutrophils to the intestine or by inhibiting the responsiveness of neutrophils to such cues.</p><p>Sequence-based searches for AimA-related proteins recovered only other <italic>Aeromonas</italic> homologues, including the highly divergent but functionally redundant AimB. Structural determination of AimA, however, revealed two linked domains of the lipocalin superfamily. Lipocalin domains are found across the tree of life, with bacterial lipocalin fold-containing proteins being only more recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop, 2000</xref>). In eukaryotes, proteins with lipocalin folds commonly bind small hydrophobic molecules such as odorant molecules, retinol, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flower, 1996</xref>), but proteins with a lipocalin fold, especially those found in prokaryotes, can also take on a variety of other functions, such as inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares and Pathak, 2017</xref>), binding extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker et al., 2016</xref>), and binding hydrophobic antibiotics and antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El-Halfawy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sisinni et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We were particularly intrigued by AimA’s structural similarity to mammalian LCN2, a known regulator of intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moschen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). LCN2 was originally identified and purified from neutrophil granules and shown to play a critical role in neutrophil extravasation and migration—processes that AimA may also modulate. LCN2 was subsequently shown to be a sensitive fecal biomarker of intestinal inflammation in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chassaing et al., 2012</xref>). Inflammation-associated induction of LCN2 appears to be protective against pathology because <italic>Lcn2</italic> deficient mice are sensitized to developing colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toyonaga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moschen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Further, <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> engineered to overexpress mLCN2 confers greater protection against colitis than a control strain of <italic>L. lactis</italic> in a mouse model of acute colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saha et al., 2017</xref>). While it is clear that LCN2 protects against inflammation, the mechanisms by which it does so are not well understood. One possibility is that mLCN2’s capacity to sequester bacterial enterobactin-like siderophores may cause beneficial shifts in intestinal microbiota composition and reduce the toxic effects of iron in the inflamed environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moschen et al., 2016</xref>). Our data, however, suggest that AimA confers protection against inflammation by a distinct mechanism, because we found no evidence that AimA binds enterobactin or contributes to <italic>Aeromonas</italic> survival in iron limiting conditions. To test for a possible overlap between LCN2 and AimA function, we asked whether addition of mLCN2 to a model of soysaponin-induced intestinal inflammation would alter AimA’s efficacy. Indeed, the presence of mLCN2 inhibited the ability of AimA to reduce the neutrophil response. This result may indicate that the two proteins compete by acting on the same pathway governing neutrophil behavior. For example, AimA and mLCN2 may compete directly for binding to the same host receptor. LCN2 binds at least two known mammalian receptors, megalin and LCN2R, which have homologues in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), although the binding to these receptors has not been directly connected to the influence of LCN2 on neutrophil behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moschen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabedo Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). Another possibility is that mLCN2 interferes with AimA’s activity by binding directly to AimA. mLCN2 is known to exist both as monomers and as dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelsson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perduca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niemi et al., 2015</xref>), and while little is known about the conditions under which each form is active, the dimeric form is associated with neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2010</xref>). In AimA, the two lipocalin-like domains are tethered, but we found that each structural half can function independently to inhibit inflammation. Future biochemical studies will determine whether either of AimA’s lipocalin domains can homodimerize or bind to other lipocalin proteins and which oligomeric states of AimA confer its immune modulatory function.</p><p>Our analysis of <italic>aimA</italic> and <italic>aimB</italic> deficient <italic>Aeromonas</italic> revealed that the proteins’ anti-inflammatory activity on the host is inextricable from the fitness advantage it confers to the bacteria. In this regard, AimA represents a new class of bacterial effector proteins, which we refer to as mutualism factors. Whereas virulence factors promote the fitness of pathogens to the detriment of their hosts and are revealed by the decreased fitness of the pathogen mutants coupled to the increased fitness of the host, a mutualism factor like AimA confers mutual benefits, and both partners suffer when it is removed from the host-microbe symbiosis. Another example of a mutualism factor is the zwitterionic polysaccharide PSA produced by <italic>Bacteroidetes fragilis</italic>, which colonizes the murine colon. PSA induces T regulatory cells (T regs), which benefit its murine host by preventing excessive inflammation. The T regs in turn contribute to <italic>B. fragilis</italic> colonization, as demonstrated by the fact that in the absence of T regs, due either to genetic ablation or absence of PSA-induction, <italic>B. fragilis</italic> suffers a colonization defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Round et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given the constraints of bacterial-host coexistence in the vertebrate intestine, we speculate that intestinal microbiota are rich sources of novel anti-inflammatory factors that enable resident microbes to colonize this tissue at high density without eliciting excessive inflammation. Such anti-inflammatory factors offer promise for useful therapeutic applications, and the high throughput gnotobiotic larval zebrafish system provides an experimentally tractable platform for their discovery. These factors, however, may represent novel biological molecules that defy easy functional classification based purely on their gene sequences or the gene sequences of their biosynthetic machinery, thus additional approaches, such as protein structure determination, will be needed to further advance our understanding of their mechanisms of action. In the case of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> AimA, the crystal structure revealed it to belong to a large family of lipocalin proteins, which includes the mammalian immunomodulatory protein LCN2. Our discovery of AimA raises the possibility that AimA and LCN2 have overlapping functions as mutualism factors in the vertebrate intestine even though they are provisioned by different members of the partnership. Given the diversity of the microbial communities that are part of the complex host-microbe ecosystem, AimA is likely only the first of many unique bacterial proteins that facilitate mutualistic interactions critical for both host and resident microbes to thrive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 DE3</td><td valign="bottom">New England Biolabs</td><td>C2527</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">K12 strain (MG1655)</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1128/JB.188.3.928–933.2006</td><td/><td>Dr. Matthew Mulvey, <break/>Univ. of Utah</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic>)</td><td>HM21S; Aer; <break/>Aeromonas Hm21; Hm21</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1128/AEM.01621–10</td><td/><td>Parent strain, SmR</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>HE-1095; Aer DT2</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1128/AEM.01621–10</td><td/><td>Hm21S::interrupted <break/>exeM mTn5 <break/>KmR SmR</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>HEC-1344; Aer DT2C</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1128/AEM.01621–10</td><td/><td>HE-1095::Tn7 <break/>containing TpR <break/>exeMN + promoter <break/>region</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>ASRC7; Aer D<italic>aimA</italic></td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Hm21S aimA::cmR</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>ASRD5; Aer D<italic>aimB</italic></td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Hm21S D<italic>aimB</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>ASRD4; <break/>Aer D<italic>A</italic>D<italic>B</italic></td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Hm21S <italic>aimA::cm<sup>R</sup>;</italic> <break/>D<italic>aimB</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>ZOR0001; <break/>ZF Aer</td><td valign="bottom">doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.140</td><td/><td>Zebrafish <italic>Aeromonas</italic> <break/>isolate</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>A. veronii</italic>)</td><td>ZOR0001; <break/>ZF Aer D<italic>aimA</italic></td><td>this study</td><td/><td>ZOR0001 <italic>aimA::cmR</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>AB x Tu strain; <break/>wild type zebrafish</td><td>UO Zebrafish facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>myd88</italic>-/-</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 28973938</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (Danio rerio)</td><td valign="bottom">Tg(BACmpx:GFP) <break/>i114; mpx:GFP</td><td>doi:10.1182/blood <break/>-2006-05-024075</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pET21B</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">LPS, <italic>E.

From previously published data on intestinal neutrophil quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>) and zebrafish gut bacterial mono-association colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2016</xref>) we estimated a effect size of 0.24 for neutrophil influx and 0.35 for bacterial colonization. These parameters suggested using an n of 40 and 23 in order to detect significant changes between treatment groups for either neutrophil influx or bacterial colonization, respectively. Each experiment described herein contains about 10–15 biological replicates (individual fish per treatment group). These experiments of 10–15 fish were repeated multiple times (technical replicates), resulting in pooled data sets ranging from 20 to 70 biological replicates. Grubbs statistical outlier test was applied to the data and data points that met the criteria for a statistical outlier were removed. In the figures, these data are presented as box and whisker plots, which display the data median (line within the box), first and third quartiles (top and bottom of the box), and minimum and maximum values (whiskers). All data points that generate the box and whisker plots are presented as individual points within the plot. These pooled data were analyzed through the statistical software Prism Graphpad software. For experiments measuring a single variable with multiple treatment groups, a single factor ANOVA with post hoc means testing (Tukey) was utilized. A p-value of less than 0.05 was required to reject the null hypothesis that no difference existed between groups of data. For survival curves a Mantel-Cox test was used to determine significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rose Sockol and the UO Zebrafish Facility staff for fish husbandry.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bacterial immunomodulatory protein with lipocalin-like domains facilitates host-bacteria mutualism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vijay Kumar (Reviewer #1); Francois Leulier (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Rolig et al. reports the exciting discovery of a novel bacterial protein, AimA, and its role in mediating host-bacteria mutualism between zebrafish and <italic>Aeromonas</italic>spp. Structural analysis on AimA reveals that it is comprised of two lipocalin-like domains that share homology with mouse lipocalin 2 (mLcn2). Similar to mLcn2, each of AimA's lipocalin-like domains can modulate neutrophil responses. However, the genetic loss of AimA in <italic>Aeromonas</italic> results in heightened neutrophil infiltration to the gut, which in turn reduces <italic>Aeromonas</italic> fitness and survival. Such a defect in fitness is not apparent when mutant <italic>Aeromonas</italic> is mono-associated with the immunocompromised <italic>myd88<sup>-/-</sup></italic>zebrafish. On the contrary, these <italic>myd88<sup>-/-</sup></italic>zebrafish displayed a striking increase in mortality, which correlates with an overgrowth of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> in the gut. Taken together, these intriguing observations shed new insight on the central role of AimA in mediating a distinct bi-directional interaction between a commensal bacterium and its host. Overall, the study is well-designed and supported using robust experimental approach and genetic models.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In a seminal study (Goetz et al., 2002), Roland Strong and colleagues previously heterologously expressed mLcn2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> which led to the discovery that mLcn2 can sequester and co-purify with a bacterial siderophore, namely enterobactin. Despite the homology between mLcn2 and AimA, it remains unclear whether AimA has the ability to bind siderophore. It is therefore important to clarify whether AimA can bind (and co-purify with) enterobactin and ensure that the AimA isolated by the authors is siderophore-free. Can the authors also please comment on whether heterologous expression of AimA impeded the growth of the <italic>E. coli</italic>?</p><p>2) To make this article more accessible to a diverse readership, many of whom may be unfamiliar with the nuances of the zebrafish model, please discuss the important limitations of the model (e.g. that it is highly artificial, examines association with a single species from a complex consortium that normally colonize zebrafish, limitations of the larval GF model, and the effect sizes of the inflammatory and viability phenotypes, which show rather subtle differences between experimental groups. E.g. in some cases, just 1-3 neutrophils per entire gut. These differences are likely not to be well-appreciated by those readers not intimately familiar with this zebrafish larval model.</p><p>3) Please justify the use of the timepoints in experiments. Why are some 6 days and others 7 days, and why were these particular timepoints chosen?</p><p>4) Please discuss the fate of the larvae infected with the various mutants outside of the measured time points. Would any of these GF or <italic>Aeromonas</italic>-associated larvae develop into adulthood? And if not, what other possible explanations could there be for rather subtle cellular differences in larvae that are not destined to survive into adulthood?</p><p>5) It is traditional to show the phenotype of the WT bacterial strain in any in vivo assay. However, the WT strain is not presented in Figure 1, on the complemented mutant. It is not always the case that a complemented mutant shows a WT phenotype, so this would be important to establish.</p><p>6) In the subsection “<italic>Aeromonas</italic> secretes a protein that modulates the intestinal neutrophil response”, it states that various mutant colonize to similar levels. However, it is latter concluded that the immunomodulatory proteins is important to support colonization of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> (subsection “AimA controls host neutrophil response and promotes <italic>Aeromonas</italic> colonization”). Please clarify how fitness and colonization are differentiated? Most would consider that colonization reflects fitness over the course of a short term assay like those used here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37172.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In a seminal study (Goetz et al., 2002), Roland Strong and colleagues previously heterologously expressed mLcn2 in E. coli which led to the discovery that mLcn2 can sequester and co-purify with a bacterial siderophore, namely enterobactin.

In response to the reviewers’ comment we now present the following evidence that AimA does not bind siderophores:</p><p>1) Careful structural examination of the wide enterobactin binding cleft in LCN2 and comparison of the analogous structural regions of each of the domains of AimA reveals that the openings of N- and C-term calyx domains of AimA are much narrower, are occluded by loops, and lack the polar enterobactin-interacting residues of LCN2. This detailed structural analysis is now presented in the last paragraph of the subsection “Presence of mouse lipocalin-2 inhibits AimA function” and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-F.</p><p>2) We tested whether AimA binds enterobactin by growing <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 under iron limiting conditions that make it dependent on the siderophore function of its secreted enterobactin. As expected under these conditions, addition of purified LCN2 inhibited <italic>E. coli</italic> growth. In contrast, addition of the same concentration range of purified AimA had no effect on <italic>E. coli</italic> growth. These data are now presented in the last paragraph of the subsection “Presence of mouse lipocalin-2 inhibits AimA function” and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1G.</p><p>3) We tested whether AimA functions in iron acquisition for <italic>Aeromonas</italic> by testing the ability of wild type <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and the Aer Δ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> mutant to grow in iron-depleted media containing dipyridyl. We found that the two strains had identical growth curves under iron limitation. These data are now presented in the second paragraph of the subsection “AimA controls host neutrophil response and promotes <italic>Aeromonas</italic> colonization” and in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, suggesting that AimA and AimB do not function in iron acquisition for <italic>Aeromonas</italic>.</p><p>Based on this evidence, we concluded that AimA does not bind enterobactin (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To make this article more accessible to a diverse readership, many of whom may be unfamiliar with the nuances of the zebrafish model, please discuss the important limitations of the model (e.g. that it is highly artificial, examines association with a single species from a complex consortium that normally colonize zebrafish, limitations of the larval GF model, and the effect sizes of the inflammatory and viability phenotypes, which show rather subtle differences between experimental groups. E.g. in some cases, just 1-3 neutrophils per entire gut. These differences are likely not to be well-appreciated by those readers not intimately familiar with this zebrafish larval model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that is important to state the implications and limitations of our model. We have now included (in the third paragraph of the Introduction) a description of the zebrafish gnotobiotic system and a discussion of its limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please justify the use of the timepoints in experiments. Why are some 6 days and others 7 days, and why were these particular timepoints chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>In our initial characterization of the neutrophil response to <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and the type 2 secretion mutant and subsequent analysis of AimA activity (Figures 1, 3, and 4) we performed the assay at 6 dpf because we have a considerable amount of data collected on neutrophil populations of germ-free, conventional, and mono-associated zebrafish at this time point (Rolig et al., 2015, Rolig et al., 2017). When we examined the colonization dynamics of the <italic>aim</italic> mutants, we saw the greatest colonization defect at 7 dpf. We therefore subsequently analyzed the host neutrophil phenotypes in response to these strains at 7 dpf in Figures 5 and 6. We now explain this rationale in the text at lines 321 and 338 and we have included a new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 that shows the colonization dynamics of the ZF Aer wild type and <italic>aimA</italic> mutant strains at days 5, 6, and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please discuss the fate of the larvae infected with the various mutants outside of the measured time points. Would any of these GF or Aeromonas-associated larvae develop into adulthood? And if not, what other possible explanations could there be for rather subtle cellular differences in larvae that are not destined to survive into adulthood?</p></disp-quote><p>We realize we did not make it clear that we can only readily maintain zebrafish in a gnotobiotic state through their larval stage (up to about 8 dpf) while they are still provisioned with nutrients from their yolk. We do not have robust methods for feeding and maintaining adult zebrafish in a germ-free state. We have now included this in our text about the limitations of the zebrafish gnotobiotic system in the third paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is traditional to show the phenotype of the WT bacterial strain in any in vivo assay. However, the WT strain is not presented in Figure 1, on the complemented mutant. It is not always the case that a complemented mutant shows a WT phenotype, so this would be important to establish.</p></disp-quote><p>The complemented mutant (ΔT2C) was previously shown to restore T2SS function (Graf, 2011), thus in these experiments we chose to compare the ΔT2 strain to the complemented strain, which allowed us to rule out the possibility that phenotypes associated with the ΔT2 strain were due to a polar or second site mutation introduced by the mutagenesis. We now explain this rationale in the subsection “<italic>Aeromonas</italic> secretes a protein that modulates the intestinal neutrophil response”.</p><p>Because the parent strain Hm21 of the two secretion system mutants is the same parent strain we used to make the <italic>aim</italic> deletion mutants, the colonization of the wild-type parent and the intestinal neutrophil response to it are presented in Figure 5C and 5E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the subsection “Aeromonas secretes a protein that modulates the intestinal neutrophil response”, it states that various mutant colonize to similar levels. However, it is latter concluded that the immunomodulatory proteins is important to support colonization of Aeromonas (subsection “AimA controls host neutrophil response and promotes Aeromonas colonization”). Please clarify how fitness and colonization are differentiated? Most would consider that colonization reflects fitness over the course of a short term assay like those used here.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the Aer ΔT2did not exhibit a colonization defect (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) in comparison to the Aer ΔT2C(complemented strain), whereas theΔ<italic>A</italic>Δ<italic>B</italic> mutant (Hm21 strain) and the Δ<italic>AimA</italic> mutant (zebrafish <italic>Aeromonas</italic> isolate ZOR001) did exhibit a colonization defect in comparison to their respective wild-type parent strains (Figure 5). We now address this in the third paragraph of the subsection “AimA controls host neutrophil response and promotes <italic>Aeromonas</italic> colonization” and point out that this could be due to other phenotypic consequences of the altered secretion profile of the Aer ΔT2strain.</p><p>We have further clarified our use of the term ‘fitness’ throughout the manuscript. We have replaced the term fitness with “the capacity to survive the intestine” or to “colonization advantage” to clarify our meaning.</p></body></sub-article></article>
