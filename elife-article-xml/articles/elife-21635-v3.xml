LAMP2 deficiency causes Danon’s disease, an X-linked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. LAMP2 is needed for chaperone-mediated autophagy, and its expression improves tissue function in models of aging. We show here that human LAMP1 and LAMP2 bind cholesterol in a manner that buries the cholesterol 3β-hydroxyl group; they also bind tightly to NPC1 and NPC2 proteins that export cholesterol from lysosomes. Quantitation of cellular LAMP2 and NPC1 protein levels suggest that LAMP proteins represent a significant cholesterol binding site at the lysosome limiting membrane, and may signal cholesterol availability. Functional rescue experiments show that the ability of human LAMP2 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes relies on its ability to bind cholesterol directly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21635.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21635.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21635.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells contain many membrane-bound compartments surrounded by a gel-like substance called the cytoplasm. Lysosomes are compartments found in most animal cells, which contain enzymes that can break down virtually all kinds of biological molecules. Cell biologists around the world use two proteins called LAMP1 and LAMP2 to mark lysosomes to study them. The loss of LAMP2 causes a condition called Danon disease that is characterized by thickening of the heart muscle. However, relatively little is known about what these proteins actually do.</p><p>Previous studies had hinted that these proteins might bind to the fatty molecule, cholesterol. Li and Pfeffer set out to test this directly and showed that LAMP1 and LAMP2 proteins do indeed bind to cholesterol. The two LAMP proteins also interact with another two proteins, called NPC1 and NPC2, which export cholesterol out of lysosomes.</p><p>Li and Pfeffer then showed that cells contain 5- to 10-times more LAMP proteins than they do NPC1-cholesterol exporters. This suggests that LAMP proteins have additional roles that need to be characterized and studied to see how important cholesterol binding is for these processes too. Future studies could also explore if LAMP proteins signal that free cholesterol is available for the cell’s needs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21635.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21635.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>lysosome membrane</kwd><kwd>Niemann Pick disease</kwd><kwd>glycocalyx</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001790</institution-id><institution>Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK37332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA124435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LAMP proteins, the major glycoproteins of the lysosome membrane, bind cholesterol directly and specifically, and interact with NPC1 and NPC2 proteins as part of the lysosomal cholesterol export process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic lysosomes are acidic, membrane-bound organelles that contain proteases, lipases and nucleases and degrade cellular components to regenerate catabolic precursors for cellular use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xu and Ren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schwake et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saftig and Klumperman, 2009</xref>). Lysosomes are crucial for the degradation of substrates from the cytoplasm, as well as membrane bound compartments derived from the secretory, endocytic, autophagic and phagocytic pathways. The limiting membrane of lysosomes is lined with so-called lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs) that are comprised of a short cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane span, and a highly, N- and O-glycosylated lumenal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kundra and Kornfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Granger et al., 1990</xref>). Because of their abundance and glycan content, LAMPs have been proposed to serve as a protective barrier to block hydrolase access to the limiting phospholipid bilayer. LAMP1 and LAMP2 are 37% identical and may overlap in function, but knockout of LAMP1 in mouse has a much milder phenotype than depletion of LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>): LAMP2-deficient mice have very short lifespans, and show massive accumulation of autophagic structures in most tissues. Indeed, LAMPs are required for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huynh et al., 2007</xref>) and LAMP2 has also been proposed to serve as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cuervo and Dice, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has implicated LAMP2 in cholesterol export from lysosomes, as LAMP-deficient cells show cholesterol accumulation that can be rescued by LAMP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eskelinen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneede et al., 2011</xref>). Proteome-wide analysis of cholesterol binding proteins included LAMP1 and LAMP2 among a long list of candidate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hulce et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these hints, the precise function of LAMP proteins has remained unclear, and they are often presumed to be structural components.

Under these conditions, most of the cholesterol remains in a mixed micelle of cholesterol and detergent and is still poorly soluble. Thus, the apparent affinity for cholesterol is likely to be tighter than the curves indicate, as the amounts added do not reflect the concentration of free cholesterol that is actually available for binding.</p><p>Preliminary experiments showed that <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol binding was competed by unlabeled cholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, but not cholesterol sulfate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggested that binding occurs via the 3β-hydroxyl moiety of the cholesterol molecule, similar to the orientation with which the NPC1 N-terminal domain binds cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, LAMP2 also bound <sup>3</sup>H-25-hydroxycholesterol with similar apparent affinity as cholesterol; binding was competed by excess cold 25-hydroxycholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as would be expected for a specific interaction.

Importantly, epicholesterol failed to compete for cholesterol binding to LAMP2 protein under conditions where cholesterol competed for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It was not possible to add higher concentrations of sterol competitors due to solubility issues, but significant inhibition was observed. Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that cholesterol binds LAMP2 via its 3β-hydroxyl moiety.</p><p>A slight stimulation of binding was seen in reactions containing low levels of competitor cholesterol sulfate or 25-hydroxycholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>); this is presumably due to the higher solubility of these sterols, which will help solubilize <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol present in the reaction’s mixed micelles, and presumably make it more available for LAMP2 binding (see also ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Infante et al., 2008</xref>). Despite its somewhat higher solubility, 25-hydroxycholesterol did not appear to bind LAMP2 much more tightly than cholesterol, at least as inferred from its ability to compete with cholesterol for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or to bind directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The LAMP protein family includes LAMP1, LAMP2, DC-LAMP, BAD-LAMP and Macrosialin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these proteins contains a related 'LAMP' domain; LAMP1 and LAMP2 proteins each contain two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Soluble versions of the individual, membrane distal ('domain 1') and membrane proximal ('domain 2') LAMP domains of LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) bound cholesterol with different capacity: the N-terminal, domain 1 bound more cholesterol than its membrane proximal, domain 2 counterpart under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). It is possible that both are capable of binding cholesterol within the full length molecule, as total domain 1 binding was less than that seen with the full length, secreted LAMP2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To verify that LAMP2 binds cholesterol in cells, soluble LAMP2 protein was expressed and purified from the secretions of HEK293F cells grown in protein-free, FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium that does not contain cholesterol. Under these conditions, any LAMP2-bound sterol must come from intracellular sources. We subjected freshly purified LAMP2 protein to chloroform:methanol extraction and analyzed the extract by thin layer chromatography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the LAMP2 extract contained a molecular species that co-chromatographed with cholesterol but not 24-hydroxy-, 25-hydroxy-, or 26-hydroxycholesterol, lanosterol or 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol.

However, it is important to note that NPC1 also likely binds cholesterol within its membrane spanning region which may also influence its overall conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2016</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21635.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>LAMP2 binds NPC1 and NPC2 proteins.</title><p><bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>, Structures of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; pdb 3jD8) and NPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; pdb 2 hka) proteins; <bold>C</bold>,<bold>E</bold>, Microscale thermophoresis (<bold>E</bold>) or fluorescence (<bold>C</bold>) obtained with mixtures of soluble, AF647 labeled-NPC1 N-terminal domain or AF647-RNase B with increasing concentrations of soluble LAMP2 in 1 µM cholesterol. <bold>D</bold>,<bold>F</bold>, Microscale thermophoresis of AF647 labeled-NPC2 with increasing concentrations of soluble LAMP2 or RNase B in 1 µM cholesterol sulfate.

[The term, reservoir, is meant to imply a holding station for cholesterol molecules that have been solubilized from the internal lipid contents of lysosomes by NPC2, and held closer to the limiting membrane, prior to NPC1-mediated export.]</p><p>Are LAMP proteins abundant enough to represent a cholesterol reservoir? We used purified LAMP2 and NPC1 proteins as standards to determine their precise abundance in HeLa and HEK293 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using the polypeptide molecular weights and cellular protein determinations, we estimate that HeLa cells contain 6.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> LAMP2 molecules per cell and 3.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> NPC1 molecules per cell, or 18 fold more LAMP2 than NPC1; HEK293T cells contain 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> LAMP2 molcules per cell and 5.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> NPC1 molecules (3.6 × fold more LAMP2).</p><p>Baby hamster kidney cells have been estimated to contain an absolute volume of ~37 µm<sup>3</sup> lysosomes and prelysosomes per cell (3.7 × 10<sup>–14</sup> l) and a lysosome membrane area of 370 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffiths et al., 1989</xref>). Assuming similar values for HeLa cells, this would represent a LAMP2 membrane density of 18,378 or 5676 molecules per µm<sup>2</sup> in HeLa or 293T cell lysosomes, respectively, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Granger et al., 1990</xref>). For comparison, tightly packed viral spike glycoproteins occur at a density of 22,000 molecules per µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quinn et al., 1984</xref>). We assume that LAMP1 will be of similar high density, together with LAMP2, practically lining the interior of the lysosome limiting membrane. In terms of concentrations, 37 femtoliters of lysosome volume would contain 0.3 mM LAMP2-associated cholesterol binding sites in HeLa cell lysosomes (assuming one mole cholesterol bound per more LAMP2). It does not seem unreasonable to consider this as a significant reservoir of cholesterol molecules that may be poised for transfer to NPC1 protein prior to export.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Residues needed for cholesterol binding are needed for LAMP protein function</title><p>The structure of an individual LAMP domain from DC-LAMP protein is comprised of a novel, beta-prism fold that appears to contain a hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>); we used this structure to model the structure of LAMP2 domain 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The ability of lysosomes to export cholesterol can be monitored by feeding cells cholesterol in the form of LDL, and using conversion of <sup>14</sup>C-oleic acid to cholesteryl oleate that takes place after endocytosed cholesterol is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>). Previous work showed that LAMP1/2 knockout MEF cells were impaired in cholesterol export using this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneede et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We used lentivirus transduction to test the ability of full length LAMP2, a membrane anchored LAMP2 domain 1 (LAMP2-GFP Δ194–368; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), or a membrane anchored LAMP2 domain 1-I<sup>111</sup>A/V<sup>114</sup>A to rescue the ability of LAMP1/LAMP2 knockout MEF cells to export LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. For these experiments, we used LAMP constructs containing a single LAMP domain, as full length LAMP2 constructs with mutations in both LAMP domains failed to fold properly or be transported efficiently to lysosomes.</p><p>It was important to first verify the precise amounts of each construct in lysosomes, to evaluate any functional rescue findings. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the rescue constructs were expressed at comparable levels in each stably expressing cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Light microscopy confirmed that the constructs were capable of proper lysosome localization, as determined by their colocalization with endogenous LAMP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) in HeLa cells. (Similar staining was observed in LAMP knockout MEF cells that lack LAMP protein markers).</p><p>To fully confirm the folding of these artificial constructs, we analyzed their glycosylation status and stability after addition of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Full length GFP-LAMP2 protein migrated at ~140 kD and its abundance was not altered after 4 hr cycloheximide treatment, consistent with its long half life in cultured cells (panel B). Similarly, the GFP-domain 1 construct was stable under these conditions and migrated at ~90 kD (panels A,B). In contrast, the I<sup>111</sup>A/V<sup>114</sup>A mutant domain I protein displayed two distinct bands; the upper band was stable, while the lower band likely corresponded to an ER form that was largely degraded after 4 hr in cycloheximide (panels A,B). From this we conclude that cells expressing membrane anchored LAMP2 domain 1 I<sup>111</sup>A/V<sup>114</sup>A are less efficient at folding the protein but some folded protein makes it to lysosomes, where it is stable. This difference was accounted for in subsequent functional rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows that as expected, full length, wild type LAMP2 rescued cholesterol export in LAMP1/2-deficient MEF cells; membrane anchored LAMP2 domain 1 showed a level of rescue consistent with its lower capacity for cholesterol binding (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, membrane anchored, LAMP2 domain 1 I<sup>111</sup>A/V<sup>114</sup>A failed to rescue cholesterol export from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with its inability to bind cholesterol; shown are the data corrected for the amount of mature proteins present in lysosomes in these cells. LAMP2 constructs mutated in both cholesterol-binding sites could not be tested, as they were only poorly delivered to lysosomes.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate a direct role for LAMP2 in cholesterol export from lysosomes, and confirm that LAMP2’s ability to bind cholesterol correlates with its ability to support cholesterol export from LAMP-deficient MEF cells. In addition, LAMP proteins bind tightly to NPC proteins in vitro and in cells, and appear to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes.</p><p>LAMP proteins are the most highly abundant membrane glycoproteins of the lysosome, and their lumenally oriented cholesterol binding sites represent a significant binding site for this important sterol. We measured ~7 × 10<sup>6</sup> molcules per HeLa cell, representing 0.3 mM binding sites in lysosomes. A recent cellular mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>) estimated LAMP proteins to be present at 260,000 copies and NPC1 at 29,193 copies per HeLa cell. While the relative abundance of these proteins matches the values we report here, their total level was 25 fold lower in that study. It is possible that these transmembrane glycoproteins were under-represented in due to their unusual protease resistance as proteins of the lysosome membrane, differences in cell confluency and/or differences in HeLa cell lines employed.</p><p>Lysosomes have recently been shown to sense and signal amino acid availability to influence lysosome biogenesis in relation to cellular need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>), and LAMP oligomerization has been reported to correlate with chaperone mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>). Cholesterol levels may influence LAMP protein conformation or interaction with other partners to signal the availability of endocytosed cholesterol to influence autophagy and cellular metabolism. The ten fold higher abundance of LAMP proteins compared with NPC1 protein in HeLa cells suggests that LAMP proteins may do more than just facilitate NPC1 function in cholesterol export. Future experiments will be needed to fully understand the roles played by these highly abundant lysosomal membrane glycoproteins.</p><p>We have shown that LAMP2 binds tightly to the N-terminal domain of NPC1 and also binds cholesterol with the same orientation as that domain. LAMP2 also aids in cholesterol export from lysosomes. How might LAMP2’s cholesterol binding site contribute to cholesterol export? Current models suggest that the soluble NPC2 protein binds cholesterol from the internal membranes of lysosomes and delivers it to NPC1 at the limiting membrane of this compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). One possibility is that NPC2 can deliver cholesterol to both NPC1 and to LAMP2, which is more abundant. This would help drive the cholesterol export process by moving cholesterol from the accumulated, lumenal lipid stores to the lysosome’s limiting membrane. Because LAMP2 and NPC1 N-terminal domains bind cholesterol in the same orientation, it makes sense that NPC2 (which binds in opposite orientation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2007</xref>]) could transfer the cholesterol between these two proteins. The recent crystal structure of NPC2 bound to the middle, lumenal domain of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2016</xref>) supports a direct handoff between NPC1 and NPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). In future work, it will be important to elucidate precisely how LAMP2 interacts with both NPC2 and NPC1 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes and how cholesterol binding contributes to LAMP2’s other cellular roles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Cholesterol, epicholesterol and sodium cholesteryl sulfate were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) was a gift from Rajat Rohatgi (Stanford University, Stanford, CA); 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol were from Steraloids (Newport, RI) or Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); [1,2-<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol (50 Ci/mmol) and 25-[26,27-<sup>3</sup>H] hydroxycholesterol were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

LAMP1 staining was performed with sequential incubation of mouse anti-LAMP1 culture supernate and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000, Invitrogen), each for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol and imaged using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope and Leica software with a 60 × 1.4 N.A. Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens and a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Photometrics). Flow cytometry was carried out on a FACScan Analyzer on gently trypsinized cells fixed as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Structures were presented in drawings created using Chimera software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Cholesterol ester formation</title><p>LAMP1/LAMP2-deficient MEF cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 5% (vol/vol) LPDS for two days and assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2015</xref>) with minor modification. After 48 hr, 100 µg/mL LDL, 50 µM lovastatin, and 50 µM sodium mevalonate were added for 5 hr. Cells were pulse labeled for 4 hr with 0.1 mM sodium [1-<sup>14</sup>C]oleate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals)–albumin complex. Cells were washed two times with 2 mL 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4, followed by 2 mL 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Cells were extracted and rinsed with hexane-isopropanol (3:2), pooled, and evaporated. After resuspending each sample in 60 µl hexane, 4 µL of lipid standard containing 8 µg/mL triolein, 8 µg/mL oleic acid, and 8 µg/mL cholesteryl oleate was added. Samples were spotted onto a silica gel 60 plastic backed, thin layer chromatogram and developed in hexane. Cholesteryl oleate was identified with iodine vapor, scraped from chromatograms, and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting in 10 mL Biosafe II.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Minimum sample sizes were determined assuming 5% standard error and &gt;95% confidence level. p values were determined using Graphpad Prism software and are indicated in all figures according to convention: *p≤0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001; ****p≤0.0001.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Chris G Burd (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Frederick Maxfield (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li and Pfeffer have investigated cholesterol binding by lysosomal LAMP proteins. They report that soluble, secreted fragments of the lumenal portions of LAMP1 and LAMP2 exhibit specific binding of cholesterol. Specificity of binding is suggested by saturation binding kinetics, competition experiments, and point mutagenesis. Full-length, endogenous LAMP2 is shown to co-immunoprecipitate with GFP-tagged NPC1 and NPC2 expressed by transfection and this association is diminished by treatment of cells to reduce late endosome cholesterol. Co-IP of LAMP2 and NPC1 is correlated with oligomeric state of LAMP1, where cholesterol promotes dissociation of LAMP1 oligomers and results in a decrease in the amount of LAMP2-NPC1 complex. Finally, the authors show that mutations in the lumenal domain of LAMP2 that ablate cholesterol binding do not support NPC1-mediated efflux of cholesterol from the lysosome.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your findings that LAMP proteins bind to cholesterol and promote NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome are potentially impactful for the field. However, four major concerns, listed below, were raised with several aspects of the work that must be definitively addressed in order to further advance the paper at <italic>eLife</italic>. While the reviewers indicated their willingness to recommend consideration of a revised manuscript by <italic>eLife</italic>, given the fundamental nature of several concerns, they also recommended that a revised manuscript should be evaluated by each reviewer.</p><p>1) The affinities and specificities of cholesterol binding to LAMP proteins is not adequately demonstrated.</p><p>It is concluded that 3H-cholesterol binds to LAMP2 with an affinity of Km ~ 5 µM. Given that the solubility of cholesterol in water is less than 100 nM, this result raises several critical questions. First, it is possible that a more soluble contaminant (e.g., an oxysterol) is responsible for the competition. Another possibility is that the cholesterol is in some type of micelle with the NP40 detergent. In either case, it is hard to know how to evaluate the concentration of cholesterol in these experiments. The authors need to elucidate the form of cholesterol that is bound by LAMP proteins.</p><p>The reviewers noted that the one-point competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> are suggestive of specificity, but they agreed that it is essential to examine other structurally similar sterols (e.g., lanosterol), instead of cholesterol sulfate, which is more soluble than cholesterol. In addition, the competition data needs to show concentration curves of unlabeled competitor sterols.</p><p>2) The lipid components of the membranes from which LAMP2 is purified and bound lipids identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) must be determined. It is key to evaluate the co-purification data in light of the abundances of cholesterol versus other abundant lipids in lysosomal membranes such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. 7-β-hydroxy cholesterol and 26-hydroxy-cholesterol are present at trace levels in cells when compared to cholesterol, and are not appropriate controls for this experiment.</p><p>3) The conclusions that NPC1 and LAMPs bind each other and that this is regulated by cholesterol-dependent changes in oligomeric state of LAMP require additional support. Regarding the LAMP2-NPC1 binding experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, data should be shown for reactions carried out in the absence of cholesterol. It was noted that the primary data showing cholesterol dependence of binding shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> was not shown and further, that the approach does not afford sufficient control of cholesterol level to firmly support the authors' conclusion that LAMP2 and NPC1 do not bind in the absence of cholesterol.</p><p>4) The reviewers had difficulty envisioning the role of LAMP proteins in NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome as you suggest in the manuscript, and this requires serious consideration in the presentation of the proposed model. Specifically, previous work has suggested that NPC2 and NPC1-NTD bind cholesterol with opposite orientation of the hydroxyl, which would allow cholesterol to slide from one pocket to the other. If LAMPs and NPC1-NTD have the same orientation, this will not work; cholesterol would remain bound to LAMP. Related to this point, one reviewer raised the point that LAMPs seem better suited to be cholesterol sensors rather than &quot;reservoirs&quot;. Compared to the capacity of the lysosome membrane to harbor cholesterol, are there really sufficient numbers of LAMP proteins per lysosome to constitute a &quot;reservoir?&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: a revised version of this study was rejected after a second round of peer review, but the authors resubmitted for consideration, and the new manuscript was deemed suitable for publication.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Lysosomal membrane glycoproteins bind cholesterol and contribute to lysosomal cholesterol export&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Chris G Burd (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Frederick Maxfield (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found this to be an interesting and potentially important study. However, lingering concerns with several fundamental aspects of the study drove the editor's decision. Regarding cholesterol binding by LAMP proteins, the reviewers acknowledged the encouraging data that supports this conclusion, but there remains concern with the methodology, including a suggestion for more rigorous controls for non-specific binding. There was agreement amongst the reviewers that a well-supported and fundamental advance regarding the mechanism of cholesterol export has yet to emerge the experiments that probed interactions between LAMP2 and NPC1 (and possibly NPC2), and also the data presented regarding LAMP2 oligomerization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have responded to each of the four major issues that were raised during the initial review. Each is addressed below.</p><p>&quot;1) The affinities and specificities of cholesterol binding to LAMP proteins is not adequately demonstrated.&quot;</p><p>New competition binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) over a 50-fold concentration range (I think – see below) show that 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol, but not cholesterol sulfate or lanosterol, compete with cholesterol for binding to secreted LAMP2 lumenal domain. The data, particularly for lanosterol, support the authors' conclusion that the 3β position of cholesterol is recognized by LAMP2.</p><p>The methods section needs to be updated. It is stated that competition experiments were done only in the presence of 30 μM unlabeled sterol.</p><p>&quot;2) The lipid components of the membranes from which LAMP2 is purified and bound lipids identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) must be determined.&quot;</p><p>The authors point out that the material that was analyzed was secreted LAMP2, not material extracted from a membrane. I'm sorry – my mistake for not appreciating this previously. This, and the additional mass spectra analyses provide further support that cholesterol is specifically recognized by LAMP2.</p><p>&quot;3) The conclusions that NPC1 and LAMPs bind each other and that this is regulated by cholesterol-dependent changes in oligomeric state of LAMP require additional support.&quot;</p><p>These concerns have been addressed with additional experiments.</p><p>The evidence presented in support of the conclusion that LAMP (LAMP1, in this case) dimerizes as a result of cholesterol depletion is an increase in the abundance of a high molecular weight species, consistent with a dimer, on a gel by anti-LAMP1 blot of cell extracts. Dimerization is one possibility. It could also be explained by an association with another protein, a conformational change, etc. While the magnitude in the increase in the putative LAMP1 dimer is statistically significant, it is a small proportion of the total LAMP1.</p><p>The IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> controls for co-IP of LAMP2 and NPC1-GFP, two integral membrane proteins, using just soluble GFP. A more appropriate and convincing control for specificity would be an unrelated GFP-tagged integral membrane protein.</p><p>The authors now report that binding of purified LAMP2 and NPC1 N-term domain proteins is not affected by the presence or absence of cholesterol, though co-IP of the full length proteins from cells is diminished when cells are incubated with cyclodextrin. The authors also report that LAMP proteins are present in approx. 10-fold excess of NPC1, and that binding between the luminal domains of LAMP2 and NPC1 in vitro are not affected by cholesterol occupancy. Given the 5 nM KD affinity of the interaction measured in vitro, it seems most likely to me that they would be associated constitutively (meaning, in the presence of absence of cholesterol) in the lysosome membrane.</p><p>Overall, with regards to the mechanism, it's unclear to me what the data is telling us. Regardless of the mechanism, the data do support, in my opinion, the conclusion that LAMP2 plays a role in cholesterol efflux from the lysosome and that this is correlated with cholesterol binding to LAMP2.</p><p>&quot;4) The reviewers had difficulty envisioning the role of LAMP proteins in NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome as you suggest in the manuscript, and this requires serious consideration in the presentation of the proposed model.&quot;</p><p>With the clarification of the manner in which the authors use &quot;reservoir,&quot; along with the determination of LAMP protein abundance, I agree that it is plausible that LAMP proteins provide a physiologically relevant &quot;reservoir&quot; of cholesterol to be a component of the NPC1- and NPC2-mediated lysosomal cholesterol efflux pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In general the authors have addressed my major concerns. However, I still have some questions and concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) I don't understand the comment in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section. I don't see how having 25-OH cholesterol will improve the solubility of cholesterol and increase its binding.</p><p>2) The treatment of wild type cells with cyclodextrin is confusing to me. Does it actually reduce cholesterol in the late endosomes/lysosomes? Without showing this, the effect on LAMP1 is hard to interpret. I am also concerned about the health of cells in LPDS and 1 mM CD for 24 hours.</p><p>3) In the eighth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section. This explanation does not make sense to me. Only a small fraction of the LAMP is dimerized. There is still abundant monomer, which could interact with NPC1. I would recommend deleting the CD treatment and the LAMP dimerization. It is not key to the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this revision, the authors have attempted to address the concerns raised with the cholesterol binding data and with their claims of cholesterol-regulated behavior of LAMP proteins and interaction with NPC proteins. Unfortunately, almost all of my concerns remain.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>My previous review: “The assay showing direct binding of 3H-cholesterol to LAMP2 has no specificity controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since 3H-cholesterol binding to LAMP2 shows weak affinity (Km ~ 5 µM), it is imperative to show that some other hydrophobic 3H-ligand does not bind to LAMP2 at these high concentrations where hydrophobic ligands often precipitate. The one-point competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> are suggestive of specificity, but the authors should try lanosterol (or some other structurally similar sterol) as a negative control, instead of cholesterol sulfate which is more soluble than cholesterol. The competition data also needs to show concentration curves of unlabeled competitor sterols. The authors' claim of similar binding of cholesterol to LAMP2 and NPC1-NTD is misleading since they compare saturation stoichiometries, not the more relevant affinity parameters. To rule out non-specific binding of insoluble cholesterol to LAMP2, careful controls are needed”.</p><p>The authors now say that they carried out binding reactions in the presence of sub-cmc concentrations of detergent. This sounds good, but the Methods section does not say anything about this. The only place the detergent is mentioned is in a new paragraph in the Results, but no details are given. All the binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is identical to what was in the first submission. So, did the authors redo these with sub-cmc detergent and get the same results? In any case, even if the authors had merely not reported their experimental procedures accurately in the original submission, none of the concerns previously raised have been addressed.</p><p>A) The key data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> which shows a saturation binding curve of 3H-cholesterol to LAMP2 that shows very weak affinity – Km = 5-10 µM. This solitary curve is hard to interpret without carrying out the same dose curve in the presence of excess unlabeled cholesterol, which would indicate the background non-specific binding. Also, they need to show that some other 3H-sterol ligand does not bind LAMP2 in the same experiment. They claim later that 25-HC competes and lanosterol does not compete. Both of these sterols are available commercially in tritiated form. 3H-lanosterol would have been a great control for specificity.</p><p>B) The next key pieces of data are in 1G and 1H. Again, these panels are identical to the original submission, and once again it is not clear how much 3H-cholesterol was used. From extrapolation using 1B, it looks like around 5 µM, but details like these are critical and need to be indicated. In any case, 1H shows competition by unlabeled cholesterol, but there is no negative control with a non-competitor like cholesterol sulfate. The authors now add competition curves by other unlabeled sterols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Unfortunately, these cannot be judged because once again it is not clear how much 3H-cholesterol was used and the raw binding values that were normalized to 1.0 are not indicated. The authors should use cpm units so that we can compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> data. Also, every competition curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> requires a positive control and a negative control in the same experiment to be able to judge anything. They show competition curve for unlabeled cholesterol out to 15 µM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, but all the other competition curves are upto 50 µM – what happens with unlabeled cholesterol at these concentrations. Based on the cholesterol data, the competitors should be judged by their ability to compete at 15 µM. Only 7-ketocholesterol seems to be a strong competitor. Also, why did they not do competition curves for 24-hydroxycholesterol, which according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> was the strongest competitor? How about epicholesterol, where the 3-hydroxyl region is modified in a manner more subtle than cholesterol sulfate. The claim that the 3β-hydroxyl group of cholesterol enters the binding pocket cannot be made from these data.</p><p>C) The mass spec data showing cholesterol is present in purifications could be due to the high concentrations of cholesterol, but not their control sterols, in the serum-rich media into which the proteins were secreted. Again, no details of the growth conditions are given so that we can judge these results.</p><p>My previous review: “The claim that LAMP proteins oligomerize when cholesterol is limiting and associate with NPC1 when cholesterol is available is not supported by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The association of NPC1 with LAMP2 is shown by IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, but no cholesterol dependence for this interaction is shown (the raw data for the bar graph in 3B is not shown). Instead, the interaction of NPC1 with LAMP2 in the presence of cholesterol is shown by a different method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, but this experiment does not show what happens in the absence of cholesterol! <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows a partial effect of cholesterol on LAMP1 dimerization, but not on LAMP2 oligomers. The key lane on the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is shown in isolation without any controls, so the significance of higher density of dimer is not clear. The quantification needs to be done on a gel from a single experiment with LAMP2.”</p><p>The authors had previously claimed cholesterol dependency of NPC1-LAMP2 interaction, but had not shown the data in a single experiment. They now say that there is no cholesterol dependence, but again do not show the data!</p><p>The IP data showing interaction between LAMP2 and NPC1-GFP (a membrane protein) uses GFP (soluble protein) as a control. They would need to use another lysosomal membrane protein as a control to rule in specificity. Again, they claim that LAMP1 dimerizes using a gel where the key lane is shown in isolation without any controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>), so the significance of the slightly higher density of the dimer is not clear. The quantification needs to be done on a gel from a single experiment with LAMP1.</p><p>Eskelinen et al., 2004 and Schneede et al., 2011 have already highlighted the roles of Lamp2 in cholesterol transport, the key advance in this study is to attempt to show a direct interaction between cholesterol and LAMP proteins and to get at the mechanism. Neither of these points are supported by their data, and as such I do not think this paper makes a significant contribution to this problem.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21635.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that your findings that LAMP proteins bind to cholesterol and promote NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome are potentially impactful for the field.

We have used precisely the conditions employed by Brown &amp; Goldstein in their studies of cholesterol binding to NPC1 protein.</p><p>New text: “Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of sub-critical micelle concentration concentrations of Nonidet P40 detergent to help solubilize the cholesterol (Infante et al., 2008). Under these conditions, most of the cholesterol remains in a mixed micelle of cholesterol and detergent and is still poorly soluble. Thus, the apparent affinity for cholesterol is likely to be tighter than the curves indicate, as the amounts added do not reflect the concentration of free cholesterol that is available for binding.”</p><p><italic>The reviewers noted that the one-point competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> are suggestive of specificity, but they agreed that it is essential to examine other structurally similar sterols (e.g., lanosterol), instead of cholesterol sulfate, which is more soluble than cholesterol. In addition, the competition data needs to show concentration curves of unlabeled competitor sterols.</italic> </p><p>To better characterize the binding pocket we have now added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>with complete binding profiles for cholesterol sulfate, 25-hydroxycholesterol, lanosterol and 7-ketocholesterol. Only 7-ketocholesterol and 25- hydroxycholesterol compete, consistent with our conclusion that the 3β-hydroxyl group of cholesterol enters the binding pocket.</p><p><italic>2) The lipid components of the membranes from which LAMP2 is purified and bound lipids identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) must be determined.

A request for full lipid analysis is far beyond what Brown &amp; Goldstein needed for NPC1 as a cholesterol binder. We added a new chromatogram to show that lanosterol, 24-, and 25-hydroxycholesterol also fail to co-chromatograph with the eluted material. Importantly, the mass peaks perfectly correspond to cholesterol or a derivative thereof, rather than a phospholipid or sphingolipid. Also, the binding specificity seen by competition (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is consistent with this. Finally, we sent our samples to Denny Porter and Chris Wassif at NIH who independently got the same profile that we did; they found no evidence of any phospholipids or special sterols.</p><p><italic>3) The conclusions that NPC1 and LAMPs bind each other and that this is regulated by cholesterol-dependent changes in oligomeric state of LAMP require additional support. Regarding the LAMP2-NPC1 binding experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, data should be shown for reactions carried out in the absence of cholesterol. It was noted that the primary data showing cholesterol dependence of binding shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> was not shown and further, that the approach does not afford sufficient control of cholesterol level to firmly support the authors' conclusion that LAMP2 and NPC1 do not bind in the absence of cholesterol.</italic> </p><p>We repeated the in vitro MST experiments with and without cholesterol and find that the N-terminal domain of NPC1 binds LAMP2 under either condition and now report this. We also added additional data in support of decreased interaction of LAMP2 with NPC1-GFP in cells with the addition of the actual gels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel B). Thus, although the NPC1 N-terminal domain binds LAMP2 whether or not that NPC1 domain is occupied, the total proteins don’t interact as well when cholesterol is limiting in lysosomes in cells.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers had difficulty envisioning the role of LAMP proteins in NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome as you suggest in the manuscript, and this requires serious consideration in the presentation of the proposed model. Specifically, previous work has suggested that NPC2 and NPC1-NTD bind cholesterol with opposite orientation of the hydroxyl, which would allow cholesterol to slide from one pocket to the other. If LAMPs and NPC1-NTD have the same orientation, this will not work; cholesterol would remain bound to LAMP. Related to this point, one reviewer raised the point that LAMPs seem better suited to be cholesterol sensors rather than &quot;reservoirs&quot;. Compared to the capacity of the lysosome membrane to harbor cholesterol, are there really sufficient numbers of LAMP proteins per lysosome to constitute a &quot;reservoir?&quot;</italic> </p><p>We actually went ahead and quantified the amount of LAMP and NPC1 proteins in cells using purified protein standards (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 3D LAMP2 concentration in 0.3mM which is not insignificant; it will be higher in 2D environment. We also clarified the Discussion to explain more clearly how LAMP proteins may hold soluble cholesterol for NPC2-mediated transfer to NPC1.</p><p>“…How might LAMP2’s cholesterol binding site contribute to cholesterol export? Current models suggest that the soluble NPC2 protein binds cholesterol from the internal membranes of lysosomes and delivers it to NPC1 at the limiting membrane of this compartment (Kwon et al., 2009). […] In future work, it will be important to elucidate precisely how LAMP2 interacts with both NPC2 and NPC1 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes and how cholesterol binding contributes to LAMP2’s other cellular roles.”</p><p>[Editors' note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors resubmitted for further consideration.]</p><p><italic>Overall, the reviewers found this to be an interesting and potentially important study. However, lingering concerns with several fundamental aspects of the study drove the editor's decision. Regarding cholesterol binding by LAMP proteins, the reviewers acknowledged the encouraging data that supports this conclusion, but there remains concern with the methodology, including a suggestion for more rigorous controls for non-specific binding. There was agreement amongst the reviewers that a well-supported and fundamental advance regarding the mechanism of cholesterol export has yet to emerge the experiments that probed interactions between LAMP2 and NPC1 (and possibly NPC2), and also the data presented regarding LAMP2 oligomerization.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have responded to each of the four major issues that were raised during the initial review. Each is addressed below.</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;1) The affinities and specificities of cholesterol binding to LAMP proteins is not adequately demonstrated.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>New competition binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) over a 50-fold concentration range (I think – see below) show that 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol, but not cholesterol sulfate or lanosterol, compete with cholesterol for binding to secreted LAMP2 lumenal domain. The data, particularly for lanosterol, support the authors' conclusion that the 3β position of cholesterol is recognized by LAMP2.</italic> </p><p>Thank you. We have now added epicholesterol which is the best control for cholesterol specificity.</p><p><italic>The methods section needs to be updated. It is stated that competition experiments were done only in the presence of 30 μM unlabeled sterol.</italic> </p><p>Corrected.</p><p><italic>&quot;2) The lipid components of the membranes from which LAMP2 is purified and bound lipids identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) must be determined.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors point out that the material that was analyzed was secreted LAMP2, not material extracted from a membrane. I'm sorry – my mistake for not appreciating this previously. This, and the additional mass spectra analyses provide further support that cholesterol is specifically recognized by LAMP2.</italic> </p><p>Thank you and we have importantly clarified that there was no cholesterol in the medium.</p><p><italic>&quot;3) The conclusions that NPC1 and LAMPs bind each other and that this is regulated by cholesterol-dependent changes in oligomeric state of LAMP require additional support.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>These concerns have been addressed with additional experiments.</italic> </p><p><italic>The evidence presented in support of the conclusion that LAMP (LAMP1, in this case) dimerizes as a result of cholesterol depletion is an increase in the abundance of a high molecular weight species, consistent with a dimer, on a gel by anti-LAMP1 blot of cell extracts. Dimerization is one possibility. It could also be explained by an association with another protein, a conformational change, etc. While the magnitude in the increase in the putative LAMP1 dimer is statistically significant, it is a small proportion of the total LAMP1.</italic> </p><p>We have removed this data.</p><p><italic>The IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> controls for co-IP of LAMP2 and NPC1-GFP, two integral membrane proteins, using just soluble GFP. A more appropriate and convincing control for specificity would be an unrelated GFP-tagged integral membrane protein.</italic> </p><p>We have added the control lysosomal integral membrane protein, MCOLN1 and showed that it does not bind LAMP2.</p><p><italic>The authors now report that binding of purified LAMP2 and NPC1 N-term domain proteins is not affected by the presence or absence of cholesterol, though co-IP of the full length proteins from cells is diminished when cells are incubated with cyclodextrin. The authors also report that LAMP proteins are present in approx. 10-fold excess of NPC1, and that binding between the luminal domains of LAMP2 and NPC1 in vitro are not affected by cholesterol occupancy. Given the 5 nM KD affinity of the interaction measured in vitro, it seems most likely to me that they would be associated constitutively (meaning, in the presence of absence of cholesterol) in the lysosome membrane.</italic> </p><p>Agreed (for the <italic>N-terminus</italic> which we measured in vitro, ± cholesterol); but in cells, the N-terminus may bind other things such as the rest of NPC1. The full length protein does show a difference in Co-IPs under different cholesterol concentrations.</p><p><italic>Overall, with regards to the mechanism, it's unclear to me what the data is telling us. Regardless of the mechanism, the data do support, in my opinion, the conclusion that LAMP2 plays a role in cholesterol efflux from the lysosome and that this is correlated with cholesterol binding to LAMP2.</italic> </p><p>Thank you; the field needs new models to explain our findings.</p><p><italic>&quot;4) The reviewers had difficulty envisioning the role of LAMP proteins in NPC1,2-mediated cholesterol export from the lysosome as you suggest in the manuscript, and this requires serious consideration in the presentation of the proposed model.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>With the clarification of the manner in which the authors use &quot;reservoir,&quot; along with the determination of LAMP protein abundance, I agree that it is plausible that LAMP proteins provide a physiologically relevant &quot;reservoir&quot; of cholesterol to be a component of the NPC1- and NPC2-mediated lysosomal cholesterol efflux pathway.</italic> </p><p>Thank you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In general the authors have addressed my major concerns. However, I still have some questions and concerns that need to be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I don't understand the comment in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section. I don't see how having 25-OH cholesterol will improve the solubility of cholesterol and increase its binding.</italic> </p><p>All the binding experiments use sub-CMC Triton to solubilize the sterol as worked out by Brown and Goldstein for the N-terminal domain of NPC1 (Infante et al. 2008 JBC 283, 1052). 25H is slightly more soluble than regular cholesterol, and all sterols come from mixed micelles onto LAMP protein in the binding reactions. Thus, there will be mixed micelles of 25H and regular cholesterol. We tried to clarify this in the text; (Infante et al. 2008 saw the same phenomena in the above paper in 3 figures).</p><p><italic>2) The treatment of wild type cells with cyclodextrin is confusing to me. Does it actually reduce cholesterol in the late endosomes/lysosomes?</italic> </p><p>Yes, it does and it can cure the NPC phenotype of cholesterol accumulation (Maxfield (PNAS 107, 5477) and Brown/Goldstein now cited). This is now more clearly explained in the text.</p><p><italic>Without showing this, the effect on LAMP1 is hard to interpret. I am also concerned about the health of cells in LPDS and 1 mM CD for 24 hours.</italic> </p><p>Brown and Goldstein showed that release of cholesterol from lysosomes, assayed by formation of cholesteryl esters, was maximal at 6 hours of treatment with 0.1% cyclodextrin (~1mM); they also assayed 24hours in their time course (Abi-Mosleh et al. 2009 PNAS). We saw normal growth rate and no cell death after 24 hours. The text was modified to clarify this point, and added a toxicology reference that supports our findings.</p><p><italic>3) In the eighth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section. This explanation does not make sense to me. Only a small fraction of the LAMP is dimerized. There is still abundant monomer, which could interact with NPC1. I would recommend deleting the CD treatment and the LAMP dimerization. It is not key to the paper.</italic> </p><p>Deleted as requested; such assays always capture only a small percent of oligomers in any case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this revision, the authors have attempted to address the concerns raised with the cholesterol binding data and with their claims of cholesterol-regulated behavior of LAMP proteins and interaction with NPC proteins. Unfortunately, almost all of my concerns remain.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specific points:</italic> </p><p><italic>My previous review: “The assay showing direct binding of 3H-cholesterol to LAMP2 has no specificity controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since 3H-cholesterol binding to LAMP2 shows weak affinity (Km ~ 5 µM), it is imperative to show that some other hydrophobic 3H-ligand does not bind to LAMP2 at these high concentrations where hydrophobic ligands often precipitate”.</italic> </p><p>Done (see below).</p><p><italic>“The one-point competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> are suggestive of specificity, but the authors should try lanosterol (or some other structurally similar sterol) as a negative control, instead of cholesterol sulfate which is more soluble than cholesterol. The competition data also needs to show concentration curves of unlabeled competitor sterols. The authors' claim of similar binding of cholesterol to LAMP2 and NPC1-NTD is misleading since they compare saturation stoichiometries, not the more relevant affinity parameters. To rule out non-specific binding of insoluble cholesterol to LAMP2, careful controls are needed”.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors now say that they carried out binding reactions in the presence of sub-cmc concentrations of detergent. This sounds good, but the Methods section does not say anything about this. The only place the detergent is mentioned is in a new paragraph in the Results, but no details are given. All the binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is identical to what was in the first submission. So, did the authors redo these with sub-cmc detergent and get the same results? In any case, even if the authors had merely not reported their experimental procedures accurately in the original submission, none of the concerns previously raised have been addressed.</italic> </p><p>We have always used conditions established by Brown and Goldstein for NPC1 and explain that more clearly here. We thank the referee for helping us make this clearer.</p><p><italic>A) The key data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> which shows a saturation binding curve of 3H-cholesterol to LAMP2 that shows very weak affinity – Km = 5-10 µM. This solitary curve is hard to interpret without carrying out the same dose curve in the presence of excess unlabeled cholesterol, which would indicate the background non-specific binding. Also, they need to show that some other 3H-sterol ligand does not bind LAMP2 in the same experiment. They claim later that 25-HC competes and lanosterol does not compete. Both of these sterols are available commercially in tritiated form. 3H-lanosterol would have been a great control for specificity.</italic> </p><p><italic>B) The next key pieces of data are in 1G and 1H. Again, these panels are identical to the original submission, and once again it is not clear how much 3H-cholesterol was used. From extrapolation using 1B, it looks like around 5 µM, but details like these are critical and need to be indicated. In any case, 1H shows competition by unlabeled cholesterol, but there is no negative control with a non-competitor like cholesterol sulfate. The authors now add competition curves by other unlabeled sterols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Unfortunately, these cannot be judged because once again it is not clear how much 3H-cholesterol was used and the raw binding values that were normalized to 1.0 are not indicated. The authors should use cpm units so that we can compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> data. Also, every competition curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> requires a positive control and a negative control in the same experiment to be able to judge anything. They show competition curve for unlabeled cholesterol out to 15 µM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, but all the other competition curves are upto 50 µM – what happens with unlabeled cholesterol at these concentrations. Based on the cholesterol data, the competitors should be judged by their ability to compete at 15 µM. Only 7-ketocholesterol seems to be a strong competitor. Also, why did they not do competition curves for 24-hydroxycholesterol, which according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> was the strongest competitor? How about epicholesterol, where the 3-hydroxyl region is modified in a manner more subtle than cholesterol sulfate. The claim that the 3β-hydroxyl group of cholesterol enters the binding pocket cannot be made from these data.</italic> </p><p>A <sub>3</sub>H-lanosterol control would have cost $2500. Instead we used the excellent suggestion of epicholesterol which wonderfully does not bind! (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, controls included). Thank you so much for this excellent suggestion. As noted by the referee, at high sterol concentrations, it is not possible to add enough competitor to fully block binding as there are significant solubility issues. Nevertheless, we have now made much more clear how the binding was done, how much cholesterol is present, and added new data for 25-hydroxycholesterol ± cold competitor (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In summary, sterol binding is indeed specific and likely tighter than the apparent Kd due to solubility issues.</p><p><italic>C) The mass spec data showing cholesterol is present in purifications could be due to the high concentrations of cholesterol, but not their control sterols, in the serum-rich media into which the proteins were secreted. Again, no details of the growth conditions are given so that we can judge these results.</italic> </p><p>Our error – the protein was purified using Freestyle 293 medium lacking any cholesterol, thank you for catching our omission.</p><p><italic>My previous review: “The claim that LAMP proteins oligomerize when cholesterol is limiting and associate with NPC1 when cholesterol is available is not supported by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The association of NPC1 with LAMP2 is shown by IP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, but no cholesterol dependence for this interaction is shown (the raw data for the bar graph in 3B is not shown). Instead, the interaction of NPC1 with LAMP2 in the presence of cholesterol is shown by a different method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, but this experiment does not show what happens in the absence of cholesterol! <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows a partial effect of cholesterol on LAMP1 dimerization, but not on LAMP2 oligomers. The key lane on the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is shown in isolation without any controls, so the significance of higher density of dimer is not clear. The quantification needs to be done on a gel from a single experiment with LAMP2”.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors had previously claimed cholesterol dependency of NPC1-LAMP2 interaction, but had not shown the data in a single experiment. They now say that there is no cholesterol dependence, but again do not show the data!</italic> </p><p><italic>The IP data showing interaction between LAMP2 and NPC1-GFP (a membrane protein) uses GFP (soluble protein) as a control. They would need to use another lysosomal membrane protein as a control to rule in specificity. Again, they claim that LAMP1 dimerizes using a gel where the key lane is shown in isolation without any controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>), so the significance of the slightly higher density of the dimer is not clear. The quantification needs to be done on a gel from a single experiment with LAMP1.</italic> </p><p>We have added the control lysosomal integral membrane protein, MCOLN1 and</p><p>showed that it does not bind LAMP2. We did show the data for the quantitation and removed the crosslinking to avoid any issues.</p><p><italic>Eskelinen et al., 2004 and Schneede et al., 2011 have already highlighted the roles of Lamp2 in cholesterol transport, the key advance in this study is to attempt to show a direct interaction between cholesterol and LAMP proteins and to get at the mechanism. Neither of these points are supported by their data, and as such I do not think this paper makes a significant contribution to this problem.</italic> </p><p>We feel strongly that the demonstration of direct cholesterol binding to LAMP2, its tight interaction with NPC1 in vitro and in cells, and the correlation between cholesterol binding capacity and phenotype rescue of LAMP depleted cells, represent a very unexpected and significant advance in our understanding of what role this protein family may play. Previous work provided no hints as to why LAMP1/2 depletion interfered with cholesterol export from lysosomes. Our work provides entirely new models that can be tested and studied further.</p></body></sub-article></article>
