and the Mtr4 RNA helicase. Mpp6 interacts with the nine-subunit exosome core, while Rrp47 stabilizes the exoribonuclease Rrp6 and recruits Mtr4, but it is less clear if these cofactors work together. Using biochemistry with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins, we show that Rrp47 and Mpp6 stimulate exosome-mediated RNA decay, albeit with unique dependencies on elements within the nuclear exosome. Mpp6-exosomes can recruit Mtr4, while Mpp6 and Rrp47 each contribute to Mtr4-dependent RNA decay, with maximal Mtr4-dependent decay observed with both cofactors. The 3.3 Å structure of a twelve-subunit nuclear Mpp6 exosome bound to RNA shows the central region of Mpp6 bound to the exosome core, positioning its Mtr4 recruitment domain next to Rrp6 and the exosome central channel. Genetic analysis reveals interactions that are largely consistent with our model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29062.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29062.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA decay</kwd><kwd>protein-RNA complex</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>RNA degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM097910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wasmuth</surname><given-names>Elizabeth V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lima</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lima</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM079196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lima</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nuclear exosome cofactors Mpp6 and Rrp47 can stimulate exoribonuclease activities of the nuclear RNA exosome and recruit the Mtr4 helicase to promote helicase dependent RNA decay.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic RNA exosome is a conserved and essential multisubunit complex that carries out diverse functions in RNA metabolism, ranging from normal turnover, processing and maturation, to quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zinder and Lima, 2017</xref>). In yeast, its 9-subunit core (Exo9) forms a donut-shaped scaffold that recruits two 3’ to 5’ exoribonucleases, Dis3 (aka Rrp44) and Rrp6. Subunit composition of RNA exosomes varies according to cellular localization, where Exo9 and Dis3 form the cytoplasmic exosome (Exo10<sup>Dis3</sup>), and Exo9, Dis3, and Rrp6 constitute the nuclear exosome (Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup>). Additionally, human Exo9 and Rrp6 may form a nucleolar exosome (Exo10<sup>Rrp6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomecki et al., 2010</xref>). Nuclear RNA exosome activities are associated with an astounding repertoire of RNA substrates, including precursors of ribosomal RNA, snoRNAs, snRNAs, surveillance of tRNA and pre-mRNAs, and decay of non-coding RNAs including CUTs, PROMPTs, and eRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmang et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houseley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pefanis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Not surprisingly, mutations in exosome subunits and its misregulation have been reported in several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fasken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lohr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). How the nuclear exosome carries out such diverse processes is thought to be determined in part through its association with regulatory protein cofactors that enhance its ability to interact with appropriate substrates.</p><p>Previous studies elucidated structures and biochemical activities of the non-catalytic core and minimal catalytic units: 10-, 11- and 12- subunit exosomes that represent the Exo10<sup>Dis3</sup> and Exo11<sup>Dis3/Ski7</sup> cytoplasmic complexes, the nucleolar Exo10<sup>Rrp6</sup> complex, and nuclear complexes Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> and Exo12<sup>Dis3/Rrp6/Rrp47</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kowalinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makino et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wasmuth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasmuth and Lima, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinder et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, these studies revealed that Exo9 modulates the activities of Dis3 and Rrp6; that the Rrp6 protein can stimulate Dis3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasmuth and Lima, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wasmuth et al., 2014</xref>); that the major path for RNAs greater than 30 nucleotides utilize the Exo9 central channel to guide RNA to Rrp6 for distributive trimming or through the entire channel to Dis3 for processive decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonneau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drazkowska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasmuth and Lima, 2012</xref>); and the existence of a minor channel-independent ‘direct access’ route to Dis3 for shorter RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinder et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While much has been learned about these exosome complexes, an incomplete picture remains with respect to nuclear exosome cofactors and their influence on exosome activities. The nuclear exosome is associated with the protein cofactors Mpp6 and Rrp47, whose individual deletion in vivo results in misprocessing of nuclear exosome substrates, while concomitant loss leads to synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feigenbutz et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>). These genetic observations resemble deletions of the TRAMP complex, a three protein complex that catalyzes polyadenylation and subsequent degradation of an array of nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaCava et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vanácová et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyers et al., 2005</xref>) through one of two non-templated polyA polymerases Trf4/5, one of two zinc knuckle proteins Air1/2, and the essential RNA helicase Mtr4, which is thought to bridge the nuclear exosome to other RNPs, including ribosome biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thoms et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, Rrp47 binds directly to Rrp6 via the Rrp6 N-terminal domain, an interaction that stabilizes Rrp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dedic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feigenbutz et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stead et al., 2007</xref>) and generates a composite interface that recruits Mtr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>) in vitro and in vivo, though other factors are speculated to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feigenbutz et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuparevic et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, Mpp6 function is less clear, due in part to its poor sequence conservation. Its synthetic lethality with Rrp6 in yeast suggested Mpp6 may be a Dis3 cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>), while in human it was posited as a Rrp6 cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schilders et al., 2005</xref>) and has been reported to recruit Mtr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schilders et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how Mpp6 influences nuclear exosome activities and Mtr4 recruitment, we present the functional characterization of nuclear exosome complexes with Mpp6, Rrp47 and Mtr4 from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and the crystal structure of a 12-subunit nuclear exosome complex bound to Mpp6 and RNA to a resolution of 3.3 Å. Using full-length proteins, we observe that Rrp47 and/or Mpp6 can stimulate Rrp6 activity when these factors are associated in exosome complexes, albeit with different dependencies on exosome subunit and domain composition. Finally, biochemical and genetic studies suggest that Mpp6 can bind RNA and stimulate the activities of the nuclear exosome, and that both Mpp6 and Rrp47 contribute to recruitment of the Mtr4 helicase to facilitate activation of the nuclear exosome and degradation of structured RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mpp6 can stimulate Rrp6 activity in an Exo9-dependent manner</title><p>Recombinant Mpp6 was expressed, purified and tested for its ability to bind various sequences of single-stranded RNA via fluorescence polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Mpp6 was mixed with reconstituted exosomes containing Rrp6 that lacked the PMC2NT domain (128-733) to prevent aggregation, Dis3, or both Rrp6 and Dis3. In the context of Exo10<sup>Rrp6</sup>, Mpp6 stimulated Rrp6-mediated decay 13-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mpp6 stimulated Rrp6 activity by 2.5-fold while reducing Dis3 activity by 1.5-fold when associated with Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, Mpp6 had no effect on the activities of Rrp6 or Dis3 in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and Mpp6 failed to stimulate Dis3 exoribonuclease or endoribonuclease activity on polyA RNA when associated with Exo10<sup>Dis3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We were unable to assess the influence of Mpp6 on degradation of AU-rich RNA by Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> as the RNA was degraded too quickly to measure rates. Taken together, these results suggest that Mpp6 association with Exo9 can stimulate Rrp6 activity, although stimulation of Dis3 can also be observed in the absence of Rrp6 or in the presence of catalytically inactivated Rrp6.</p><p>Mpp6 contains two small regions of high sequence conservation as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>), one near its N-terminus and one near the middle of the protein.

Given its location in the structure and evolutionary conservation, we refer to Mpp6 Arg112 as the ‘arginine anchor’. Interestingly, two known mutations within Rrp40 that are associated with neurological disorders lie proximal to the arginine anchor of Mpp6. These include Gly148 (Gly191 in human), which is mutated to cysteine in hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halevy et al., 2014</xref>), and Trp195 (Trp238 in human), which is mutated to arginine in pontocerebeller hypoplasia and spinal motor neuron degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wan et al., 2012</xref>).

The defect on Exo10<sup>Rrp6</sup> stimulation observed for a second mutant, Mpp6 R89E, was exacerbated when combined with Rrp40 E185A, a mutation predicted to disrupt contacts to the Mpp6 arginine anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The third Mpp6 mutant, R103E, exhibited a weaker defect that could be overcome by adding 10-fold excess mutant Mpp6. In contrast, the defect in exosome stimulation by Mpp6 R112E was not overcome by addition of excess cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combining Mpp6 R112E and Rrp40 E185A resulted in a similar loss of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

As before, Mpp6 stimulation of Rrp6 activity on polyA RNA was diminished by partial lasso deletion, however Rrp47 activity was not altered in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This observation suggests that the stimulatory effects of Mpp6 and Rrp47 depend on unique elements within the nuclear exosome. These biochemical observations appear consistent with recent observations in yeast wherein deletion of the Rrp6 PMC2NT domain, a mutation known to result in loss of Rrp47 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stead et al., 2007</xref>), results in a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of the Rrp6 lasso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wasmuth and Lima, 2017</xref>).</p><p>How might Mpp6 and Rrp47 stimulate Rrp6 activity in the nuclear exosome?

While lattice contacts between Rrp6 and two symmetry related Dis3 subunits may alter its conformation, Rrp6 is rotated away from the Exo9 central channel, perhaps facilitating greater access for RNA to engage the S1/KH ring and Rrp6 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Interestingly, a similar conformation for Rrp6 was observed in the crystal structure of Exo12<sup>Dis3exo-endo-/Rrp6exo-/Rrp47</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makino et al., 2015</xref>), although in this case RNA was not observed in the Rrp6 active site.

However, synthetic lethality was observed when mutations in the tripartite interaction with Mtr4 were combined with a Mtr4 C-terminal GFP tag, consistent with Mtr4 recruitment to the exosome being dependent on additional factors or Mtr4 surfaces that interact with Rrp6, Mpp6, Rrp47 or other components of the TRAMP complex. Furthermore, experiments in human suggest that both Mpp6 and Rrp47 contribute to Mtr4 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schilders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubas et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mpp6 and/or Rrp47 were added to full-length Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> to determine if these cofactors contribute to interactions with Mtr4 via analytical gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with previous results, Mtr4 did not co-elute with the exosome in the absence of Rrp47 and Mpp6 while co-elution was observed in the presence of Rrp47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When Mpp6 and Rrp47 were both present, more Mtr4 was detected in fractions containing the exosome suggesting greater stability of the complex. Importantly, Mpp6 was capable of recruiting Mtr4 to the exosome in the absence of Rrp47 and, to lesser extent, in the absence of Rrp6. Removing the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Mpp6 (1-156) did not disrupt Mtr4 interaction, but removal of the N-terminal 81 amino acids in Mpp6 (82-186) or the conserved N-terminal 22 amino acid motif in Mpp6 (23-120) resulted in no detectable interactions with Mtr4. Mpp6<sup>Minimal</sup> (81-120) failed to interact with Mtr4. These data suggest that Mpp6 elements required for exosome activation are distinct from those required for Mtr4 recruitment.</p><p>To assess whether Mpp6- or Rrp47-mediated recruitment of Mtr4 results in Mtr4-dependent RNA degradation, we assayed reconstituted exosomes for decay activity in the presence of exogenously added Mtr4 using a 17 nt double stranded RNA with a 10 nt 3’ poly(A) overhang (ds<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>) in comparison with assays using the same labeled 27 nt RNA without the complementary 17 nt strand (ss<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Previous studies reported that Dis3 is unable to degrade the ds<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub> substrate in the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makino et al., 2015</xref>), presumably because the 3’ overhang is too short to span the Exo9 central channel. Rrp6-dependent trimming of the 3’ overhang was stimulated in the presence of Rrp47, Mpp6 or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with our biochemical observations using polyA RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Products of Dis3 activity could be detected with the ds<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub> substrate, but only when Rrp47 or Mpp6 was present. Importantly, this activity was dependent on the presence of both Mtr4 and ATP, as AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, failed to support activity. By contrast, Dis3-dependent degradation of ss<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub> did not appear dependent on Mpp6, Rrp47, Mtr4, ATP or AMPPNP. Trimming of the ds<sub>17</sub>A<sub>10</sub> 3’ overhang by Rrp6 dominated the assay in WT exosomes in the presence of Rrp47 or Mpp6, so we analyzed Mtr4-dependent decay using exosomes reconstituted with catalytically inactivated Rrp6 (Rrp6<sup>exo-</sup>). As before, Mtr4-dependent decay was only observed in the presence of Rrp47 or Mpp6, while addition of both cofactors resulted in the greatest stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

However, since the Mpp6 (81-120) protein did not result in productive interactions with Mtr4 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the observation that <italic>mpp6 (81-120)</italic> phenocopies <italic>∆mpp6</italic> is also consistent with a model in which Mtr4 recruitment is defective. Finally, a strain harboring <italic>mpp6 (81-186)</italic> and <italic>rrp6 (128-634)</italic> was viable despite the fact that both Rrp47- and Mpp6-dependent mechanisms for Mtr4 recruitment are presumed missing. Although this strain grows much slower than any other characterized in this study, its viability suggests that combining the Mpp6 exosome associating region with its C-terminal domain is sufficient to suppress lethality observed for <italic>rrp6 (128-634)</italic>, perhaps through interactions with the transcriptional termination machinery via Nrd1 as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Experiments presented here suggest that the nuclear exosome cofactor, Mpp6, can associate with the Exo9 core through interactions with the S1/KH subunit Rrp40 to recruit the helicase Mtr4 and to stimulate the activities of the exosome, most notably those catalyzed by Rrp6. A minimal region of Mpp6 comprised of amino acids 81–120 appears sufficient for exosome association and stimulation in vitro, although it is defective for recruitment of Mtr4. As our structure shows, this fragment includes a conserved arginine anchor that is important for Mpp6 interactions with the exosome core via Rrp40 and biochemical interactions with Rrp6 and the Rrp6 lasso.</p><p>This study also sheds light on dual functions of Mpp6 and Rrp47 insofar as both factors can stimulate RNA exosome activities and both contribute to Mtr4 recruitment and Mtr4-dependent degradation in vitro, perhaps providing some additional insights to in vivo synthetic interactions reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feigenbutz et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milligan et al., 2008</xref>). Interactions between the nuclear exosome and Rrp47 or Mpp6 result in stimulation of exosome activities, but they rely on distinct surfaces for these activities. Rrp47 interacts with the N-terminal PMC2NT domain of Rrp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuch et al., 2014</xref>), while Mpp6-mediated stimulation requires the Exo9 core and the Rrp6 C-terminal lasso.</p><p>Rrp47 and Mpp6 each contribute to Mtr4 interactions with Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup>, and inclusion of both cofactors appears to maximize these interactions. While we were unable to decouple Rrp47-mediated stimulation from its ability to recruit Mtr4, genetic and biochemical results suggest that a minimal fragment of Mpp6 (residues 81–120) that supports Mpp6-mediated stimulation was not sufficient to support growth in vivo when paired with an <italic>rrp6</italic> allele that does not interact with Rrp47, and that additional Mpp6 elements are required for optimal cell growth. These include N-terminal elements that contribute to interactions with Mtr4 and C-terminal elements that were reported to contribute to interactions with the termination apparatus or perhaps Rrp6 as indicated by two-hybrid studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Additional details have been resolved with respect to the contributions of Mpp6 and Rrp47 to nuclear exosome function, however critical work remains to resolve the structural and mechanistic bases for activities associated with the Mtr4 helicase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Exosome subunit purification, complex reconstitution, and analyses</title><p>Cloning, expression, purification of exosome subunits and reconstitution of various complexes have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greimann and Lima, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wasmuth and Lima, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wasmuth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zinder et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mpp6 (full-length and various truncations), Rrp47, and Mtr4 were cloned into pRSF-Duet1 with a N-terminal Smt3-fusion tag, and were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) RIL (Novagen; St. Louis, MO).

Briefly, to quantify Dis3 exoribonuclease activity, the fraction of full-length RNA degraded at a given time was calculated based on the amount of 4–5 nt products released.

For quantitation of Rrp6 and Dis3 activities when present in the same complex, the rate of accumulation of Dis3 products (4–5 nt) was analyzed at time points before Rrp6 products merged with those of Dis3.

Your article has been reviewed favorably by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Tollervey (Reviewer #2); Andrzej Dziembowski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers were quite positive about the work but several issues need to be dealt with via revision. Please address these points thoroughly as possible; note that no additional experiments are required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: How were the contributions of Mpp6 to Dis3 and Rrp6 activities distinguished in the Exo11Dis3/Rrp6 complex? This is a key aspect of the work and it is a potential concern that the conclusions appear to have been based on a single RNA (polyA) that is not a major in vivo substrate.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: &quot;addition of Mpp6 diverts the pattern of UV-induced RNA crosslinks from Dis3 to Rrp6&quot;. This is a plausible interpretation of the protein gel, but the data would be more convincing is quantitated. As presented, it adds little to the paper.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: Does RNA binding by channel occluded exosomes differ significantly from Mpp6 alone? Are we really just seeing the RNA binding affinity of Mpp6 here?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>: How does Exo10Dis3 + Rrp6 + Mpp6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> differ from Exo11Dis3/Rrp6 + Mpp6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>? The composition appears to be the same but the activity appears different – and more like Exo11Dis3/6-exo + Mpp6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> also appears to indicate that Rrp6 does not contribute to the activity of the Exo10Dis3 + Rrp6 + Mpp6 complex, in contrast to a major conclusion of the manuscript that Mpp6 largely acts through Rrp6. Some clarification is needed</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: How was it established that &quot;Mpp6 and Rrp47 stimulate Rrp6 activity&quot; in the Exo11Dis3/Rrp6 complex used? Is this simply inferred from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?</p><p>6) The final sections on genetic interactions is an understandable attempt to relate the in vitro data to cellular phenotypes. However, it is not easy to follow the significance of the observations reported. This is not helped by the somewhat subjective scoring system used. For example: &quot;Strains containing mpp6 (81–120) phenocopied Δmpp6&quot;. This appears to be a significant conclusion when stated, but is actually based on very limited data and, in fact, the + scores do not appear to be identical. These analyses would be much more valuable were the structural data used to identify specific amino acid changes that are predicted to yield suppression or synergistic negative interactions. As it is, the section adds little to the manuscript.</p><p>7) The information is densely packed in the text and sometimes a little difficult to follow. The text might need another round of editing to improve clarity.</p><p>8) In the section entitled 'Mpp6 can stimulate Rrp6 activity in an Exo9-dependent manner' the following first sentence of the paragraph does not connect well with the content of the subsequent sentences and needs a linking sentence &quot;Mpp6 contains two small regions of high sequence conservation as noted previously (Milligan et al., 2008), one near its N-terminus and one near the middle of the protein.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29062.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: How were the contributions of Mpp6 to Dis3 and Rrp6 activities distinguished in the Exo11Dis3/Rrp6 complex? This is a key aspect of the work and it is a potential concern that the conclusions appear to have been based on a single RNA (polyA) that is not a major</italic> in vivo <italic>substrate.</italic> </p><p>We assume the question regarding initial rates reported for Dis3 and Rrp6 from the Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> complex pertains to the complexity of these assays where both products are observed and where the products coalesce at the end of the time course. The calculation is based on the initial rates obtained from the early points of the time course where products of Rrp6 (intermediates) and Dis3 (final 4–5 nt products) are distinct and clearly separable by gel electrophoresis. We have also included labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to explicitly indicate Rrp6 and Dis3 products to help the reader distinguish these activities. The procedures to separately quantify Dis3 and Rrp6 exoribonuclease have been established in Wasmuth and Lima, 2012 and reported in Wasmuth and Lima, 2017. We apologize for the confusion as some y axes were mislabeled in the prior submission, leading to the misconception that loss of substrate was being measured instead of accumulation of products.</p><p><italic>The second comment pertains to our claim that Rrp6 is preferentially stimulated in an Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> complex. The reviewers point to an issue that this claim is supported solely by observations using a single polyA RNA, and that this RNA is not an in vivo substrate. While we agree that our synthetic RNAs cannot and were not intended as surrogates for in vivo substrates, we would argue that a polyA substrate is relevant because many RNAs are polyadenylated by TRAMP in the nucleus prior to degradation. Furthermore, we do include data for three other substrates, an AU-rich RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that is presumed to be more flexible than polyA RNA, and the RNA substrates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> as a single stranded RNA substrate and as a partial duplex RNA substrate with a 3’ overhang. While we tested the activities of Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup> with the AU-rich RNA, the RNA was degraded too quickly to ascertain rates when both enzymes were active, so we assessed the contributions of Mpp6 to degradation of AU-rich RNA by Exo10<sup>Dis3</sup> and Exo10<sup>Rrp6</sup>. In both cases, Mpp6 stimulates the activities of Dis3 and Rrp6 in the context of the exosome complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels F and G). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we compare the activities of Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup>, Exo12<sup>Dis3/Rrp6/Mpp6</sup>, Exo12<sup>Dis3/Rrp6/Rrp47</sup>, and Exo13<sup>Dis3/Rrp6/Mpp6/Rrp47</sup> with a mixed 27mer RNA 5’-CCCCACCACCAUCACUUAAAAAAAAAA alone and with a 17mer complementary RNA to generate a duplex RNA with a 10 nucleotide 3’ overhang. Comparing data in the presence of AMPPNP where Mtr4 is not active in the first row of gels to the last row in panel A shows that Rrp6 activities are stimulated by Mpp6 at the expense of Dis3 products using the ssRNA substrate, similar to results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with Exo11<sup>Dis3/Rrp6</sup>. In panel C, comparison of the leftmost column (Exo11<sup>Dis3/Mpp6</sup>) to the 3<sup>rd</sup> column (Exo10<sup>Dis3</sup>) shows that Mpp6 can stimulate Dis3 to some extent in the absence of Rrp6, consistent with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with polyA RNA and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—Supplement Figure 1G</xref> for AU-rich RNA.</italic></p><p> <italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: &quot;addition of Mpp6 diverts the pattern of UV-induced RNA crosslinks from Dis3 to Rrp6&quot;.

Cross-linking intensities are also prone to artifacts; more crosslinking does not necessarily mean more occupancy. While we interpreted more cross-linking to Rrp6 as a measure of RNA accessibility to Rrp6, it could simply be that Mpp6 shifts the RNA path slightly to bring the RNA closer to an amino acid that can form a crosslink and may not actually reflect the occupancy of the complex. We removed this figure from the paper.</italic></p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: Does RNA binding by channel occluded exosomes differ significantly from Mpp6 alone? Are we really just seeing the RNA binding affinity of Mpp6 here?</italic> </p><p><italic>We show that Mpp6 alone binds RNA with a K<sub>d</sub> &gt; 1 µM (blue bar) and that Exo10<sup>Channel-occ/Rrp6exo-/Mpp6</sup> binds RNA with a K<sub>d</sub> of ~200 nM (orange bar), just two-fold less well than Exo10<sup>Rrp6exo-/Mpp6</sup> (~90 nM; red bar), so we do not think that we are just seeing the RNA binding affinity of Mpp6 in Exo10<sup>Channel-occ/Rrp6exo-/Mpp6</sup>. Furthermore, Mpp6 can partially rescue Rrp6 activities in exosomes that include S1/KH channel mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that RNA binding activities of Mpp6 cooperate with additional RNA binding activities of the exosome (most likely the Rrp6 lasso) to stimulate Rrp6 even in the presence of channel mutations.</italic></p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 1A, 1B and 4E</xref>: How does Exo10Dis3 + Rrp6 + Mpp6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> differ from Exo11Dis3/Rrp6 + Mpp6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>?

However, it is not easy to follow the significance of the observations reported. This is not helped by the somewhat subjective scoring system used. For example: &quot;Strains containing mpp6 (81–120) phenocopied Δmpp6&quot;. This appears to be a significant conclusion when stated, but is actually based on very limited data and, in fact, the + scores do not appear to be identical. These analyses would be much more valuable were the structural data used to identify specific amino acid changes that are predicted to yield suppression or synergistic negative interactions. As it is, the section adds little to the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>While we agree that the scoring system is subjective, the statement that the ‘+ scores do not appear to be identical’ is incorrect. The scores for the pRS415 empty vector (i.e. mpp6Δ) in the originally submitted manuscript were, from left to right, -, ++++, +++, ++, -. The scores for the mpp6 (81–120) allele were also -, ++++, +++, ++, -. We appreciate the reviewer comments regarding the limited utility of data this figure as it pertains to the structure, but we argue for its inclusion as it shows various dependencies in vivo for domains characterized in vitro that were not apparent in the structure, so they have added value. For instance, mpp6 (1–120) can support growth in strains expressing an Rrp6 isoform that lacks the ability to interact with Rrp47, but only when the Rrp6 C-terminal tail is included. It also shows that cells harboring mpp6 alleles that can bind Mtr4 (full-length or 1–120) grow better in strains expressing an Rrp6 isoform that lacks the ability to interact with Rrp47 (rrp6 128–733 allele). This supports a major conclusion in our manuscript, that Mpp6 and Rrp47 both contribute to Mtr4 interactions, further corroborating results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. While we will defer to the reviewers and editors if they feel strongly on this point, we also feel strongly that this data should be included in the revised manuscript, as previous studies to this point have only identified Rrp47 as a bridge between Mtr4 and the exosome in yeast. We revised this section extensively to focus discussion on the most important observations to clarify these points.</italic></p><p> <italic>7) The information is densely packed in the text and sometimes a little difficult to follow.
