Layer four receives the densest bottom up sensory inputs, while layers 2/3 and 5 receive top down inputs that may convey predictive information. A subset of cortical somatostatin (SST) neurons, the Martinotti cells, gate top down input by inhibiting the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 and 5, but it is unknown whether an analogous inhibitory mechanism controls activity in layer 4. Using high precision circuit mapping, in vivo optogenetic perturbations, and single cell transcriptional profiling, we reveal complementary circuits in the mouse barrel cortex involving genetically distinct SST subtypes that specifically and reciprocally interconnect with excitatory cells in different layers: Martinotti cells connect with layers 2/3 and 5, whereas non-Martinotti cells connect with layer 4. By enforcing layer-specific inhibition, these parallel SST subnetworks could independently regulate the balance between bottom up and top down input.</p></abstract><kwd-group

discrete layers. Excitatory principal cells (PCs) in each layer differentially encode and process sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>), due in part to the fact that they receive different external inputs. âBottom-upâ sensory inputs primarily enter L4, while âtop downâ inputs target PCs in supragranular and infragranular layers. The relative impact of these two main input pathways is likely to be crucial for sensory-guided behavior. Dendrite-targeting somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons are well known for shaping sensory coding through lateral and recurrent inhibition, and for gating top-down input by regulating dendritic spiking and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Veit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adesnik, 2017</xref>). While it is well established that SST neurons send and receive synaptic connections with neurons across multiple cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>), it is unclear whether SST circuits impact all layers in a global manner, or if instead they selectively control specific layers, which could have profound impacts for cortical computation.</p><p>Studies which have examined connectivity of SST cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>) and GABAergic interneurons more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Scholl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Packer and Yuste, 2011</xref>) have found that inhibitory neurons interconnect with excitatory cells densely and non-selectively, which has led to the emerging hypothesis that excitatory circuits are overlaid by a âblanket of inhibitionâ. While these studies have usually focused on connectivity within a single layer, one possibility is that this principle generalizes to the rest of the circuit, meaning that SST cells wire up irrespective of layer to globally regulate cortical networks. However, the SST population is highly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yavorska and Wehr, 2016</xref>) and can be divided into multiple subgroups of cells which exhibit distinct electrophysiological, morphological, genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>), and in vivo functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, some of these subgroups target their axons to different laminar domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">MuÃ±oz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nigro et al., 2018</xref>), and it has been hypothesized that subgroups of SST cells might be specialized to differentially modulate the activity of specific layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>), perhaps by forming distinct subnetworks. Such an architecture would allow for independent gating of different cortical pathways by complementary networks of SST interneurons.</p><p>We addressed these contrasting hypotheses by combining high-resolution optogenetic circuit mapping, paired intracellular recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing, and in vivo optogenetics. With a focus on SST neurons in layer 5, the layer in which they are most numerous, we identified two distinct sub-networks of SST neurons with strikingly contrasting connectivity and in vivo function. The first sub-group of SST neurons was composed of Martinotti cells (MCs), a well-studied cell type which has classically been defined by its ascending axonal projection to L1. The second subgroup was morphologically, transcriptionally, and synaptically distinct from MCs and composed of SST neurons that primarily target L4 instead of L1. The connectivity and function of this second sub-class of SST neurons, which have sometimes been referred to simply as ânon-Martinottiâ cells or âNMCsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nigro et al., 2018</xref>), are largely unknown.</p><p>Our data on L5 SST neurons show that these two SST subgroups comprise highly distinct inhibitory subnetworks that exhibit exquisitely specific and strikingly complementary laminar patterns of connectivity and in vivo impact. MCs receive input from L2/3 and L5, whereas NMCs receive input from L4 and the L5B/L6 border. In turn, MCs provide reciprocal inhibition to PCs in L5 but not to those in L4, while NMCs selectively inhibit PCs in L4. Optogenetically activating MCs and NMCs in vivo results in extremely distinct laminar patterns of suppression, suggesting they may have contrasting roles in sensory computation and behavior. Single-cell RNA sequencing onÂ &gt;2000 individual SST neurons revealed transcriptomically defined SST sub-classes that showed distinct somal lamination profiles across the cortical range of depth. Taken together, these results demonstrate that of these, two major subgroups of cortical SST cells, by virtue of their layer-selective synaptic connectivity, can independently modulate the activity of different cortical layers during sensation. This highly selective synaptic and functional architecture supports a model in which distinct sub-networks of SST neurons may fine tune the balance of activity across the layers of the neocortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two distinct sub-networks of SST neurons defined by layer-specific connectivity</title><p>To probe the synaptic architecture of SST circuits, we employed a combination of one and two photon optogenetics, single cell reconstructions, and paired recording. To make targeted recordings from SST neurons belonging to putatively different sub-classes, we took advantage of transgenic reporter mouse lines that label either all SST neurons (<italic>Sst</italic>-IRES-Cre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), or different anatomical sub-classes of SST neurons in the barrel cortex (GIN, X94, and X98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oliva et al., 2000</xref>). We focused our investigation on SST neurons in L5 which harbors a large and diverse population of SST cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with prior data, the anatomy and intrinsic physiology of L5 GIN cells demonstrated that they are MCs (41/44; 93%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawaguchi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fanselow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kinnischtzke et al., 2012</xref>). By similar analyses, neurons in the X94 line were non-Martinotti cells (32/35; 91%), which formed a dense axonal plexus in L4 rather than L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and exhibited quasi-fast-spiking electrophysiological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While the X94 line labels onlyÂ ~15% of SST cells in L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), additional recordings from L5 SST-TdT cells suggested that the X94 line subsamples the NMC population (consistent with a previous report) since 30â40% of recorded L5 SST cells exhibited an NMC phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1câg</xref>). Aligning biocytin reconstructions of L5 MCs and NMCs revealed that these two populations have strikingly complementary vertical profiles of neurite density: MCs primarily innervated layers 1, 2/3 and 5, and NMCs primarily innervated L4 and the L5/L6 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

We transgenically expressed ChR2 in cortical excitatory neurons across all layers, and used scanning photostimulation to map the spatial profile of excitatory inputs to NMCs and MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Remarkably, we found that L5 MCs and NMCs receive inputs from highly specific and largely non-overlapping sources. MCs, but not NMCs, frequently received excitatory input from either upper L5, L2/3, or from both L2/3 and L5, but received little input from L4 or L6, broadly consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, NMCs received strong input from L4 and/or the L5B/L6 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>; input from L4 and L6 was 62 Â± 7% of total input for nÂ =Â 14 NMCs versus 25 Â± 3% for nÂ =Â 15 MCs; p=6.5 Â· 10<sup>â10</sup>; two sample T-test; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) but relatively little input from L2/3 and L5. Thus, L5 MCs and NMCs appear to receive distinct and complementary patterns of excitatory innervation. An important caveat to these experiments is that our optogenetic stimulation did not recruit the same amount of activity in excitatory neurons across different layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4f</xref>), presumably due to differences in intrinsic excitability or opsin expression levels. Although this makes it difficult to assess the relative strength of laminar input pathways in an absolute sense, stimulation of sites in non-preferred layers (e.g. stimulating L2/3 while recording from an L5 NMC) almost never evoked a response that was significantly greater than the background level of EPSCs, except at sites which were close to the borders between layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3k</xref>). This suggests that input from most sites in non-preferred layers (L4 and L6 for MCs, L2/3 and L5A for NMCs) was either absent or too small to be detected via this method.</p><p>The striking laminar differences in inputs to NMCs and MCs suggested that they might be differentially recruited by activity of different cortical layers. To test this possibility, we specifically photo-stimulated L4 excitatory neurons via Cre-dependent expression of ChR2 in <italic>Scnn1</italic>-Cre mice (crossed to GIN or X94; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). L4-specific photo-stimulation (with two different stimulus protocols, across four different intensities) drove large EPSCs in NMCs but evoked little to no input in MCs under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Current clamp recordings under the same conditions showed that L4 photo-stimulation reliably drove spiking in L5 NMCs, but not in L5 MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) despite the fact that MCs are intrinsically more excitable than NMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The lack of evoked responses in MCs was not due to differences in the degree of L4 activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for controls). Thus, these results indicate a stark difference between L5 NMCs and MCs: L4 densely innervates and powerfully drives firing in L5 NMCs, but not L5 MCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>L4 photo-stimulation excites L5 NMCs but not L5 MCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Schematic of the experimental configuration.Â L5 Ã 94 or GIN cells were recorded during photo-stimulation of L4 excitatory neurons.

Since SST cells have been implicated in generating feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that MCs and NMCs might target their inhibitory outputs in order to reciprocally inhibit the same PC populations that excite them. For example, NMCs but not MCs would inhibit L4 PCs, whereas MCs but not NMCs would inhibit L5 PCs. Alternatively, MCs, NMCs, or both cell types could globally target PCs within and across layers non-selectively. To address this, we used two photon optogenetic circuit mapping to determine whether the outputs of individual SST cells (in the non-specific SST-Cre line) diverge onto PCs in multiple layers. If individual SST cells target either L4 or L5 PCs, but not both, then we should never observe common input to pairs of L4 and L5 PCs when photo-stimulating single SST neurons. This can be tested by mapping optogenetically evoked unitary SST inhibitory connections onto multiple PCs recorded simultaneously and analyzing the spatiotemporal coincidence of evoked IPSCs onto different pairs of PCs, thereby measuring the amount of common input shared between pairs of PCs in different layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morgenstern et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Merel et al., 2016</xref>).

To maximize the spatial precision of photo-stimulation we used a soma-targeted opsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2016</xref>) and computer-generated holography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Since SST â PC synapses are often located on the distal dendrites of PCs, we recorded IPSCs using a cesium-based internal solution, and took additional steps to minimize false negatives (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Using this method, we simultaneously mapped SST inputs to pairs of L4-L5 PCs and L5-L5 PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2f</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>two photon optogenetic circuit mapping reveals that L4 and L5 PCs are inhibited by separate populations of L5 SST cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental configuration.

Furthermore, our finding that MCs and NMCs specifically target L5 PCs and L4 PCs very closely replicates results from a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nigro et al., 2018</xref>), lending further support to the notion that MCs and NMCs are wired into selective subnetworks with distinct laminar populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CRE-DOG enables genetic access to subtypes of SST cells</title><p>The highly specific connectivity revealed by our circuit mapping experiments suggests that MCs and NMCs are specialized for different functions in cortical computation. If this is the case, we would expect that manipulating the activity of these groups of interneurons will have different effects on cortical dynamics. Based on our circuit mapping results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we hypothesized that increasing NMC activity optogenetically would primarily affect L4, whereas increasing MC activity would impact neurons in L5, but not in L4. Since no recombinase driver line is available for NMCs, we sought to instead use the GFP lines themselves for selective expression of ChR2. To do this, we employed the CRE-Dependent-on-GFP (CRE-DOG) system which uses two split fragments of Cre recombinase, that unite as a functional Cre molecule only in the presence of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tang et al., 2015</xref>).

While nearly all TdTomato expression colocalized with GFP, we observed a small number of GFP-/TdTÂ +neurons, which mostly appeared to be pyramidal cells. This off-target expression is probably the result of CRE-DOG leakage, since injecting GFP- wildtype animals in the same manner also results in sparse expression of TdT in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). However, most (232/267; 87%) TdTÂ +neurons were GFP+, indicating that CRE-DOG allows expression of ChR2-TdT in GFPÂ +X94 cells with high specificity.

Consistent with our previous experiments, NMC photostimulation reliably evoked powerful IPSCs in L4 PCs, whereas PCs in other layers usually received small IPSCs or showed no response (mean charge transferÂ Â±C.I: L2/3Â =Â 2.0Â Â±Â 1.4 pC; L4Â =Â 10.7Â Â±Â 4.8 pC; L5Â =Â 0.8Â Â±Â 0.5 pC; L6Â =Â 1.1Â Â±Â 0.4 pC). At the population level, the evoked IPSC was only significant in L4 PCs (L2/3: p=0.41, nÂ =Â 20; L4: p&lt;10<sup>â8</sup>, nÂ =Â 30; L5: p=0.67, nÂ =Â 27; L6: p=0.84, nÂ =Â 22; F-test on linear mixed-effects model compared to baseline charge), though a small number of individual L2/3 PCs did exhibit substantial IPSCs. While this was expected for L2/3 and L5 PCs, the lack of evoked inhibition in L6 PCs is notable, since it suggests that the L6 to NMC connection is asymmetric, unlike the highly reciprocal connectivity pattern seen between L4 PCs and NMCs. It is important to note that we illuminated all layers non-selectively in these experiments (e.g. photostimulated X94 cells both within and outside of L5, though these likely have similar connectivity; see Supplementary note, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) in order to mimic the pattern of activation we would expect to achieve during in vivo photostimulation in ensuing experiments. We conducted these experiments while pharmacologically blocking glutamatergic synaptic transmission, but observed very small or no EPSCs in response to photostimulation in a subset of experiments carried out without glutamatergic blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). These results indicate that CRE-DOG can be used with the X94-GFP line to achieve specific optogenetic control of NMCs.</p><p>Unfortunately, we found that GIN mice were unsuitable for specifically labeling MCs since we unexpectedly observed very bright TdT expression in a large number of L6 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1j</xref>) that were electrophysiologically and morphologically different from MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1l</xref>) and negative for Cre expression in SST-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1m</xref>). The GIN line also labels a heterogeneous population of SST cells (including some L4 NMCs; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We therefore turned to an alternative GFP line, X98, which also labels MCs and not NMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). An important caveat of this strategy is that the population of MCs labeled by the X98 line differs from that labeled by the GIN line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), which makes it difficult to draw a direct link between the circuits described above and X98-based in vivo manipulation of MCs. Nevertheless, we reasoned that X98-ChR2 mice would provide a useful comparison to X94-ChR2 experiments, since it would allow us to target a distinct but similarly sized population of non-NMC SST cells using exactly the same protocol used to target X94 cells.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.019</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of expression in SST reporter lines.</title><p>Four mouse reporter lines were used in this study to target SST neurons and subtypes.

X98 has been described as labeling MCs primarily in deep L5 and upper L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), as well as in L2/3. We observed a large number of TdTÂ +neurons in L2/3 and throughout L5. In X98 mice injected with CRE-DOG/flexed-ChR2-TdT (X98-ChR2 mice), a substantial fraction of TdTÂ +neurons (81/204; 40%) lacked visible GFP expression, but immunohistochemical staining for somatostatin showed that nearly all TdTÂ +neurons (192/204; 94%), including GFP- neurons, were somatostatin positive; this discrepancy might arise from some SST cells expressing GFP only transiently during development. Slice recordings revealed that photostimulation of these neurons drove strong inhibition in L2/3 and L5 PCs, but relatively little in L4 and L6 PCs (mean charge transferÂ Â±C.I: L2/3Â =Â 33.9Â Â±Â 18.7 pC; L4Â =Â 4.7Â Â±Â 3.0 pC; L5Â =Â 17.9Â Â±Â 5.0 pC; L6Â =Â 4.9Â Â±Â 2.7 pC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). In contrast to X94-ChR2, in X98-ChR2 slices evoked responses at the population level were only significant in L2/3 and L5 PCs (L2/3: p&lt;10<sup>â11</sup>, nÂ =Â 6; L4: p=0.46, nÂ =Â 7; L5: p&lt;10<sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 15; L6: p=0.53, nÂ =Â 4; F-test on linear mixed-effects model). These results, along with the patterns of axonal fluorescence, suggests that ChR2-TdTÂ +Â cells in X98-ChR2 mice are a population of SST cells which includes MCs but not NMCs, making X98-ChR2 mice a useful comparison for X94-ChR2 mice. As before, we illuminated the entire slice in these experiments, meaning that MCs in L2/3 were also photostimulated. Since L2/3 MCs inhibit L5 PCs and L5 MCs inhibit L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), the inhibition we observed in L2/3 and L5 PCs likely reflects contributions from both L2/3 MCs and L5 MCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SST subtypes drive layer-specific effects during active sensation</title><p>To test whether these two different SST subtypes differentially impact sensory processing across the cortical layers, we next optogenetically stimulated X94 and X98 cells while recording barrel cortex activity while animals actively touched a stimulus bar placed in different locations in their whisking field. A simple prediction based on our circuit mapping data is that these two subtypes of SST cells should suppress different cortical layers: NMCs should suppress L4, whereas MCs should suppress L2/3 and L5. However, since SST neurons can also disinhibit PCs by suppressing PV cells, it is possible that the net impact on PCs in different layers could instead be to increase activity. Furthermore, a previous in vitro study showed that PV cells are more effectively inhibited by NMCs than by MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2013</xref>); thus a second hypothesis is that activating NMCs would cause a net disinhibition, whereas MCs would result in a net suppression.</p><p>Recording from X94-ChR2 mice, we observed that photostimulating NMCs powerfully suppressed the spontaneous activity of all units in L4, both FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>; 5.2Â Â±Â 1.7 Hz control versus 1.1Â Â±Â 0.5 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 39 L4 FS units), and RS units (1.8Â Â±Â 1.2 Hz control versus 0.9Â Â±Â 0.7 Hz light; p&lt;0.001, nÂ =Â 15 L4 RS units; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b,e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, stimulating NMCs strongly attenuated the response to sensory stimulation in L4 units (L4 RS: 3.8Â Â±Â 1.7 Hz control versus 2.3Â Â±Â 1.2 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 15; L4 FS: 7.1Â Â±Â 4.0 Hz control versus 2.9Â Â±Â 1.0 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d,g,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that, in these conditions, enhancing NMC firing potently suppresses L4 and does not cause a net disinhibition of L4 excitatory neurons. NMC photostimulation caused little to no change in the activity of the L5 RS and L6 RS populations (L5 RS spontaneous: 5.1Â Â±Â 1.2 Hz control versus 5.1Â Â±Â 1.3 Hz light; p=0.20, nÂ =Â 59; L6 RS spontaneous: 1.9Â Â±Â 1.0 Hz control versus 1.6Â Â±Â 0.7 Hz light; p=0.42, nÂ =Â 13; L5 RS sensory-driven: 5.9Â Â±Â 1.2 Hz control versus 5.6Â Â±Â 1.3 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 59; L6 RS sensory-driven: 2.1Â Â±Â 1.0 Hz control versus 1.9Â Â±Â 0.9 Hz light; p=0.04, nÂ =Â 13), although some individual L5 RS units exhibited substantial increases or decreases in their firing rates. This is consistent with the lack of NMC inhibitory connections to PCs in these layers and supports the notion that NMC-mediated inhibition has layer-specific effects on cortical dynamics. Although our in vitro data did not reveal a strong monosynaptic connection from NMCs to L2/3 PCS, NMC photostimulation also robustly reduced spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in the L2/3 RS population (L2/3 RS spontaneous: 0.9Â Â±Â 0.5 Hz control versus 0.1Â Â±Â 0.1 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â4</sup>, nÂ =Â 10; L2/3 sensory-driven: 3.4Â Â±Â 1.4 Hz control versus 1.5Â Â±Â 0.5 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 10), as well as that of nearly all FS units, including those outside of L4 (L2/3 FS sensory-driven: 8.3Â Â±Â 4.0 Hz control versus 5.6Â Â±Â 3.0 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 11; L5 FS sensory-driven: 7.6Â Â±Â 2.8 Hz control versus 4.5Â Â±Â 3.0 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 38; L6 FS sensory-driven: 8.3Â Â±Â 3.8 Hz control versus 7.0Â Â±Â 4.4 Hz light; p&lt;10 <sup>â6</sup>, nÂ =Â 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Because L4 is an important source of excitatory drive to L2/3 PCs and FS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>), the most likely explanation is that that NMC photoactivation indirectly reduces activity in L2/3 by dramatically reducing excitatory input from L4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Differential layer-specific modulation of cortical activity by optogenetic activation of NMCs and MCs in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Raster plots showing activity in example RS units recorded from different layers in X94-ChR2 and X98-ChR2 mice.Â Black rasters show trials with no stimulus thatÂ is spontaneous activity.

Furthermore, we did not observe any effect on cortical activity when we repeated these experiments in wild-type mice (injected with the same viral cocktail used with X94/X98 mice), indicating that the effects we observed depended specifically on the optogenetic stimulation of GFPÂ +SST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1gâj</xref>). Two important caveats should be noted in interpreting these results in the context of our L5 MCs circuit mapping data: 1) photostimulation in these experiments activates X98 cells both in L5 and L2/3, and 2) the cells labeled in X98-ChR2 represent a population that is different from the population labeled by the GIN line, which might be expected to exhibit different connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morishima et al., 2017</xref>).

Our data establish the existence of two subnetworks of SST interneurons that make exquisitely selective and reciprocal interactions with different sets of cortical layers. Optogenetic circuit mapping shows that L5 MCs receive excitatory inputs chiefly from PCs in L2/3 and L5, the primary cortical output layers, while L5 NMCs receive inputs mainly from PCs in L4 and upper L6, the primary input zones for afferent input from the ventral posteromedial thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>). Paired recordings and 2-photon holographic optogenetic interrogation indicate that, in turn, these same SST subtypes selectively inhibit the same PC populations that excite them, at least within L4 and L5. In vivo, NMCs and MCs differentially suppress the activity of specific cortical layers. Thus NMCs and MCs are functionally segregated into two distinct networks with selective and complementary laminar connectivity, and functional impacts in the awake brain. Transcriptome profiling further suggests that SST neurons break down into as many as 10 sub-clusters that might compose unique neocortical inhibitory microcircuits. More specifically, our data point to a transcriptionally distinct subset of SST neurons (referred to here at âNMCsâ but marked by the selective expression of the gene <italic>Hpse</italic>) that powerfully controls PC activity in Layer 4, potentially gating bottom up input into the cortex. Conversely, several transcriptionally distinct subsets of SST neurons, commonly referred to as âMCsâ, have no direct impact on L4, and instead potently control supragranular and infragranular PCs, the major targets of top down input from other cortical areas.</p><p>These results reveal a previously unknown, striking degree of specificity in the inhibitory cortical wiring diagram. In particular, the observation that L5 NMCs exhibit nearly no intralaminar connectivity with L5 PCs, but do engage in dense, reciprocal connectivity with L4 PCs is inconsistent with the idea of a single, global blanket of SST-mediated inhibition. Instead, SST-PC circuits appear to more closely resemble a patchwork quilt, comprised of multiple networks of SST subtypes which independently modulate separate spatial domains. SST-PC connectivity can be extremely dense and non-selective within one of these domains (e.g. creating a blanket within a single laminar microcircuit), but highly selective on the scale of layers and columns.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional implications of separate, layer-specific SST feedback circuits</title><p>The striking difference in the input and output circuitry of SST subtypes suggested that these two interneuron classes might have different functional effects during sensory processing. Indeed, our Cre-DOG optogenetics experiments demonstrate that MCs nearly exclusively suppress the cortical output layers that they innervate, namely, L2/3 and L5. Conversely, NMCs potently suppress L4, but have a minimal impact on L5 activity. Notably, NMC photo-stimulation did cause a prominent deactivation of L2/3 cells. Since our slice data indicate that NMCs make only weak or infrequent connections onto L2/3 PCs, much of this reduction in L2/3 activity can likely be attributed to a loss of input from L4, which we previously showed is necessary for their sensory response. Nevertheless, a component of this reduction could be due to direct monosynaptic inhibition from NMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work, we showed that direct optogenetic suppression of L4 PCs resulted in deactivation of FS units, and net disinhibition and increased sensory evoked activity of L5 RS units. Based on this work we proposed that L4 PCs exert an inhibitory influence on L5 PCs via a disynaptic circuit in which L4 PCs drive L5 FS cells, which in turn inhibit L5 PCs. Consistent with this, here we saw that FS units in L5 showed strong and consistent deactivation when L4 was suppressed by NMC photostimulation. However, despite this reduction in L5 FS unit activity, we did not observe a net disinhibition across the population of recorded L5 RS units â in fact, somewhat remarkably, despite the major changes in both L4 and L2/3, on average we observed no net change in L5 RS unit activity across the recorded population. We can consider several possible explanations for this seeming discrepancy. Photostimulating NMCs, as we did here, resulted in a much stronger suppression of L4 than we achieved in our previous work with direct optogenetic suppression of L4 PCs. This may be due to the partial efficacy of the silencer eNpHR3.0, together with the fact the the Cre line we use in our previous study for L4 PCs (scnn1ta-tg3-Cre) only labels a fraction of the L4 PC population. Owing to the near complete suppression of L4 PC activity in this study, we also observed a much large deactivation of L2/3 RS units than in our prior study, where L2/3 was only mildly, albeit significantly, impacted. Thus, one possibility is that themuch stronger suppression of L2/3, which should cause a profound reduction in L2/3 to L5 excitatory drive that counteracted the loss of L4-driven disynaptic inhibition. Alternatively, photoactivation of NMCs might cause presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic release at intracortical/thalamocortical synapses onto L5 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015</xref>) or even drive the release of neuropeptides that suppress L5 cells through pre- or post-synaptic mechanisms. Further work is needed to reconcile these results. Our circuit mapping experiments revealed both MCs and NMCs exhibit dense, reciprocal connectivity with specific excitatory populations. Thus, both SST subtypes participate in potent recurrent inhibitory loops that might be critical for network stabilization, gain control, or competitive interactions between neural ensembles within each layer. Interestingly, NMCs and MCs also receive different sources of long-range input: NMCs but not MCs receive direct thalamic input from VPM, whereas MCs are known to receive long-range inputs from primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kinnischtzke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cruikshank et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these circuit features suggest that NMCs and MCs might be specialized to regulate different streams of input to the cortical microcircuit. The major âbottom-upâ pathway to the barrel cortex is the lemniscal thalamocortical projection from VPM which carries spatiotemporally precise exteroceptive signals from the whiskers and which acts as a key driver of cortical activity via its projection to L4 and the L5B/L6 border. By virtue of their dense reciprocal connectivity with L4, as well as their direct connections from VPM (as well as cells at the L5B/L6 border, which are also VPM recipients), NMCs will generate feedback and feedforward inhibition targeted to L4 PCs. This inhibition is likely to occur on slower timescales than PV-mediated inhibition; thus, rather than enforcing temporally precise responses, NMC-mediated inhibition might control amplification of bottom-up sensory signals that is thought to occur in L4. In contrast, MCs will have little effect on the integration of bottom-up signals in L4. However, other important long-range afferents to the barrel cortex, such as those from motor cortices, contralateral S1, and the paralemniscal pathway projection from POm, target the infragranular and supragranular layers (including L1). Inputs from these projections are thought to exert a primarily modulatory effect on barrel cortex activity, and in many cases might carry âtop-downâ signals conveying contextual/predictive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Larkum, 2013</xref>). MCs are positioned to directly influence the integration of these signals, and indeed MC-mediated inhibition is capable of gating dendritic integration of these inputs. The parallel structure of MC and NMC networks could allow S1 to independently gate its sensitivity to top-down inputs without changing its sensitivity to bottom-up inputs, and vice versa. In turn, differential modulation of these SST sub-circuits, either by local or long range excitatory input, by VIP-interneuron mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pi et al., 2013</xref>) or neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Polack and Contreras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>) could represent a mechanism by which the brain dynamically fine-tunes the balance between bottom-up and top-down information during sensory integration.</p><p>The stark differences in the inputs to MCs and NMCs suggest that they will likely exhibit different patterns of activity in vivo. For technical reasons, most studies of SST activity in awake animals have focused on SST cells in superficial cortical layers, which are mostly MCs. These studies have revealed that MCs have unique functional properties. Compared to other cell-types, L2/3 MCs in the barrel cortex are poorly driven or even hyperpolarized by single whisker sensory stimuliÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>), and appear relatively decoupled from spontaneous fluctuations shared by other neurons in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sachidhanandam et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, along with some L5 MCs, L2/3 MCs are suppressed when the cortex enters an active state of arousal, whereas NMCs in L4 and L5 increase their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pala and Petersen, 2018</xref>). These findings are consistent with other studies which have observed that subtypes of SST cells with either wide or narrow spike waveforms (which might correspond to MCs and NMCs) are differentially modulated by changes in arousal, behavior, and rewarding stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in the activity of SST cells have been proposed to perform operations such as adjusting the gain of sensory responses or modulating dendritic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Phillips and Hasenstaub, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murayama et al., 2009</xref>); SST sub-circuits, like the ones described here, would allow for these operations to be applied to specific layers and/or cell-types. A pressing question for future investigation will be to determine how local and long-range connectivity contributes to the unique activity patterns of SST subtypes, and conversely, to determine how distinct SST subtypes differentially shape the dynamics of the cortical microcircuit in different sensory and behavioral contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Diversity of SST cells</title><p>Our physiological data support the notion of at least two major SST subclasses, defined by their input/output connectivity with L4 or L2/3 and L5.

Beyond studies which used the X94 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>), close examination of the literature reveals several reports of cells with L4-targeting morphologies and other properties characteristic of NMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">FairÃ©n et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Helmstaedter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar and Ohana, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Porter et al., 2001</xref>), which have sometimes been called âLorente de NÃ³ cellsâ in attribution to their earliest describer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">FairÃ©n, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lorente de NÃ³, 1992</xref>). The previous lack of genetic tools to target these cells may have hindered detailed investigation of L5 NMCs until now. It is likely that NMCs in all layers have sometimes been misclassified as fast-spiking cells due to their quasi-fast-spiking intrinsic properties, especially in studies done without genetic or immunohistochemical markers for somatostatin and parvalbumin. This issue likely also applies to studies performing in vivo extracellular recordings, since spike waveforms of NMCs are similar to those of parvalbumin-expressing FS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">MuÃ±oz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>L5 NMCs bear striking resemblances to the SST cells in L4 which are also non-Martinotti cells and have sometimes been called âlow-threshold spikingâ or âLTSâ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beierlein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2005</xref>). Compared to L5 NMCs, L4 NMCs have similar morphologies and intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), inhibitory targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), and transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that excitatory synapses onto L5 NMCs exhibited what appeared to be asynchronous EPSCs during sustained high frequency firing in the presynaptic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3c</xref>). Asynchronous release of glutamate is uncommon in cortical circuits; to the best of our knowledge, the only other published observation is at the synapse from L4 PCs onto L4 SST cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>).. Taken together, these similarities suggest that L4 and L5 NMCs are a single cell-type. Due to their lack of intralaminar connectivity, L5 NMCs might be thought of as âectopicâ L4 NMCs; however, the number of NMCs in L5 is likely comparable to or perhaps even greater than the number of L4 NMCs in the barrel cortex. The X94 line labelsÂ ~Â 15% of L5 SST cells, but this is likely a lower bound since this line does not provide complete coverage over L5 NMCs. Biocytin fills of L5 SST-TdT cells revealed that 19/52 cells (37%) possessed NMC morphologies, compared to 31/52 (60%) that possessed MC morphologies and 2/52 that could not be placed in either category. Consistent with this, a support vector machine trained to distinguish L5 GIN cells from L5 Ã 94 cells based on their intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g</xref>) labeled 48% of L5 SST-TdT cells as putative NMCs. However, L5 NMCs often appeared to have larger cell bodies than MCs, which could potentially have made L5 NMCs easier to locate or patch and thereby introduced a bias in this assessment. Nevertheless, we estimate that 15â40% of L5 SST cells are NMCs. L4 and L5 respectively host approximately 10% and 40% of all SST cells in S1, so assuming nearly all L4 SST cells are NMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), we estimate that L4 and L5 NMCs collectively represent roughly 15â25% of all SST cells in S1.</p><p>In this study we relied on four transgenic lines for SST neurons (SST-IRES-Cre, X94, X98 and GIN). Although the latter three GFP lines proved useful, heterogeneity within the GFP<sup>+</sup> population within these lines (particularly the GIN line, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halabisky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGarry et al., 2010</xref>) and our single-cell RNA-seq data imply that they each are likely to label a mixture of what may be functionally distinct SST subtypes, while other subtypes of SST cells are not covered by these lines at all, such as long-range projecting SST cells that are most prevalent in L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, our 2P mapping experiments (using the SST-Cre line) show that cells sampled from the SST population in an unbiased manner connect to L4 or L5 in a mutually exclusive manner; this argues that the distinction between NMCs and MCs is a genuine dichotomy which generalizes to the broader SST population. However, it is certain that these two groups, particularly MCs, can be further subdivided, and examining the connectivity of these finer SST subdivisions will very likely add further nuance to the scheme we describe here. For example, recent work suggests that specific subtypes of MCs receive different amounts of VIP innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MuÃ±oz et al., 2017</xref>). Although we did not observe any obvious specificity in how MC circuits are organized with respect to L5A versus L5B and/or slender-tufted, intratelencephalic PCs versus thick-tufted, pyramidal tract PCs (data not shown), recent evidence suggests that some MC subtypes preferentially connect to L5 PC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morishima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hilscher et al., 2016</xref>). Achieving a full understanding of connectivity and functional interactions among SST and PC subtypes will require a more sophisticated understanding of the taxonomy of cortical cell-types, as well as the development of new genetic tools and circuit mapping methods.</p><p>Taken together, the data in this study establish two new fundamental inhibitory motifs in the cortex: two subnetworks of SST cells that interconnect with specific cortical compartments â the input and output cortical layers, potentially providing a means to fine tune cortical computation in the barrel cortex during different sensory or behavioral demands. Since most cortical regions appear to contain numerous subtypes of SST cells, we hypothesize that similar architectures will be present in other cortical regions, such as primary visual cortex. Consistent with this notion, other studies have shown that subtypes of SST cells with distinct morphologies, molecular and electrophysiological properties, and connectivity exist in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MÃ¼ller and Remy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>). More generally, the approached we employed here to connect the anatomy, physiology, synaptic connectivity and transcriptional profile of specific neuronal subtypes may represent a generalizable strategy to define neuronal subtypes and reveal their unique contributions to brain activity and behavior. With respect to SST neuronsâ role in sensory computation, our data raise the possibility that sub-networks of dendrite-targeted interneurons fine tune the balance between bottom up and top down input in cortical processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Berkeley under protocol AUP-2014-10-6832-1.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Mus musculus)</td><td>Scnn1-tg3-Cre line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#009613</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Mus musculus)</td><td>Emx1-IRES-Cre line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#005628</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Mus musculus)</td><td>PV-IRES-cre line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#008069</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagentÂ (Mus musculus)</td><td>SST-IRES-cre line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#013044</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Mus musculus)</td><td>GIN line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#003718</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>X94-GFP line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#006334</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>X98-GFP</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#006340</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Ai9 Rosa-LSL-tdTomato line</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>#007909</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>AAV9.CAGGS.Flex. <break/>ChR2-tdTomato.WPRE.SV40</td><td>University of Pennsylvania Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>AAV9-2YF-hSyn-DIO-ChrimsonR-mRuby2-Kv2.1</td><td>This lab</td><td/><td>Available atÂ Addgene(Plasmid #105448);Described inÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">PÃ©gard et al.

Slices were placed in a recording chamber and constantly perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (NaCl 119 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub>1.3 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>1.3 mM, glucose 20 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>26 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub>2.5 mM) maintained at 32Â° C (21Â° C for multiphoton mapping experiments).

In some experiments, additional current steps were manually designated and performed online to aid in estimation of rheobase. Resting membrane potential was defined as the median membrane potential during a baseline period measured immediately after break-in. Input resistance was calculated with Ohmâs law using the steady state membrane potential during subthreshold current injections steps (current clamp) and/or the steady state current during 5 mV voltage steps (voltage clamp).

Monosynaptic excitatory connectivity onto SST cells was tested by driving trains of 10 spikes in the presynaptic cell at 70 Hz via current injection, while monitoring for EPSCs in the postsynaptic cell.

However, it was often difficult to visualize X94 cells using these animals due to the TdTomato fluorescence being much brighter than the GFP fluorescence. In other experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2h</xref>), we targeted FS/PV cells in L4 by looking for L4 neurons with large cell bodies under IR, and then confirmed the identity of these cells electrophysiologically, with the primary criteria separating them from being narrow spike widths (slightly shorter than the average NMC spike) and little or no spike frequency accommodation during high amplitude steps of current injection.</p><p>To classify SST-TdT cells as putative NMCs or MCs, we fit a support vector machine (cross validated 10-fold) to perform binary classification of L5 GIN cells and L5 Ã 94 cells using only their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. We found that a classifier based on only two measures (spike width and estimated rheobase) performed just as well as multivariate classification based on a large number of metrics (~85% accuracy).We then used this classifier to predict the identity of a different dataset of L5 SST cells recorded in SST-TdT mice. This approach is likely to have resulted in a small number of SST-TdT cells being misclassified; however, the connectivity of putative NMCs and MCs were highly similar to the connectivity of NMCs and MCs identified using the X94 and GIN lines. Furthermore, our conclusions about the differences in connectivity rates of L5 MCs and NMCs with L4 and L5 PCs are unchanged by the exclusion of the SST-TdT dataset, with the exception of L5PCâL5SST connections â a circuit which has been studied in some detail by others. This approach also effectively assumes a dichotomy in L5 SST cells, since we have only two labels (MC and NMC) to provide as training data, which is an important caveat since it is likely that further subdivisions of SST cells exist in L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). In a handful of cases, we recorded from SST-TdT cells which appeared to be FS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), with very narrow spikes, low input resistances, and a near complete lack of spike-frequency accommodation during high amplitude current injection steps; these neurons were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>Using paired recordings, we tested 544 total possible connections between 146 L5 SST cells (39 L5 GIN cells, 53 L5 Ã 94 cells, 54 L5 SST-TdT cells) and PCs/FS cells in L4 and L5.

This dataset was unbalanced, and because in some cases we tested multiple connections onto the same L5 SST cell, included some non-independent observations. Because of this, we used Monte Carlo permutation tests to test for significant differences between the connectivity rates of MCs and NMCs. We generated a permuted dataset with the same observation structure (same number of L5 SST cells and same number of connections tested per L5 SST cell) in place for MCs and NMCs by randomly resampling with replacement at both levels. We then measured the difference in observed connectivity rate for the MC and NMC groups, and repeated this procedure 100,000 times to generate a null distribution of rate differences.

Prior to photo-stimulation, infrared and epifluorescence images were captured using an IR-1000 CCD camera (DAGE-MTI) and imported into MATLAB.</p><p>Excitatory mapping experiments were performed using a modified version of a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pluta et al., 2015</xref>). Mapping was performed over an area extending from pia to the white matter, covering 2â4 barrel columns laterally (~400 to~800 Âµm). For mapping excitatory inputs to GIN and X94 cells, the DMD was used to pattern light into a square region (75 Âµm x 75 Âµm). Each stimulation site was spaced 40 Âµm apart from adjacent ones, resulting in some overlap of adjacent stimuli. We chose to ârampâ our photostimulation, starting each stimulus with the light off and linearly increasing the light intensity over time. Ramping in this manner minimizes activation of fibers of passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010</xref>). In each trial, a âsawtoothâ light stimulus composed of three successive 25 ms ramps of light (1.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> final intensity) was applied to one stimulus site (unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pluta et al. (2015)</xref>, which used only a single ramp per trial). This protocol was chosen in order to maximize the short-term facilitation of excitatory inputs to L5 SST cells, though in practice we found it was usually possible to observe responses during the first ramp alone. Ten regions were stimulated per second in a serial, pseudorandom order, with 4 s breaks after every 10 s of mapping. Control experiments were performed using identical stimulation conditions while recording from ChR2<sup>+</sup> neurons in all layers. These experiments determined the spatial resolution of photostimulation and confirmed that spiking was elicited in ChR2Â +neurons only when regions very close to the soma were stimulated. We also included nÂ =Â 2 experiments mapping inputs to L5 Ã 94 cells which were performed using the exact mapping protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pluta et al. (2015)</xref>, though our results and conclusions were not substantially altered by their exclusion.</p><p>All data were analyzed using custom written MATLAB software. Data preprocessing consisted of removing baseline offsets and slow fluctuations from recordings by subtracting a down-sampled and median-filtered versions. Charge was calculated as the integral of the preprocessed recordings during photo-stimulation and the subsequent 25 milliseconds. To aggregate maps across cells, we first rotated the average map collected in each experiment in order to horizontally orient the laminar boundaries of the mapped area. Maps were next translated vertically to align the L4-L5 laminar boundary, and translated horizontally to align either the home column or the soma position of the recorded cell, before being horizontally cropped to an areaÂ Â±300 Âµm of their center and then averaged to yield a summary map. For the average map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3k</xref>, we first binarized each input map by performing a permutation test comparing the excitatory charge evoked at each stimulus site to the charge observed during baseline periods. This yielded a binary map showing which stimulus sites evoked significant amounts of charge (after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). We then averaged these maps together as described above.</p><p>For L4 stimulation experiments, we used widefield photostimulation through a 5x objective. We used two stimulation protocols: prolonged, 1 s ramps of linearly increasing light intensity and trains of ten pulses (1 ms duration) at 40 Hz. We stimulated at four different intensities for each protocol. Since we sometimes recorded multiple neurons in the same slice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we fit generalized linear mixed effects models to the dose-response function of light-intensity versus evoked response (EPSC charge transfer or number of spikes), with fixed effects coefficients for the slope of this function for each cell-type and random effects slope coefficients for each slice and neuron in the dataset as well as a constant intercept term. F-tests were used to test for differences in fixed effects coefficients. For paired analysis of L4 NMCs and L5 MCs/NMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), paired t-tests were used to test for differences in L4-evoked responses at maximum stimulus intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Two-photon CGH-based inhibitory output mapping</title><p>Laser light was generated using a 5W 1040 nm femtoTrain laser (Sepctra-Physics) and power was modulated on short time scales using a Pockels cell (Conoptics) and a high speed shutter (UniBlitz). Light was delivered to the sample using a VIVO 2- Photon workstation (3i) based on a Sutter Moveable Objective Microscope (Sutter) and the hologram was created using a Phasor 2-Photon computer-generated holography system (3i) with Slidebook software (3i) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). The holograms used for stimulation were 2D discs of diameter 15 um centered on points with 20 um spacing, making a 400 um x 400 um grid in the focal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1b,c</xref>). Stimulation consisted of 4 or 10 ms square pulses to the Pockels cell with voltages calibrated to produce 200 or 250 mW average power on sample, respectively. The choice of 4 ms at 200 mW or 10 ms at 250 mW stimulation was determined slice to slice based on opsin expression. Power for each hologram was calibrated empirically to account for power loss due to diffraction efficiency degradation away from the zero-order of the SLM. There was an inter-trial interval of 100 ms between the end of one stimulation and the start of the next stimulation. Under these conditions, SST cells spiked reliably and with high radial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c,d</xref>) and moderate axial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1f,g</xref>). Given the sparsity of SST neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), this level of spatial resolution provided a good tradeoff between sampling many cells with fewer targets and spiking cells with high spatial resolution. In addition, reliably evoked spikes were produced with low latency and jitter when stimulating randomly through the target grid at 10 Hz. Under these conditions, most evoked spikes occurred in the first 20 ms after the onset of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1e,h</xref>).</p><p>Space clamp error will inevitably affect somatic measurements of currents from distally located SSTâPC synapses; however, we recorded IPSCs using a cesium-based internal solution (which included the ion channel blockers tetraethylammonium and QX-314) and performed experiments at room temperature, which ameliorate this to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</xref>). We also used a holding potential ofÂ +40 mV to increase the IPSC driving force. In these experiments, internal solutions also contained 5 Î¼M Alexa 488 hydrazide (ThermoFisher Scientific) to aid visualization with multiphoton imaging, andÂ ~5 mM kynurenic acid Sodium salt (abcam) was added to the external ACSF to block glutamatergic activity.</p><p>To determine which locations evoked responses in the voltage-clamp recordings, first we detected IPSCs using a Bayesian modeling approach via Gibbs sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Merel et al., 2016</xref>). To obtain point estimates IPSC times from the posterior distribution over IPSC times, we binned the IPSC time samples for each trial at 1 ms resolution to create a posterior timeseries of when IPSCs were likely occurring. We then threshholded those timeseries (using <italic>findpeaks</italic> in MATLAB) to compute point estimates of IPSC times. Because the vast majority of evoked spikes recorded from opsin expressing SST cells occurred with short latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c,f</xref>), we estimated the evoked rate at each location from a 30 ms time window starting 5 ms after the onset of each stimulation and the background rate of IPSCs for each patched cell from the last 25 ms of all inter-trial intervals. Taking a Poisson distribution with the estimated background rate as the null distribution for all locations for each cell, we could then calculate a p-value for the hypothesis that there are no evoked IPSCs each location (i.e. there is no increase in IPSC rate). We then detected locations with evoked responses using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Detection Rate (FDR) procedure with qÂ =Â 0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). We chose this relatively liberal FDR rate because any false positives will likely be thrown out after the temporal statistics are taken into account.</p><p>To determine if a location with evoked rates in both simultaneously patched cells was in fact a common input from a single source, we employed a statistical test that compares a computed synchrony statistic against a null distribution computed from resampled event time series. Specifically, the test we use employs a null distribution where all synchrony is a result of processes at timescales longer than some given duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amarasingham et al., 2012</xref>). The intuition is that the chosen duration should match the general timing of evoked IPSCs such that any synchrony under this null arises only because IPSCs across cells are being generated by two separate presynaptic SST cells stimulated on the same trials. When we reject this null, we have evidence that the synchrony is coming from a process that operates at a finer timescale than the general evoked IPSC statistics: that is, a single presynaptic SST cell is generating highly time-locked IPSCs in two postsynaptic PCs such that the across-trial-within-cell variance of IPSC times is greater than the within-trial-across-cell IPSC times. In our case, the duration of the timescale we want to test against can be estimated from both the timing statistics of evoked spiking of SST cells as wells as the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) of IPSCs for all trials at all detected input locations across all PC input maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1e,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2g</xref>). Using these statistics as guidance, we chose 10 ms as the timescale for our null distribution. In detail, we first summarize the synchrony of events between two simultaneously patched cells at each location where both cells receive input. The statistic we use to quantify synchrony is the sum of the center and two flanking bins of the cross correlation of the binary event time series for simultaneously recorded cells. We then created a null distribution for this statistic at each of these locations using the event series resampling described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amarasingham et al. (2012)</xref> which allowed us to estimate a p-value for each location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2h,i,j,k</xref>). We then detected common spatiotemporal input using these p-values and the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure with qÂ =Â 0.05, aggregating all tests across all paired maps. The common input probability for a simultaneously patched pair could then be computed as the total number of detected common input locations for that pair divided by the total number of unique detected input locations for the pair (i.e. the cardinality of the union of the sets of input locations for the two cells).</p><p>To align the input maps across cells, we first aligned each input map to a two-photon image of the tissue taken at the time of recording based on previous calibrations between the SLM coordinate frame (e.g. the input map frame) and the two-photon imaging frame. Next, the tissue-aligned maps were then registered via an affine transform to a confocal image of the fixed slice which had been stained with DAPI and in which the opsin expressing cells could be visualized as well as the patched cells which had been filled with biocytin. This allowed each map to be registered to each other based on the laminar borders, in particular the L4-L5 boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Biocytin staining and reconstruction</title><p>Following experiments, slices were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â° for several days.

Slices were then washed again and mounted/DAPI-stained on coverslips using VectaShield.</p><p>Stained neurons were imaged on a confocal microscope, along with the DAPI signal in order to identify laminar boundaries. These images allowed us to qualitatively assess whether recorded cells were L1-targeting MCs or L4-targeting NMCs.

We imaged neurons using a 10x air objective and used the Imaris software package to automatically trace filled neurites. Subsequently, we manually edited these traces and annotated layer boundaries. These reconstructions did not distinguish between axon and dendrite and contained small scale errors (e.g. neurites passing near each other were sometimes spuriously connected). However, comparison of semi-automated reconstructions with detailed 3D reconstructions (performed manually in Imaris, after imaging with a 60x oil immersion objective and/or a 20x air objective) showed that the semi-automated approach yielded an accurate measurement of neurite density in each layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Animals were perfused with 10 mL cold PBS followed by 15 mL 4% PFA.

An additional ninth position that did not contact the whiskers was used to compute non-contact evoked firing rates. The horizontal distance between adjacent stimulus positions was 5.3 mm. Most mice habituated quickly to the presentation of the tactile stimulus assessed by lack of a change in whisking or running speed during stimulus presentation.

Waveforms were first clustered automatically using KlustaKwik and then manually corrected to meet criteria for further analysis. With the exception of eight burst-firing units, included units had no more than 3% of their individual waveforms violating a refractory period of 2 ms. Individual units were classified as either fast-spiking or regular spiking using a k-means cluster analysis of spike waveform components. Since the best separation criterion was the trough-to-peak latency of the large negative-going deflection and clustering is nondeterministic, we defined all units with latencies shorter than 0.36 ms as fast-spiking and all units with latencies larger than 0.38 ms as regular-spiking. Cells with intermediate latencies were excluded from further analysis. Putative ChR2-expressing cells were identified by dramatic increases in spike rates to blue-light stimulation. The depth of each unit was assigned based on the calculated depth of the electrode on the array that exhibited its largest amplitude-sorted waveform.

Five to seven micron optical sections were imaged at 20x using a Zeiss LSM 880 and filters for Alexa 488, Atto 550, Atto 647 and DAPI using Zen software. Z-projections and signal thresholding were performed in FIJI, using the Cell Counter plugin to record marks from manual cell counting calls. Co-expression spatial profiles are presented as a cell frequency table as triple positive as compared to double-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) or rastered on a common anatomy reference to bin normalized counts of cluster classifier+/tdTomato+ (as compared to total tdTomato+) by their laminar position within S1 cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Code availability</title><p>All the code used for the analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/drisso/x94">https://github.com/drisso/x94</ext-link>Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Risso, 2019</xref>: copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/x94">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/x94</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Ariel Agmon (West Virginia University) for generously providing X94 mice.

Ideally, one would want to normalize by both the number and firing rates of activated neurons (see e.g. Hooks et al., 2011). Our goal in recording evoked spikes from ChR2+ excitatory cells was primarily to assess the spatial precision of our optogenetic stimulation rather than systematically measure the amount of spikes evoked by neurons in each layer. Normalizing by our recorded firing rates changes the strength of inputs dramatically â for example, the relative strength of inputs from L2/3 vs L4 are adjusted by an order of magnitude. We do not believe this accurately portrays the structure of these circuits. For example, the normalized data would suggest that L2/3 provides a stronger input to L5 NMCs than L4, but virtually no sites in L2/3 (except for those near the L4 border) actually had observable evoked EPSCs in NMC mapsâ suggesting that we are dramatically amplifying noise through this normalization. It is also at odds with our own unpublished observations from experiments expressing ChR2 specifically in L2/3 pyramidal cells (using the Drd3-Cre line) while recording from NMCs and MCs in L5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Using this approach we found that L2/3 drives strong responses in L5 MCs, but produces very little responses in L5 NMCs. This contrasts quite strongly with what we saw when we optogenetically activated L4 excitatory cells (see Figure 2) and indicates that the L4 input to L5 NMCs is indeed much stronger than the L2/3 input, as our maps in Figure 1 would suggest.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43696-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>To address the second point about whether short-term facilitation of glutamatergic inputs substantially affected the excitatory inputs we observed, we conducted further analysis on the excitatory currents by comparing the responses for the first, second, and third photo-stimulus in each train of brief (50 ms) light ramps we delivered (see Materials and methods). We might expect that the excitatory output of layers with high light-evoked firing rates would grow relatively stronger over time within a single trial since their synapses would facilitate more than those from layers with lower firing rates. For example, we would expect that inputs to L5 NMCs from L4 neurons (in which we observed high firing rates) would facilitate more than inputs from L5 or L6. However, we do not see any obvious change in the relative strength of inputs from different layers if we separately analyze the evoked EPSCs during different time windows in the stimulus train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43696-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Although we cannot fully explain why this is the case, one possibility is that the site-to-site variance in our maps is mainly driven by differences in the number of connected presynaptic neurons that are recruited per trial, instead of by the number of spikes or synaptic dynamics of these neurons.</p><p>In light of the above considerations, rather than normalizing our maps we have opted to include a new analysis in which we perform multiple-comparisons corrected significance testing on stimulated sites to create binary maps showing sites with/without significant evoked responses. The population averages of these maps (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3k) show a picture that is consistent with our previous interpretations, though inputs from the lower layers are relatively more prominent; this is likely because the ceiling effect produced by this procedure limits the contribution of sites with many and/or highly active presynaptic neurons to the population average. We have also amended the text in paragraph two of subsection âTwo distinct sub-networks of SST neurons defined by layer-specific connectivityâ to make note of some of the caveats of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B: Should be GOhm, not MOhm</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6:</p><p>For each cell, it will be helpful to conduct a paired test to examine whether its firing rate was significantly modulated by optogenetic stimulation, and reflect the results in E and G.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted paired tests for each unit recorded, and find that this does reflect the results in E and G â the sign and laminar distributions of significantly modulated units are in agreement with the population level effects we show in Figure 6F and H.

This inconsistency should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. There are several possible explanations, several of which we have now raised in the text. These include the much stronger reduction in L2/3 activity observed when photo-stimulating NMCs as compared to optogenetically suppressing L4 excitatory cells, which would simultaneously remove much more of the excitatory input to L5 PCs. Further experiments are needed. We have expanded our discussion of this discrepancy and separated it into its own paragraph, see paragraph three of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L5A differs from L5B. It would be worth making this distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important distinction. Most notably, the L5 sublaminae are preferentially composed of two different classes of PCs: Type A/ thick-tufted (TT) PCs, which are often Intrinsic Bursting and are enriched in L5B, and Type B/slender-tufted (ST) PCs, which are Regular Spiking and are enriched in L5A. TT and ST cells exhibit myriad differences, including differences in their excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. We believe that this heterogeneity is unlikely to impact our conclusions about NMC circuitry, since our data indicate that NMCs are minimally connected with any kind of L5 pyramidal cell. However, it could very likely play a major role in the organization of MC circuitry. We conducted further analyses to see if our data could speak to this possibility.</p><p>We recorded from both TT and ST PCs during our paired recording experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, panel A), and did not attempt to preferentially record from either type. Unfortunately, because the fine axons of SST cells are difficult to recover with biocytin staining, we usually filled only the SST cells to limit the amount of background biocytin signal. Consequently, we did not directly observe the dendritic morphology of most of the L5 PCs that we recorded from in these experiments. However, in paired recordings where the L5 PC was patched using potassium-based internal solution, we characterized its intrinsic properties via current injections. ST PCs are known to exhibit spike-frequency adaptation in response to prolonged current injection, whereas many TT PCs initially fire bursts or doublets of spikes before transitioning into a regular-spiking pattern that is largely non-adapting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, panel B) (Agmon and Connors, 1992; Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990; Hattox and Nelson, 2007; Schubert et al., 2001). Accordingly, we reanalyzed our data and categorized our L5 PCs into putative ST PCs and putative TT PCs based on the presence or absence of burst firing, as well as on the adaptation index (see Materials and methods) of their spike trains in the last 500ms of a 1000ms current injection. We observed connectivity between MCs and both adapting (putative ST) and non-adapting (putative TT) PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, panel C). We did not observe significant differences between these groups in terms of MCâPC connectivity, nor in PCâMC connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, panel D), though we note that splitting our data means we are likely underpowered, particularly for PCâMC connectivity.</p><p>Our new Cre-DOG optogenetic experiments also provide some insight on this question, specifically regarding MC outputs onto L5 PCs. In slice experiments, we regularly filled pyramidal neurons (see Figure 5C) while optogenetically activating MCs (in GIN-ChR2 or X98-ChR2 mice) or NMCs in X94-ChR2 mice. In cases where the dendritic morphology of L5 PCs was recovered, we classified cells as TT or ST and examined their IPSC responses to photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, panel E). Photostimulation in X94-ChR2 mice resulted in little response in either ST or TT cells, consistent with a lack of NMC connectivity onto L5 PCs at large. Photostimulation in GIN-ChR2 mice drove responses of similar magnitude in ST and TT cells. In X98-ChR2 mice, we were unfortunately able to recover only a relatively small fraction of PC morphologies (due to a damaged slide), but the responses of identified TT cells were similar to the responses of unidentified L5 PCs, which likely included both ST and TT cells.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43696.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Connectivity of MCs and NMCs with L5 PC subtypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Post-hoc confocal image showing biocytin fills from two paired recording experiments in connections were tested between an NMC and an ST L5 PC (left) and between an NMC and a TT L5 PC (right).

We do not see evidence for MCs preferentially connecting to TT or ST PCs in our data, nor for optogenetic activation of MCs/NMCs differentially affecting L5A vs L5B. However, this does not mean that the heterogeneity of PCs in the L5 sublaminae does not play an important role in the organization of these circuits. Indeed, the picture emerging from recent literature suggests that parsing the heterogeneity of both PCs and MCs will be crucial to understanding these circuits. Several lines of evidence suggest that there are at least two subtypes of MCs present in L5, and likely more (Tasic et al., 2016, Ma et al., 2006, Munoz et al., 2017). The Kullander labâs work indicates that the L5 MCs labeled by the Chrna2-Cre line preferentially target TT pyramidal cells (Hilscher et al., 2017). Since this line appears to label a subpopulation of MCs in L5 (which might correspond to the âT-shapedâ MCs described in Munoz et al., 2017), one possibility is that L5 contains different subtypes of MCs which preferentially connect with PC subtypes. This notion is supported by a recent study in rat frontal cortex which found strong associations between L5 MC heterogeneity and connectivity with L5 PC subtypes (Morishima et al., 2017), suggesting that different subtypes of L5 MCs might exist which preferentially connect to either ST or TT PCs.</p><p>Because our data probably do not speak definitively to specificity at this level, we have opted not to include them in the manuscript. However, we have added text making this distinction more clearly to the Discussion and Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L4 also contains NMCs that receive input from L4 excitatory neurons and inhibit L4. Can one think of L5 NMCs as 'displaced' L4 NMCs? L4 and L5 NMCs share connectivity and gene expression patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the evidence strongly supports the idea that L5 NMCs and L4 NMCs are the same cell-type â we previously discussed this in the supplementary text. While it is not inaccurate to describe L5 NMCs as being âdisplacedâ or âectopicâ L4 NMCs, we estimate that the number of L5 NMCs in the barrel cortex is comparable to or perhaps even greater than the number of L4 NMCs. We have added new text and incorporated what was previously supplementary text discussing this into subsection âDiversity of SST cellsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C â it would be of interest to separately show axon and dendrite density.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed manual reconstructions distinguishing axon and dendrite for only 2 MCs and 2 NMCs (currently shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1); the remainder of our reconstructions were done automatically and without distinguishing axon from dendrite (see Materials and methods), though the large majority (~90%) of the neurite density shown in Figure 1C comes from axonal arborizations. This was a deliberate decision on our part; although the automatic reconstructions are slightly less accurate than manual ones and do not make this (admittedly important) distinction between axon and dendrite, they are far less time-consuming and allowed us to collect data on a larger sample of neurons. Furthermore, during this project we became aware of another study (now published, Nigro et al., 2018) which performed detailed morphological analysis of MCs and NMCs. We have made changes to the text to make these details explicit and to call more attention to this study and others which have previously characterized the morphology of these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do NMCs receive excitatory input showing short-term synaptic facilitation (presumably the MCs do)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, excitatory synapses onto NMCs exhibit prominent short-term facilitation, similar to MCs. A quantification of this is currently shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B. Work from the Agmon and Connors groups has previously characterized excitatory synapses onto NMCs in some detail â we have added new citations to the Results to point the reader specifically to these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the current in vivo L5 data in the context of previously published L2/3 GIN &amp; SST data (Lee et al., 2012; Gentet et al., 2012; Sachidhanandam et al., 2016; Munoz et al., 2017; Pala and Petersen, 2018).</p> </disp-quote><p>We have added new text discussing these studies to the final paragraph of subsection âFunctional implications of separate, layer-specific SST feedback circuitsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âSST subtypes drive layer-specific effects during active sensationâ: &quot;NMC photostimulation caused little to no in the activity of the L5 RS and L6 RS populations&quot; should probably read &quot;NMC photostimulation caused little to no change in the activity of the L5 RS and L6 RS populations&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
