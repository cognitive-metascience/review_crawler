sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA (ADAR1) isoforms neutralize the immunostimulatory activity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by converting adenosine to inosine (i.e., A-to-I editing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">George et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tomaselli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Patterson and Samuel, 1995</xref>). ADAR1 alters the RNA coding sequence, because I is read as G, and it also destabilizes dsRNA because A:U base pairs are disrupted than I:U mismatches. These modifications by ADAR1 suppress the cellular responses to dsRNA and prevent to type I IFN production. There are three mammalian ADAR genes (ADAR1-3), but only ADAR1 isoforms p110 and p150 and ADAR2 have deaminase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tomaselli et al., 2015</xref>). The IFN inducible ADAR1 p150 isoform (subsequently ‘p150’) is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, while the constitutive ADAR1 p110 (an N-terminal truncated isoform translated from a shorter mRNA initiated at a downstream promoter in <italic>ADAR1</italic>) and ADAR2 are mostly nuclear. Mutations of <italic>ADAR1</italic> result in the severe, sometimes lethal, childhood neurodevelopmental disease, Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rice et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, ADAR1 can be either pro-viral or anti-viral depending on the virus-host cell context (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">George et al., 2014</xref>]). The antiviral effects are due to hyper-editing and mutagenesis of viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samuel, 2011</xref>). Proviral effects are due in part to editing of viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong and Lazinski, 2002</xref>) and/or to destabilizing dsRNA resulting in suppression of dsRNA-signaling through MDA5 and MAVS to type I IFN genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Accordingly, mutation of either MDA5 or MAVS rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype of <italic>Adar1</italic> knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pestal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liddicoat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mannion et al., 2014</xref>). ADAR1 also antagonizes the IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase, PKR, presumably by altering the structure of dsRNA and thereby preventing both PKR activation and phosphorylation of its substrate protein, eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samuel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gélinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). However, whereas effects of ADAR1 on PKR activity have been extensively studied, ADAR1 effects on another IFN-regulated dsRNA-activated antiviral pathway, the oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS-RNase L) system, have not been described. OAS isoforms (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3) are IFN inducible enzymes that sense dsRNA and produce 2’,5’-oligoadenylates (2-5A) which activate RNase L to degrade viral and host single-stranded RNAs leading to apoptosis and inhibition of virus growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silverman and Weiss, 2014</xref>). Here we report that whereas <italic>ADAR1</italic> single gene KO A549 cells were not viable, it was possible to rescue <italic>ADAR1</italic> deficient cells by knockout (KO) of either <italic>RNASEL</italic> or <italic>MAVS</italic> or by expression of a viral antagonist of the OAS/RNase L system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silverman and Weiss, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that the RNase L activation is the primary mode of cell death induced by either endogenous or exogenous dsRNA.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25687.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DsRNA induced antiviral pathways.</title><p>DsRNA can be destabilized by ADAR1 activity. In the absence of ADAR1 dsRNA can be recognized by (1) MDA5 leading to IFN production; (2) OAS leading to activation of RNase L and eventually translational inhibition and apoptosis and (3) PKR leading to inhibition of translation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25687.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25687.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25687-fig1-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNase L activity is the major pathway leading to dsRNA-induced cell death</title><p>Before assessing the role of ADAR in regulating the RNase L pathway we compared the roles of MAVS, RNase L and PKR in mediating dsRNA induced cell death in A549 cells. Thus we used lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide (sg)RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) to construct A549 cell lines with disruption of genes encoding each of these proteins, <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO, <italic>MAVS</italic> KO, <italic>PKR</italic> KO cells as well as <italic>MAVS-RNASEL</italic> double knockout (DKO). Disruption of each gene and protein expression in the absence or presence of IFN-α was confirmed by sequence analysis and Western immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The various A549 mutant cell lines were characterized for their sensitivity or resistance to exogenous dsRNA by poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC) transfection as compared to wild type (WT) A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We initially transfected WT A549 and KO with a range of concentrations of pIC and at 48 hr post treatment cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Cells lacking RNase L expression were resistant to cell death at treatment with up to 5 µg/ml of pIC while treatment of WT A549 as well as PKR KO or MAVS KO cells with 0.5 µg/ml of pIC promoted cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To obtain a more quantitative measure of cell death as well as to assess the effects of ADAR1 ablation on cell death, we compared the kinetics of pIC-induced cell death with the same set of cells in real time with an IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging System and software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We also observed markers of apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activity) in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). While cells expressing RNase L died by 24–30 hr post treatment, cells ablated for RNase L expression (<italic>RNASEL</italic> KO and <italic>RNASEL-MAVS</italic> DKO) were resistant to pIC induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b&amp;c</xref>). Similarly, <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO or <italic>RNASEL-MAVS</italic> DKO showed accelerated wound healing in monolayer scratch assays compared with <italic>MAVS</italic> KO and WT cells, all of which retained RNase L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). RNase L was previously reported to impair cell migration in these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rath et al., 2015</xref>) as well as to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, the protective effect of <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO was not restricted to A549 cells as human mammary epithelial (HME) cells were also protected from pIC-induced cell death by ablation of RNase L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25687.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Construction of the plasmids for knockout of human ADAR1, MAVS and PKR using CRISPR/Cas9.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25687.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25687.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Genes</th><th valign="top">Primers</th><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Nucleotide sequences (5’−3’)*</th><th valign="top">Targeting <break/>Region</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">ADAR1</td><td valign="top">sgADAR1-4</td><td valign="top">Forward</td><td valign="top">CACCG<bold><italic>TCTGTCAAATGCCATATGGG</italic></bold></td><td valign="top">Exon2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Reverse</td><td valign="top">AAAC<bold><italic>CCCATATGGCATTTGACAGA</italic></bold>C</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">sgADAR1-6</td><td valign="top">Forward</td><td valign="top">CACCG<bold><italic>ACTCAGTTCCTGGAAATGTG</italic></bold></td><td valign="top">Exon2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Reverse</td><td valign="top">AAAC<bold><italic>CACATTTCCAGGAACTGAGT</italic></bold>C</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">MAVS</td><td valign="top">sgMAVS-1</td><td valign="top">Forward</td><td valign="top">CACCG<bold><italic>GAGGGCTGCCAGGTCAGAGG</italic></bold></td><td valign="top">Exon4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Reverse</td><td valign="top">AAAC<bold><italic>CCTCTGACCTGGCAGCCCT</italic></bold>C</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">PKR</td><td valign="top">sgPKR-1</td><td valign="top">Forward</td><td valign="top">CACCG<bold><italic>TAATACATACCGTCAGAAGC</italic></bold></td><td valign="top">Exon1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Reverse</td><td valign="top">AAAC<bold><italic>GCTTCTGACGGTATGTATTA</italic></bold>C</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>*Nucleotides sequences which were used for targeting gene are indicated as bold and italic.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25687.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>ADAR1</italic> KO cells were rescued from <italic>RNASE L</italic> KO or <italic>MAVS</italic> KO but not from WT or <italic>PKR</italic> KO A549 cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) WT, WT-p150 KO, <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO, <italic>RNASEL-ADAR</italic> DKO, <italic>MAVS</italic> KO, <italic>MAVS</italic>-p150 DKO, <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO; (PKR expression was induced 1.6–1.9 fold following IFN treatment in cells expressing ADAR1 and reduced 0.3–0.6 fold in cells deleted for ADAR1 or ADAR1 p150; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>.)

Indeed IFN treatment of ADAR1 KO cells upregulated ISG expression and further induced IFN by endogenous dsRNA in cells lacking expression of both isoforms of ADAR1 (p110 and p150) or ADAR1 p150 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Furthermore, while rRNA remained intact in WT, <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO or <italic>MAVS</italic> KO cells, highly specific and characteristic RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Silverman et al., 1983</xref>) identical to the pattern induced by Sindbis infection of WT A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) were observed by Bioanaylzer in IFN treated ADAR1 p150 KO, <italic>MAVS-ADAR1 p150</italic> DKO, or <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells. (It is important to note that the RNA degradation products observed in IFN-treated <italic>RNASE L-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells are not the characteristic specific RNase L mediated pattern. The nuclease(s) responsible for these non-specific rRNA cleavage products is unknown.) Thus 2-5A was produced and RNase L activated by endogenous RNA even in the absence of MAVS.

However, deletion of MDA5 or MAVS, components of the canonical type I IFN production pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), was shown to overcome the ADAR1 deficiency and allow the viability of mouse embryos, although most of the surviving mice died within the first few days after birth and there were abnormalities in organ development as well as excess IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pestal et al., 2015</xref>). MDA5/MAVS dependent IFN production and signaling involves many pathways and IFN stimulated gene products and it remained unclear which of the these are primary contributors to the death of these embryos, although it has been shown that PKR ablation was unable to rescue either <italic>Adar1</italic> KO mouse embryo lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>While our finding that MAVS KO rescued the lethality of ADAR1 in a human cell system is consistent with the literature on <italic>Adar1</italic> KO in murine systems in vivo and expected, the finding that RNase L ablation rescues the ADAR1 lethality even in the presence of MAVS and normal IFN response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) is unexpected. It is possible that, in the mouse embryo system, RNase L, activated downstream of MDA5-MAVS also contributes to embryonic lethality. However, rescue of lethality due to <italic>Adar1</italic> KO by <italic>Mda5</italic> or <italic>Mavs</italic> KO in the mouse embryo may be due to one or more other MAVS dependent activities. It should be noted that mouse embryo fibroblasts (mef) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mannion et al., 2014</xref>) and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pestal et al., 2015</xref>) can survive <italic>ADAR1</italic> KO. This is likely due to the low levels of OAS expression in these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>) (and data not shown) and in the case of mefs, also a low level of RNase L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The observation that ectopic expression of active RNase L, but not mutant inactive RNase L, promotes death of ADAR1 deficient cells supports the central role of RNase L activation in dsRNA-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Further supporting this conclusion, expression of the MHV PDE, NS2, a potent RNase L antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>), but not its inactive mutant, enables recovery of viable <italic>ADAR1</italic> KO cells while knockdown of NS2 in <italic>ADAR1</italic> KO cells leads to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that RNase L has a predominant role in promoting cell death by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It has been shown recently that RNase L site-specifically cleaves tRNAs and Y-RNAs, and that depletion of the Y-RNA RNY1 contributes to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donovan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to RNase L, and consistent with mouse embryo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), deletion of PKR did not allow recovery of <italic>ADAR1</italic> KO cells and single PKR KO did not change the kinetics of pIC-induced death in cells that contained ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Apparently, PKR (a dsRNA-activated protein kinase that inhibits translation) does not substantially contribute to ADAR1 KO cell lethality. [PKR was activated by pIC in WT A549 cells resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2α, whereas pIC treatment of PKR KO cells did not result in phosphorylated eIF2α, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).] However, it is noted that IFN treatment of ADAR1 deficient cells did not induce PKR expression, in contrast to ADAR1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 2–source data1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 5–source data1</xref>). We do not currently know why this occurs.</p><p>Endogenous cellular dsRNA activates OAS leading to RNase L activity in <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> KO cells as evidenced by rRNA degradation, site-specific tRNA-His cleavage following IFN stimulation, and accumulation of 2-5A in <italic>RNASEL</italic> KO cells, even in the absence of exogenous dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It should be noted that dsRNA is the only well-established activator of OAS enzymatic activity [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silverman and Weiss, 2014</xref> and references therein]. While IFN treatment of <italic>RNASEL-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells produces enhanced expression of IFN-β and -λ, and ISGs, these effects of IFN were reduced in <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells. Our findings suggest that MAVS is likely to augment RNase L activation through the upregulation of IFNs and OASs (which are ISGs), effects that do not require exogenous dsRNA when ADAR1 is deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, although not statistically significant, the accumulation of 2-5A was greater in <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells compared to <italic>MAVS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, deletion of MAVS promotes the viability of A549 cells engineered to lack ADAR1 and upon pIC treatment, the <italic>MAVS</italic> KO cells exhibit a slower rate of cell death than WT A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells die faster than <italic>RNASEL-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells most likely because RNase L can be activated in the former cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and c</xref>). Thus, while the MDA5/MAVS pathway plays a central role in IFN induction and signaling and can upregulate both OAS and PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these data indicate that RNase L can be activated in the absence of MAVS expression in <italic>MAVS-ADAR1</italic> DKO cells by pIC. These results are consistent with our previous findings that activation of RNase L during virus infections does not depend on IFN induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birdwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since RNase L is activated in the absence of ADAR1 editing contributing to cell death, RNase L-induced cell death could potentially contribute to symptoms of the neurodegenerative and inflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome (AGS) in cases with mutation of <italic>ADAR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rice et al., 2012</xref>). In mouse models, mutations of genes responsible for AGS, such as RNase H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pokatayev et al., 2016</xref>) and Trex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2015</xref>), led to self-DNA-mediated activation of cGAS, a protein functionally and structurally similar to OASs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings show that mutation of ADAR1 leads to self-dsRNA activation of one or more OAS isoform resulting in RNase L activity and cell death. We suggest that mutations affecting homologous nucleic acid sensors in the IFN system, cGAS and OAS, both of which produce unusual 2’−5’ internucleotide linkages, lead to AGS although through different signaling pathways. In vivo evidence for the pro-inflammatory role of RNase L was obtained in virus-infected mice where presence of RNase L contributed to secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakrabarti et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Brenda Bass (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have now received comments on your manuscript from three experts in the specific area of ADAR1 biology. All agreed that the work was interesting, well done and in principle suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless the following fairly minor points should be thoroughly addressed via revision.</p><p>1) Because ADAR1 technically belongs to the cytosine deaminase family of enzymes, a more appropriate title would be to substitute adenosine deaminase with the &quot;double stranded RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 in a human cell line&quot;.</p><p>2) ADAR1 activity does not separate dsRNA into single stranded RNA but rather creates partially dsRNA. Please correct in the text and figure.</p><p>3) Please remove the word partially from &quot;partially rescues&quot; in the Abstract and also in the Introduction.</p><p>4) Indicate the source and size of poly IC used.</p><p>5) Please quantify the Western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and comment on the levels of PKR seen in interferon treated cells.</p><p>6) The reviewers agreed that the conclusions derived from this work should be tempered somewhat because results obtained primarily in a single cell line cannot necessary be extrapolated to the intact organism.

Nevertheless the following fairly minor points should be thoroughly addressed via revision.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Because ADAR1 technically belongs to the cytosine deaminase family of enzymes, a more appropriate title would be to substitute adenosine deaminase with the &quot;double stranded RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 in a human cell line&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Title has been changed as suggested.</p><p><italic>2) ADAR1 activity does not separate dsRNA into single stranded RNA but rather creates partially dsRNA. Please correct in the text and figure.</italic> </p><p>We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to shown that ADAR editing produces partially dsRNA rather than ssRNA. We have also changed the wording in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We have stated that ADAR1 “destabilizes dsRNA” in several places in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Please remove the word partially from &quot;partially rescues&quot; in the Abstract and also in the Introduction.</italic> </p><p>This has been done as requested.</p><p><italic>4) Indicate the source and size of poly IC used.</italic> </p><p>The sources of pIC are now indicated in Materials and methods. pIC (1.5-8 kb) was obtained from InvivoGen (see IncuCyte, cell death assay description), and used to obtain the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.

PKR expression, fold induced by IFN treatment over mock treated of various cell types is summarized in the figure legends and the data are shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref> files.</p><p>PKR fails to be induced by IFN treatment in cells with ADAR1 or ADAR1 p150 KO. We do not currently understand why this occurs. We have added to the text; “However, it is noted that IFN treatment of ADAR1 deficient cells did not induce PKR expression, in contrast to ADAR1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We do not currently know why this occurs.</p><p><italic>6) The reviewers agreed that the conclusions derived from this work should be tempered somewhat because results obtained primarily in a single cell line cannot necessary be extrapolated to the intact organism. Because mouse data indicates that the RIG-I/MDA5 is perhaps the primary pathway you could modify your conclusion to indicate that the OAS/RNase L pathway is an important contributor at least in the cell line tested.</italic> </p><p>While Mda5 or Mavs deletion can rescue mouse embryonic lethality, the downstream pathway(s) that mediate lethality are not known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As described above, we have shown that while the OAS-RNase L pathway can be activated by endogenous dsRNA in the absence of MAVS in A549 cells, activation is more robust in the presence of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, explained above in item #7). Thus, RNase L may be the downstream pathway mediating lethality in mouse as well so that <italic>Mavs</italic> or <italic>Mda5</italic> KO leads to diminished RNase L activation and cell death and rescues embryonic lethality. Alternatively, there may be another effector downstream of MDA5/RIG-I-MAVS inducing cell death in mouse embryos. We have now stated in the Discussion; “It is possible that in the mouse embryo system RNase L, activated downstream of MDA5-MAVS also contributes to embryonic lethality. However, rescue of lethality due to <italic>Adar1</italic> KO by Mda5 or <italic>Mavs</italic> KO in the mouse embryo may be due to one or more other MAVS dependent activities.”</p><p><italic>7) Finally, can it be distinguished from the data whether accumulated dsRNA in ADAR1 deficient cells directly activates basal OAS or perhaps a sensed by MDA5 to induce interferon causing a subsequent induction of OAS?</italic> </p><p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, OAS-RNase L can be either activated by dsRNA in a parallel pathway to the canonical MDA5-MAVS IFN induction pathway or as a MAVS dependent pathway. Our data show that RNase L can be activated in MAVS-ADAR1 DKO and MAVS-p150 DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), indicating that MDA5 sensing of endogenous dsRNA is not required for activation of RNase L by endogenous dsRNA. However, MAVS expression (hence MDA5 sensing-MAVS signaling) does enhance RNase L activation presumably by up regulating OAS gene expression. This is supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A (2-5A</xref> induction) and also by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> which show increased up regulation of IFN-λ and OAS2 following IFN treatment of RNase L-ADAR DKO compared to MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells. In the original manuscript, we had discussed the effect of MAVS in enhancing 2-5A production and RNase L activation (tRNA degradation) through up regulation of OAS gene expression and have now added further text to clarify this point; “Thus 2-5A was produced and RNase L activated by endogenous RNA even in the absence of MAVS”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
