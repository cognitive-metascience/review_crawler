Eph receptors usually guide migrations of cells by exclusion from regions expressing Ephrin. In sea urchin embryos, pigmented immunocytes are specified in vegetal epithelium, transition to mesenchyme, migrate, and re-enter ectoderm, distributing in dorsal ectoderm and ciliary band, but not ventral ectoderm. Immunocytes express Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn is expressed throughout dorsal and ciliary band ectoderm. Interfering with expression or function of Sp-Eph results in rounded immunocytes entering ectoderm but not adopting a dendritic form. Expressing Sp-Efn throughout embryos permits immunocyte insertion in ventral ectoderm. In mosaic embryos, immunocytes insert preferentially in ectoderm expressing Sp-Efn. We conclude that Sp-Eph signaling is necessary and sufficient for epithelial insertion. As well, we propose that immunocytes disperse when Sp-Eph enhances adhesion, causing haptotactic movement to regions of higher ligand abundance. This is a distinctive example of Eph/Ephrin signaling acting positively to pattern migrating cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16000.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16000.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16000.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During animal development, numerous cells move around the embryo to form and shape the growing tissues. As these cells move, they are guided to their destination by molecular cues. The embryo’s tissues produce these cues and the cues can either repel or attract migrating cells. Ephrins are a large and well-studied family of proteins that serve as guidance cues and are found on the surface of certain types of cells. Some migrating cells have receptors for Ephrin and are repelled from tissues that contain Ephrin proteins. In these cases, the repulsive interaction between Ephrins and cells with receptors ensures that migrating cells avoid certain locations and reach the correct final destination.</p><p>The sea urchin is an important model organism for studying how animals develop and in particular how genes control animal development. This is in part because these animals can be easily manipulated in the laboratory and are more closely related to animals with backbones than many other model organisms. Sea urchins also have a relatively simple set of genes; many of which are similar to the human form of the gene. In sea urchin embryos, pigmented cells called immunocytes are known to migrate from one region of the embryo to another where they form part of its immune system. However it was not clear what guides this migration.</p><p>Sea urchins produce one type of Ephrin protein and its associated receptor, and now Krupke et al. show that immunocytes carry the receptor for Ephrin and migrate to embryonic tissues that produce high levels of this Ephrin. This finding suggested that the Ephrin is actually attracting the immunocytes to their final destination rather than repelling them. Further experiments supported this idea and revealed that immunocytes that lack the Ephrin receptor fail to enter the right tissue. Similarly, altering the pattern of Ephrin in the embryo’s tissues altered immunocyte migration in a predictable way.</p><p>These findings of Krupke et al. suggest that Ephrin and its receptor have changed their biological functions during evolution of animals. This raises a number of questions for future research including whether the molecular mechanisms used by Ephrin and its receptor to attract immunocytes in sea urchins is the same as that used to repel cells in other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16000.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16000.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>purple sea urchin</kwd><kwd>Strongylocentrouts</kwd><kwd>purpuratus</kwd><kwd>deuterostome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2413-2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008997</institution-id><institution>University of Victoria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-03737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eph receptor signaling commonly excludes migrating embryonic cells from regions of high ligand density; however, in sea urchin embryos pigmented immunocytes are attracted to regions expressing high levels of Ephrin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dispersal of cells from a site of origin to form a predictable pattern throughout an organism is a spectacular demonstration of directed migration, an essential component of the metazoan patterning toolkit. The complex movements of neural crest or the extensions of central nervous system axons are familiar vertebrate examples that are brought about by a relatively small number of cellular mechanisms. Attraction to a chemical source, permissive substrates, and mechanisms of exclusion or repulsion appear to the principal means of controlling even complex cell migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In many situations Ephrin and Eph are important components of the signaling that regulates migration of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pasquale, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Henkemeyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poliakov et al., 2004</xref>). Eph receptors are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by cell surface ligands, Ephrins. Ephrins are bound to membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage (Ephrin A) or a transmembrane domain (Ephrin B). The receptors and ligands are found throughout metazoans and they are thought to accompany the evolution of multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tischer et al., 2013</xref>). Vertebrate receptors and ligands are diverse with as many as 16 Eph receptors and 8 Ephrins. The principal developmental functions of Eph/Ephrin signaling include defining tissue domains and guiding migrating cells or growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cayuso et al., 2015</xref>). In the best-understood models, Eph receptors repulse cells from regions expressing Ephrin, or with reverse signaling, where ligand bearing cells respond to receptor binding, Ephrin-expressing cells are repulsed from cells expressing Eph receptors. Eph and Ephrins regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and often integrate activity of other receptor ligand systems to coordinate adhesive and migratory responses to the environment of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashaw and Klein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bush and Soriano, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates Eph and Ephrins have complex patterns of expression and interaction, which complicates functional studies. Genomic studies of sea urchins reveal that there is a single Eph receptor (Sp-Eph) and a single Ephrin ligand (Sp-Efn), making them an attractive model for studies of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whittaker et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, urchins are basal deuterostomes, so they provide an opportunity to study the range of morphogenetic mechanisms employed by embryos that share a common ancestor with vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drescher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellott and Burke, 2008</xref>). In <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, embryos express Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn in two overlapping domains of ectoderm and Eph/Ephrin signaling appears to have a role in morphogenesis of the ciliary band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krupke and Burke, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pigmented immunocytes are a well-studied cell lineage in urchin embryos because of their distinctive reddish granules and their early specification within the nested rings of endomesodermal cells in the vegetal plate. Specification of pigmented immunocyte precursors begins in cleavage stages when micromeres express Delta, which initiates Notch-mediated specification of a non-skeletogenic mesoderm domain in an adjacent ring of veg2-derived blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sweet et al., 2002</xref>). This domain is first demarcated by expression of the transcription factor glial cells missing (GCM), which is critical to the specification of pigmented immunocytes in the dorsal half of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruffins and Ettensohn, 1996</xref>). During gastrulation, the pigmented immunocytes transition to mesenchyme and migrate to the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takata and Kominami, 2004</xref>). Once in the ectoderm the cells adopt a distinctive dendritic form and mediate innate responses to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solek et al., 2013</xref>). Although many aspects of the lineage have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barsi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beeble and Calestani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley and Rast, 2015</xref>), we know little about the dispersal and insertion into epithelium of pigmented immunocytes.</p><p>Here we report immunocyte precursors express the receptor, Sp-Eph, while migrating over a gradient of Sp-Efn ligand on the basal surfaces of dorsal ectodermal cells. Manipulations of Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn concentrations reveal that suppression of Sp-Eph signaling interferes with insertion of immunocytes into the ectoderm. Altering ligand concentration indicates that pigmented immunocytes are more likely to insert in ectoderm expressing high levels of Sp-Efn. We propose Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn function initially in the dispersion of immunocytes precursors, and subsequently they are necessary for the insertion of mesenchyme into epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunocyte migration</title><p>Pigmented immunocytes of sea urchin embryos arise in the vegetal mesoderm and begin to transition from epithelium to mesenchyme during the initial phase of archenteron invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruffins and Ettensohn, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

The reticles were positioned so that they included only ectodermal cells and their associated cytonemes. The mean intensity per pixel within each rectangle was determined and the values were normalized to a percentage of the most posterior sample. The mean value for each region and S.E.M. were calculated and plotted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16000.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16000.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16000-fig1-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Sp-Efn is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm and ciliary band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupke and Burke, 2014</xref>). A more detailed examination of the ligand indicates an apparent correlation between the relative fluorescence, or immunoreactivity of ectoderm expressing Sp-Efn and the distribution of pigmented immunocytes. Sp-Efn is not expressed in ventral ectoderm, but is expressed in the ciliary band and dorsal ectoderm and it appears to be most abundant at the tips of the larval arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Measurements of fluorescence intensity per pixel in 5 evenly spaced quadrants along the axis from the animal pole domain to the vertex indicate that there is a gradient of Sp-Efn abundance in the dorsal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These observations show a correlation in the distribution of pigmented immunocytes and the abundance of Sp-Efn, suggesting a role for Sp-Efn in localization of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sp-Efn is expressed on cytonemes</title><p>Fixation with PEM, a buffer designed to stabilize cytoskeletal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vielkind and Swierenga, 1989</xref>) results in immunolocalization of Sp-Efn on the basal surface of ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to small cytoplasmic granules, Sp-Efn is abundant on long, thin projections that radiate into the blastocoel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Notably, fixation with ice-cold methanol, or buffered formaldehyde solutions, localizes Sp-Efn to dorsal ectodermal cells, but does not preserve the basal processes. Localization with apical markers, spectrin or actin, and DIC imaging to establish the position of the basal surface, confirms that Sp-Efn is abundant on processes radiating into the blastocoel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–J</xref>).

Soluble Ephrins have been shown to function as competitive inhibitors and details of receptor activation indicate that clustering is an essential part of the activation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Himanen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seiradake et al., 2010</xref>). Our data show that Sp-Efn is abundant on cytonemal processes on the basal surfaces of dorsal ectodermal cells. This is a distinctive mechanism of Ephrin presentation and may indicate that the epithelial cells could expand their range of Ephrin signaling by distances of up to 15 µm from the cell surface. An implication of this manner of ligand presentation is that cells within the length of cytonemes could potentially activate receptors on a pigmented immunocyte without making direct contact with the cell – a form of paracrine signaling. Live imaging indicates that immunocytes migrate from the vegetal plate and contact the basal surface of the ectoderm as they migrate. Presentation of Ephrin on cytonemes suggests an active presentation of ligand in a context where immunocyte precursors move through a shag carpet of Ephrin. However, at this time there is no experimental evidence supporting a need for Sp-Efn expression on cytonemes in order for it to function. Cytonemes on the ectoderm of sea urchin embryos may have additional roles in presentation of ligands and receptors.</p><p>Thin filopodia have not previously been termed cytonemes in sea urchin embryos. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews (1897)</xref> described filopodia on the basolateral membranes of the epithelial cells of blastulae of sea urchin embryos that extend, retract, branch and fuse. He suggested that the processes are connections between blastomeres and provided cytoplasmic continuity. The existence of these fine processes was confirmed with phase contrast imaging, time-lapse, and transmission EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dan, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gustafson, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vacquier, 1968</xref>). The filopodia of blastomeres were suggested to function in cell adhesion or to maintain cytoplasmic continuity of blastomeres. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al. (1995)</xref> described ectodermal filopodia using DIC optics and noted that they are shorter and less abundant than filopodia of mesenchyme. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McClay (1999)</xref> distinguished thin filopodia from other forms of filopodia and emphasized the potential role they may have as structures detecting patterning information. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, thin filopodia have been demonstrated to be involved in signaling; either in presentation of ligands or receptors, and are distinguished by calling them cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramirez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>). Numerous examples of signaling are now known to involve the subset of filopodia called cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradilla and Guerrero, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). The demonstration that thin ectodermal filopodia of sea urchin embryos present the ligand Sp-Efn indicates that they are cytonemes that function in presentation of patterning information.</p><p>The expression of Sp-Eph on pigmented immunocyte precursors, the expression of Sp-Efn on basal cytonemes, and the pattern of abundance of Sp-Efn provide a strong correlative basis for the hypothesis that Eph/Ephrin signaling is a component of the mechanisms determining the distribution of pigmented immunocytes. The principal effect of suppressing expression of Sp-Eph or inhibiting Eph kinase function is the pigmented immunocytes not adopting a characteristic dendritic morphology. The treatments result in a small increase the number of pigmented immunocyte precursors in the blastocoel, which suggests attachment to the ectoderm is independent of Eph/Ephrin signaling. Suppressing expression of Sp-Eph or inhibiting Eph kinase function results in a 20% reduction in the number of pigmented immunocytes in 72 hr embryos. There is no difference in the number of pigmented immunocytes at 48 hr when Eph is either knocked down or inhibited and activated caspase-3 and morphological indications of apoptosis occur in a small proportion of the immunocytes. As well, apoptosis appears to occur relatively late in the process of immunocyte migration (72 hr) and is almost completely absent in control embryos. We have concluded that the 20% reduction in the number of pigmented immunocytes is in part due to immunocytes becoming apoptotic. If Eph functioned solely as a survival factor selecting among randomly dispersed immunocyte precursors, apoptosis would be detected in control embryos. As well, using Sp1 as a differentiation marker, it is apparent that immunocyte precursors are distributed throughout the dorsal ectoderm before the end of gastrulation, which indicates patterning arises during migration. Although there is a single ligand for Eph in urchins, morpholinos directed at the receptor result in a reduction of pigmented immunocytes, and morpholinos directed at the ligand (SpEphrin) have no effect on cell numbers. This outcome may result from other interactions, both extra- and intra-cellular, with Sp-Eph, or from differences in efficiencies of the morpholinos that target the receptor or the ligand. Complete suppression of either the ligand or the receptor is necessary to fully explain this observation. Our loss-of-function data support an essential role for Eph/Ephrin signaling in the insertion of mesenchyme into epithelium, however we are unable to distinguish the precise step in the transition requiring Eph activation. The morphology of cells changes as they insert into the ectoderm, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Loss-of-function data does not distinguish between a sequential process and a process that is directly dependent on Eph/Ephrin. In one situation, insertion and the change in morphology are independent pathways that are sequentially activated, and only one pathway is dependent on Eph/Ephrin signaling. An alternative is that insertion and the change in morphology are independent processes, but they are directly dependent on Eph/Ephrin signaling.</p><p>By injecting Sp-Efn RNA we are able to express ligand throughout the embryo, including the ventral ectoderm, where this ligand is not normally expressed. The ventral ectoderm does have cytonemes, at similar densities to dorsal ectoderm, but they do not express Sp-Efn. Expression of Sp-Efn in ventral ectoderm is sufficient for pigmented immunocytes to disperse beneath ventral ectoderm and insert in the epithelium. As well, a high level of Sp-Efn expression in half of an embryo enhances immunocyte insertion in dorsal ectoderm. Overall, loss-of-function and gain-of-function outcomes indicate that Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn are components of the pathways that facilitate insertion of immunocytes into epithelium.</p><p>It is also clear from our data that there are additional factors that influence the distribution of Sp-Efn and the ability of pigmented immunocytes to insert in an epithelium. When Sp-Efn is ectopically expressed, early gastrula stages have uniform expression of Sp-Efn. However, by the completion of gastrulation, Sp-Efn cannot be detected in endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). This may account for pigmented immunocytes not inserting into endoderm or coelomic epithelia, however the mechanism by which Sp-Efn is excluded from the endoderm is not known.</p><p>The accumulation of pigmented immunocytes in regions of abundant Sp-Efn and experiments in which Sp-Efn levels are perturbed in half of the embryo indicate that pigmented immunocytes move into regions expressing high levels of Sp-Efn. Several mechanisms could potentially account for the apparent attraction of immunocyte precursors to ectoderm expressing Sp-Efn. Given the established role for Eph/Ephrin signaling in regulating cellular adhesion, we propose a mechanism in which Sp-Eph activation leads to a localized increase in adhesion. Although soluble attractants cannot be eliminated as possible co-factors, haptotaxis may be sufficient to account for the observations that we report. Haptotaxis guides by means of a gradient of adhesion and is dependent upon adhesive bonds that are continuously made and broken. Stronger adhesions resist disruption better than weaker adhesions, with the result that random motions will move a cell up an adhesive gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies, 2005</xref>). Our data indicate that Ephrin abundance is not uniform and pigmented immunocytes continuously extend and retract short processes. If Eph activation leads to a localized enhancement of adhesion, random movements of cells would cause them to disperse and move to regions in which the level of Ephrin is higher. Eph activation has been demonstrated to promote integrin mediated cell adhesion in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huynh-Do et al., 1999</xref>) and the kinase NIK (Nck-Interacting Ste20 Kinase) is activated by Eph receptors, which leads to integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2000</xref>). As well, Eph receptors have been demonstrated to interact with Ig Superfamily receptors, which are also expressed by pigmented immunocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barsi et al., 2015</xref>). Gradients of Ephrin have been previously demonstrated to be critical to retinotectal and corticospinal patterning. However, the predominant mechanism is for high levels of ligand to suppress projection of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suetterlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Triplett and Feldheim, 2012</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that Sp-Eph and Sp-Efn may also function in the dispersion of immunocyte precursors from their site of origin, in addition to their role in insertion into the ectoderm.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses suggest that Eph receptors and ephrin ligands diverged into A- and B-types at different points in their evolutionary history, such that primitive chordates likely possessed an ancestral ephrin-A and an ancestral ephrin-B, but only a single Eph receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drescher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellott and Burke, 2008</xref>). No extant groups of deuterostomes are known to have retained this primitive condition. However, urchins have the simplest set: a single receptor and ligand. In urchins, Eph and Ephrin are expressed in broad domains of ectoderm, where they function at the interface to mediate apical contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krupke and Burke, 2014</xref>). We now add to this a role in mediating aspects of dispersal and epithelial transition of migratory cells. Summaries of the diverse functions of Eph and Ephrin in vertebrates emphasize broad categories of functions in establishing domains within epithelia such as we find in developing hindbrains, somites, intestinal villi, and vascular remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pasquale, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poliakov et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, Eph and Ephrin have a second broad set of functions in guiding migrating cells, or axonal outgrowths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nievergall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Triplett and Feldheim, 2012</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suetterlin et al., 2012</xref>). This parallel suggests that urchin embryos are a model that reveals a basal range of Eph and Ephrin functions, which has expanded and diversified such that Eph and Ephrin are the principal molecular determinants of cellular positioning and tissue patterning in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo culture and injection</title><p>Eggs and sperm were collected from <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> adults that had been induced to spawn by shaking.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigate the mechanisms by which embryonic pigment cells migrate to specific regions of ectoderm during sea urchin gastrulation. They demonstrate that both pigment cell precursors and differentiated pigment cells express the ephrin receptor (Eph) beginning at early gastrula. Using an antibody the authors show that the ephrin ligand (Efn) is expressed in aboral ectoderm and is absent from oral ectoderm which lacks pigment cells. Expression is on the basal side of the epithelium and is concentrated in cytoneme-like structures. Using Eph inhibitors, morpholino antisense perturbation of receptor and ligand, and mRNA misexpression the authors demonstrate that Eph signaling is necessary for proper pigment cell insertion into the ectoderm. In the absence of Eph, the pigment cell precursors remain rounded and undergo apoptosis. This is an interesting twist on Eph function as it has usually been seen a negative migratory factor that repulses contact. Overall the results presented clearly implicate Eph/ephrin signaling in the process of pigment cell patterning.</p><p>However, some of the claims are overstated and not supported by data. The most significant of these is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> which is the most important figure in the paper as it is the one that should show ectopic pigment cells in the ventral ectoderm if the hypothesis is supported, but the figure cannot be interpreted that way as presented. Next most significant is the claim that Ephrin is selectively expressed in the cytonemes or at the tips of the cytonemes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Eph/ephrin terminology is a little confusing so it would be helpful to explicitly define the two in one place in the Introduction (the information is there – it would just help if it was consolidated to eliminate confusion between Eph and Efn). Also there is mention of diversification in vertebrate ephrins. A very short explanation of the numbers of genes and the designation of A and B types in relation to the sea urchin genes would add perspective.</p><p>2) Several times in the text there is mention of &quot;mesenchymal to epithelial&quot; transition. The pigment cells insert into the epithelium but are they really epithelial? They remain fairly motile and don't seem to completely associate with the epithelium.</p><p>3) In the beginning of the Discussion, Efn expression on the cytonemal process is said to suggest a paracrine function. Why paracrine? Some further explanation would be useful.</p><p>4) In the mRNA injection experiments, the lack of pigment cell insertion into endodermal or coelomic pouch epithelia suggests other mechanisms of control. This could be explored in the Discussion.</p><p>5) On the abscissa of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> graph the order of treatments is slightly different between the left (40h) and right (72h) sides (Efn MO1). A congruent arrangement would reduce confusion.</p><p>6) Is there a reason why Efn MO1 was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but Efn MO2 was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</p><p>7) In Methods 2.1 pL injection seems like a pretty specific volume. Is this correct?</p><p>8) The authors are not correct in stating that this is the first time ectodermal cytonemes (filopodia) have been described in sea urchins. Miller and McClay (1995) identified these structures, analyzed their motility by time-lapse imaging, and discussed their possible role in signaling. The authors need to reinterpret their analysis of cytonemes in light of these previously published findings.</p><p>9) The authors emphasize that there is a single ephrin ligand and one receptor in sea urchins. Since that's true, why does the ephrin MO not produce the same effects as the receptor MO (or NVP treatment)? The Efn MO had no effect on apoptosis (PC number) at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) or on the number of cells that insert into the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) but the Eph MO has significant effects in both cases. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> argue that the Efn MO is effective, so why are there these differences between the ligand and receptor knockdowns?</p><p>10) The authors document asymmetric distributions of PCs under a variety of experimental conditions. The implication is that directional cell migration causes the asymmetry, but one could imagine scenarios where differential cell survival and/or proliferation contribute. Is it possible that the effects of Eph knockdown on PC migration are a secondary consequence of the activation of an apoptotic program, rather than the other way around? Is it possible that the asymmetric distribution of PCs seen in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is due to enhanced survival or proliferation of those PCs that happen to find themselves on the side of elevated Eph signaling? The authors should discuss explicitly why they don't think differential survival/proliferation contribute to the asymmetric distribution of PCs, especially since they document a role for Eph in apoptosis/survival of PCs.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref> is supposed to show that pigment cells don't move much after insertion, but this looks like a pluteus stage embryo and one would have to look much earlier. This is a very important point because the PC asymmetry could come from asymmetric ingression (most pigment cells ingress from the dorsal side of the vegetal plate), directional migration within the blastocoel prior to insertion, and/or directional migration within the plane of the ectoderm.</p><p>12) One widely used control for MO specificity is to show that two different (largely non-overlapping) MOs directed at the same mRNA produce the same effect. Here the authors list two different MOs for each target (Efn and Eph) in the Methods, but for both mRNAs all the data in the paper come from a single MO the second MO is never discussed.</p><p>13) Some concerns about the image quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: First, the authors need to include a diagram illustrating how the regions were mapped out for quantification, as this was hard to glean from the text. How did the authors insure that each region contained the same number of cells (versus black background), which would affect the average pixel intensity over the entire area? Also, the authors point out that the curves in G and H have similar shapes, but one wonders how dependent the shape of the pixel intensity curve (H) is on the specific image processing conditions that were chosen, i.e., contrast settings.</p><p>14) The authors should discuss the available evidence concerning the specificity of NVP.</p><p>15) The specificity of the antibodies is never addressed. If they have been used in previous publications, the authors should briefly summarize the data indicating that these reagents are specific, since so much of this paper relies on immunostaining.</p><p>16) Do VE cells lack filopodia entirely or do they have filopodia that are free of Efn?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Eph and Ephrin function in Dispersal and Epithelial Insertion of Pigmented Immunocytes in sea urchin embryos&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The most significant of these is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> which is the most important figure in the paper as it is the one that should show ectopic pigment cells in the ventral ectoderm if the hypothesis is supported, but the figure cannot be interpreted that way as presented. Next most significant is the claim that Ephrin is selectively expressed in the cytonemes or at the tips of the cytonemes.</italic></p><p>The most important changes we have made relate to claims noted by the editorial team as lacking support. The claim that ectopic expression of Sp-Efn results in pigmented immunocytes inserting into ventral ectoderm is a critical finding and we have provided additional data to support this claim. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> now contains mid-sagittal optical sections of experimental and control embryos to demonstrate the presence and location of ectopic immunocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4I,K</xref>). We have retained the original image, a ventral projection, but have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. This supplement contains 3 orthagonal projections from the same stack of images as the ventral projection. The reviewers were concerned that the immunocytes that appear to be ventral in the projection may be located deeper in the embryo and may not be inserted in the ventral ectoderm as we claim. The orthogonal projections enable the reader to examine each pigment cell to determine that it is indeed inserted or contacting the ventral ectoderm. Thus, we have added evidence to support the claim of ectopic pigment cells resulting from ectopic expression of Sp-Efn.</p><p>The second most significant claim that one of the reviewers questioned was the expression of Sp-Efn on cytonemes. The reviewers were concerned that without a basal membrane marker, it was possible that the Efn was within the cell, not on cytonemal projections. We have added 2 panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to support our claim that expression of Sp-Efn is on cytonemes. We are unaware of any good immunological markers for basolateral domains in urchin ectoderm, but F-actin and Spectrin are excellent apical markers and we have used these in conjunction with DIC to show the main cell body of the ectodermal cells, providing the reader with an image showing the basal membrane of ectodermal cells and the Ephrin-containing cytonemes extending from these cells. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-G</xref> the reader should be able to see that the filaments to which Sp-Efn localizes lie within the blastocoel and are not within the thickness of the epithelium. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H-J</xref> shows there is sub-apical actin and actin associated with epithelial junctions. In addition, these images show F-actin and Sp-Efn co-localize within basal cytonemes. Thus, we have provided additional evidence to support our claim that Sp-Efn is expressed on basal cytonemes of dorsal ectoderm in sea urchin embryos.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Eph/ephrin terminology is a little confusing so it would be helpful to explicitly define the two in one place in the Introduction (the information is there – it would just help if it was consolidated to eliminate confusion between Eph and Efn). Also there is mention of diversification in vertebrate ephrins. A very short explanation of the numbers of genes and the designation of A and B types in relation to the sea urchin genes would add perspective.</italic></p><p>The reviewer requested that we define and consolidate receptor and ligand terminology and enumerate and describe vertebrate diversification and terminology. A brief section describing the Eph and Ephrin nomenclature and the diversity of vertebrate genes has been added to the Introduction (Introduction, para 2) and we have ensured the urchin orthologues are named and the naming is used consistently.</p><p><italic>2) Several times in the text there is mention of &quot;mesenchymal to epithelial&quot; transition. The pigment cells insert into the epithelium but are they really epithelial? They remain fairly motile and don't seem to completely associate with the epithelium.</italic></p><p>The reviewer questioned use of the terminology of “mesenchyme to epithelial transition”. The reviewer is correct in noting that the transition of pigmented immunocytes into the epithelium has not been characterized and the cells have several features that are distinct from epithelial cells. We have used the terminology of “inserting” into the epithelium to describe the process, rather than mesenchyme to epithelial transition, which implies aspects of the process that are unknown.</p><p><italic>3) In the beginning of the Discussion, Efn expression on the cytonemal process is said to suggest a paracrine function. Why paracrine? Some further explanation would be useful.</italic></p><p>The reviewer requested a fuller explanation of paracrine effects of cytonemal expression of Sp-Efn. We have expanded the description of the model of paracrine effects of cytonemal expression of Sp-Efn to clarify what is meant by a paracrine effect (Discussion, para 1).</p><p><italic>4) In the mRNA injection experiments, the lack of pigment cell insertion into endodermal or coelomic pouch epithelia suggests other mechanisms of control. This could be explored in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>The reviewer asked that we explore the lack of pigment cell insertion into endoderm and coelomic epithelia. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (Discussion, para 5).</p><p><italic>5) On the abscissa of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> graph the order of treatments is slightly different between the left (40h) and right (72h) sides (Efn MO1). A congruent arrangement would reduce confusion.</italic></p><p>The reviewer asked that we reorder the treatments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and we have done so.</p><p><italic>6) Is there a reason why Efn MO1 was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but Efn MO2 was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</italic></p><p>The reviewer asked if there is a reason that the one morpholino was used in some experiments and the second morpholino was used in others. A note was added to the methods stating that morpholinos producing identical phenotypes were used interchangeably. Note that in point 12, the reviewer suggests the contrary idea that we did not use both morpholinos as often as we could.</p><p><italic>7) In Methods 2.1 pL injection seems like a pretty specific volume. Is this correct?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer questioned the precision of the injection volume. We have corrected to statement to show the range of volume used in injections.</p><p><italic>8) The authors are not correct in stating that this is the first time ectodermal cytonemes (filopodia) have been described in sea urchins. Miller and McClay (1995) identified these structures, analyzed their motility by time-lapse imaging, and discussed their possible role in signaling. The authors need to reinterpret their analysis of cytonemes in light of these previously published findings.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer asserts that we are not correct in stating cytonemes have not previously been described and cites Miller et al. 1995. We have added a more complete review of ectodermal filopodia (Discussion, para 2) noting that filopodia have a long history of study in urchins. We distinguish cytonemes from other forms of filopodia; cytonemes function in signaling and bear either receptors or ligands. A novel aspect of our paper is that we know of no prior reports ascribing a ligand presentation function to urchin filopodia.</p><p><italic>9) The authors emphasize that there is a single ephrin ligand and one receptor in sea urchins. Since that's true, why does the ephrin MO not produce the same effects as the receptor MO (or NVP treatment)? The Efn MO had no effect on apoptosis (PC number) at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) or on the number of cells that insert into the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) but the Eph MO has significant effects in both cases. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> argue that the Efn MO is effective, so why are there these differences between the ligand and receptor knockdowns?</italic></p><p>The reviewer asks why there is a difference in the outcomes of receptor and ligand knockdown. We have added a brief section in the discussion (Discussion, para 3) stating that this is not resolvable without a complete ablation of either the ligand or the receptor.</p><p><italic>10) The authors document asymmetric distributions of PCs under a variety of experimental conditions. The implication is that directional cell migration causes the asymmetry, but one could imagine scenarios where differential cell survival and/or proliferation contribute. Is it possible that the effects of Eph knockdown on PC migration are a secondary consequence of the activation of an apoptotic program, rather than the other way around? Is it possible that the asymmetric distribution of PCs seen in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is due to enhanced survival or proliferation of those PCs that happen to find themselves on the side of elevated Eph signaling? The authors should discuss explicitly why they don't think differential survival/proliferation contribute to the asymmetric distribution of PCs, especially since they document a role for Eph in apoptosis/survival of PCs.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is concerned that the data showing ectopic pigmented immunocytes in embryos injected with Sp-Efn RNA is insufficient. As noted in comments to the editor, we have supplemented this figure with a lateral optical section and provided a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) using orthogonal views to show that pigmented immunocytes are in, or closely associated with the ventral ectoderm. We have also noted in the figure that the circle indicating the location of the ventral ectoderm is defined by the higher density of nuclei in the ciliary band.</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref> is supposed to show that pigment cells don't move much after insertion, but this looks like a pluteus stage embryo and one would have to look much earlier. This is a very important point because the PC asymmetry could come from asymmetric ingression (most pigment cells ingress from the dorsal side of the vegetal plate), directional migration within the blastocoel prior to insertion, and/or directional migration within the plane of the ectoderm.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is concerned that we do not have a single video showing the complete ontogeny of pigmented immunocytes. There are technical reasons that make this a difficult request. Keeping larvae alive and healthy on a microscope slide for 48 h is not possible at this time. We have made a series of videos to show each of the phases of immunocyte ontogeny and presented those as an alternative. The point of <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref> is that in early plutei, pigmented immunocytes do not move extensively; they have inserted in ectoderm and stopped migrating. In <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, this occurs between 60 and 72 h, which is the stage we have used to make this video. The reviewer goes on to suggest several mechanisms that may underlie the patterning of immunocytes, which is correct.</p><p><italic>12) One widely used control for MO specificity is to show that two different (largely non-overlapping) MOs directed at the same mRNA produce the same effect. Here the authors list two different MOs for each target (Efn and Eph) in the Methods, but for both mRNAs all the data in the paper come from a single MO the second MO is never discussed.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is concerned that we do not use the non-overlapping morpholinos to the same extent in our studies. See 6 above.</p><p><italic>13) Some concerns about the image quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: First, the authors need to include a diagram illustrating how the regions were mapped out for quantification, as this was hard to glean from the text. How did the authors insure that each region contained the same number of cells (versus black background), which would affect the average pixel intensity over the entire area? Also, the authors point out that the curves in G and H have similar shapes, but one wonders how dependent the shape of the pixel intensity curve (H) is on the specific image processing conditions that were chosen, i.e., contrast settings.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers have requested a fuller explanation of image quantification. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which contains a detailed explanation and a diagram of how quantification was done.</p><p><italic>14) The authors should discuss the available evidence concerning the specificity of NVP.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer requested a discussion of NVP specificity. We have referred readers to the discussion in the paper describing NVP (Martiny-Baron et al. 2010).</p><p><italic>15) The specificity of the antibodies is never addressed. If they have been used in previous publications, the authors should briefly summarize the data indicating that these reagents are specific, since so much of this paper relies on immunostaining.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer requests a summary of data on antibody specificity. As there are no novel antibodies reported, the details of antigens employed and specificity are available in the cited papers. We have added a note to the Methods explaining this (Materials and methods, para 4).</p><p><italic>16) Do VE cells lack filopodia entirely or do they have filopodia that are free of Efn?</italic></p><p>Do VE cells lack filopodia or do they have filopodia that are free of Efn? We have added a statement to the Discussion (Discussion, para 4) answering this question.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Major Point:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) What is meant by the sentence in the third paragraph of the Discussion &quot;Complete suppression….&quot; Is it possible that the receptor responds to inputs other than the Eph ligand? Is incomplete KO of the Eph ligand the cause of the different phenotype?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer wants a clearer statement regarding the difference between the effects of the morpholino targeting the receptor and the morpholino targeting the ligand. We have altered the text of the manuscript to make this clearer. This sentence has been added: “This outcome may result from other interactions, both extra- and intra-cellular, with Sp-Eph, or from differences in efficiencies of the morpholinos that target the receptor or the ligand.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
