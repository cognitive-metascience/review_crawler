Here, we solve the structure of double-knot toxin (DkTx), a tarantula toxin that activates the heat-activated TRPV1 channel. We also provide improved structures of TRPV1 with and without the toxin bound, and investigate the interactions of DkTx with the channel and membranes. We find that DkTx binds to the outer edge of the external pore of TRPV1 in a counterclockwise configuration, using a limited protein-protein interface and inserting hydrophobic residues into the bilayer. We also show that DkTx partitions naturally into membranes, with the two lobes exhibiting opposing energetics for membrane partitioning and channel activation. Finally, we find that the toxin disrupts a cluster of hydrophobic residues behind the selectivity filter that are critical for channel activation. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mode of toxin-channel recognition that has important implications for the mechanism of thermosensation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11273.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11273.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other mammals sense heat using a protein called the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) channel. This protein is found in the membranes of a particular type of nerve cell, and it forms a pore that allows certain ions to pass through the membrane. Along with sensing heat, TRPV1 can also be activated by a toxin called double-knot toxin – which is found in spider venom – and by capsaicin, the active ingredient in chilli peppers.</p><p>One way to investigate how a protein works is to study its three-dimensional (3D) structure. Here, Bae, Anselmi et al. use a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to produce a detailed model of the 3D structure of double-knot toxin. This model is then combined with 3D maps of TRPV1 from previous studies to predict where the toxin binds to TRPV1. This suggests that the toxin binds to a section of TRPV1 that is buried within the membrane. Moreover, the new models highlight a 'hydrophobic' region of the TRPV1 channel that may work as the heat sensor.</p><p>Together, Bae, Anselmi et al.’s findings reveal a new way in which a toxin can bind to a target protein in membranes. The next step is to test the idea that the hydrophobic region identified in this work is the part of TRPV1 that senses heat.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11273.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11273.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>capsaicin</kwd><kwd>thermosensing</kwd><kwd>membrane channel</kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions in membranes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faraldo-Gómez</surname><given-names>José D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000093</institution-id><institution>Center for Information Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwieters</surname><given-names>Charles D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jae Il</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003715</institution-id><institution>Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>Chanhyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of a bivalent double-knot tarantula toxin bound to the outer pore of the capsaicin receptor reveals a novel mode of toxin-channel recognition that has important implications for thermosensation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The venom of poisonous animals contains an arsenal of protein toxins that target ion channel proteins to paralyze prey and induce pain by activating nociceptive sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohlen and Julius, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>). These toxins, which typically contain multiple disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Norton and Pallaghy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pallaghy et al., 1994</xref>), activate or inhibit ion channel proteins that open and close in response to membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cestele et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Milescu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997a</xref>), binding of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Celie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dellisanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ulens et al., 2006</xref>) or other sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, these small proteins are invaluable tools for investigating ion-channel structures and operational mechanisms.</p><p>Many of these protein toxins have evolved to interact with functionally important domains of ion channels that are freely accessible to water on the external side of the cell membrane, implying that toxin-channel recognition takes place in an aqueous environment. For example, the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin binds to the extracellular side of the pore of potassium channels to physically block the flow of ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</xref>). A recent X-ray structure of a complex between charybdotoxin and the Kv1.2-2.1 paddle chimera channel revealed that this block is effected by a lysine residue that the toxin inserts into the selectivity filter of the channel, mimicking a K<sup>+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>). Another example is the tarantula toxin PcTx1, which activates acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) by clamping onto helix 5 within the large extracellular domain of the channel, and inserting an Arg finger motif into a subunit interface where protons bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salinas et al., 2006</xref>). The ASIC channel was also crystalized in complex with MitTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>), a structurally distinct two-subunit snake toxin that binds to an extended region of the extracellular domain of the channel, stabilizing it in an open conformation. The general principle of toxins binding to ion channels within aqueous environments is further illustrated by X-ray structures of a glutamate-activated cation channel in complex with the cone snail toxin con-ikot-ikot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and of the extracellular domains of Cys-loop receptors in complex with cone snail or snake toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Celie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dellisanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ulens et al., 2006</xref>). These striking structures not only reveal in great detail the nature of toxin-channel interactions in solution, but also provide valuable insights into the operational mechanisms of an array of ion channels. This notwithstanding, it has been recently suggested that certain types of toxins can target domains within ion channel proteins that are embedded within the lipid membrane. For example, tarantula toxins that modify the gating of voltage-activated ion channels partition into membranes and are thought to bind to the voltage-sensing domains within the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and MacKinnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mihailescu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milescu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Phillips et al., 2005b</xref>). Thus far, however, no structures of toxin-channel complexes have been solved for this class of toxins, and therefore our understanding of toxin-channel interactions within membrane environments is limited.</p><p>Double-knot toxin (DkTx) is a tarantula toxin isolated from the venom of a Chinese bird spider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>) that activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. TRPV1 is a cation channel expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons that plays important roles in the transduction of noxious stimuli as well as thermosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Julius, 2013</xref>), but the molecular mechanism of heat-dependent activation has remained elusive. From a structural perspective, DkTx is intriguing because it has an unusual bivalent architecture, being comprised of two inhibitor-cysteine-knot (ICK) motifs that have been designated as the K1 and K2 lobes. DkTx is also quite hydrophobic, requiring the use of detergents to efficiently fold in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2012</xref>), which raises the possibility that the toxin might interact with TRPV1 in a membrane environment, similar to toxins targeting voltage-sensing domains of voltage-activated ion channels. In a recent breakthrough, near-atomic resolution structures of the TRPV1 channel were solved using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), including a closed state (apo), a capsaicin-bound state, and an open state with both DkTx and the vanilloid resiniferatoxin (RTx) bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of the complex between TRPV1 and DkTx/RTx unambiguously reveals that the DkTx lobes bind to sites at the periphery of the external pore of the channel. However, the resolution of electron density maps was insufficient to reveal the structure of DkTx in atomic detail. Therefore, the binding arrangement of the two DkTx knots is unknown, as is the nature of the interactions between toxin and channel, or whether the interaction occurs in aqueous or membrane environments. How DkTx recognition ultimately results in channel opening, and how this process might relate to the mechanism of temperature-sensing, are also open questions.</p><p>In the present study, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of DkTx, and the molecular-modeling suite ROSETTA together with existing cryo-EM density maps to derive high-quality structural models of the TRPV1 channel with and without DkTx bound. We also investigate the interaction of the toxin with the TRPV1 channel and lipid membranes using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrate that DkTx interacts intimately with TRPV1 while inserting hydrophobic residues into the surrounding lipid membrane, and provide the first example of a complex structure between toxin and channel within a membrane environment. Comparison of the improved structures of apo and toxin-bound TRPV1 reveals novel insights into the mechanism by which DkTx induces channel opening, and provides new insight into the mechanism of thermosensation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMR structures of K1 and K2 lobes of DkTx</title><p>Our first objective was to solve the structure of DkTx in solution at atomic resolution through solution NMR spectroscopy. Because previous studies have demonstrated that the two lobes (or knots) of the toxin, K1 and K2, can fold independently and can also activate the TRPV1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>), we synthesized K1 and K2 individually using solid-phase peptide synthesis. The full-length toxin was also produced recombinantly, with and without <sup>15</sup>N-labeling. All constructs were folded in vitro in the presence of detergent, and correctly folded species were purified using reversed-phase HPLC. Our strategy was to first use two-dimensional (2D) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to study each of the lobes separately, because these measurements would yield less crowded spectra and thus facilitate the assignment of a greater number of cross-peaks, which could then be translated into nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) inter-proton distance restraints for structure determination. We then conducted additional NMR experiments using <sup>15</sup>N labeled DkTx, taking advantage of the separation of overlapped spectra in 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NOESY using <sup>15</sup>N, and compared the backbone proton resonances of K1 and K2 with the full-length protein.</p><p>Complete proton resonance assignments for K1 and K2 were made using traditional 2D NMR sequential assignment techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wüthrich, 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using the proton chemical shift values of isolated K1 and K2 as reference, proton resonances in DkTx were readily identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). The backbone proton chemical shift values of DkTx were found to be nearly identical to those measured for K1 and K2 separately, except for a few residues in the linker region and in the N- and C-termini of the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We can therefore conclude that the structures of isolated K1 and K2 are highly similar to those in full-length DkTx.</p><p>The structures of K1 and K2 were determined using the inter-proton distance restraints deduced from the NOESY data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), in addition to backbone dihedral angle phi restraints estimated from DQF-COSY spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim and Prestegard, 1989</xref>), and disulfide-bond restraints inferred from homology with other ICK toxins of known structure. Using the simulated-annealing method and energy function in Xplor-NIH 2.37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwieters et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwieters et al., 2003</xref>), we derived a set of 20 energy-minimized structures for each knot that fulfill the NMR restraints, as well as generic protein-geometry and other knowledge-based restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bermejo et al., 2012</xref>). Statistical analysis of these ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) indicates that the structures are determined without significant stereochemical violations. A superposition of the 20 energy-minimized structures obtained for each lobe demonstrates that the protein backbone is well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), except in the inter-connecting linker, for which we obtained relatively few distance restraints. Each lobe consists of two anti-parallel beta-strands (F21<bold>-</bold>Y22/K32-K33 in K1 and L61<bold>-</bold>D62/Y70-C71 in K2), stabilized by three disulfide bonds.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NMR solution structures of K1 and K2.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Ensemble of backbone structures of K1 (<bold>A</bold>), in green, and K2 (<bold>B</bold>), in cyan.

Two notable differences between K1 and K2 are the length of loop 3, which is longer in K1 than in K2, and the configuration of a tryptophan side-chain in loop 2 (W11 in K1 and W53 in K2), which is more solvent accessible in K1 (154 ± 16 Å<sup>2</sup>) than in K2 (132 ± 7 Å<sup>2</sup>). The latter stems from actual differences in the NOESY spectra for K1 and K2; the number of NOE cross-peaks between the conserved Trp in loop 2 and the conserved Ile and Pro residues in loop 4 are fewer in K1 than in K2. The likely cause of this structural difference is a serine (S10) to glycine (G52) substitution at the first position in loop 2, which seems to allow this loop to bend towards loop 4 in K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Surface renderings of K1 and K2 show that both lobes feature a large cluster of exposed hydrophobic residues (green), comprised of W11, M25, F27 and I28 in K1 and W53, L65, A66, F67 and I68 in K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

The hydrophobic surfaces in both K1 and K2 are surrounded by basic residues (blue) and acidic residues (red), including D1, E7, K13, K14, H30 and K32 in K1 and E47, E49, K56, E72, K73 and R75 in K2.

Notwithstanding the groundbreaking insights provided by these cryo-EM maps, the associated structural models deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are objectively suboptimal in several respects. Aside from the missing backbone fragments and side-chains in unresolved regions, the published structural models show a significant number of stereochemical violations and steric overlaps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). As an example, the MolProbity score, which is a standardized metric of model quality among structures of comparable resolution, ranks PDB entries 3J5Q and 3J5P in the 29th and 36th percentile, respectively (with 100th percentile being the best score). A specific issue pertaining to the published model of the TRPV1/DkTx/RTx complex is that it is based on a map with imposed fourfold symmetry, despite the fact that the two DkTx lobes are not identical and thus the appropriate symmetry for the complex would be twofold. More importantly, in the published structure of the TRPV1/DkTx/RTx complex, the toxin is modeled as a poly-alanine chain based on the structure of hanatoxin because an atomic-resolution structure of DkTx had not yet been solved. Assignment of the K1 and K2 knots to the EM map was therefore not possible, and so the nature of their interaction with the channel or the membrane has remained unclear.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.008</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Evaluation of structural models of apo TRPV1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11273.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11273.008</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="5"><bold>PDB entry 3J5P</bold></td> </tr><tr><td colspan="5">Number of atoms: 18,628</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Correlation coefficient with cryo-EM map EMD-5778 (3.4 Å): 0.71</td></tr><tr><td>All-atom contacts</td><td>Clashscore, all atoms<sup>a</sup></td><td colspan="2">76.31</td><td>16th percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Protein geometry</td><td>Poor rotamers</td><td>524</td><td>26.57%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;1%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran outliers</td><td>0</td><td>0.00%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran favored</td><td>2204</td><td>94.35%</td><td>Ideal: &gt;98%</td></tr><tr><td>MolProbity score<sup>c</sup></td><td colspan="2">3.82</td><td>36th percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td>C<sub>β</sub> deviations &gt;0.25 Å</td><td>0</td><td>0.00%</td><td>Ideal: 0</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone bonds</td><td>166/19032</td><td>0.87%</td><td>Ideal: 0%</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone angles</td><td>72/25760</td><td>0.28%</td><td>Ideal: &lt; 0.1%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><bold>Partial ROSETTA model</bold><sup>d</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Number of atoms: 18,628</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Correlation coefficient with cryo-EM map EMD-5778 (3.4 Å): 0.71</td></tr><tr><td>All-atom contacts</td><td>Clashscore, all atoms<sup>a</sup></td><td colspan="2">3.45</td><td>97th percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Protein geometry</td><td>Poor rotamers</td><td>4</td><td>0.20%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;1%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran outliers</td><td>12</td><td>0.51%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran favored</td><td>2200</td><td>94.18%</td><td>Ideal: &gt;98%</td></tr><tr><td>MolProbity score<sup>c</sup></td><td colspan="2">1.53</td><td>94th percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td>C<sub>β</sub> deviations &gt;0.25 Å</td><td>0</td><td>0.00%</td><td>Ideal: 0</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone bonds</td><td>44/19024</td><td>0.23%</td><td>Ideal: 0%</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone angles</td><td>56/25744</td><td>0.22%</td><td>Ideal: &lt; 0.1%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><bold>Complete ROSETTA model</bold></td> </tr><tr><td colspan="5">Number of atoms: 19,632</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Correlation coefficient with cryo-EM map EMD-5778 (3.4 Å): 0.71</td></tr><tr><td>All-atom contacts</td><td>Clashscore, all atoms<sup>a</sup></td><td colspan="2">3.77</td><td>96th percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Protein geometry</td><td>Poor rotamers</td><td>8</td><td>0.37%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;1%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran outliers</td><td>32</td><td>1.33%</td><td>Ideal: &lt;0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran favored</td><td>2236</td><td>92.70%</td><td>Ideal: &gt;98%</td></tr><tr><td>MolProbity score<sup>c</sup></td><td colspan="2">1.62</td><td>92nd percentile<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td>C<sub>β</sub> deviations &gt;0.25 Å</td><td>0</td><td>0.00%</td><td>Ideal: 0</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone bonds</td><td>52/20068</td><td>0.26%</td><td>Ideal: 0%</td></tr><tr><td>Bad backbone angles</td><td>148/27144</td><td>0.55%</td><td>Ideal: &lt; 0.1%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p><sup>a</sup>Clashscore is the number of serious steric overlaps (&gt;0.4 Å) per 1,000 atoms.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><p><sup>b</sup>100th percentile is the best score among structures of comparable resolution; 0th percentile is the worst score.

This approach enabled us to develop atomic models of apo TRPV1 and the TRPV1-DkTx complex that are considerably improved; the updated MolProbity scores rank these complete models in the 92nd and 80th percentile, respectively, while maintaining the original quality of the fit to the experimental cryo-EM maps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). To construct the model of the TRPV1-DkTx complex, we used an unpublished cryo-EM map with imposed twofold symmetry, kindly provided by Yifan Cheng and colleagues. Although the resolution of this map is somewhat inferior to that of the fourfold symmetrized map utilized originally (4.3 Å compared to 3.8 Å), densities for each of the four DxTk knots (two per toxin) are clearly discernable. We initially docked the NMR structures of K1 and K2 into these densities using Xplor-NIH, in either a clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) configuration (viewed from the extracellular side), optimizing the fit of each lobe to the EM map while also applying NOE distance restraints within each knot (based on the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments for K1 and K2 in solution). These two partial models were then input into ROSETTA, which was then used to generate a randomized ensemble of 100 models of the complete TRPV1-DkTx complex for each K1-K2 configuration. Analysis of these two ensembles shows that the majority of the 100 CCW models fit to the experimental cryo-EM map significantly better, and also have a better ROSETTA score, than the majority of the 100 CW models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that the number of NOE-restraint violations in the CW initial seed model generated with Xplor-NIH was twice as large as for the CCW model, for a comparable fit quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We can therefore conclude unambiguously that DkTx binds to the outer pore of TRPV1 in a CCW configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Docking of DkTx into the electron density map of DkTx/RTx-bound TRPV1.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Top-ranking ROSETTA models of the structure of TRPV1 with DkTx bound in a clockwise (CW, <bold>A</bold>) or counter-clockwise (CCW, <bold>B</bold>) configuration.

These two loops straddle the interface between TRPV1 subunits, with loop 2 capping the S6 helix from one subunit, while loop 4 localizes near the N-terminus of the re-entrant pore helix from the adjacent subunit. Scanning mutagenesis previously identified four residues within the outer pore domain of TRPV1, namely I599A at the top of S5, F649A in the pore loop, and both A657P and F659A at the top of S6, where mutations disrupt activation of the channel by DkTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>); two additional mutants in this region (V595A in S5, and T650A in the pore loop) also display diminished activation by the toxin, whereas Y631A, near the N-terminus of the pore helix, enhances the effect of DkTx. Our model indicates that among these residues, only F649, A657, T650 and Y631 could interact directly with the toxin, suggesting that the other mutations influence toxin activation of the channel through an indirect mechanism (see below). Interestingly, the model also shows that both K1 and K2 drape over the top of S6 at the presumed interface with the surrounding membrane, and position several conserved hydrophobic residues (W11, F27 and I28 in K1, and W53, F67 and I68 in K2) where they would interact directly with lipids in the bilayer.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of the proposed structural model of the TRPV1-DkTx complex.</title><p>Close-up of K1 (<bold>A</bold>) and K2 (<bold>B</bold>) in the top-ranking ROSETTA model of DkTx bound to TRPV1.

In the case of the K2 knot, the concentration-dependence for activation of TRPV1 saturates in the low micromolar range, and the extent of maximal activation is comparable to saturating concentrations of DkTx. In contrast, saturation of the concentration-response relation cannot be observed for K1, and at the highest concentrations that can be tested, K1 produces between 6- and 12-fold weaker activation compared to a saturating concentration of K2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Because we cannot achieve higher concentrations of K1 in aqueous solution due to limited solubility, we investigated whether this knot has lower affinity or efficacy compared to K2 by taking advantage of the fact that bivalency increases the local concentration of each lobe, and therefore will produce higher occupancy of the channel compared to the separate lobes. For these experiments, we produced bivalent versions of K1 (K1K1) and K2 (K2K2), and tested whether bivalency altered the large difference in the ability of the two lobes to activate TRPV1. K1K1 should remain a weak activator of TRPV1 if K1 has lower efficacy than K2, however, bivalency should diminish the differences between K1 and K2 if K1 has lower affinity. Indeed, we found that 1 µM K1K1 produced comparable activation to that produced by the same concentration of DkTx or K2K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), suggesting that the efficacy of the two knots is comparable, but that the affinity of K1 is much lower than that of K2. Although both DkTx and K2K2 exhibited slow dissociation, we observed considerably more rapid dissociation for K1K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that K1 has lower binding affinity than K2 even when tested in its bivalent form.</p><p>The observation that K1 has lower affinity than K2 provides a means to validate our structural model of the TRPV1-DkTx complex. Specifically, chimeras in which we replace either loop 2 and loop 4 in K1 by that in K2 ought to lead to a gain of function for activating the channel, resulting from an enhanced binding affinity; in contrast, substitutions in regions not involved in the channel-toxin interface should not alter the degree of channel activation. We generated such chimeras between K1 without the linker (K1-ΔL) and K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and tested their ability to activate full-length TRPV1 channels compared to a saturating concentration of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The weak activation observed with K1-ΔL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; green) was not altered in constructs in which either Asn1 in the N-terminus or loop 3 of K2 were transferred into K1-ΔL [i.e. K1(D1N) or K1(K2L3)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, chimeras in which loop 2, loop 4 or the C-terminal part of K2 were transferred into K1-ΔL [i.e. K1(K2L2), K1(K2L4) or K1(K2CT)] exhibited considerably more robust activation compared to K1-ΔL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The negative results observed with the N-terminal mutant and the loop 3 transfer, together with the gain of function observed with loop 2 and loop 4 transfer, support the notion that these two loops engage directly with the outer pore of TRPV1, as observed in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The model also provides a possible explanation for the gain of function observed when the C-terminus of K2 is transferred to K1. The location of the C-termini of K1 and K2 indicates that they are likely to interact with the pore turret (residues 604–626) of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), a region absent in our model as it was deleted from the TRPV1 construct used for cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), but preserved in the full-length construct used for our functional studies.</p><p>To investigate the interaction between the toxin and channel in more detail, we carried out an all-atom MD simulation of the complex embedded in a phospholipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To enhance the exploration of diverse interaction patterns in a limited simulation time (~500 ns), we coupled the χ<sub>1</sub> and χ<sub>2</sub> torsion angles of all interfacial side-chains in the toxin and channel to a fictitious high-temperature bath, using an extended-Lagrangian approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iannuzzi et al., 2003</xref>) (see Methods). To preclude the dissociation of the complex under this bias, the cryo-EM envelop was used as a three-dimensional restraint. A contact map between residues in DkTx and the outer pore of TRPV1 was then generated from the last 200 ns of simulation, so as to identify the most pronounced interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Two regions of the extracellular surface of the channel stand out as forming the most persistent side-chain contacts with either of the two lobes of DkTx, namely the N-terminus of the pore-helix, primarily via Y631, and a stretch of the pore-loop and N-terminus of S6, including N652, D654, F655, K656, A657 and V658; additional interactions are mediated by K535 and E536, in S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The contacts with the pore and S6 helices are particularly worth noting because the A657P mutation effectively abolishes channel activation by DkTx, while Y631A enhances it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>). Many of the contacts on the toxin are with residues that are equivalent in K1 and K2, e.g. W11 and W53, F27 and F67, K14 and K56 and G12 and G54, respectively, and a computational alanine-scanning (Ala-scan) analysis of the toxin-channel interface, based on the configurations explored during the MD simulation (see Methods), indicate that these are all influential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, there are also differences between K1 and K2, which might underlie their different affinity for TRPV1. The most interesting unique interactions for K2 involve S55 (K13 in K1), L65 (M25 in K1) and R75 (K35 in K1). The persistence of these interactions is worth noting because these residues are located in either loop 2 (S55), loop 4 (L65) or the C-terminus (R75), and transfer of these segments from K2 into K1 yields a pronounced increase in the binding affinity of isolated K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These residues are also predicted to have a significant stabilizing effect by the computational Ala-scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>DkTx interactions with TRPV1 and the surrounding lipid bilayer from MD simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Molecular system employed in the simulation of the TRPV1-DkTx complex.

For these experiments, we took advantage of the presence of a single conserved and solvent accessible Trp residue in loop 2 of both K1 and K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; W11 and W53), and used Trp fluorescence to monitor the partitioning of the toxin from the aqueous solution into the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ladokhin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milescu et al., 2007</xref>). When aqueous solutions of DkTx were excited at a wavelength of 280 nm, emission spectra with maxima at 353 nm were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left), as expected for Trp residues residing in such an environment. In contrast, upon addition of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), the fluorescence emission spectra for DkTx shifted to shorter wavelengths (i.e. a blue shift), and the fluorescence intensity increased, suggesting that the toxin partitions into membranes where the environment of the Trp side-chains is more hydrophobic and their dynamics are more constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ladokhin et al., 2000</xref>). To quantify the extent of partitioning as a function of lipid concentration, we measured the relative fluorescence intensity in a blue-shifted region of the spectra (e.g. 320 nm) as a function of lipid concentration, and fit a partition function to the data to obtain a mole-fraction partition coefficient (K<sub>x</sub>) of (2.3 ± 0.7) × 10<sup>6</sup>, indicating an energetically favorable interaction of DkTx with lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). This strong interaction of DkTx with membranes would facilitate binding of the toxin to the channel by increasing the local concentration of the toxin near the channel and by a reduction in the dimensionality of diffusion within the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelrod and Wang, 1994</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interaction of DkTx and toxin constructs with lipid membranes measured using Trp fluorescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>, left panel) Trp emission spectra of DkTx (<bold>A</bold>), K1 without linker (<bold>B</bold>), K2 (<bold>C</bold>), bivalent K1 (K1K1) (<bold>D</bold>) and bivalent K2 (K2K2) (<bold>E</bold>) in the absence (black) and presence (blue, 1.6 mM for DkTx, 2 mM for K1-ΔL and K1K1, and 3 mM for K2 and K2K2) of lipid vesicles (1:1 mix of POPC:POPG).

Fitting of a partition function to the data yielded K<sub>x</sub> values of (3.9 ± 1.1) × 10<sup>5</sup> for K1 and (2.0 ± 0.2) × 10<sup>4</sup> for K2, suggesting that the interaction of K1 with lipid membranes is stronger compared to K2. Because the fluorescence changes for K2 were small and did not saturate even at higher lipid concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we conducted a similar experiment using the bivalent constructs K1K1 and K2K2, which we expected would increase the K<sub>x</sub> values due to avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Indeed, both K1K1 ([2.9 ± 0.3] × 10<sup>6</sup>) and K2K2 ([8.1 ± 2] × 10<sup>4</sup>) showed increased K<sub>x</sub> values compared to K1 and K2, respectively, and K1K1 exhibited a higher K<sub>x</sub> value when compared to K2K2, confirming that partitioning of K1 into membranes is more favorable than K2. These results are remarkable when considering that K2 has a higher affinity for TRPV1 compared to K1, leading us to propose a model whereby partitioning of DkTx into membranes would be disproportionately mediated by K1, leaving K2 available to engage TRPV1 and initiate formation of the toxin-channel complex (see Discussion).</p><p>We also examined chimeras of K1 and K2 to identify which regions determine their distinct membrane partitioning energies. Interestingly, transfer of the N-terminus and loops 2 and 4 from K2 into K1 produced either no change, or a moderate increase in K<sub>x</sub>, even though the region transferred was from the weaker partitioning K2 knot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that the C-terminus of K2 is responsible for the weaker partitioning of that knot; however, transfer of that region into K1 greatly diminished the blue-shifts observed on addition of membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), precluding an accurate determination of K<sub>x</sub>.</p><p>Although bivalency in DkTx clearly plays an important role in channel activation, it also increases the local concentration of the two lobes relative to each other and may promote interactions between the two. Indeed, the measured free energies of membrane partitioning (ΔG° = −RT lnK<sub>x</sub>) for DkTx (ΔG° = −8.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>), K1K1 (ΔG° = −8.7 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) and K2K2 (ΔG° = −6.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) reveal a systematic energetic penalty for bivalency between 4.8 to 6.3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> if we calculate the theoretical free energies for bivalent toxins (DkTx ΔG° = −13.3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>; K1-K1 ΔG° = −15 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>; K2-K2 ΔG° = −11.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) from that measured for the monovalent toxins (K1 ΔG° = −7.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>; K2 ΔG° = −5.8 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) assuming complete additivity of the free energies for partitioning of each lobe. One possible explanation for this energetic penalty is that the linker between the two knots constrains their orientations and prevents optimal membrane interactions by both lobes concurrently. To test this possibility we constructed a version of DkTx wherein the linker was replaced with a highly flexible linker comprised of 7 Gly residues (7G-DkTx), and observed a K<sub>x</sub> value that is indistinguishable from wild-type DkTx ([4.4 ± 0.03] × 10<sup>6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This result seems to rule out the possibility that the linker restricts the dynamics of the two lobes significantly. Therefore, we deduce that the suboptimal membrane partitioning of DkTx probably owes to direct interactions between the two lobes, possibly mediated through the same amphipathic surfaces that interact with the membrane. Although we could not observe NOEs between K1 and K2 in the NMR spectra of DkTx in solution, it is conceivable that transient and non-specific hydrophobic interactions could go undetected, or that they are prevalent only when the toxin dynamics becomes restricted by the membrane surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Insights into the mechanism of channel activation</title><p>As noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), the most striking features of the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 bound to DkTx, relative to the unbound structure, are the dilation of the outer pore within the selectivity filter (SF) region, and the opening of the intracellular gate that is formed at the crossing between the S6 helices. Based on our improved structures of TRPV1 with and without DkTx, we set out to systematically analyze the key differences between these two states to explore the mechanism by which toxin binding promotes channel opening.</p><p>This comparative analysis indicates that binding of DkTx promotes changes in the transmembrane architecture of the channel that pertain not only to the internal structure of each of the channel subunits, but also to their relative arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); as a result, these seemingly cooperative changes open up the constrictions observed in the apo structure, both in the SF region and the intracellular gate. These structural changes appear to be effected through displacements in the pore helix (P) and S6 helices relative to the S1-S4 unit and the transmembrane S5 segment; individually, the S1-S5 and P-S6 units are largely unchanged (RMSD ~ 0.7–0.8 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). That the P and S6 helices become displaced relative to S1-S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is consistent with the fact that their respective N-termini are the primary contacts for the toxin on the channel extracellular surface, as discussed above. The changes in P and S6 within a given subunit correlate very clearly with a pronounced rearrangement of the SF and pore loop in that same subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), but also with changes in the intracellular side of the channel. The rationale for this remote effect is that the P and S6 helices are the main interfacial elements between adjacent subunits in the transmembrane domain of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>); therefore, displacements in these elements are propagated to the adjacent subunits, and compounded to the changes in their own internal structure. As a result, the S1-S4 units (which as mentioned remain largely unchanged) become noticeably displaced relative to each other, thus affecting the crossing angle of helices S5 and S6, and hence the degree of opening of the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Conformational mechanism of activation of TRPV1 inferred from the cryo-EM structures of apo and DkTx-bound channel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of the S1-S4 unit in the apo (orange) and toxin-bound (marine) structure; the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of the C-α trace is only ~0.7 Å, indicating the internal structure of this unit is not altered upon toxin binding.

This network involves, among others, residues I599, F659 and V595, F649, as well as T650. Only the latter two residues are nearby DkTx in the toxin-bound structure; however, mutation of any of these five residues diminishes toxin-induced opening of the channel, particularly in the case of I599A, F649A and F659A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>). To evaluate whether the distinct arrangement of this hydrophobic cluster is a significant feature of the apo and toxin-bound structures, despite their limited resolution, a MD simulation of apo TRPV1 was also carried out and contrasted with that discussed above for the toxin-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), using an analogous methodology. When the degree of compactness of this hydrophobic network is quantified in terms of the number and persistence of pairwise side-chain contacts, it is apparent that there is a generalized reduction of these contacts in DkTx-bound TRPV1, relative to apo TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In DkTx, two of the residues nearest to this hydrophobic cluster are M25 in K1 and L65 in K2, a relatively conserved position on the two knots that makes frequent contact with channel residues in the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Accordingly, both M25 and L65 are predicted to play energetically important roles based on our computational alanine-scan of the toxin-channel interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although we have not yet tested other toxin residues that make direct contact with TRPV1 (such as W11/W53 and K14/K56), we mutated L65 in K2 to Ala and measured the concentration-dependence for activation of TRPV1 relative to wild-type K2. The L65A mutant dramatically reduced activation of K2 and increased the rate of dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), confirming this residue mediates important interactions with the outer pore of TRPV1.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11273-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.023</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Structural changes in TRPV1 resulting from DkTx binding, and close-up view of a cluster of buried hydrophobic residues that become exposed upon channel opening.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11273.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11273.023</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The L65A mutation in K2 perturbs activation of the TRPV1 channel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TRPV1 current time-course in HEK293 cells depicting activation of the channel by L65A and WT K2 toxins in the whole-cell configuration at +60 and −60 mV.

The solution NMR structure of DkTx indicates that the toxin is composed of two well-ordered ICK lobes, connected by a 7 residue linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as previously surmised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). Our structures show that K1 and K2 lobes have similar amphipathic surfaces, which are formed by clusters of solvent-accessible hydrophobic residues (aromatic and aliphatic residues in loop 2 and loop 4) and surrounding basic and acidic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In an improved model of the toxin docked onto the TRPV1 channel, these amphipathic surfaces on K1 and K2 can be seen to intimately interact with the TRPV1 channel, as well as with lipids in the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Indeed, conserved aromatic residues in DkTx (W11 and F27 in K1, W53 and F67 in K2) reach into the void formed by S4, S6 and pore-helix of TRPV1, which lipid molecules would fill in the absence of the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Our results demonstrate that DkTx interacts favorably with membranes in the absence of the channel such that the conserved Trp residues reside within the membrane environment and exhibit blue-shifted fluorescent emission spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, our results provide direct structural evidence for a model wherein DkTx interacts with TRPV1 within the lipid membrane. Although the bivalency of DkTx clearly helps to prolong the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>), each lobe has relatively small protein-protein interfaces with TRPV1 (655 Å<sup>2</sup> for K1 and 556 Å<sup>2</sup> for K2), suggesting that the interaction of the toxin with the surrounding membrane is important for stabilizing the toxin-channel complex.</p><p>It is interesting to compare the present structural picture of DkTx binding to TRPV1 with the mode of PcTx1 binding to ASIC, as well as that described for tarantula toxins binding to voltage-sensing domains in Kv channels. DkTx, PcTx1 and voltage-sensor toxins like hanatoxin and GxTx-1E adopt similar folds, and display amphipathic surfaces that enable interactions with lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). In DkTx, residues in loops 2 and 4 engage the outer pore of TRPV1, while interacting with lipids in the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A,B</xref>), and contain mostly hydrophobic residues (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> where the toxins are oriented identically). In PcTx1, residues in loops 1 and 4 form a clamp-like structure for the toxin to bind to helix-5 within the extracellular thumb domain of the ASIC channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the voltage-sensor toxin GxTx-1E also employs residues in loops 1 and 4 to bind to the S3b helix within the voltage-sensing domain of Kv channels, and these form a surface that resembles the one used by PcTx1 to bind to ASIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). If we orient the two lobes of DkTx with channel-binding surfaces directed down, as if viewing the toxin-channel complex from a side view in the membrane, and oriented both PcTx1 and GxTx-1E by backbone superposition (as is done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B,D,E</xref>), the channel-binding surfaces for PcTx1 and GxTx-1E would both be displaced laterally by roughly 90° (compare the location of residues highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref> for K1 and K2 with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> for PcTx1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> for GxTx-1E). Interestingly, the amphipathic surface of GxTx-1E is similarly displaced relative to the amphipathic surfaces of both lobes of DkTx, which makes sense because those surfaces for both toxins are important for interacting with membranes and their target channels. Overall, this comparison suggests that the common fold of all these toxins provides at least two distinct surfaces for engaging with ion channel proteins, while maintaining favorable interactions with the lipid membrane.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of active surfaces of different classes of tarantula toxins.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Active surfaces of K1 (<bold>A</bold>) and K2 (<bold>B</bold>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that the K2 lobe is a more effective activator of TRPV1 when compared to K1 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and that tethering of the two lobes of DkTx dramatically enhances the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>), similar to the avidity effect of a bivalent antibody. We find that the two lobes of DkTx also have very different energetics for partitioning into lipid membranes, with the K1 lobe displaying considerably stronger interactions when compared to K2, a trend that can be recapitulated in the bivalent K1K1 construct when compared to the bivalent K2K2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Using bivalent K1K1 and K2K2 constructs, we also found that differences in binding affinity can explain why K2 is a much better activator of TRPV1 compared to K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, bivalency not only increases the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex, but also enables the two lobes to be separately tuned for optimal membrane partitioning or affinity for binding to the channel. This feature of DkTx would suggest that the toxin preferentially uses the K1 lobe to interact with membranes and thus raise the local concentration of K2 at the membrane surface, thereby promoting the initial formation of the toxin-channel complex using K2 within the interfacial region of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

It is tantalizing to speculate that the disruption of this cluster, which implies an increased solvent exposure of more than a dozen hydrophobic side-chains across four channel subunits, leads not only to the structural changes required for ion permeation, but also to the kind of increase in the heat capacity of the protein that has been postulated to explain temperature sensing in TRP channels, including TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>). Notably, mutations at positions T633, F640 and Y653 within the hydrophobic cluster have been shown to alter temperature sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel without affecting activation of the channel by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it is interesting that an external Na<sup>+</sup> binding site in the outer pore of TRPV1 has been shown to tightly regulate temperature-sensor activation, and that DkTx renders TRPV1 temperature-insensitive over a wide temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jara-Oseguera, 2016</xref>). The hypothesis that this rearranging hydrophobic cluster is involved in temperature sensing will require careful experimental examination, and could begin to provide a unifying framework to rationalize how very different stimuli cooperate to regulate TRP channel activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy</title><p>K1, K2 and DkTx were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2012</xref>).

In a first stage, 100 models were generated for each system following the ‘relax’ application in 5 cycles, using a high-resolution energy function for proteins in the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</xref>) in addition to the experimental cryo-EM maps. The fit-to-density score was determined with a 9-residue sliding-window, and was added to the total ROSETTA score with a weight of 0.2. The symmetry of the cryo-EM maps was explicitly imposed on all the models; a fourfold symmetric map was used for apo TRPV1, and a twofold symmetric map for the DkTx-TRPV1 complex. Each of these 100 models required approximately 280 computer-hours on an Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz core-processor for the apo TRPV1 channel and 800 hr for the complex. The models with the best ROSETTA score for apo TRPV1 and TRPV1 with DxTx in a CCW configuration were then used as the seed for a second refinement stage. In this stage, positional restraints were imposed on the backbone and on well-resolved side-chains, and the configuration of all remaining side-chains was refined through extensive sampling and scoring. In particular, we ranked the degree of confidence in the position of each side-chain atom by evaluating a score equal to −<italic>m<sub>a</sub>ρ</italic>(<italic>x<sub>a</sub>, y<sub>a</sub>, z<sub>a</sub></italic>), where <italic>m<sub>a</sub></italic> is the mass of the atom and <italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>x<sub>a</sub>, y<sub>a</sub>, z<sub>a</sub></italic>) the normalized density signal at the hypothetical atom position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Atoms for which the calculated score was in the top 20% were considered to be well resolved and were not modified further. To generate a plausible configuration for the remaining side-chain atoms, we generated 12,000 new models, using the ROSETTA energy function only (i.e. without a fit-to-map restraint). On average, each new model of apo TRPV1 and TRPV1-DkTk required approximately 15 and 25 core-minutes, respectively. To identify the most representative model for each of these ensembles, we used the clustering algorithm of Daura and colleagues as implemented in GROMACS version 4.6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2008</xref>), using a similarity cut-off of 1 Å for apo TRPV1 and 0.08 Å for the toxin-channel complex.

The equations of motion were integrated with a time-step of 2 fs. The pressure (1 atm) was maintained constant with a Nose-Hoover Langevin-piston barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feller et al., 1995</xref>), allowing variations in the volume of the simulation cell but keeping a constant ratio in the membrane-plane dimensions.

Electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) with a real space cutoff of 12 Å. The same cut-off was used for truncating van-der-Waals interactions, modeled with a shifted Lennard-Jones potential. To equilibrate the simulation systems, we used conventional MD simulations with gradually weaker positional restraints applied to the protein, the toxin and buried water molecules over 12 ns. For the toxin-channel complex, a subsequent MD simulation was carried out for 400 ns using the twofold symmetric cryo-EM map of the complex as a three-dimensional restraint, via the MDFF module in NAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trabuco et al., 2009</xref>) (with 0.3 kcal/mol as the scaling factor). During the last 200 ns of this simulation, we coupled the χ<sub>1</sub> and χ<sub>2</sub> torsions of all side-chains at the toxin-channel interface to a fictitious temperature of 3,000 K, using an extended-Lagrangian approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iannuzzi et al., 2003</xref>), so as to accelerate the configurational sampling of that interface.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. Two of the three reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Vincenzo Carnevale and Katie Henzler-Wildman (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Bae et al. reports a structural characterization of the complex between the TRPV1 ion channel and the double-knot tarantula toxin. Building on the recent work by Yifan Cheng and colleagues, the authors adopted an array of approaches (both experimental and computational) to attain a description of the channel-toxin interactions with an atomic level of detail.</p><p>The authors use solution NMR to determine the structure of the individual lobes of Double Knot Toxin DkTx, then use ROSETTA to model DkTx into the cryo-EM map of the TRPV1/DkTx complex. Examination of the structure obtained in this way reveals significant lipid-toxin interaction and a relatively small toxin-channel interface as compared to other tarantula toxins. The authors confirm the lipid partitioning of the toxin by monitoring intrinsic Trp fluorescence, finding that K1 partitions more strongly into the membrane. In contrast, K2 has a greater affinity for TRPV1, a slower off-rate as monitored in electrophysiology experiments. The authors take advantage of this difference in affinity to confirm the specific toxin loops that interact with the channel using loop-swapping experiments in single-knot constructs. This leads to a novel mechanism, where one knot is optimized for lipid partitioning while the other knot is optimized for channel interaction.</p><p>The overall picture is insightful and compelling and rests on solid experimental observation and computational results. The resulting molecular model advances our structural knowledge of TRPV1 and enables other investigators to further study the properties of this channel. Most importantly, this study constitutes a much-needed stepping-stone to address the relevant question of the molecular mechanism of TRPV1 activation. The research has been rigorously conducted and described with a level of detail that is appropriate to ensure reproducibility of the results, yet still comprehensible by non-specialists. The discussion of the results is thoughtprovoking and of potential interest to a large community of scientists.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper could and should be made stronger by reexamining the data and providing improved discussions, without additional lengthy experiments. The required revisions fall into four general areas:</p><p>1) There should be a more extensive comparison of apo and toxin-bound channel structure with emphasis on the potential mechanism of activation.</p><p>2) The discussion on the comparison with other toxins should be removed or it should be clarified, as it is currently confusing. This needs a clearer explanation and perhaps a larger reference frame or cartoon model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to provide a clearer perspective.</p><p>3) More extensive discussion on the role of lipid partitioning of toxin constructs. Partition experiments could be conducted on chimeric mutants analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The partition data on these mutants may provide stronger evidence on the existing correlation (or anticorrelation) between lipid partitioning and affinity for the toxin. Such experiments should, in principle, be straightforward.</p><p>4) The question of whether toxin lobes interact intra-molecularly in two-lobe toxin constructs or even inter-molecularly in single-lobe constructs should be addressed. This comment is driven by the expected energies of interactions (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggesting that closed structures (or dimers) should predominate. This would require additional experiments (unless there are inter domain NOEs in the data that has already been collected), although RDC data on the 15N samples already prepared for the HSQC spectra shown in the current manuscript should be relatively straightforward to perform.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11273.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:The paper could and should be made stronger by reexamining the data and providing improved discussions, without additional lengthy experiments. The required revisions fall into four general areas:1) There should be a more extensive comparison of apo and toxin-bound channel structure with emphasis on the potential mechanism of activation.</italic></p><p>We very much appreciate the opportunity to put forward our mechanistic interpretation of the newly refined structural data. At this point, our proposal is necessarily hypothetical, but nevertheless we feel that it will be of interest to the readers, and that it will help design new experimental work.</p><p>Specifically, we have added a new section to the revised version of the manuscript in which we highlight the major differences between these two structures, as well as the mechanism of channel activation that can be inferred from those differences. Given the limited resolution of the structures, we have also evaluated the statistical significance of our key observations using molecular dynamics simulations. MD simulations of apo TRPV1, analogous to those previously presented for the toxin-bound channel, are now also included in our study. A new figure has been added to the revised manuscript to summarize our observations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)</p><p>This comparative analysis indicates that binding of DkTx promotes changes in the transmembrane architecture of the channel that pertain not only to the internal structure of each of the channel subunits, but also to their relative arrangement; as a result, these seemingly highly collective structural changes open up the constrictions observed in the apo state, in the selectivity filter (SF) and the intracellular gate.</p><p>These structural changes appear to be effected through displacements in the pore helix (P) and S6 helices, relative to the S1-S4 unit and the transmembrane segment of S5, both of which are largely unchanged. That the P and S6 helices become displaced, relative to S1-S5, is consistent with the fact that the N-termini of P and S6, respectively, are the primary contacts for the toxin on the channel extracellular surface. The changes in P and S6 within a given subunit correlate very clearly with a pronounced rearrangement of the SF and pore loop in that same subunit, but also with changes in the intracellular side of the channel. The rationale for this remote effect is that the P and S6 helices are the main interfacial elements between adjacent subunits, in the transmembrane region of the channel; therefore, displacements in these elements are propagated to the adjacent subunits, adding to the changes in their own internal structure. As a result, the S1-S4 units (which as mentioned remain largely unchanged) become noticeably displaced relative to each other, thus affecting the crossing angle of helices S5 and S6, and thus the degree of opening of the intracellular gate.</p><p>Very interestingly, the displacements induced by DkTx on the channel main-chain correlate with the disruption of a cluster of hydrophobic interactions behind the SF, at the interface between S5, the pore helix and S6, in close proximity to the contact region with the toxin. This network involves, among others, residues I599, F659 and V595, F649, as well as T650. Only the latter two residues contacts directly DkTx in the toxin-bound structure; however, mutation of any of these residues diminishes DkTx-induced opening of the channel, particularly in the case of I599A, F649A and F659A. Therefore, it seems clear that the stability of this hydrophobic cluster is a determining factor for channel activation. It is tantalizing to speculate that the disruption of this cluster, which implies an increased solvent exposure of more than a dozen hydrophobic side-chains across the four channel subunits, leads not only to the structural changes required to allow for ion permeation, but also to the kind of increase in the heat capacity of the protein that has been postulated to underlie temperature sensing in TRP channels – i.e. the changes just described might explain, at least in part, the temperature dependence of the activation process of TRPV1.</p><p>The relevant changes to the manuscript can be found in the subheading “Membrane partitioning of DkTx” of the Results, paragraphs one to three of the Discussion, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, and are reflected in the new title and Abstract. We also include new data on a toxin mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) to provide experimental support for some residues in the hydrophobic cluster interacting with specific toxin residues.</p><p><italic>2) The discussion on the comparison with other toxins should be removed or it should be clarified, as it is currently confusing. This needs a clearer explanation and perhaps a larger reference frame or cartoon model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to provide a clearer perspective.</italic></p><p>We have revised the text (Discussion), modified the figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and its legend to make it clear that all toxins are shown with the same orientation (by backbone superposition) and that channel binding surfaces are on present on different parts of the toxins.</p><p><italic>3) More extensive discussion on the role of lipid partitioning of toxin constructs. Partition experiments could be conducted on chimeric mutants analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The partition data on these mutants may provide stronger evidence on the existing correlation (or anticorrelation) between lipid partitioning and affinity for the toxin. Such experiments should, in principle, be straightforward.</italic></p><p>We did not originally undertake these experiments because we exhausted our supply of the K1(K2L2) chimera performing functional studies. We synthesized a new batch of this chimera and completed the requested partitioning experiments. Unfortunately they are not very informative. Although these chimeras were originally designed to identify regions in K2 that would enhance the affinity of K1 (gain of function), from the perspective of membrane partitioning they can only be used to identify regions that weaken partitioning (loss of function). The new results show that transfer of the N-terminal residue, or loops 2, 3 or 4, either leave K1’s strong partitioning intact or paradoxically enhance the strength of partitioning. Transfer of the C-terminus greatly reduces the blue shift observed with partitioning, either because it weakens partitioning or because it alters the orientation of the toxin (and the relevant Trp residue) within the membrane. Unfortunately we cannot readily distinguish between these possibilities because the small blue-shift would make it impossible to construct a titration. We include these data in a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and comment briefly on them in the Results section in paragraph one of subheading “Membrane partitioning of DkTx”. Since none of the chimeras weakened the strong partitioning of K1, they don’t provide the basis to establish a correlation or anti-correlation between partitioning and affinity, nor do they define regions of the toxins most important for membrane partitioning.</p><p><italic>4) The question of whether toxin lobes interact intra-molecularly in two-lobe toxin constructs or even inter-molecularly in single-lobe constructs should be addressed. This comment is driven by the expected energies of interactions (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggesting that closed structures (or dimers) should predominate. This would require additional experiments (unless there are inter domain NOEs in the data that has already been collected), although RDC data on the 15N samples already prepared for the HSQC spectra shown in the current manuscript should be relatively straightforward to perform.</italic></p><p>Although the question of whether the lobes interact in the context of the membrane merits further examination, we consider it to be tangential to the current study. This possibility was discussed because we noticed a systematic energy penalty for bivalency in the toxin-membrane interactions, and we felt compelled to comment. We have revised this section to be clear about why we think there may be inter-lobe interactions, despite the fact that we cannot see NOEs in the DkTx spectra. To our thinking, if DkTx containing the natural linker and the version with a 7-Gly linker have the same penalty, it would seem that there must inter-lobe interactions. We no longer have 15N samples to undertake RDC experiments, and we would need to prepare fresh samples, and at least for us, the requested experiments would require considerable optimization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
