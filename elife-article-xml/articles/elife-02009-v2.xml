as no single transport mechanism appears to account for all of the observations. Here, we compare the transport of soluble secretory proteins (albumin and α1-antitrypsin) with that of supramolecular cargoes (e.g., procollagen) that are proposed to traverse the Golgi by compartment progression–maturation. We show that these soluble proteins traverse the Golgi much faster than procollagen while moving through the same stack. Moreover, we present kinetic and morphological observations that indicate that albumin transport occurs by diffusion via intercisternal continuities. These data provide evidence for a transport mechanism that applies to a major class of secretory proteins and indicate the co-existence of multiple intra-Golgi trafficking modes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02009.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02009.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The Golgi is a structure within cells where proteins and other large molecules are modified and prepared for delivery to locations inside or outside of the cell. Each Golgi is made from a stack of flattened sacs called cisternae that are filled with fluid and enclosed by a membrane.</p><p>Proteins and other molecules are transported to the Golgi by packages called vesicles, which fuse with the outermost cisterna, which is known as the ‘cis-face’ of the Golgi, and unload their contents. From here, the proteins are processed and modified by enzymes as they move through the Golgi towards the ‘trans-face’ on the opposite side. The modified proteins are then re-packaged into vesicles before being sent to their intended destinations.</p><p>But how do proteins move through the Golgi? Some researchers have suggested that proteins do not actually move: rather, the stacks of the Golgi move like a conveyer belt as new cisterna are added to the cis-face. However, other researchers have proposed that molecules proceed from one cisterna to the next inside small vesicles. It is also possible that proteins are transported through the Golgi in other ways, or by a combination of two or more methods.</p><p>Now, Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al. reveal that some small, soluble, proteins can move through the Golgi by diffusion. These proteins move much quicker than large protein complexes, which suggests that multiple transport mechanisms do co-exist within the Golgi. Furthermore, Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al. found that these soluble proteins are most likely moving through some narrow tunnel-like connections between the individual cisternae.</p><p>Following on from the work of Beznoussenko, Parashuraman et al., the main challenge is to understand how all the different types of proteins that move through the Golgi are transported—which includes roughly a third of all human proteins. As many of these proteins are important for human health, learning to control their transport might create new opportunities to understand and treat disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02009.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02009.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>intracellular trafficking</kwd><kwd>soluble cargo protein</kwd><kwd>albumin</kwd><kwd>golgi complex</kwd><kwd>membrane tubule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luini</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (Ministry of Education, Research and Universities)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luini</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione Italiana per al Ricerca sul Cancro (FIRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mironov</surname><given-names>Alexandre A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The soluble cargo protein albumin traverses the Golgi stack at much faster rates than procollagen aggregates, by diffusion via intercisternal continuities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly one third of the eukaryotic proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to their cellular destinations through the secretory pathway. Over the years, the general organization of membrane transport along the secretory pathway has been gradually unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mellman and Simons, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellman and Warren, 2000</xref>), and many of the underlying molecular components have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rothman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schekman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emr et al., 2009</xref>). Some key questions, however, remain unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfeffer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>).</p><p>A central issue is how cargo proteins traverse the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malhotra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>), a major transport station composed of stacks of flat membranous cisternae. There are three main anterograde transport mechanisms that are in principle possible and might apply to the Golgi: (a) transport by compartment progression–maturation; (b) transport by dissociative anterograde vesicular carriers and, (c) transport via inter-compartment continuities.</p><p>Among these, the progression–maturation model has gained a degree of consensus as an intra-Golgi traffic mechanism, based on several lines of evidence in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lanoix et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rizzo et al., 2013</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rivera-Molina and Novick, 2009</xref>), algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 1995</xref>), and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donohoe et al., 2013</xref>). Under this model, cargo molecules remain in the lumen of the Golgi cisternae while the cisternae themselves progress through the stack and ‘mature’ through recycling of their resident enzymes. Recently, cisternal progression has been proposed to apply only to the rims (and not to the core) of the cisternae in the mammalian Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the Golgi, the progression–maturation principle appears to be involved in the endocytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>) and the phagocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairn and Grinstein, 2012</xref>) in different species.</p><p>The vesicular transport mechanism, whereby dissociative carriers transport cargoes between successive compartments, operates at many stages of the trafficking pathway and has been proposed to apply also to intra-Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rothman, 2002</xref>). Here, however, the evidence is less direct and less conclusive than at other transport segments, with conflicting claims about the presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orci et al., 2000</xref>) or absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claude, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sabesin and Frase, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Severs and Hicks, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clermont et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Lazzaro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilchrist et al., 2006</xref>) of anterograde cargo proteins in the peri-Golgi carriers. Moreover in particular cases, like in microsporidia, intra-Golgi transport appears to occur without COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Diffusion-based transport via inter-compartment continuities remains the least explored and understood of the traffic mechanisms. Some antecedents, however, are available. Continuity-mediated transport has been observed to occur between endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luzio et al., 2007</xref>), and also the exocytic release of cargo from secretory granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rutter and Hill, 2006</xref>) or synaptic vesicles through transient pores (kiss-and-run) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rizzoli and Jahn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</xref>) at the plasma membrane can be considered to occur via this modality. For intra-Golgi transport, this mechanism has been discussed several times in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mellman and Simons, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weidman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mironov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mironov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>) and a few recent intra-Golgi transport models including the mixing–partitioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>), the kiss-and-run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mironov and Beznoussenko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fusella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mironov et al., 2013</xref>) and the cisternal progenitor schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pfeffer, 2010</xref>) have been proposed that imply transient tubular continuities across cisternae. At the molecular/mechanistic level, Golgi tubule formation has been proposed to be initiated by COPI coatomer-mediated budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), and tubule elongation and fission appear to require the actions of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase-γ (LPAATγ), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">San Pietro et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Recent evidence also points to a role for Golgi localized SNAREs and BARS in the dynamics of the intercisternal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fusella et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the molecular players regulating the intra-Golgi connections remains lacking.</p><p>Altogether, uncertainties remain about the applicability of continuity-based transport to the Golgi. One main reason for this situation has been the long-standing difficulty of demonstrating intercisternal continuities in thin sections for electron microscopy. This obstacle has now been partly overcome by the use of electron tomography and new methods of three dimensional electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>), which have revealed the presence of intercisternal tubular continuities under experimental conditions that favor the detection of these tubules, such as the induction of active trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vivero-Salmeron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">San Pietro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wanner et al., 2013</xref>). The second and main problem, yet to be resolved, is that the mere presence of intercisternal tubules is insufficient to prove a role for these continuities in transport, as these tubules might be too few and unfavorably disposed to support trafficking.</p><p>To test the continuity-based transport model, it is thus necessary to search for functional evidence of a transport role for these continuities. To this end, we have used soluble secretory proteins as transport markers, as these are globular objects of a few nm in diameter that should easily cross the observed intercisternal tubules and rapidly move from the cis to the trans face of an interconnected stack or ribbon. The transport of some soluble proteins has been studied decades ago using electron microscopic autoradiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caro and Palade, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamieson and Palade, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley and Peters, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castle et al., 1972</xref>) and biochemical pulse-chase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamieson and Palade, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lodish et al., 1983</xref>), but their actual mechanism of secretion remains unknown.</p><p>Comparing the trafficking pattern of prototypic soluble proteins with those of cargoes previously proposed to move by cisternal progression–maturation, we find that soluble proteins cross the Golgi stack at a much faster rate, apparently by diffusion along intercisternal connections; and that this transport mode coexists in the same Golgi complex with the much slower intra-Golgi progression of large, non-diffusible cargo, such as procollagen I (PC-I). Soluble secreted proteins are of great physiological interest because they represent a significant portion (possibly more than 10%) of the mammalian proteome and include hormones, growth factors, serum proteins, antibodies, and digestive enzymes. Thus, these results are consistent with a novel mechanism of transport for a major class of secretory proteins, and provide evidence for multiplicity of transport mechanisms that can help to rationalize most of the observed intra-Golgi trafficking patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The experimental system: comparing transport of soluble cargo with that of VSVG and PC</title><p>As prototypes of soluble proteins we used albumin and α1-antitrypsin (hereinafter termed antitrypsin). These are globular, water-soluble proteins roughly 3 nm in diameter that should easily diffuse through the 30–60 nm wide Golgi intercisternal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). Albumin is an abundant, non-glycosylated protein, while antitrypsin is N-glycosylated. The trafficking of soluble proteins (albumin in most experiments) was characterized and compared with that of PC-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weinstock and Leblond, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>) and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>), because these cargoes have been extensively characterized and shown to move by cisternal progression (or rimmal progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>] or compartment progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mironov et al., 2013</xref>]. For the sake of brevity, from now onward we will use the term compartment progression to describe the traffic of procollagen and other similar cargo). Thus, if albumin moves by diffusion via continuities, it should exhibit transport kinetics and patterns different from VSVG and PC-I. PC-I forms large, stable, non-diffusible aggregates that cannot enter tubules or vesicles and cross the Golgi stack in a gradual fashion by compartment progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>); and VSVG is a large trimeric transmembrane viral protein that shows the same trafficking pattern as PC-I, at least under certain specific conditions (see below). In this study, we only used conditions under which VSVG crosses the Golgi by compartment progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Albumin crosses the Golgi stack faster than VSVG and PC: kinetic evidence for fast synchronized albumin movement across progressing cisternae</title><p>We first compared the kinetics of intra-Golgi transport of albumin with those of VSVG and PC-I in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line that secretes both albumin and antitrypsin. To assess traffic rates, we used synchronization techniques by which cargoes can be arrested in the intermediate compartment (IC), and then released, to monitor their synchronous passage through the secretory system.</p><p>To compare albumin with VSVG, HepG2 cells were infected with VSV and subjected to the following synchronization protocol (protocol 2, 'Materials and methods'): the secretory pathway was first cleared of cargo by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX); and then CHX was removed at 15°C. At this temperature albumin and VSVG were re-synthesized relatively efficiently, and were then transported to, and arrested in, the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, the 15°C transport block was removed by shifting the temperature to 32°C, to allow the synchronous passage of albumin and VSVG from the IC to and through the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, this protocol does not seriously overload/perturb the secretory pathway since, under similar conditions, the Golgi complex has been shown to maintain a normal structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). To monitor cargo passage, we used both immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) and immuno-fluorescence.</p><p>By immuno-EM, albumin was seen at time 0 (i.e., at end of the 15°C block) in the ER and IC at similar levels, with very little in the Golgi stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, green arrowheads). An earlier study had shown that a soluble protein (soluble secretory GFP) concentrates in the IC/Golgi area at 15°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blum et al., 2000</xref>); however, no EM experiments were carried out to verify the localization. Using immuno-EM, we do not observe any such concentration of albumin in the Golgi after the 15°C block (time 0). Albumin is clearly restricted to the ER and IC, and absent from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,I,L</xref>). Within 2 min of release from the 15°C block, albumin entered and filled the entire Golgi, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN), with apparently similar levels throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,I</xref>). After 5 min at 32°C, the distribution of albumin had not changed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F,I</xref>), while at 10 min, albumin was higher in the TGN than in the cis cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,I</xref>). Then (by 20 min), albumin began to exit the Golgi, as indicated by its diminishing overall levels in the Golgi stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J,L</xref>).

As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>), at time 0, VSVG was depleted in the ER, concentrated in the IC, and nearly absent in the Golgi stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,K</xref>). 2 min after the 15°C block release, VSVG was still mostly in IC elements adjacent to the cis-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,K</xref>), and at 5 min it had reached only the first cis-cisterna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F,K</xref>). Later, VSVG gradually reached the medial and then the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,K</xref>). Thus, VSVG moves gradually through the stack in over 15 min, consistent with the compartment progression trafficking mechanism, as expected under these synchronization conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>For immunofluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we monitored arrival of both VSVG and albumin at the cis- and trans-Golgi by determining their degree of co-localization with cis- and trans-Golgi markers (GM130 and TGN46, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). This is feasible because cis- and trans-Golgi markers can be resolved (to a large though not complete extent) by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shima et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>) ('Materials and methods'). Albumin showed a diffuse ER-like distribution at time 0, with no clear Golgi staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); then, 2 min after the release of the 15°C block, albumin entered the Golgi stack and co-localized to the same extent with both GM130 and TGN46 (i.e., it reached both the cis and trans areas, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the ER was still not completely empty. After 5–10 min, albumin had completely left the ER and now localized mostly in the Golgi, where its levels declined in the cis-Golgi, while they remained high in the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), compatible with rapid albumin diffusion through the stack followed by concentration in the TGN. Thus, the export of albumin out of the ER was very efficient, so that by 10 min after the release of the temperature block almost all of the protein had been transported to the Golgi apparatus. Antitrypsin showed very similar distribution and trafficking patterns to albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>VSVG, instead, showed a punctate (IC-like) distribution at 15°C, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After the release of the block, VSVG reached the cis-Golgi first (at 5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and then later, with a lag of 10–15 min, it arrived at the TGN, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, this is compatible with compartment progression, and is in agreement with the immuno-EM data.</p><p>Next, we compared albumin and PC-I. We expressed albumin in professional PC-I secretory cells (human fibroblasts) by microinjecting albumin cDNA in the nucleus and subjecting the cells to the synchronization protocol 1 ('Materials and methods'). A limited but sufficient fraction of injected cells expressed albumin. At 15°C (time 0), albumin was mostly diffuse in the ER (as seen in HepG2 cells), while PC-I was seen in scattered fluorescent ‘spots’ (presumably PC-I aggregates within the IC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). We then increased the temperature to 32°C. In these cells, the PC-I trafficking pattern has been characterized extensively in previous studies: PC-I arrives at the cis-Golgi from the IC in 2–3 min and later progresses to the TGN by compartment progression in 12–15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we confirmed that within 3 min after the release of the 15°C block, PC-I aggregates reach the Golgi area but not the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>); and by correlative light-immuno-EM (CLEM), we further confirmed that at this time PC-I aggregates reach the cis but not the distal cisternae, well in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). In the same cells, by contrast, albumin filled the Golgi stack rapidly, as in HepG2 cells: at 3 min, it already co-localized with the TGN marker TGN46 (by immunofluorescence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>) and, by EM, it filled the Golgi stacks from cis to trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kinetic patterns of synchronized transport of albumin and PC-I through the Golgi stack.</title><p>Human fibroblast cells were microinjected in the nucleus with cDNA for albumin and incubated for 2 hr before further treatments.

Albeit relatively mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>), the traffic synchronization protocols that were applied here might ‘overload’ the secretory pathway. We therefore sought to examine the transport patterns of albumin and PC in cells at steady-state. This can be achieved using GFP-tagged cargoes in living HeLa cells ('Materials and methods'), which offer controlled expression conditions.</p><p>GFP-albumin showed steady-state Golgi localization and secretory behavior similar to that of native albumin in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that this construct can be used as an albumin tracer. Moreover, a characterization of the GFP-albumin dynamics in HeLa cells based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>), showed that this construct enters and exits the Golgi with half-times of about 3–4 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and diffuses ‘horizontally’ along the Golgi ribbon in seconds, as expected from its soluble nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We thus proceeded to assess the steady-state transport behavior of GFP-albumin, and to compare it with that of PC. To this end, we bleached the Golgi area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and monitored the time for arrival of GFP-albumin from the ER at the cis-Golgi and at the trans-Golgi (again by quantifying its co-localization with GM130 and TGN46; see above and 'Materials and methods') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). After 1–2 min (i.e., the earliest time at which GFP-albumin had recovered to detectable levels in the Golgi stack) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), GFP-albumin had reached both the cis-Golgi and the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>); in fact, it showed a slightly higher degree of co-localization with TGN46 than with GM130 (using the unbiased co-localization Method 2 based on automatic thresholding; see 'Materials and methods'), indicating that it had already traversed the Golgi stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, quantification in J). Later (3 min post-bleaching), the GFP-albumin signal became slightly higher in the trans<italic>-</italic> than the cis-Golgi, and at 12 min (when recovery was nearly complete), it was clearly higher in the trans<italic>-</italic> than the cis-Golgi (as seen before bleaching, with a ratio of about 1.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). To control for the possibility that part of the fluorescence signal recovered in the Golgi area might come from the underlying ER, we repeated this experiment using nocodazole-induced ministacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I,K</xref>), where the cis and trans-Golgi markers are resolved better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shima et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>) and the very low background fluorescence of the ER present in the cellular periphery allows a better resolution of Golgi fluorescence. The results were very similar to those obtained with the intact ribbon. Next, to confirm these results by EM we resorted to GFP-photooxidation followed by CLEM experiments. For photooxidation studies, the same experiments as those described above were carried out, and the cells were fixed 2 min after photobleaching, when GFP-albumin fluorescence had recovered in the Golgi. Then, the newly arrived fluorescent protein in the Golgi was excited in the presence of DAB under conditions that favor the photo-oxidation reaction and the formation of DAB electron dense precipitates in the close vicinity of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grabenbauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meiblitzer-Ruppitsch et al., 2008</xref>) ('Materials and methods').

It is important to note here that the quantities of antitrypsin and VSVG present are very similar suggesting that the difference in the transport behavior of these proteins is not due to differences in their abundance. In addition, as mentioned in the text, the transport behaviors of antitrypsin and albumin are similar, reiterating further that the differences in the transport behavior between soluble secretory cargoes (albumin and antitrypsin) and VSVG/PC is possibly not due to the differences in their abundance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02009.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02009.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02009-fig3-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To monitor the behavior of PC under similar conditions, we used HeLa cells transfected with GFP-tagged PC-III (a homotrimer that forms large aggregates in the Golgi complex like PC-I, and in general behaves like PC-1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perinetti et al., 2009</xref>] and 'Materials and methods'). A limited but sufficient number of cells expressed this cargo. We then bleached the whole Golgi area and monitored the rate of entry of PC-III-GFP into the Golgi complex from the ER. PC-III behaved as expected from our previous experiments on PC-I trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). At 3 min post-bleaching, some PC-III-GFP aggregates (in the form of distinct bright puncta) had already entered the Golgi area, but had not reached the TGN (i.e., did not co-localize with TGN46) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,N</xref>). Later (at 9 min), many more PC-III-GFP aggregates had reached the Golgi stack and some of these co-localized with TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M,N</xref>), confirming that PC-III, like PC-I, enters the Golgi and then moves gradually to the TGN, consistent with compartment progression and different from the albumin transport pattern.</p><p>We also monitored whether the fast transport of soluble cargoes by diffusion is coupled to their processing by Golgi enzymes. To this end, the biochemical maturation of antitrypsin was monitored by the pulse chase assay. Antitrypsin was processed efficiently by Golgi enzymes, as evidenced by increased apparent molecular weight of the protein, with a kinetics reflecting that measured by microscopy-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the same experiments, VSVG acquired endo-H resistance at a markedly slower rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the Golgi residence time of soluble cargo appears to be sufficient for complete glycosylation. Possibly, the high surface/volume ratio of the flat Golgi cisternae maximizes the contact, and hence the efficiency of the reaction, between cargo and enzymes.</p><p>In summary, extensive kinetic evidence obtained under both traffic-synchronization and steady-state conditions shows the coexistence of two different intra-Golgi trafficking behaviors (and hence, presumably, different mechanisms) for different cargo types. PC-I (also PC-III) and VSVG enter the Golgi stack and move gradually from cis to trans, consistent with compartment progression, while albumin equilibrates rapidly across the Golgi compartments. The latter behavior is consistent with diffusion via intercisternal continuities. However, purely kinetic data cannot exclude that other mechanisms, such as fast vesicular shuttling, might lead to the same traffic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</xref>). To distinguish between diffusion- and vesicle-based traffic, we used both morphological and computational approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Albumin is depleted in Golgi vesicles and is present in Golgi intercisternal tubules</title><p>We first examined the Golgi structure in HepG2 cells at steady-state, with a focus on vesicles and tubules, using EM tomography. The Golgi stacks in HepG2 cells comprise 4–6 cisternae that were flanked by vesicles and connected side-by-side by ‘longitudinal’ tubules and fenestrated membranes, as seen in many other cell types. Some longitudinal tubules were Y-shaped and connected heterologous cisternae in neighboring stacks (not shown), in agreement with previous descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, successive cisternae within individual stacks were sometimes connected by tubules that appeared to be oriented in the cis-trans direction (‘vertical’ tubules) and that were distributed apparently randomly at all levels of the stack, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). These vertical tubules were often convoluted (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), and had calibers ranging from 30 to 60 nm. The number of intercisternal connections between heterologous cisternae across the Golgi stack was highly variable. In HepG2 cells, each stack had about 5 ± 2 intercisternal connections (calculated as described in 'Materials and methods'). When a complete tomographic reconstruction of a tubule was possible, it was always found that the tubule was connected to a cisterna (not shown) in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). A few narrow continuities joining the central areas of adjacent cisternae were also observed (not shown). Similar results were obtained using both chemical fixing and high-pressure freezing (not shown). For comparison, we also examined the Golgi in rat liver. The vertical and Y-shaped tubules were similar to those in HepG2 (not shown).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>EM tomography facilitates the visualization of convoluted intercisternal tubules.</title><p>HepG2 cells were high-pressure frozen and prepared for EM tomography ('Materials and methods').

Albumin was scarce in the ER (not shown) and dense in the stacks, and even denser in the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C,G,I</xref>). A similar distribution was also found in rat hepatocytes with a slightly higher concentration of albumin in Golgi and TGN (not shown). The distribution of antitrypsin was indistinguishable from that of albumin (not shown). For comparison, VSVG was markedly more concentrated in the TGN than in the stack (except in cells expressing high levels of VSVG, where the stacks were filled with this cargo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D,H,J</xref>); and PC-I aggregates (in human fibroblasts) were also much more numerous in the TGN than in the Golgi stack (not shown). Thus, a large fraction of VSVG and PC-I in the Golgi area was located in the TGN. Next, we focused on the distribution of cargo in Golgi tubules and vesicles. We first examined the albumin content of Golgi vesicles (defined as round, 50–60 nm-wide profiles near the Golgi stack; see 'Materials and methods') by immuno-EM. The vesicular profiles were markedly depleted of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, arrows, and 5k for quantification).

We sought to resolve this discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data by examining the conditions of the in vitro preparation. COPI vesicles were purified exactly as described by Rothman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malhotra et al., 1989</xref>). Their study used the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPγS to increase the yield of vesicles in vitro. It was later shown, however, that GTPγS also affects the sorting of cargo into vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanoix et al., 1999</xref>). We thus examined the effects of GTPγS, and we show here that while COPI-coated vesicles that are formed in the presence of GTPγS contained significant levels of albumin, those that are formed in the absence of GTPγS were depleted of albumin, in line with our in vivo data. The exclusion of soluble proteins from vesicles has been reported before (e.g., of proinsulin from KDEL-receptor-containing vesicles; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57a">Orci et al., 1997</xref>]); however, the mechanism of exclusion remains unclear.

In random, thin sections for immuno-EM, tubules appear as elongated variably oriented tubular–ovoidal profiles in the vicinity of the stack ('Materials and methods'). These profiles contained albumin at a similar density to that seen in the cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, arrowheads, quantified in K), independently of their orientation (parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the cisternae) (see below). For comparison, we also examined VSVG. This cargo has been previously shown to be depleted in Golgi vesicles and, to a lesser extent, in tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). We confirmed that VSVG is lower in both vesicular and tubular peri-Golgi profiles than in cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then attempted to visualize albumin in complete vertical tubular connections. This experiment presented serious difficulties because: (a) most connections are convoluted and cannot be included in single thin sections; and, (b) even relatively ‘linear’ continuities are very unlikely to be cut through their entire length at random (here, a reasonable expectation is that less than one connection may be found in hundred sections, assuming six connections per stack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>]). An additional difficulty is that the tubular membranes are often cut obliquely at some point along their length, resulting in defective membrane visualization. We sought to overcome these problems by (a) cutting several hundreds of individual thin sections, as well as several serial sections, to find at least a few complete inter-cisternal connections, and, (b) combining tomography with albumin labeling by photo-oxidation and cryo-immuno EM. Using the first approach, we succeeded in visualizing a few tubular connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>) that showed continuity across heterologous cisternae (see legend to these figures). These connections contained albumin at roughly the same level as in cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>). Moreover, the tomography- and photooxidation-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meiblitzer-Ruppitsch et al., 2008</xref>) also indicated that albumin is present in the connecting tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4</xref>).</p><p>In sum, despite the technical difficulties, the data are consistent with the notion that albumin is depleted in peri-Golgi vesicles and it is present in Golgi intercisternal tubules at levels similar to those seen in cisternae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Computational comparison of vesicle-based with diffusion-based models of intra-Golgi transport</title><p>To further distinguish between continuity-based and vesicle-based albumin transport, we then used two computational models. These models were constructed to assess whether the equilibration of albumin at the observed rates (within 1–2 min) through a closed system with a stack-like geometry (defined using morphological parameters derived from our observations) could be best explained by a scheme based on simple diffusion of albumin between the cisternae through tubules without biasing forces, or by a scheme based on vesicular transport. Notably, these models are limited to simulating intra-Golgi equilibration of cargoes and do not aim to simulate the entire traffic process through the Golgi including cargo arrival, departure and intra Golgi concentration steps.</p><p>For diffusion-based transport, we simulated albumin diffusion through either one stack or through Golgi ribbons made of three to five longitudinally connected stacks containing vertical intercisternal tubules ('Materials and methods' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

Also of note, even when connectivity gaps at any level of a stack are simulated, these gaps can be compensated for by the presence of connections at the same level in neighboring stacks longitudinally joined in Golgi ribbons, and/or by the fact that these gaps might be transient, i.e., that connections might form and disassemble rapidly (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Computational simulations of intra-Golgi transport of albumin by diffusion via intercisternal tubules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Golgi stack was modeled as a system of six circular cisternae connected in series by five (one per pair of cisternae) vertical cylindrical tubules. (<bold>B</bold>) The same stack drawn in a ‘distended’ disposition. The size of the cisternae was set to 1.5 μm diameter and 30 nm thickness, and the diameter and length of the tubules to 30 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The simulations started with the first cisterna (<italic>cis</italic>) filled with albumin (black shading) and all of the others empty (no shading). Albumin was then allowed to diffuse through the connections until it asymptotically reached equilibrium (gray shading in all cisternae). The variations with time in the albumin concentrations in the other cisternae were calculated for the center of the cisternae (see below). For wider tubule diameters of 60 nm and 120 nm, the 90% threshold of equilibrium was reached after 7.8 s and 6.8 s compared to 14.9 s for the 30 nm diameter. For shorter and longer tubules of 30 nm diameter with 50 nm and 150 nm lengths, the 90% threshold of equilibrium was reached after 11.4 s and 19.1 s. When assuming a system composed only of four circular cisternae, the 90% threshold of equilibrium in the fourth cisternae was reached after 3.4 s (60 nm diameter, 100 nm length) and 3.0 s (120 nm diameter, 100 nm length) compared to 6.4 s for the 30 nm diameter tubules.

Each stack contained 4 to 6 cisternae, each with a diameter of 1.5 microns and a thickness of 30 nm. The vesicles were spherical, with a diameter of 50–70 nm. The simulations started with only the first cisterna filled with albumin (black), and all the others empty (white). Albumin transport is considered to proceed stepwise, where each step is defined as one vesicle detaching from each cisterna and fusing with an adjacent one. The albumin concentration in the vesicles is always assumed to be the same as in the cisterna from where they originated. The albumin concentration in the various cisternae is expressed as a function of the numbers of steps (per cisterna, as defined above). Two scenarios were considered. (<bold>A</bold>) In the first, cargo is exchanged between the neighboring cisternae by anterograde as well as retrograde vesicles. This means that the first and last cisternae exchange one vesicle each at every step, while the other cisternae exchange two vesicles. This is required for the cisternal volumes to be kept constant. In this simulation, 50% and 90% equilibrium were reached after 3948 and 8846 steps per cisterna, respectively (for comparison, 282 and 933 steps are required for 50% and 90% equilibrium across only two cisternae). For larger vesicles with diameters of 60 nm and 70 nm 90% equilibrium is reached with fewer steps (5119 and 3224, respectively). However, experimental observations indicate a range of vesicle diameter from 50 nm to 70 nm, so for our calculations described below we considered the vesicle diameter to be 60 nm. (<bold>B</bold>) The second scenario represents the steady-state situation where only anterograde transport vesicles are considered. Here, in each step, one vesicle detaches from each cisterna and fuses with the next one. The volume constancy of the system is maintained by a vesicle coming into the first cisterna at each step (containing the same albumin concentration as the first cisterna), and by an identical vesicle exiting the last cisterna. Here, 50% and 90% equilibrium are reached after 3785 and 6474 steps using 50 nm diameter vesicles (compared to 563 and 1865 steps for only two cisternae). (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) Changes in albumin concentration in cisternae 2, 4, and 6, expressed as fractions of the concentrations in the same cisterna at equilibrium, as a function of the number of steps, for the scenarios in <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, respectively. All these simulations were performed using the MATLAB software and the script Skript3_Golgi_vesicular_transport.m is provided as supporting material.</p><p>Based on the above numbers, the model (scenario ‘a’ is considered here and the results are similar also with scenario ‘b’) predicts that close to 5119 vesicle budding/fusion steps per cisterna are required for 90% equilibration of albumin across the stack, considering 60 nm diameter vesicle, 6 cisternae per stack and the concentration of albumin in vesicles as same as that of the cisterna. Our own observations indicate that the concentration of albumin in the vesicles is 20% of that present in cisterna (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), so approximately 25,000 steps per cisterna are needed for 90% equilibration of albumin across the stack. Since such equilibration happens in less than 2 min (we consider 2 min here, for simplicity), each cisterna has to bud (and fuse with) close to 12,500 vesicles per min or about 200 per s. Based on these numbers one can calculate the turnover of a cisternal rim assuming that: (<bold>A</bold>) the diameter of an ‘ideal’ cisterna in the mammalian Golgi to be 1500 nm, and therefore the perimeter of the cisterna to be approximately 4700 nm, and, (<bold>B</bold>) vesicles are formed from the whole perimeter (or rim) of the cisterna, then a maximum of 78 vesicles of 60 nm diameter (4700/60) can bud from the rim of each cisterna at any given time. Thus, the budding (and fusing) of 78 vesicles can be considered one event of turnover of the cisternal rim. Thus, a rim, in order to produce 12,500 vesicles per min, has to turnover (12,500/78) 160 times per min i.e., once every 400 ms, or in other words, the rim turns over 2.5 times per second. On varying the diameter of the vesicle from 50 to 70 nm this value ranges from 4 to 2 times per second for a stack with 6 cisternae (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for the results of these calculations). Since the typical Golgi of the HeLa cells that we used for live imaging studies contained 4 cisternae, we also simulated vesicle-mediated transport across such a Golgi. Based on the results of this simulation described earlier, the calculated turnover rate of cisternal rims varies between 2 and 1 times per second for a stack with 4 cisternae (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Thus for a range of parameters used for the simulation (variations in number of cisterna, vesicle diameter and bidirectional or unidirectional vesicle transport), the calculated turnover time of a cisternal rim ranges between 250 and 1000 ms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) i.e., turnover of the cisternal rims ranges from 4 to 1 times per second.</p><p>Regardless of the mode of intra-Golgi transport, if we match these numbers with published observations about the Golgi, we can then ask whether this vesicle-based turnover rates are possible/realistic or else. Actually, there are a few experimental observations, which, in the light of these calculations, indicate that a role of vesicles in albumin transport is not tenable:</p><p>1) One is qualitative and is about the images of budding/fusing vesicles in Golgi stacks observed by electron microscopy. Thus, if each cisternal rim generates 200 vesicles (and fuses with 200 vesicles) per second then one would expect to see signs of this enormous budding and fusion activity at the cisternae. This is, however, clearly not the case. The Golgi cisternae look rather 'quiet', with fairly rare images of budding or fusion.</p><p>2) Another observation is quantitative and is based on the association-dissociation rate of the Arf/COPI complex at the Golgi in living cells. The life cycle of a COPI-dependent vesicle is schematically comprised of the following steps: exchange of GDP/GTP on Arf, association of Arf-GTP and COPI with the membrane of cisternal rims, budding, fission, and uncoating of the vesicle (which is initiated by GTP hydrolysis on Arf and the consequent dissociation of Arf from the vesicle membrane), and then docking and fusion of the vesicle with the next cisterna. At the uncoating stage, Arf and COPI are shed from the vesicle and become cytosolic. Thus, the on- and off-rate of Arf/COPI at the Golgi (or at least of the portion of Arf/COPI that is involved in forming vesicles at the rims) should reflect the overall turnover of the vesicles. Hence, if the rimmal membrane turns over (i.e., turns into vesicles and fuses with an equivalent number of vesicles) 2.5 times per second, then the portion of Arf/COPI coat that is located at the rims should cycle, i.e., detach from (and attach to) the rim membrane at the same rate, namely, 2.5 times per second. As noted, these considerations are valid only for the fraction of Arf and COPI that participate in vesicle formation at the rim, rather than for the total Golgi Arf and COPI pool; however, the available evidence indicates that a sizable fraction of the Golgi-associated Arf/COPI is located at the cisternal rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oprins et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weidman, 1995</xref>). Hence, a substantial portion of the Golgi-associated Arf/COPI pool would be predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport to associate with and detach from the rimmal membrane 2.5 times per second. Hence, the vesicular model of albumin transport predicts that a substantial portion of Golgi-associated Arf/COPI pool would associate with and detach from the rimmal membrane 2.5 times per second.</p><p>The rate of association/dissociation of Arf and COPI with/from the Golgi complex has been measured in living cells by FRAP and FLIP video microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>), and its value has been used as a descriptor of the molecular process of Arf and COPI binding to, and dissociating from, the Golgi membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>). It turns out that the Arf/COPI dissociation/association rate at the Golgi is mono-exponential with a half time of 15 s for Arf and 35 s for COPI, and that similar values apply to the dissociation of Arf/COPI in the presence of BFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>). These rates are orders of magnitude slower than those predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport (notably, the process underlying these slow rates remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>]). Hence, the major fast cycling subpopulation predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport is not detected. We conclude that this subpopulation of Arf and COPI does not exist, and that the vesicular model of albumin transport is incompatible with the available data.</p><p>These data and arguments rule out, or at least strongly militate against, the possibility that Golgi vesicles turn over fast enough to mediate the rapid intra-Golgi transport of albumin. A further consideration that argues against a vesicular turnover rate as fast as that predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport is based on the comparison between this predicted rate and the rate that is experimentally observed for the formation of other coated (e.g, clathrin- or COPII-coated) vesicles, in other cellular locations. The rates of formation of these vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thor et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinman et al., 1976</xref>) and even of synaptic vesicles at one of the fastest brain synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2006</xref>), are order of magnitudes lower than those predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport. Such a difference, while formally possible, would be quite surprising.</p><p>Given the above considerations, we conclude that the most parsimonious interpretation of the data is that the bulk of the trafficking of albumin through the Golgi is mediated not by the vesicles but by intercisternal tubules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02009.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02009.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02009-fig6-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.018</object-id><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Computer-simulated model of the formation of a pH gradient between continuous <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi cisternae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The model is based on three proton-handling components in the stack (the size and geometry of which are as defined in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): proton pumps located in the <italic>trans</italic>-most cisterna (cisterna 1: swirls), proton channels located in all of the other cisternae (cisternae 2–6: red circles), and a proton buffering system (made up of proteins and/or lipids; dashes) that decreases the diffusion coefficient of protons moving through the system. For modeling, the initial luminal pH was set to be identical to the cytosolic pH (set at 7.0). When the pumps start working (activity of pumps: 10 protons/s in total; modeled on four pumps), the proton concentration in the lumen of the <italic>trans</italic>-most cisterna (cisterna 1) starts increasing locally. Protons then start diffusing towards the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi pole (cisterna 6). Their diffusion is slowed down by the proton buffering system (proteins and lipids).

Moreover, as the protons move, they encounter the proton channels present in cisternae 2 to 6, through which they can leak out into the extra-luminal space, resulting in a pH gradient across the Golgi stack. The rate of leakage is assumed to be linearly dependent on the difference between the proton concentrations in the lumen and in the cytosol (zero leakage for an internal pH of 7.0, and a leakage of 1.4 protons/s/channel for an internal pH of 6.0; the model assumes two channels per cisterna). The energy needed to generate the gradient comes from the ATP consumed by the proton pumps. The steepness and shape of the gradient depend on the interplay among these three defined proton-handling mechanisms.

(Assuming a diffusion coefficient of 100 µm<sup>2</sup>/s would result in a proton pump rate of 100 protons/s and a leakage rate of 14 protons/s at an internal pH of 6.0, and the time scale in the Figure would range from 0 to 6 s.

This fast diffusion-based transport coexists in the same Golgi stacks with the slower movement of supramolecular cargo such as PC by compartment progression.</p><p>Three lines of evidence (kinetic, morphological, and computational) converge to support the notion of continuity-based transport. The kinetic evidence, which consists of the observation that albumin traverses the stack in less than 2 min, at least fivefold to sixfold faster than PC, is consistent with diffusional transport, a fast process over short distances. It cannot, however, exclude in principle a role for other (potentially) rapid transport processes such as intercisternal shuttling by COPI-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, further discriminating evidence is required. The morphological experiments show that Golgi vesicles are depleted (80%) of albumin while Golgi intercisternal tubules appear to contain albumin at similar levels as those seen in cisternae. Published biochemical studies concur with this depletion in vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sonnichsen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilchrist et al., 2006</xref>) indicating that the observed depletion is not an artifact of reduced epitope presentation in the vesicles. These observations therefore favor a role for tubular continuities, over vesicles, in albumin transport. Clearly, the albumin depletion in vesicles is difficult to reconcile with the extreme efficiency of the intra-Golgi albumin transport. Moreover, computational models of intra-Golgi transport by diffusion show that tubules, even when very few and transient, are sufficient to mediate the observed fast rate of albumin transport through the stack. Instead, models of vesicular transport show that Golgi vesicles would have to form and fuse at rates of hundreds of vesicles per cisterna per second, and hence that cisternal rims would have to turnover several times per second, to mediate albumin transport (see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for a detailed discussion of this point). These computational results appear difficult to reconcile with at least two lines of experimental evidence: (a) with such rates of vesicle formation/fusion, there should be morphological signs of such an enormous activity; however, cisternae look quiet, with fairly rare images of budding or fusion; and, (b) if cisternal rims turned over a few times per second as a result of vesicle budding, then the vesicular coat protein COPI (or at least a substantial subpopulation of COPI) should cycle on and off the Golgi complex at similar rates, i.e., roughly three times per second; however, the half-time of COPI dissociation from the Golgi complex is roughly 35 s in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Presley et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, the vesicle turnover rates calculated to be required for albumin transport are orders of magnitude higher than those experimentally observed for any other type of coated vesicles at any cellular location including endocytic vesicles (about 2 pinocytic vesicles per second per macrophage cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinman et al., 1976</xref>]) or fast neuronal synapses that form close to 1–15 endocytic vesicles per second per synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2006</xref>) or COPII vesicles (about 0.3 vesicles per exit site per second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thor et al., 2009</xref>]).</p><p>Collectively, these considerations indicate that the simplest scheme to accommodate all of the available evidence on albumin intra-Golgi transport is one in which this soluble cargo reaches the cis-Golgi via the IC and diffuses rapidly across the Golgi stack in the cis-trans direction through (most probably transient) intercisternal tubules and concentrates on the trans-side. At the same time, non-diffusible cargoes that cannot enter intercisternal tubules (such as PC-I) traverse the stack slowly, by progression–maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). As noted earlier, continuity-mediated transport has been proposed to occur also in the endo-lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luzio et al., 2007</xref>) and during the release of synaptic vesicles through flickering pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rizzoli and Jahn, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the questions raised by the cargo diffusion model, one concerns the functional significance of its coexistence with maturation. We suggest that each process optimizes the transport of different cargo classes endowed with specific physical properties. For instance, PC-I forms aggregates in the early Golgi (or earlier) and is efficiently transported in this condensed state by compartment progression. Albumin and possibly other abundant serum proteins, instead, move from the ER to the Golgi in a soluble state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oprins et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, once at the Golgi, these proteins diffuse rapidly via continuities away from the cis-Golgi towards the TGN, where they are concentrated and exported. Existence of different modes of transport possibly also gives the cell/organism flexibility to switch between modes of transport depending on the cargoes being transported in a certain physiological or developmental stage. For example, during the spermatid development there is a clear increase in the proliferation of intracisternal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vivero-Salmeron et al., 2008</xref>) that we propose may coincide with an increase in the transport of cargoes that depend on diffusional mode of transport.</p><p>The second question raised by the cargo diffusion model is how the Golgi maintains its compositional polarity in the presence of continuities and does not collapse to form one larger compartment. Several possibilities can be hypothesized. For instance, the collapse of connected cisternae may be prevented by scaffolds that maintain cisternal geometry, or it might actually tend to occur, but at a rate that is too slow compared to the half-life of transient continuities. Regarding domain segregation within continuous compartments, there are several known prior examples. They include the ER, with its rough and smooth domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992</xref>), the neuronal plasma membrane, with different compositions in the soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradke and Dotti, 2000</xref>), and even the cytosol, where gradients of calcium and other second messengers are continuously created and maintained across different cytosolic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zaccolo et al., 2002</xref>). In most cases, the molecular basis for domain segregation is ill-understood, with a few possible exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zaccolo et al., 2002</xref>). For the Golgi complex, multiple such domain-generating mechanisms might exist, and they might be based on: (a) the small size and the transiency of intercisternal tubules, which might act as filters by remaining open for a time sufficient for the passage of molecules such as albumin that would rapidly diffuse through the tubes, but not for that of larger molecules, such as lipid rafts, or protein clusters, which would be retarded by the small size and curvature of the tubes; (b) the arrival at the cis- and trans-Golgi poles of membranes of markedly different compositions and thicknesses from the ER and from endosomes, with the consequent creation of a cis-to-trans lipid compositional gradient through which Golgi resident enzymes may distribute differentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>); (c) the action of cytosolic scaffolds to nucleate different domains in different cisternae; and, (d) the action of intralumenal buffering and pumping systems to create gradients of ions, such as calcium and protons, in a fashion similar to that described for cytosolic messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarron et al., 2006</xref>) (a quantitative model of this last mechanism and a further discussion of diffusion via continuities are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Clearly, much work is needed to clarify whether and how some of these mechanisms apply.</p><p>Another point of consideration while discussing the cargo diffusion model is the possible relationship between intra-Golgi transport and Golgi export, although a detailed analysis of the mode of albumin export is beyond the scope of this study. Earlier biochemical and our own imaging studies have shown that small soluble cargoes are cleared from the cells quite rapidly and a pH gradient is necessary for such an efficient export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yilla et al., 1993</xref>) (our unpublished data). Moreover, we show that albumin is concentrated in the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), and that this concentration most likely depends on the low TGN pH, as it is abolished by concanamycin, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump that operates in the TGN (not shown). Thus, the pH-dependent concentration of albumin on the trans-side of the stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) appears to be an important driving force for albumin export in that it imparts some sort of directionality to the movement of this cargo by increasing the probability of cargo molecules to localize in the TGN vs the CGN. Based on the above collective considerations and the current results, a hypothetical transport model for albumin might be delineated as follows: albumin reaches rapidly the Golgi from the ER, where it diffuses rapidly across the stack at a rate dependent on the number and transiency of the connections, accumulating in the low pH trans-Golgi compartments. This intra-Golgi equilibration of albumin is fast and hence unlikely to be rate-limiting for export out of the Golgi (differing in this regard from the slower transport of larger cargo such as PC-I which takes 10–15 min to cross and exit the stack). Rather, export is likely to depend on the rate of formation of the export carriers and on the concentration of albumin in these carriers, which, as noted, depends on the TGN pH. A notable consequence of this is that the export efficiency of other soluble cargoes might vary as a function of their propensity to concentrate in the TGN at low pH. The mechanism by which a low pH increases the albumin concentration in the TGN is unknown. On a speculative plane, at low pH, albumin might bind with increased affinity to a TGN protein or lipid, resulting in enhanced concentration and sorting into export carriers. Under these conditions albumin might also tend to self-aggregate, increasing concentration, and sorting efficiency. Interestingly, under the vesicular transport model, concentration in the TGN could be achieved by directional vesicle-mediated transport in a pH-independent way. Thus, the fact that export is pH-dependent is a further indication in favor of the diffusion-based mechanism.</p><p>Finally, one may ask whether the coexistence of diffusion- and maturation-based mechanisms might help to rationalize the observation of different intra-Golgi trafficking patterns for various cargo proteins and under different conditions. Clearly, the trafficking of large non-diffusible cargoes (e.g., PC-I) and that of soluble proteins (e.g., albumin) is explained in a simple way by the above dual transport scheme. The case of VSVG, a trimeric transmembrane protein, is more complex, in that this cargo has been reported to either progress gradually through the stack like PC-I (here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>), or to spread rapidly from cis to trans cisternae like albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>), depending on experimental conditions. Here, a simple explanation would be that this dual behavior might depend on the ability of VSVG to exist in two states, an ‘aggregated’ one, in which it would form large clusters that behave like PC-I (as proposed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffiths et al., 1985</xref>), and a diffusible one (mono/oligomers) that behaves like albumin. Under this assumption, which remains to be verified, also the dual behavior of VSVG could be accommodated by our two-mechanisms scheme.</p><p>The coexistence of multiple transport principles, involves a loss of simplicity and elegance compared to a single general mechanism. Nevertheless, evidence that multiple cargo transfer strategies are used in the secretory and endo-lysosomal pathways is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luzio et al., 2007</xref>) and the observation of different cargo transport rates for different cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) concurs well with the notion of multiple transport mechanisms. It is unclear whether the mechanisms so far described represent the full range of the existing transport strategies. The complete scenario will probably emerge through studies of further cargoes and trafficking steps in suitable cell types. Highly secreting cells, including certain cancer lines, might preferentially use one rather than another traffic mechanism. Uncovering the diversity of the trafficking modes will enhance our ability to understand and selectively manipulate different cargo classes, for research or therapy purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, DNA constructs, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>HepG2 human hepatoma and HeLa cells (both from ATCC) were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, glutamine and antibiotics.

To determine the rate of GFP-albumin entry into the Golgi complex from the ER at steady-state, the Golgi area was photobleached and the rate of fluorescence recovery into this area was monitored. It is known that after photobleaching, GFP can recover its original conformation and fluorescence, albeit partially and slowly. To verify whether this phenomenon might contribute to the Golgi FRAP and thus ‘contaminate’ the signal due to GFP-albumin entry into the Golgi complex, we bleached whole cells and monitored the recovery of fluorescence. This recovery was low and contributed to less than 5% of the Golgi FRAP during the time-scale of the experiments. For each cell, the intensity of the Golgi area was recorded and normalized to the intensity of the whole cell, to account for the overall intensity loss during bleaching. The same approach was used to measure the diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon. Since the rate of diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon was an order of magnitude faster than the ER to Golgi transport of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we have assumed that the contribution of the latter is negligible.

At suitable intervals after bleaching, the cells were fixed with 0.05% gluteraldehyde in 150 mM HEPES for 5 min, and then processed for immunofluorescence (i.e., labeled for the Golgi markers GM130 and TGN46). It is important to note here that fixation of monolayers of cells is a rapid process that happens in a time frame 1–2 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Polishchuk et al., 2000</xref>), and so any artifact due to slow fixation of the samples is nonexistent. This procedure prevented the recovery of fluorescence of the GFP by spontaneous recovery of its fluorescent conformation (see above).

To measure co-localization between cargo and the Golgi marker proteins GM130 and TGN46, we used approaches modified from published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). Co-localization indicates the intensity of cargo staining within the GM130- or TGN46-stained areas (cargo localized in other cellular or Golgi regions was not considered). Two methods were used:</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Method 1</title><p>This method is a modification of the weighted co-localization analysis of the Zeiss LSM510 META confocal image analysis software, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manders et al. (1993)</xref>. It involves subtracting the background in each channel. The standard Zeiss value for background is arbitrarily set at 40% of the peak value, but this can be changed to reduce overlap between channels. This method was used in parallel with immuno-EM and stereology experiments, and gave results that were in good agreement with the immuno-EM data. Note that because of the resolution limit of the optical system, with this method the degree of overlap calculated between the Golgi markers themselves (GM130 and TGN46, which are in reality completely segregated in the cis-Golgi and the TGN, respectively) is about 20% in HepG2 cells under optimal conditions. This means that the calculated distribution of GM130 itself between the cis-Golgi and the TGN is about 80% in the cis-Golgi and 20% in the TGN. Vice versa, TGN46 is calculated to be about 20% in the cis-Golgi and 80% in the TGN. This defines the maximal dynamic range of the method: a cargo moving from the cis-Golgi to the TGN will shift from a GM130/TGN46 ratio of about 80/20 (in the cis-Golgi) to a ratio of 20/80 (in the TGN). This applies to HepG2 and HeLa cells; however, under specific conditions (i.e., when the Golgi complex is fragmented into separated stacks, and especially in some stacks, which are presumably those oriented with cisternal planes parallel to the beam), the resolution between GM130 and TGN46 can be greater.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Method 2</title><p>To eliminate the arbitrariness of the background subtraction in method 1, we developed a modification of the co-localization approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manders et al. (1993)</xref>, using the MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., R2006b). Briefly, an optical section taken through the center of the Golgi region was recorded and the intensities of the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers and of the cargo were normalized to the maximum of the corresponding channel for each pixel. To calculate three-color co-localizations, i.e., the co-localization of cargo with each of the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers, the intensity distributions were interpreted as probability distributions for the specific markers. Thus, the probability for a cargo protein to co-localize with a cis-Golgi or <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi marker was calculated for each pixel by multiplying the normalized intensities: <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i,cis</italic></sub> <italic>= I</italic><sub><italic>i,cargo</italic></sub> <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i,cis</italic></sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i,trans</italic></sub> <italic>= I</italic><sub><italic>i,cargo</italic></sub> <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i,trans</italic></sub> , where <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i,cargo</italic></sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i,cis</italic></sub> , and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i,trans</italic></sub> are the intensities of the cargo, and the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers at the <italic>i</italic>-th pixel, normalized to the corresponding maximum intensity. The sums of all of the <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i,cis</italic></sub> and the <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i,trans</italic></sub> values represent the degree of co-localization of the cargo with the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers, respectively. Using this method, the degree of overlap calculated between the Golgi markers themselves (GM130 and TGN46, which are in reality completely segregated in the cis-Golgi and the TGN, respectively) is about 30%. This means that the calculated distribution of GM130 itself between cis-Golgi and TGN is about 70% in the cis-Golgi and 30% in the TGN, and vice versa for TGN46 (see above). This method was also tested by comparing the GFP-albumin distribution in HeLa cells at steady-state as determined by this method, with that seen by immuno-EM. The degree of co-localization by method 2 of GFP-albumin with TGN46 was about 80% higher than with GM130 in good qualitative agreement with the immuno-EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to visually verify the data obtained by Methods 1 and 2, we used a line-scan method.

In studies of intra-Golgi transport, the number of gold particles were counted per cisterna in 30 stacks per time point (per experiment, in at least four experiments), and normalized to the value in the ER. This normalization was necessary to reduce the labeling variability between different sections and experiments. The TGN was defined as ribosome-less, tubular-reticular membranes adjacent to the trans-Golgi cisternae that were positive for TGN46 labeling. The IC elements were defined as clusters of tubular-vesicular membranes located near the <italic>cis</italic> side of a stack that were positive for ERGIC53. Vesicles were defined as round profiles adjacent (lateral) to Golgi cisternae and not exceeding 65 nm in diameter, a feature of COPI-derived vesicles.

Since the intra-Golgi diffusion rate of soluble cargoes is an order of magnitude faster than either entry into or exit out of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) excluding them in the simulations does not affect the conclusions.</p><p>Additionally the following assumptions are implicit in the model:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. The protein is initially distributed homogeneously in the first cisternae.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. The initial protein density spreads out everywhere inside the confined volume (to other cisternae and tubules) according to the diffusion equation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. The diffusion constant for albumin is homogenous throughout the system (inside the cisternae as well as inside the tubules).</p></list-item><list-item><p>iv. The protein concentration is high enough so that it can be described by density and not by stochastically moving individual proteins. This is not really a limitation because stochastic random walk motion yields the same diffusion behavior as a continuous particle density.</p></list-item><list-item><p>v. No interactions are considered between the diffusing proteins and the system boundaries (cisternae and tubule walls).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Of note, the use of modeling here was restricted to assess whether the equilibration rates of albumin across the stack are compatible with the continuity- or the vesicle-based model, or with both.</p><p>The size of the cisternae was varied and did not significantly change the magnitude of the time to reach equilibrium. Changing the diameter and length of the tubules affected the equilibration times in a way typical for diffusion processes (see figure legends for results). Also, systems with two tubules instead of one connecting adjacent cisternae were simulated. As mentioned above, three Matlab scripts are included in the supporting material that were used by us to produce the data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments involving immuno-EM and immunofluorescence were performed at least three times on different days, and each treatment was carried out as triplicate samples. For quantification, 15–30 individual measurements were made for each sample (for instance of the labeling density of albumin in Golgi stacks, or of the degree of co-localization of cargoes with a Golgi marker in a cell). For correlative light-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), each experiment was carried out at least three times and at least three cells were examined. Experiments on the live dynamics of GFP-albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) were repeated at least four times. Values are mean ±SD from 30 stacks per time point, in three independent experiments for immuno-EM; and mean ±SD of 10 co-localization measurements per time point for immunofluorescence.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Corda and M A De Matteis for critical reading of the manuscript, DrVictor Hsu for critical contributions towards to the design of the study and experiments, C P Berrie for editorial assistance and R Le Donne for artwork preparation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>A major controversy in the field of membrane traffic is how cargo progresses through the Golgi complex. Here the authors report a very important finding-namely that a soluble cargo and a large aggregate cargo (collagen) traverse a single Golgi stack at different rates. By itself, this finding would be inconsistent with simple cisternal maturation in that a means to traverse the Golgi without any cisternal movement is possible.</p><p>The work is carried out to a high standard but the manuscript needs reworking and certain parts need to be modified as described below. Figure S4 should really be a main figure combined with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a-b</xref>, while the rest of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could be moved to a new figure. The modelling sits at the end, and should be better integrated. One option would be to bring the simulation in earlier and explain what predictions the different models make. The data can then be presented in light of the simulation, commenting of which model provides the best fit to the experimental observations. Some of the EM is fantastic but other images could be a lot better. Detailed suggestions follow here:</p><p>1) The results show a correlation between the presence of cisternal continuities defined by EM, and cargo transport. They do not “demonstrate” cisternal continuities are responsible for transport as the authors claim in the text. For this conclusion the machinery mediating cisternal continuity formation would need to be inactivated, and further experiments done showing (i) cisternal continuities are lost and (ii) transport ceases. The major question left unresolved by this work is the mechanism by which cisternal continuities between adjacent Golgi compartments form and resolve. A further question is how this occurs without collapse and mixing of the two compartments to generate one larger compartment. Please acknowledge and discuss.</p><p>2) In the Results section, the authors describe albumin transport following release of a 15C block. They refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>-m, however this fails to convincingly show accumulation of albumin in the Golgi region marked by either GM130 or TGN46. The diffuse staining, possibly ER as the authors mention, does not seem to be reduced and accounts for the bulk of the signal while only a small proportion overlaps with Golgi markers. This suggests that albumin trafficking is not particularly efficient and only a subpopulation is being transported to the Golgi. These conditions are used for the immunoelectron microscopy, so this is a problem for all the data shown. The reviewers would prefer to see more examples of the triple labeling shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-f</xref> than that shown in j-q.</p><p>3) Please remove the Concanamycin data (and mention of these data) in Figure S2 – they don't add to the story.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> albumin is compared to procollagen (PC) traffic. In panel 2a a whole cell is shown, while for the other condition (3min at 32C) only a magnified region of the Golgi is shown. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> showing PC localization by EM is described in the text before <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> showing albumin. The figure order should be changed. A more serious problem is the quality of the PC image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> does not provide strong support that PC is in the “cis but not the distal” Golgi cisternae as claimed in the manuscript. Was a Golgi marker used to define the cis cisternae? If yes, then a clearer image with highlights for the different markers as nicely done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-f</xref> should be shown.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are also far from compelling evidence that albumin rapidly fills the entire Golgi stack while PC moves more slowly. It is not obvious to me what the CLEM data in Figure 3o-r show, and this is not quantitated. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not shown at the same scale. This isn't entirely clear and the figure legend is confusing - it would be better if the scale was marked in the figure and not appended to the legend. Panels 3a-c show whole cells, while 3d-i are Golgi only however at different scales. It would be better if cells were shown at one magnification while enlarged Golgi was shown at another standardized scale to allow simpler comparison of the different images and between figures.</p><p>5) The cisternal continuity data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> appears to rely on arbitrary tracing of membrane edges. The example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a-c</xref> is not an unambiguous connection and the yellow labeled cisternae in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> appears to have a clear membrane bilayer in the region said to form a join. I have a similar problem with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>, apparently showing a continuity labeled for albumin that lies adjacent to a Golgi stack but isn't definitely connected to it.</p><p>6) The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is presented to give a framework for the continuity model for trafficking. This isn't well integrated with the rest of the work. The assumptions are not properly described in the text, and exactly what testable predictions the modeling generates is unclear. Why does VSV G not diffuse through cisternal continuities as rapidly as soluble cargo? From what I can tell the modeling is a simplification of the 3D membrane architecture of the Golgi to 2D, so surface area to volume ratio is not correctly accounted for. What are the absolute concentrations of albumin, VSV G and PC in the system? My concern is that albumin levels are much higher than the other markers, and this may explain some of the differences seen.</p><p>7) Two minutes is very fast for diffusion through continuities. Have the authors considered the issue of whether fixation (or cryoEM processing) is fast enough to have full confidence in the 2 minute time point (versus 5 minutes, for example)? It does not change their story but is an important issue to control for experimentally.</p><p>8) The state distribution of albumin in HepG2 cells seems more complicated than their simple model. If the compartment can fill in 2 minutes and the ER has little albumin, why does the compartment empty so much more slowly? Addition of cycloheximide and determination of the efflux rate would be informative here. How can TGN accumulation be explained? Is the albumin binding to lipidic particles in the Golgi to slow its exit? Please comment on this in relation to use of vesicles versus simple diffusion.</p><p>9) The authors report that small diffusive cargos cross the Golgi complex in a few minutes. It may be hard to reconcile this view with the multi-step glycosylation at work for certain cargos. It would be important to know whether glycosylation kinetics fits with the observed transport kinetics. The alpha1-antitrypsin reporter chosen in this study may be an adequate example. The use of lectin may be helpful to carry out a rough analysis.</p><p>10) The diffusive model explains very well how a cargo may fill-up every cisternae in a very short time. However, it seems to me that the export will then be very slow if no additional hypothesis is used to impose that the diffusion is biased in the anterograde direction. Otherwise, the cargo will always be homogeneously distributed in all cisternae and emptying the Golgi would be very slow. The authors mention pH gradient but without really using this as driving force. In addition, not all cargo may be sensitive to the pH gradient that exists in the Golgi. The authors should take this in account in their simulations and try to estimate the exit time (e.g. time need to empty 90% of the Golgi) of small and large cargo in the absence of biased diffusion. They should discuss this point.</p><p>11) The authors may measure the exit time of the small cargo (in an experiment similar to the one presented in Figure S3b) and compare the exit of large cargo exiting Golgi through maturation. These values may be used in the simulation to see what level of diffusion bias one has to add to the diffusion model to explain the observed kinetics.</p><p>12) While the FRAP experiment is showing a fast filling of the Golgi, bleaching half, and not all, the Golgi would also have giving interesting diffusion value. Ideally, the bleaching of all the ER should be done at the same time to separate ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi recovery. It may also enable to detect differences of diffusion in Golgi sub-domains.</p><p>13) The use of 15degree block and release may induce differences between small cargos like albumin and large ones (like VSVG) that may not be visible in normal conditions. It is clear that retention at 15 degree is already not occurring in the same sub-compartment for the different cargos and this difference may explain part of the downstream behaviour reported here. Carrying out a photo-bleaching experiment to compare the kinetics of intra Golgi diffusion of small and large cargos may help to control for this in physiological conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02009.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The work is carried out to a high standard but the manuscript needs reworking and certain parts need to be modified as described below</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the appreciation of our work and their constructive criticism.</p><p><italic>Figure S4 should really be a main figure combined with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4a-b</italic></xref><italic>, while the rest of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>could be moved to a new figure</italic>.</p><p>We have done this and modified the manuscript appropriately (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>The modelling sits at the end, and should be better integrated. One option would be to bring the simulation in earlier and explain what predictions the different models make. The data can then be presented in light of the simulation, commenting of which model provides the best fit to the experimental observations</italic>.</p><p>We have sought to modify the manuscript to take into account the perception of the reviewers that the models should be better integrated. In order to achieve this, we need to consider that the scope of our models is limited. The models only aim to assess the equilibration rates of small soluble cargoes across a closed system with a stack-like geometry, and in particular to compare two possibilities: a) cargo equilibration through the stack by diffusion via continuities and b) equilibration via shuttling vesicles. Importantly, the models do not aim to simulate the entire traffic process through the Golgi including cargo arrival, departure and intra-Golgi concentration steps. Given these limitations, we feel that it would be difficult for a reader to grasp the significance of these models without first providing the appropriate experimental background. Rather, we think that the best way to use the models in this manuscript is to go through the following logical steps:</p><p>- The experiments describe the morphology of the stacks including tubular connections between cisternae, suggesting that these connections are used to translocate soluble proteins like albumin. The experiments also establish an upper bound of 2 minutes, as the time required for albumin passage from the first to the last compartment.</p><p>- These data pose the question as to whether the equilibration of albumin through the stack within 1-2 min can be best explained by a model based on simple diffusion of albumin between the cisternae through tubules without biasing forces, or by a model based on vesicular transport.</p><p>- The calculations reveal that the diffusion-based model is easily compatible with the experimental data, while the vesicular model is difficult (or impossible) to reconcile with the data, since a great number of vesicles would be required to explain the observed transport rates whereas no evidence is available from the experimental side that such a high amount of vesicle traffic exists.</p><p>We therefore propose to improve on the original scheme, rather than to drastically change it. In the revised version, we seek to achieve a better integration of the models by making reference to the original data on which the parameters of the models were based on, and by clarifying the logical flow that was adopted. However, if the editor and the reviewers strongly prefer to stick to their original advice to restructure the manuscript and bring the simulation in earlier, we will find a way to do so.</p><p><italic>Some of the EM is fantastic but other images could be a lot better</italic>. <italic>Detailed suggestions follow here:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The results show a correlation between the presence of cisternal continuities defined by EM, and cargo transport.

The sentence now reads as follows: “Thus, these results provide evidence consistent with a novel mechanism of transport for a major class of secretory proteins, and for the notion of multiplicity of transport mechanisms that can help to rationalize most of the observed intra-Golgi trafficking patterns”.</p><p><italic>The major question left unresolved by this work is the mechanism by which cisternal continuities between adjacent Golgi compartments form and resolve</italic>.</p><p>We agree with comment of the reviewers that the mechanistic question is not fully resolved, although a certain amount of information is available on the mechanism of formation and fission of the intercisternal tubules. We have now added a note regarding this point in the Introduction (“At the molecular/mechanistic level … a complete understanding of the molecular players regulating the intra-Golgi connections remains lacking”).</p><p><italic>A further question is how this occurs without collapse and mixing of the two compartments to generate one larger compartment. Please acknowledge and discuss</italic>.</p><p>The issue of coexistence of intercisternal connections and cis-trans polarity of the Golgi apparatus is not without antecedents. We have discussed various possibilities at length and now suitably modified the Discussion to highlight this point (“The second question raised by the cargo diffusion model is how the Golgi maintains its compositional polarity … Clearly, much work is needed to clarify whether and how some of these mechanisms apply”).</p><p><italic>2) In the Results section, the authors describe albumin transport following release of a 15C block. They refer to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1j-m</italic></xref><italic>, however this fails to convincingly show accumulation of albumin in the Golgi region marked by either GM130 or TGN46. The diffuse staining, possibly ER as the authors mention, does not seem to be reduced and accounts for the bulk of the signal while only a small proportion overlaps with Golgi markers. This suggests that albumin trafficking is not particularly efficient and only a subpopulation is being transported to the Golgi. These conditions are used for the immunoelectron microscopy, so this is a problem for all the data shown. The reviewers would prefer to see more examples of the triple labeling shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1a-f</italic></xref> <italic>than that shown in j-q</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have now included more images of cryo-immunogold microcopy that define the distribution of albumin across the Golgi at high resolution (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the time points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>-m (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>), we note that they are the earliest time points – 2min after release of 15°C block. The rest of the time course is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> where one can see that by 5 min the ER has already emptied to a large extent, indicating that the transport of albumin is remarkably efficient. Moreover, we note that even at 2 min after release of the 15°C block, although albumin is still mostly in the ER, it has also already reached the Golgi, as indicated by the presence of albumin fluorescence within the Golgi area (to be compared with the absence of albumin fluorescence at time 0). Thus, under the conditions used for the experiments, the albumin transport appears to be efficient. We have clarified the text in this regard. The text reads as follows: “Albumin showed a diffuse ER-like distribution at time 0, with no clear Golgi staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>); … the export of albumin out of the ER was very efficient, so that by 10 min after the release of the temperature block almost all of the protein had been transported to the Golgi apparatus.”</p><p><italic>3) Please remove the Concanamycin data (and mention of these data) in Figure S2 – they don't add to the story</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the Concanamycin data as suggested by the reviewer. Since one of the latter questions (see point 10) raised by the reviewers directly refers to the role of pH in the albumin transport we had to retain the reference to this data and we have mentioned it as data not shown.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>albumin is compared to procollagen (PC) traffic. In panel 2a a whole cell is shown, while for the other condition (3min at 32C) only a magnified region of the Golgi is shown.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2f</italic></xref> <italic>showing PC localization by EM is described in the text before</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2e</italic></xref> <italic>showing albumin. The figure order should be changed</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which now show enlarged Golgi in all conditions, so that they are now uniform. We have also changed the order of the figures so that PC localization by EM is presented before that of albumin.</p><p><italic>A more serious problem is the quality of the PC image in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2f</italic></xref> <italic>does not provide strong support that PC is in the “cis but not the distal” Golgi cisternae as claimed in the manuscript. Was a Golgi marker used to define the cis cisternae? If yes, then a clearer image with highlights for the different markers as nicely done in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1a-f</italic></xref> <italic>should be shown</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not being clear with the image. A Golgi marker was indeed used to define the cis-Golgi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>. While PC can be identified morphologically by the presence of aggregates (now indicated by an asterisk), the cis-Golgi was identified by using GM130 as a marker (black dots) labeled by immuno nanogold technique. The gold particles showing the presence of GM130 are now indicated by arrows. We have not done cryo-immunogold labeling (usually used to label two or three markers simultaneously) here, since PC can easily be identified morphologically and only single labeling for the cis-Golgi marker was required.</p><p><italic>The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>are also far from compelling evidence that albumin rapidly fills the entire Golgi stack while PC moves more slowly. It is not obvious to me what the CLEM data in Figure 3o-r show, and this is not quantitated</italic>.</p><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> complete the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>, where we show that under synchronized conditions albumin traverses the Golgi stack faster than VSVG or PC. In other words, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are meant to examine whether the observed fast kinetics of albumin transport might be limited to the synchronization conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>) or they are observed also at steady state. The results show that, under steady state conditions, the newly recovered fluorescence of albumin (immediately after photobleaching), that represents newly arrived cargo from the ER at the Golgi apparatus, can be seen to spread throughout the Golgi (as determined from the overlap of albumin with both GM130 and TGN46), while in the case of PC, it is mainly restricted to the cis side of the Golgi. We think that such an overlap is fairly compelling evidence that the albumin traverses the Golgi stack faster than PC even under steady state conditions. Moreover the use of Golgi ministacks where the separation between the cis and trans Golgi is always clearer than that seen with the intact Golgi ribbon provides a further convincing argument that even under steady state conditions the albumin traverses the Golgi stack faster than VSVG or PC.</p><p><italic>It is not obvious to me what the CLEM data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3o-r</italic></xref> <italic>show, and this is not quantitated</italic>.</p><p>In addition, to confirm the above light microscopy data with a high resolution EM-based approach, we used a method based on photo-oxidation of GFP coupled to FRAP to unambiguously identify the newly arrived cargo, represented by the photoconversion product (marked by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3o-r</xref>). As can be seen from the figure in the case of albumin the photo-conversion product is present throughout the Golgi already at 2 min after bleaching, suggesting rapid transport across the stack (consistent with all of the previous data), while it is restricted to the cis side in the case of VSVG and PC, which migrate through Golgi more slowly.</p><p>Regarding quantification, due to intrinsic limitations of the technique, the density of the photo-conversion product cannot be quantified in a meaningful way. However, as requested by the reviewer, we have now added quantifications by measuring the percentage of cells where the Golgi was completely filled with GFP-albumin and cells where GFP-albumin is present only at the cis side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3s</xref>).</p><p>We apologize for not having been clear about the description of the experiments represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3o-r</xref>. We have rewritten the corresponding figure legend to make it clearer.</p><p><italic>The images in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>are not shown at the same scale. This isn't entirely clear and the figure legend is confusing – it would be better if the scale was marked in the figure and not appended to the legend.

It would be better if cells were shown at one magnification while enlarged Golgi was shown at another standardized scale to allow simpler comparison of the different images and between figures</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have now changed the scale bars in this figure so that the bars represent a uniform length (2μM) to make the comparison between different images easier. We have not marked the scale in this figure to maintain uniformity with other figures.</p><p><italic>5) The cisternal continuity data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>appears to rely on arbitrary tracing of membrane edges. The example in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4a-c</italic></xref> <italic>is not an unambiguous connection and the yellow labeled cisternae in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4c</italic></xref> <italic>appears to have a clear membrane bilayer in the region said to form a join. I have a similar problem with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4i</italic></xref><italic>, apparently showing a continuity labeled for albumin that lies adjacent to a Golgi stack but isn't definitely connected to it</italic>.</p><p>We again apologize for not being clear with the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>. The image is one virtual section from the tomogram shown in Figure S4 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). When seen in the context of the whole panel of successive images the reviewer can clearly see that the intercisternal connection is a valid one. To avoid any confusion, we have removed panel 4c and shifted Figure S4 to the main figures. The new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) contains the whole set of virtual sections from the tomogram making it easier to visualize the rather tortuous intercisternal connection. We also note that most connections are fairly complex and require an analysis of several successive virtual sections, which explains why they are rarely detected by casual observers.</p><p>Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref> (now Figure. 5f), this is one of the examples of ‘simple’ or ‘linear’ connections between two distinct cisternae in the Golgi stack. As discussed in the text, these linear continuities are rare in thin sections. We chose this one because the labeling is particularly ‘clean’, and because the connection can be discerned, especially on the ‘internal’ side of the turn of the tubule. We have now added arrows to facilitate the appreciation of the continuity. Following the arrows one can clearly see the luminal continuity between the two non-adjacent cisternae that the tubule connects.</p><p><italic>6) The model in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>is presented to give a framework for the continuity model for trafficking. This isn't well integrated with the rest of the work. The assumptions are not properly described in the text, and exactly what testable predictions the modeling generates is unclear</italic>.</p><p>Part of our response to these comments can be found above. Basically, the two models, one based on equilibration via continuities and one on equilibration via shuttling vesicles, are simple, and are designed only to assess whether the equilibration rates of albumin across the stack are compatible with a continuity-based, or with a vesicle–based mechanism, or with both. Here, we will consider the above comments one by one.</p><p><italic>The assumptions are not properly described in the text…</italic></p><p>The parameters that were used for the modeling were not described in detail in the main text to enhance the readability of the manuscript. Nevertheless, detailed descriptions of the necessary parameters are in the figure legends, and are now clearly referred to in the main text, and the scripts used for the modeling are also provided as supplementary material. Additionally, the technical aspects of the modeling and the assumptions made are now described in detail in the Methods section. The assumptions of the model are recapitulated briefly below:</p><p>i) The protein is distributed homogenously in the first cisternae.</p><p>ii) The initial protein density spreads out everywhere inside the confined volume (to other cisternae and tubules) according to the diffusion equation.</p><p>iii) The diffusion constant for albumin is homogenous throughout the system (inside the cisternae as well as inside the tubules).</p><p>iv) The protein concentration is high enough so that it can be described by density and not by stochastically moving individual proteins. This is not really a limitation because stochastic random walk motion yields the same diffusion behavior as a continuous particle density.</p><p>v) No interactions are considered between the diffusing proteins and the system boundaries (cisternae and tubule walls).</p><p><italic>This isn't well integrated with the rest of the work</italic>.</p><p>As detailed above, the use of modeling is restricted to testing which of the two models (diffusion based or vesicle transport based) can be reconciled with the experimental data. To this end we judge that a reader will be unable to grasp the significance of these models without first providing the appropriate experimental background. Thus we have followed the logical progression of first describing the experimental data (an upper bound of 2 minutes for albumin equilibration through the stack), then building computational models of the two competing hypothesis (transport based on diffusion of cargo or transport mediated by vesicles) and finally concluding that only the diffusion based model is compatible with the experimental data.</p><p>In the revised version, in order to better integrate the models, while describing them we make reference to the original data on which the parameters of the models are based on, and also clarify the logical flow that was adopted.</p><p><italic>…exactly what testable predictions the modeling generates is unclear</italic>.</p><p>The diffusion-based model and the vesicle shuttling model aim to calculate the time required for albumin equilibration across the stack and the number of events (vesicle budding/fusion) required for equilibration, respectively. For the purpose of this study, the models aim only to assess whether the equilibration rates of albumin across the stack are compatible with the continuity– or the vesicle–based model, or with both.</p><p>In the revised version, we have clarified the limitations of the models and the logical flow that was adopted.</p><p>We have also added a note in the Methods section that reads as follows: “Of note, the use of modeling here was restricted to assess whether the equilibration rates of albumin across the stack are compatible with the continuity, or the vesicle-based model, or with both.”</p><p><italic>Why does VSV G not diffuse through cisternal continuities as rapidly as soluble cargo?</italic></p><p>Regarding VSVG, information that is not often appreciated but which emerges from the literature, and that has been briefly discussed in our manuscript, is that VSVG can behave in two different modes: it can equilibrate rapidly through the stack like albumin or it can behave like PC, depending on the synchronization conditions. Specifically, the albumin-like behavior of VSVG has been reported to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>) when VSVG is accumulated in the ER at 40°C and then released at 32°C. Instead, under the conditions we use for synchronization (40-15-32°C), VSVG exhibits a transport behavior similar to that of PC, possibly because it forms oligomers/polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffiths et al., 1985</xref>) that behave like PC during the 15°C block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). We have modified and extended these comments in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>From what I can tell the modeling is a simplification of the 3D membrane architecture of the Golgi to 2D, so surface area to volume ratio is not correctly accounted for</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that diffusion in 3D generally differs from diffusion in 2D. For diffusion in 3D, the mean squared displacement &lt;<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; during a time interval <italic>t</italic> is &lt;<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; = <italic>6 D t</italic> with D being the diffusion coefficient, whereas for diffusion in 2D, &lt;<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt; = <italic>4 D t</italic>. In the present situation, however, the 2D assumption perfectly matches the biological system.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have also compared 2D and 3D diffusion of albumin particles through the idealized Golgi compartment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with the simulation package Virtual Cell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/">http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/</ext-link>). We obtained the following results for a standard configuration with 6 cisternae, with a cisternae thickness of 20 nm, cisternae diameter of 1000 nm, tubule length of 100nm, tubule diameter of 30 nm, and diffusion coefficient D of 10 μm<sup>2</sup>/s:</p><p>- assuming diffusion in 3D, 50% equilibration in compartment #6 was reached after 2.3 s and 95 % equilibration after 6.7 s.</p><p>- assuming diffusion in 2D, 50 % equilibration in compartment #6 was reached after 2.6 s and 95 % equilibration after 7.5 s.</p><p>We have additionally performed the same comparison for a system with large cisternae (cisternae diameter of 1500 nm) and keeping the other parameters same as before:</p><p>- assuming diffusion in 3D, 50 % equilibration in compartment #6 was reached after 5.4 s and 95 % equilibration after 15.7 s.</p><p>- assuming diffusion in 2D, 50 % equilibration in compartment #6 was reached after 6.0 s and 95 % equilibration after 17.3 s.</p><p>The results for the two system sizes are therefore very similar. In all cases, the difference in the equilibration time is less than 12%, showing that simulating in 2D leads to the same behavior as in 3D. We believe this justifies our simplification to the 2D case as used in the manuscript.</p><p>This is now mentioned in the Methods section of the revised manuscript. We now state:</p><p>“The simulations of albumin diffusion through the Golgi stack were run both in 2D and 3D. Since the 2D and 3D concentration profiles were in very good agreement with the difference in equilibration time less than 12%, we only show data for diffusion in 2D.”</p><p><italic>What are the absolute concentrations of albumin, VSV G and PC in the system? My concern is that albumin levels are much higher than the other markers, and this may explain some of the differences seen</italic>.</p><p>To address this point, we refer the reviewers to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> where we now show biochemical pulse-chase analysis of antitrypsin and VSVG in HepG2 cells under conditions similar to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (transport assay monitored by EM). As noted in the text, the transport kinetics of antitrypsin are indistinguishable from those of albumin. The conditions of immunoprecipitation were such that the proteins were completely depleted. One can notice that the amounts of antitrypsin and VSVG are similar (in terms of radioactive counts or here intensity of the protein bands), suggesting that the antitrypsin is not present in much higher levels than VSVG. Therefore, the difference between their kinetic behaviors is not due to the different abundance of VSVG and antitrypsin and, by extension, of albumin. We have now included the following phrase in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>: it is important to note here that the quantities of antitrypsin and VSVG present are very similar suggesting that the difference in the transport behavior of these proteins is not due to differences in their abundance. In addition, as mentioned in the text, the transport behaviors of antitrypsin and albumin are similar, reiterating further that the differences in the transport behavior between soluble secretory cargoes (albumin and antitrypsin) and VSVG/PC is possibly not due to the differences in their abundance.</p><p><italic>7) Two minutes is very fast for diffusion through continuities. Have the authors considered the issue of whether fixation (or cryoEM processing) is fast enough to have full confidence in the 2 minute time point (versus 5 minutes, for example)? It does not change their story but is an important issue to control for experimentally</italic>.</p><p>In our experience, 2 min is ample time to fix the samples. This was addressed in our own original paper on the development of correlative video-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Polishchuk et al., 2000</xref>). The data indicated that fixation of the cell in monolayers takes only 1-2 sec. Published literature in this aspect has shown that the fixation happens in a matter of seconds. The literature in this regard has been reviewed extensively in “Fine structure Immunocytochemistry“ by Gareth Griffiths (Griffiths, 1993). This aspect is now briefly mentioned in the Methods section. It reads as follows: “It is important to note here that fixation of monolayers of cells is a rapid process that happens in a time frame of 1-2 sec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Polishchuk et al., 2000</xref>), and so any artifact due to slow fixation of the samples is nonexistent.”</p><p><italic>Points 8-11</italic></p><p>Since some of the issues raised by the reviewers are to some extent redundant, we prefer to group our responses as detailed below, for the sake of clarity and brevity.</p><p>The reviewers raise a series of interesting questions on the relationship between the diffusion-based mechanisms of intra-Golgi traffic and the mechanism of export from the Golgi. We agree that these questions are interesting and important in their own right; however we respectfully note that this study is meant to focus on intra-Golgi traffic and that an analysis of the mechanism and rate of exit of soluble cargoes from the Golgi is beyond its scope.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have carried out some of the experiments and discussed the relevant aspects mentioned by the reviewers in the revised manuscript along the lines reported below: “Another point of consideration while discussing the cargo diffusion model is the possible relationship between intra-Golgi transport and Golgi export […] Thus, the fact that export is pH-dependent is a further indication in favor of the diffusion-based mechanism.”</p><p><italic>12) While the FRAP experiment is showing a fast filling of the Golgi, bleaching half, and not all, the Golgi would also have giving interesting diffusion value. Ideally, the bleaching of all the ER should be done at the same time to separate ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi recovery. It may also enable to detect differences of diffusion in Golgi sub-domains</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure we understand the comments of the reviewers. In any case, the bleaching of half of the Golgi and assessment of the ‘longitudinal’ diffusion rate has been performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). The half-time of ER-Golgi transport (200sec) and the intra-Golgi recovery (20sec) differ by an order of magnitude and so the contribution of ER-Golgi transport to the intra-Golgi recovery would be minimal. Moreover, these data were used merely to show that the GFP-albumin behaves as expected and the quantitation does not bear directly on the main conclusions of the manuscript. We have now mentioned this in the Methods section. It reads as follows:</p><p>“The same approach was used to measure the diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon. Since the rate of diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon was an order of magnitude faster than the ER to Golgi transport of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) the contribution of the latter to the recovery should be negligible. For exit from the Golgi complex, the FRAP-related iFRAP technique was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>).”</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that studying the differences, if any, in the diffusion kinetics in Golgi sub-domains would be interesting. However, our opinion is that the results of such a study would not affect the conclusions reached in the manuscript; rather they present a stimulating starting point for a follow-up to the present study.</p><p><italic>13) The use of 15degree block and release may induce differences between small cargos like albumin and large ones (like VSVG) that may not be visible in normal conditions. It is clear that retention at 15 degree is already not occurring in the same sub-compartment for the different cargos and this difference may explain part of the downstream behaviour reported here. Carrying out a photo-bleaching experiment to compare the kinetics of intra Golgi diffusion of small and large cargos may help to control for this in physiological conditions</italic>.</p><p>We have studied the intra-Golgi diffusion of GFP-albumin, which appears to be much faster than the intra-Golgi diffusion of VSVG-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al 2008</xref>) or PCIII-GFP (which does not diffuse; our unpublished observations), thus indicating that albumin can indeed diffuse rapidly ‘horizontally’ as well as ‘vertically’ across the Golgi stacks, as expected form its soluble nature and the presence of connections.</p><p>The reviewers note that at 15C albumin resides both in the IC and the ER, while VSVG concentrate in the IC, and that this might explain their different downstream behaviors. It is difficult to see how these different distributions of the two cargoes might lead to a much more rapid filling of the Golgi by albumin than by VSVG. In any case, it is to control for this and other possibilities that we have studied the kinetics of transport at steady-state with no synchronization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Also under steady-state conditions albumin still shows a faster kinetics of intra-Golgi transport compared to VSVG and other cargoes, further reinforcing our conclusion that the transport behavior of small soluble cargoes is different from others.</p></body></sub-article></article>
