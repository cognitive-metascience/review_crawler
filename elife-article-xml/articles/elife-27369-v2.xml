pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.001</object-id><p>Bacteria frequently need to adapt to altered environmental conditions. Adaptation requires changes in gene expression, often mediated by global regulators of transcription. The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS is a key global regulator in <italic>Gram</italic>-negative bacteria and is believed to be a crucial player in bacterial chromatin organization via its DNA-bridging activity. H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors (osmolarity, pH, temperature) and interaction partners. Mechanistically, it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved. Here, we show that a diverse spectrum of H-NS modulators alter the DNA-bridging activity of H-NS. Changes in monovalent and divalent ion concentrations drive an abrupt switch between a bridging and non-bridging DNA-binding mode. Similarly, synergistic and antagonistic co-regulators modulate the DNA-bridging efficiency. Structural studies suggest a conserved mechanism: H-NS switches between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’, bridging competent, conformation driven by environmental cues and interaction partners.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information every cell needs to work properly is encoded in molecules of DNA that are much longer than the cell itself. A key challenge in biology is to understand how DNA is organized to fit inside each cell, whilst still providing access to the information that it contains. Since the way DNA is organized can influence which genes are active, rearranging DNA plays an important role in controlling how cells behave.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and many other bacteria, a protein called H-NS contributes to DNA reorganization by forming or rupturing loops in the DNA in response to changes in temperature, the levels of salt and other aspects of the cell’s surroundings. In controlling loop formation, it dictates whether specific genes are switched on or off. However, it remains unclear how H-NS detects the environmental changes.</p><p>To address this question, van der Valk et al. used biochemical techniques to study the activity of H-NS from <italic>E. coli</italic> under different environmental conditions. The experiments show that changes in the environment cause structural changes to H-NS, altering its ability to form DNA loops. A previously unnoticed region of the protein acts as a switch to control these structural changes, and ultimately affects which genes are active in the cell.</p><p>These findings shed new light on how bacteria organize their DNA and the strategies they have developed to adapt to different environments. The new protein region identified in H-NS may also be present in similar proteins found in other organisms. In the future, this knowledge may ultimately help to develop new antibiotic drugs that target H-NS proteins in bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H-NS</kwd><kwd>Hha</kwd><kwd>YdgT</kwd><kwd>nucleoid</kwd><kwd>bacterial chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NanonextNL of the Government of the Netherland and 130 partners</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Valk</surname><given-names>Ramon A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moolenaar</surname><given-names>Geri F</given-names></name><name><surname>Dame</surname><given-names>Remus T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VIDI 864.08.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Valk</surname><given-names>Ramon A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moolenaar</surname><given-names>Geri F</given-names></name><name><surname>Goosen</surname><given-names>Nora</given-names></name><name><surname>Dame</surname><given-names>Remus T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Athena grant 700.58.802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vreede</surname><given-names>Jocelyne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0014/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hofmann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Dame</surname><given-names>Remus T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 201506880001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VICI 016.160.613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dame</surname><given-names>Remus T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The DNA-bridging efficiency of H-NS, a genome organising and transcription regulatory protein, is modulated by changes in environmental conditions of the cell, which drive a structural rearrangement of the protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the bacterial genome is compacted by a vast variety of factors, including DNA supercoiling, and macromolecular crowding, it owes much of its organization to nucleoid-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dame, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dame et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dillon and Dorman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rimsky and Travers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Travers and Muskhelishvili, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luijsterburg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dame and Tark-Dame, 2016</xref>). A key protein in nucleoid organization of Gram-negative bacteria is the Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein (H-NS). Genome-wide binding studies have revealed that H-NS binds along the genome in long patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grainger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahramanoglou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lucchini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navarre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oshima et al., 2006</xref>), which have been proposed to mediate the formation of genomic loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Valk et al., 2014</xref>). H-NS is also an important regulator of global gene expression, implied in mediating global transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli (osmolarity, pH, temperature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atlung and Ingmer, 1997</xref>), and operating as xenogeneic silencer, silencing horizontally integrated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>). A large fraction of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> genes (5–10%) is thus regulated (usually repressed) by the action of H-NS. H-NS operation is modulated by environmental stimuli and through interplay with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atlung and Ingmer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoebel et al., 2008</xref>). In solution, the H-NS protein exists as a dimer, which oligomerizes at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ceschini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spurio et al., 1997</xref>). H-NS consists of three structural domains: a C-terminal domain responsible for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shindo et al., 1995</xref>), a N-terminal dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerdan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ueguchi et al., 1996</xref>) and a central dimer-dimer interaction domain responsible for multimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2009</xref>). These two interaction domains are connected by a long α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>) (helix α3). H-NS exhibits two seemingly distinct DNA-binding modes: DNA bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dame et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dame et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dame et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider et al., 2001</xref>), the condensation of DNA by intra- and inter- molecular DNA binding by H-NS and DNA stiffening, the rigidification of DNA through the formation of a H-NS-DNA filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dame and Wuite, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). These modes have been attributed to the basic functional H-NS unit (a dimer) binding to DNA either in cis or <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wiggins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joyeux and Vreede, 2013</xref>). H-NS paralogues StpA, Sfh, Hfp, and truncated derivatives such as H-NST, have been proposed to modulate H-NS function by forming heteromers with H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baños et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deighan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williams et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williamson and Free, 2005</xref>), with DNA-binding properties different from homomeric H-NS. Members of the Hha/YmoA family of proteins are H-NS co-regulators with limited sequence homology to H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madrid et al., 2007</xref>). At many targets along the genome, H-NS and Hha co-localize. Localization of Hha at these sites is strictly H-NS dependent, whereas the genome-wide binding pattern of H-NS is only mildly affected by Hha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ueda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although evidence has been put forward that the concentration of divalent ions determines the binding mode of H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), a mechanistic explanation is lacking. Moreover, the possible effect of co-regulators of H-NS, such as Hha, on these binding modes has remained unexplored. To obtain a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying the H-NS binding modes, it is crucial to determine the effects of ion valence and concentration, as well as the presence of helper proteins on both the stiffening and the bridging mode. Here, we investigate DNA stiffening on short DNA tethers using Tethered Particle Motion (TPM). As <italic>intramolecular</italic> DNA bridging does not occur on short DNA tethers, DNA stiffening can be uncoupled from <italic>DNA bridging</italic>. In addition, to accurately determine <italic>intermolecular</italic> DNA-bridging efficiencies in solution, we developed a sensitive quantitative bulk assay. Using these two assays, we unravel the assembly pathway of bridged DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes and the roles of mono- and divalent ions, helper proteins Hha and YdgT, and truncated H-NS derivatives. Finally, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that ions and interacting proteins <italic>directly</italic> alter H-NS structure from a ‘closed’ bridging incapable to an ‘open’ bridging capable conformation, thus providing a molecular understanding of the modulation of H-NS function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup>and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening</title><p>In order to dissect the role of divalent ions in the formation of bridged and stiffened complexes, we applied a novel, sensitive, and <italic>quantitative</italic> DNA-bridging assay and carried out TPM experiments (providing a quantitative and selective readout of DNA stiffening). The DNA-bridging assay relies on immobilization of bait DNA on magnetic microparticles and the capture and detection of <sup>32</sup>P labeled prey DNA if DNA-DNA bridge formation occurs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref> for a schematic depiction of the assay). 80% of initial prey DNA is recovered at high H-NS concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the absence of either the H-NS protein or bait DNA, no prey DNA is recovered under our experimental conditions. Next, we used this assay to quantify the DNA-bridging efficiency of H-NS as a function of the amount of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), reproducing the qualitative results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al. (2010)</xref> and providing independent confirmation of the previously observed effects. The concentration range from 0 to 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> is considered to be physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hurwitz and Rosano, 1967</xref>). Importantly, the transition from no bridging to complete bridging is abrupt between 4–6 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, indicating that changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration might drive a binary switch.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modulation of H-NS function by ionic conditions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) DNA-bridging efficiency as a function of H-NS concentration in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

However, due to the co-occurrence of DNA bridging, previous studies were incapable of measuring DNA stiffening in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Here, we used TPM to investigate DNA stiffening as a function of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In TPM, the Root Mean Square displacement (RMS) of bead movement is a direct reflection of tether stiffness and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). DNA-binding proteins can affect both, but previous studies have shown that the DNA contour length is not affected by binding of H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dame et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, an increase in stiffness due to H-NS binding translates into a higher RMS value of a DNA tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Here, we measured the effects of H-NS on DNA stiffness in the absence and presence of 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and confirmed that H-NS stiffens DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>); importantly, our experiments reveal that Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not affect the stiffness of the fully formed H-NS-DNA complexes at saturation, as in both conditions the RMS is the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Analysis of the binding characteristics using the McGhee-von Hippel equation revealed that the association constant of H-NS is somewhat reduced in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while cooperativity increases under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,d</xref>). The reduction in DNA-binding affinity of H-NS may be attributed to shielding of the negatively charged phosphate backbone by Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The cooperative binding of H-NS and DNA stiffening observed by TPM suggest that H-NS multimerizes along DNA, likely via the recently defined dimer-dimer interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>). Multimerization along DNA has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williams et al., 1996</xref>) but has never been conclusively demonstrated. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant, H-NS<sub>Y61DM64D</sub>, predicted to have disrupted dimer-dimer interaction based on the H-NS<sub>1-83</sub> crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography showed that this H-NS mutant indeed exists solely as a dimer in solution independent of protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), whereas wild-type H-NS forms large multimeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2009</xref>). The multimerization behavior of both proteins was unaffected by the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay confirmed that the DNA binding of the H-NS mutant is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). TPM experiments reveal that H-NS<sub>Y61DM64D</sub> binding does not lead to the formation of stiff H-NS-DNA filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The RMS is reduced compared to that of bare DNA, indicating not only that dimer-dimer interactions are disrupted, but also that individual H-NS dimers mildly distort DNA. DNA-bridging experiments reveal that H-NS<sub>Y61DM64D</sub> is also incapable of forming DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that individual H-NS<sub>Y61DM64D</sub> dimers do not form stable bridges and that dimer-mediated bridging, involving H-NS-dimer binding cooperativity due to high local DNA concentration adjacent to existing bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dame et al., 2000</xref>), is insufficient to explain the formation of bridged DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes. The nature of the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on DNA-bridging efficiency is not understood. An increase in affinity would be expected if Mg<sup>2+</sup> would only facilitate interactions between the DNA phosphate backbone and negatively charged residues on H-NS, but this is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not affect the multimeric state of H-NS in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a model involving an effect on H-NS multimerization can be excluded. A structural effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on individual units within H-NS filaments could explain the observed effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the bridging efficiency of H-NS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup>alters H-NS structure</title><p>To investigate the role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on individual H-NS dimers we carried out MD simulations of an H-NS dimer in both the absence and presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, using our previously established model of a full-length H-NS dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Valk et al., 2014</xref>). Visual inspection of the H-NS dimer simulations at 50 mM KCl reveals that H-NS changes from an ‘open’ extended conformation into more compact ‘closed’ shapes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> for snapshots from these simulations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for examples of the ‘closed’ conformation, or <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> for a movie of one such simulation). The three domains in H-NS interact, and these inter-domain interactions are facilitated by partial unfolding and buckling of the long central α helix (helix α3) connecting the dimerization and dimer-dimer interaction domains. The average distance between the donor and acceptor of all helical hydrogen bonds (O-H distance) in helix α3 indicates that the buckle forms in region Glu42-Ala49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). By analyzing the O-H distance between residues Ser45 and Ala49 in time, key residues at the site of buckle formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), we found that buckles can be reversible and irreversible, within the simulation time scale of 50 ns. Reversible buckles, caused by thermal fluctuations, typically last a few nanoseconds and occur several times during a single simulation run (see green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> for an example). Irreversible buckles, stabilized by inter-domain interactions, do not return to a helical conformation during our simulations (see red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> for an example). To characterize the interactions that occur during the simulations, we generated contact maps that show the probability of finding interactions between residues, with a contact defined as the minimum distance between two residues being 0.6 nm or less, see Materials and methods for details of this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). These maps reveal that the DNA-binding domain interacts with other parts of the protein complex. In absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the DNA-binding domain interacts with the dimerization domain, rendering the DNA-binding QGR motif (residues 112–114) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>) of one DNA-binding domain inaccessible (see the snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Although the simulations were performed in absence of DNA, these observations suggest that DNA bridging is not possible in such a conformation, as the H-NS dimer can bind DNA only through its remaining/second DNA-binding domain. In this ‘closed’ conformation, interactions occur between the IRT residues at position 10–12 and the AMDEQGK residues at position 122–128. These interactions are hydrophilic in nature, supplemented by a salt bridge between R11 and D124 or E125. In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain no longer occur (see the snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> or the movie in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>), The absence of such interactions is further illustrated by the contact map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref> and in higher detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>. The likelihood of finding Mg<sup>2+</sup> interacting with (i.e. being within 0.6 nm of) H-NS residues, indicated by P<sub>Mg2+</sub>, revealed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> has a preference for glutamate residues in region 22–35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), where the ions shield this region from interacting with the DNA-binding domains. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions transiently interact with the glutamate residues, with residence times in the order of a few ns (as seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). Furthermore, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions interact with region 98–105 (sequence DENGE), right next to the DNA-binding QGR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes the ‘open’ conformation of H-NS, ensuring that DNA bridging can occur. Furthermore, we noted that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is also located close to the buckle and may directly stabilize helix α3 through interactions with Glu42, Glu43, Glu44, and Ser45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), resulting in an ‘open’, bridging capable, H-NS conformation (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>). These data suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> modulates H-NS by shielding interactions between the DNA-binding domain and dimerization domain, and by influencing the conformation of helix α3. Based on these observations, we designed an H-NS mutant predicted to bridge DNA independent of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We therefore generated a mutant in which several of the amino acids involved in buckle formation (E43,E44,S45) were substituted with alanines. In our DNA-bridging assay, H-NS<sub>E43A,E44A,S45A</sub> retains its ability to bridge DNA, but indeed achieves high DNA recovery (±50%) in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9a</xref>). Low concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> are sufficient to reach saturated DNA bridging (up to 80% DNA recovery) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9a</xref>). This observation independently confirms our model that the stretch of glutamates at the buckle is responsible for Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent bridging by H-NS. Additionally, we note that the DNA-binding affinity of H-N<sub>E43A,E44A,S45A</sub> is not significantly altered and that its DNA binding cooperativity is similar to that of wildtype H-NS in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Yet, in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, wild-type H-NS exhibits a far more cooperative DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This suggests that the transition between the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ conformation of H-NS promotes lateral filament formation by H-NS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conformation of the H-NS dimer as a function of osmolarity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Snapshots depicting representative conformations of H-NS in the simulations with 50 mM KCl (top) and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> +50 mM KCl (bottom) (For the full movies depicting these effects see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>, for other examples of the ‘closed’ conformations of H-NS see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Previous studies have revealed that the H-NS DNA stiffening mode is mildly sensitive to the KCl concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Using TPM, we were able to confirm these observations. The reduction in DNA stiffening is gradual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dame and Wuite, 2003</xref>) and modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). It is thus questionable whether the multimerization of H-NS along DNA alone is sufficient to explain its role in repression of transcription (and modulation thereof). Could the modulation of gene repression be due to ionic effects on DNA-bridging efficiency? Using our DNA-bridging assay, we observed complete abolishment of H-NS DNA bridging by KCl at concentrations exceeding 120 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), a binary response, similar to what we observed for the Mg<sup>2+</sup> titration. This in vitro observation mirrors the in vivo response of the ProU operon, at which KCl concentrations exceeding 100 mM are required to alleviate H-NS-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cairney et al., 1985</xref>). Control experiments using K-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) confirm that K<sup>+</sup>, and not the counter-ion, is responsible for the observed effects, even though the counter ion may affect the DNA-binding affinity of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leirmo et al., 1987</xref>) This strong and abrupt effect on DNA bridging, while leaving DNA stiffening essentially unaffected, might indicate that H-NS reverts to the ‘closed’ conformation by the addition of K<sup>+</sup>. To investigate this effect at a structural level we performed MD simulations at high KCl concentrations. The presence of 130 mM KCl alters interactions between the various domains in H-NS (see contact maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>). In addition to interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, the two DNA-binding domains in the dimer interact with each other. Moreover, the DNA-binding domains interact with helix α3. In particular regions 98–105 (KYSYVDENGE) and 123–129 (EQGKS) are involved in these interactions. The average distance between the donors and acceptors in the hydrogen bonds within helix α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) indicates that that buckles in helix α3 also occur at a high KCl concentration, at the same location as determined by low-salt conditions. These observations indicate that the ‘closed’ state can have multiple forms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for snapshots), but that all these conformations block the DNA-binding motif QGR from interacting with DNA. The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not significantly alter the occurrence of buckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Instead, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is capable of deterring interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain by shielding residues in the dimerization domain involved in these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). However, the probability of interactions occurring between the DNA-binding domain and other parts of the protein is reduced significantly in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). High K+ concentrations therefore inhibit H-NS bridging by promoting the ‘closed’ conformation of H-NS even in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and elucidates the modulatory and regulatory effects of KCl and osmolarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Modulation of DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by truncated H-NS variants</title><p>In addition to environmental factors such as osmolarity, H-NS activity is affected by interactions with other proteins in vivo. Members of the Hha/YmoA protein family, such as Hha and YdgT, are known to cooperate with H-NS in repression of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baños et al., 2008</xref>), while other proteins such as H-NST are capable of inhibiting H-NS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), likely by hampering H-NS multimerization. To systematically investigate the latter mechanism, we designed and synthesized truncated H-NS derivatives, targeting the H-NS dimerization domain (H-NS<sub>1-58</sub>) or dimer-dimer interaction domain (H-NS<sub>56-83</sub>). Interfering with H-NS dimerization, through the addition of H-NS<sub>1-58</sub> in DNA-bridging experiments, we observed a reduction in DNA recovery from 75% to 20% at ratios higher than 1: 3 H-NS<sub>1-58</sub>/ H-NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Similarly, targeting the dimer-dimer interaction domain (through H-NS<sub>56-82</sub>) resulted in complete abolishment of DNA bridging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Next, we investigated the effects of H-NS derivatives on H-NS DNA stiffening using TPM. Only at very high H-NS derivative concentrations (30-fold excess) reduction of DNA stiffening was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These experiments reveal that both H-NS dimerization and dimer-dimer interactions can be effectively targeted for inhibition of H-NS activity and that the respective domains are crucial to the formation of bridged filaments. This suggests that natural H-NS inhibitors such as H-NST operate by disrupting DNA bridging and provides clues for rational design of artificial peptide inhibitors of H-NS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.021</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modulation of H-NS function by protein cofactors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) DNA bridging efficiency as a function of inhibiting peptides targeting either the dimerization domain (H-NS<sub>1-58</sub>) and multimerization domain (H-NS<sub>56-82</sub>).

Two such proteins, Hha, and YdgT, are members of the Hha/YmoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madrid et al., 2007</xref>) family of proteins. In order to understand the modulation of H-NS function by these proteins we investigated their influence on the H-NS DNA binding modes. We observed that Hha, when added at equimolar concentrations, enhances DNA bridging by H-NS at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). A similar enhancement of H-NS-mediated DNA bridging was observed with the Hha paralogue, YdgT. While Hha and YdgT promote DNA bridging to a similar extent, YdgT promotes DNA bridging at significantly lower concentrations, likely due to a higher affinity for H-NS. At higher concentrations of YdgT the effect on H-NS-mediated bridging closely resembles the bridging profile obtained for H-NS<sub>E43A,E44A,S45A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine whether enhanced DNA bridging is due to structural changes in H-NS-DNA filaments, we investigated the effects of Hha and YdgT on DNA stiffening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). TPM experiments show a mild increase in H-NS mediated DNA stiffening in the presence of Hha. We observe a negative offset in RMS in the presence of YdgT, indicating a more compact conformation. Specifically, this is evident in TPM experiments containing H-NS, YdgT, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, where in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and YdgT, H-NS causes ‘DNA collapse’ in TPM (data not shown), similar to earlier observations for H-NS in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) or with Hha added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This ‘DNA collapse’ is attributed to H-NS-mediated DNA bridge formation. One possible explanation for the effects of Hha and YdgT, is that they effectively increase the DNA-binding affinity of H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether Hha affects H-NS conformation, we performed MD simulations, incorporating structural information from the recently resolved H-NS<sub>1-43</sub>-Hha co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Our MD simulations reveal that Hha does not prevent buckles in helix α3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Instead Hha alters the interactions between the dimerization domain and the DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) by blocking access to parts of dimerization domain. This hypothesis is further supported by interactions between Hha and other parts of H-NS, including the DNA-binding domain and helix α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Hha, the contacts between the DNA-binding domain and dimerization domain are reduced even further. This shows that Hha modulates H-NS function by stabilizing the ‘open’ -bridging capable- conformation of H-NS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been known for many years that H-NS binding induces gene silencing. H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors (osmolarity, pH, temperature) and interaction partners. These findings support the hypothesis that H-NS plays a role in environmental adaptation. However, mechanistically it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved. Based on our findings, we conclude that H-NS is incapable of bridging or stiffening DNA as dimers. H-NS dimers bind DNA in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dame et al., 2000</xref>) and associate side-by-side along DNA, likely via the recently identified dimer-dimer interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arold et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in DNA stiffening. This process is cooperative as H-NS dimers interact with neighbors, as well as with DNA. Our studies reveal that H-NS-DNA filaments are <italic>structurally</italic> very similar, independent of the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). But <italic>functionally,</italic> these H-NS-DNA filaments are distinct. H-NS can be ‘activated’ by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which promotes a conformational change, rendering both DNA-binding domains of H-NS dimers accessible for DNA bridging. In our model, the assembly of bridged complexes proceeds in distinct steps: (1) nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang et al., 2007</xref>) (binding of an H-NS dimer at a high affinity site), (2) lateral filament growth by H-NS dimer-dimer interactions (leading to DNA stiffening) and (3) bridging of the assembled filament to bare DNA provided in trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Each step can potentially be modulated by osmolarity and protein interaction partners. Here, we show that these factors most effectively target DNA bridging.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.024</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model of H-NS complex assembly.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) H-NS nucleates at preferred DNA sequences in the genome.

Our observations add to the large body of evidence showing that regulation of transcription via H-NS is complex, and that it does not proceed via a single, simple, well-defined mechanism. The most straightforward form of repression by H-NS is via occlusion of RNA polymerase from the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prosseda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Göransson et al., 1990</xref>). Whether this mechanism of repression involves lateral filament formation or bridging is unclear. It is expected that both types of complexes assembled at a promoter site can in principle occlude RNA polymerase. A second mechanism of repression is to trap RNA polymerase at the promoter, preventing promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schröder and Wagner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). RNA polymerase trapping likely involves DNA bridging of promoter upstream and downstream elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dame et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). A third mechanism of repression by H-NS is to interfere with RNA polymerase progression during active transcription by intragenic binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dole et al., 2004</xref>). In this model, both modes could interfere with transcription. However, it was suggested recently that only bridged filaments are capable of interfering with transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kotlajich et al., 2015</xref>), with lateral filaments likely being disassembled as RNA polymerase encounters them. Generally, the type of complex formed by H-NS is expected to depend on the type and number of ions, combined with local DNA conformation (dependent on DNA sequence or DNA topology), and the presence of modulating proteins. The interplay between these factors will determine the strength of the complex, and degree of repression. Thus, different H-NS repressed genes are expected to be subject to different types of modulation, providing a key to a coordinated response in gene expression to altered conditions and selectivity for the interplay with specific co-regulators at specific target regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of expression vectors</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>H-NS expression vector</title><p>The vector pRD18 for expression of H-NS was constructed by inserting the PCR amplified <italic>hns</italic> gene into the pET3His overexpression vector using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites.

distance regression (ODR) was performed to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear implicit equation describing the cooperative ligand binding. The binding site size (n) of H-NS was fixed to a value of 30 bp during regression, which corresponds to values determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2003</xref>). The association constant (K) and the cooperativity parameter (ω) were assumed to be positive real numbers. A custom fitting routine was implemented in Fortran and makes use of the ODRPACK library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boggs et al., 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The starting conformation of the full-length H-NS dimer was constructed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Valk et al., 2014</xref>). The system was placed in a periodic dodecahedron box with a distance of at least 0.8 nm between the box edge and the most extended atom of the protein dimer, followed by the addition of water and ions. With this system we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of full length H-NS at different concentrations of KCl, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> and with the addition of Hha, summing up to a total of six different systems. Hha was added by aligning the crystal structure containing the H-NS – Hha complex (PDB code 4ICG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>]) with the full-length structural model and copying the Hha molecules. System size ranged from 513457 atoms for the Hha systems to around 1,135,000 atoms for the other four systems.</p><p>Interactions between atoms were described by the AMBER99-SB-ILDN force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>), in combination with the TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>). Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated via the Particle Mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>) with a short-range electrostatic cutoff distance at 1.1 nm. Van der Waals interactions were cut off at 1.1 nm. Preparation of the systems consisted of energy minimization equilibration of the solvent. Energy minimization was performed by the conjugate gradient method. After energy minimization, the positions of water molecules and ions were equilibrated by a 1 ns molecular dynamics run at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 bar in which the heavy atoms in the protein were position-restrained with a force constant in each direction of 1000 kJ/mol nm. After preparation, we performed 16 50 ns runs for each system, varying initial conditions by assigning new random starting velocities drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 298 K. All simulations were performed with GROMACS v.4.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>) at the Dutch National Supercomputer with the leap-frog integration scheme and a time step of 2 fs, using LINCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hess et al., 1997</xref>) to constrain all bonds. All simulations were performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble at a pressure of 1 bar, using the v-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Frames were stored every 10 ps. The first 10 ns of each simulation are excluded from analysis, unless stated otherwise. Analysis focused on determining contacts between domains, between H-NS and Hha, between H-NS and ions, and helical hydrogen bonds. Contact maps of interactions between residues in the H-NS dimer system were obtained by first calculating the minimum distance between each residue pair in the system. A residue pair is counted to be in contact if they are at a minimum distance of 0.6 nm or less. The probability of a contact is then calculated as the average over all 16 simulations (excluding the first 10 ns) and displayed as a contact probability matrix. We used a modified version of the g_mdmat tool in GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>) in combination with Perl scripts to generate contact maps. To determine the location of ions with respect to the H-NS system, we calculated the minimum distance between each residue in the H-NS dimer and the ions and counted a contact if the distance between an H-NS residue and an ion is 0.6 nm or less. These contact probabilities (P<sub>Mg2+</sub>, P<sub>K+</sub> and P<sub>Cl-</sub>) are averaged over all 16 simulations and the two monomers. A similar procedure was performed to determine the probability of contacts between H-NS and Hha, P<sub>Hha</sub>, and between H-NS domains, with P<sub>1-40</sub> indicating the probability of finding the DNA-binding domain (residues 96–137) close to the dimerization domain (residues 1–40). P<sub>96-137</sub> indicates the probability of finding the dimerization domain close to the DNA-binding domain.</p><p>To determine the location of the buckle in helix α3, we calculated the helical hydrogen bond distances d<sub>O-N</sub> for residues 22–67 in each monomer between the backbone carbonyl oxygen O of residue i and the backbone amide nitrogen N of residue i + 4. A hydrogen bond is counted to be in contact if they are at a minimum distance of 0.35 nm or less. These probabilities are averaged over all 16 simulations (excluding the first 10 ns) and the two monomers. Snapshots and movies were generated with PyMOL.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>We thank Bas de Mooij for his assistance in standardizing the bridging assay, Wim Jesse and Alexander Kros for synthesizing the H-NS<sub>56-83</sub> peptide and their assistance during its purification.

In this study, van der Valk et al. developed and carried out novel methodologies to assay the impact of H-NS on DNA bridging and DNA stiffening at different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> and in the presence of the H-NS co-regulators Hha and YdgT. The authors also examined the consequences of truncating H-NS and carried out molecular dynamic simulations of the effects of these conditions on the H-NS dimer. The results of these assays and modeling, led the authors to conclude that &quot;H-NS switches between a &quot;closed&quot; and an &quot;open&quot;, bridging-competent conformation driven by environmental cues and interaction partners. This model is extremely attractive, however in my opinion the authors have not tested their interesting ideas in sufficient depth. The study would be a more substantial contribution with additional experiments and discussion to address the following:</p><p>1) Many of the conclusions are based on molecular dynamic simulations. The authors should carry out independent experiments such as fluorescence quenching, to test the predictions of these simulations.</p><p>2) The authors examined the &quot;modulation of DNA bridging by osmotic factors&quot;, but infer that the model is relevant to a range of environmental signals. This should be tested. As a minor point the authors should comment on how the concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> tested in vitro compare to the concentrations found to modulate H-NS activity in the cell.</p><p>3) The authors observe disparate effects of Hha and YdgT with respect to DNA stiffening. How do these differences relate to effects of Hha and YdgT in vivo? Can Hha really be a proxy for YdgT in the molecular simulations?</p><p>4) The authors make very general statements about the implications of their observations? Ideally, the contributions of filament formation versus bridging to the regulation of specific promoters should be examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript van der Valk and colleagues present evidence that certain ions and important regulatory factors from <italic>E. coli</italic> promote the ability of H-NS to bridge DNA molecules. The new in vitro DNA bridging assay they develop is elegant and is used to show that Mg and KCl above a certain concentration can promote DNA bridging by H-NS. The findings with Mg are consistent with the original findings from the Kenney and Yan labs. The authors go on to use the same in vitro assay to show that KCl and regulatory proteins that promote the activities of H-NS, including Hha and YdgT, also promote DNA bridging by H-NS. These findings are new. Finally, based on molecular dynamics simulations the authors suggest that Mg, K, and Hha influence bridging through a common mechanism. This proposed mechanism involves interacting directly with H-NS and blocking an otherwise inhibitory interaction between an oligomerization determinant and a DNA-binding determinant of the protein. The work is interesting but falls somewhat short. Additional biophysical experiments would be needed to strengthen the case that certain ions and proteins promote bridging by altering the distance between specific regions of H-NS. Furthermore, there are no in vivo or in vitro tests of the physiological relevance of Hha or YdgT's ability to promote bridging by H-NS.</p><p>1) For the H-NS (Y61D; M64D) double mutant that is predicted to be defective for dimer-dimer interactions, it would be important to show the EMSA analysis of its ability to bind DNA (currently mentioned as data not shown, subsection “The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening”, last paragraph). Ideally, the authors should also test whether this particular mutant is defective in vivo.</p><p>2) The modulation of DNA bridging and stiffening by truncated H-NS variants is interesting (subsection “Modulation of DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by truncated H-NS variants”). However, the authors should be careful about extrapolating the findings with these fragments of H-NS to other proteins such as H-NST. I think if the authors want to make strong claims about H-NST, then it would be better to directly test whether or not H-NST influences bridging (perhaps with the one from EPEC as it appears to have the most potent activity).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Van der Valk et al. report new insights into the mechanism and regulation of DNA bridging by the bacterial transcriptional regulator H-NS. Specifically, the authors determined how magnesium, osmolarity, and Hha/YdgT modulate a switch between bridged H-NS filaments (H-NS filaments binding two distinct DNA segments) and stiffened H-NS filaments (N-HS binding to a single DNA segment). These two different modes of H-NS binding affect gene expression differently, and understanding both the physical basis for the switch and how it is regulated are crucial questions in the field of bacterial gene regulation. Van der Valk et al. propose and provide support for a novel hypothesis that the switch in binding modes involves sequestration or release of one of the two DNA-binding domains in an H-NS dimer by the N-terminal dimerization domain. Using a new, quantitative bridging assay, the authors report that magnesium and the H-NS modulators Hha/YdgT favor the bridging conformation whereas KCl and truncated H-NS derivatives that mimic other H-NS modulators decrease bridging at high concentrations. In contrast, stiffened filaments were only disrupted by interactions in the dimer-dimer interaction domain. Using molecular dynamics simulations to observe H-NS conformational changes with or without these factors, the authors found that a bulge in the central H-NS α-helix could facilitate interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, resulting in a closed conformation that disfavors bridging. Factors that favor bridging appear to disfavor interactions between the DNA binding domain and dimerization domain, and results in a more open conformation. These results suggest a mechanism by which factors that influence H-NS filament conformations act by altering the sequestration of the DNA-binding domain.</p><p>The authors' findings significantly advance understanding of H-NS filament formation and its regulation, but their presentation in the submitted manuscript will be largely inaccessible to a general audience without revisions to the text and figures. Additionally, one relatively straightforward experiment would greatly increase the relevance of the findings to in vivo regulation. All these changes are achievable within a reasonable time and would make the manuscript suitable for high-profile publication.</p><p>1) Both the TPM and bridging assays need to be better explained in the text and figures. For starters, the ability of readers to understand each assay would be immensely aided by simply graphics that illustrate the assay and what is being measured. For the TPM assay, what is the physical difference in bead behavior between 0% and 100% coverage? This could be illustrated. For the bridging assay, what is the difference between no bridging and complete bridging? Is it just one H-NS dimer bridge between the two DNAs – or more than one bridge? This could be illustrated. For example, an earlier paper from this group provided an excellent illustration of the assay used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Dame et al. 2006. Nature. 444:387). For both assays, what is the source of the DNA used (why was it chosen and where it is from)? Is the DNA from a gene naturally regulated by H-NS? These DNAs should be described, and perhaps shown as sequence in a supplemental figure, rather than referring readers to another paper.</p><p>The first paragraph of the subsection “The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening” should be rewritten to better explain the goals and set-up of the two assays, and the logic for why the experiments were carried out as described so that readers diverse backgrounds can follow the description.</p><p>2) One main conclusion is that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions interact with residues 22-35 of H-NS based on molecular dynamics. Do the authors believe this is principally an ionic interaction or some type of coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by these residues? Could this interaction be abolished by a mutation in H-NS? It would enhance the paper to discuss the properties of this interaction, but more experiments are not necessary. Is there precedence in the literature for Mg<sup>2+</sup> interacting with proteins in a similar manner? If so, examples would be useful to cite and discuss.</p><p>a) The authors should also stipulate explicitly that the simulations were performed in the absence of DNA, and discuss whether the conclusions derived from simulations in the absence of DNA can be used to infer the behavior of H-NS in the presence of DNA. The current simulation provides evidence that the conformation of an H-NS dimer is dynamic in solution, but would this effect be different when H-NS is bound to DNA? A discussion of this question would make the results more complete.</p><p>b) Additionally, it is unclear why the authors' results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> lead them to test the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to H-NS. Did they favor this model because the high [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] does not inhibit DNA binding (subsection “The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening”, last paragraph)?</p><p>3) The authors propose that high K<sup>+</sup> can disrupt the bridging of H-NS, which they relate to changes in the cell during osmotic stress. Although this observation is interesting, the authors should rule out the possibility that the high [Cl<sup>-</sup>] could destabilize H-NS DNA interaction rather than high [K<sup>+</sup>] destabilizing the bridging interaction, since it is known that Cl<sup>-</sup> can destabilize protein-DNA interactions (Leirmo S, et al. 1987. Biochemistry 26:2095.). The authors should repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref> with potassium glutamate to test ionic conditions that actually correspond to the in vivo osmotic stress response. If K<sup>+</sup> is responsible for the changes in bridging, then the potassium glutamate result will show a similar decrease in bridging as KCl.</p><p>4) The discussion on the Hha/YdgT effect on H-NS binding affinity is unclear because the experiment is not described well. The results are also confusing in that Hha and YdgT both increase bridging, but only Hha enhances binding affinity (by their assay). This result does not support the hypothesis put forth in the subsection “Modulation of H-NS by Hha and YdgT”, that both Hha and YdgT increase the binding affinity of H-NS. A clearer description of the results is needed to communicate the differences and similarities between the Hha and YdgT effects accurately. Additionally, a diagram illustrating how Hha and YdgT are proposed to affect filaments and a representation of this experiment also might improve the accessibility of the results. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, including a graphical representation of coverage would immensely help in understanding the results.</p><p>a) It is surprising that Hha and H-NS together do not show cooperative DNA binding. The authors should discuss how these new results can be reconciled with previous publications showing that Hha (along with H-NS) is necessary for silencing of genes (e.g., Ali, S. S., et al. 2013. JBC. 288: 13356; Banos, R. C., et al. 2009. PLoS Genetics. 5:e1000513.) The results presented in those papers suggest that cooperative binding is necessary for forming a filament that can silence genes (a bridged filament), which would also suggest that filaments containing Hha and H-NS should cooperatively form a bridged filament. The result that Hha disrupts cooperative binding is inconsistent with that hypothesis, so the authors should discuss alternative mechanisms to explain how Hha and H-NS together silence genes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Environment driven conformational changes modulate H-NS DNA bridging activity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Key components of the manuscript include use of an elegant biochemical assay to demonstrate that Mg, as well as the regulatory factors Hha and YdgT promote DNA-bridging by H-NS. They also show that K inhibits DNA-bridging by H-NS, and that truncated derivatives of H-NS can modulate the ability of H-NS to bridge the DNA--findings that have implications for naturally occurring inhibitors of H-NS, such as H-NST. Based on molecular dynamics simulations the authors suggest that Mg and Hha promote bridging through a common mechanism. This proposed mechanism involves interacting directly with H-NS and blocking an otherwise inhibitory interaction between an oligomerization determinant and a DNA-binding determinant of the protein. In my earlier review I had indicated that additional biophysical experiments would be needed to strengthen the case that certain ions and proteins influence bridging by altering the distance between specific regions of H-NS. The authors didn't comment on this concern but indicate in their response to reviewer 1 that Alexa555 labelling of H-NS is problematic. Thus, a limitation of both the original and the current study is that there are no independent experimental tests of the predictions from the molecular dynamics simulations used to develop the highly interesting model the authors propose.</p><p>In my earlier review I had also indicated there are no in vivo or in vitro tests of the physiological relevance of Hha or YdgT's ability to promote bridging by H-NS. The authors didn't comment on my concern but indicate in response to reviewer 1 that they are conducting a separate single-molecule study to test the effects of different bridging efficiencies on RNA polymerase progression.</p><p>The authors adequately addressed my specific comments. In particular, they now provide in vitro analysis of the ability of HNS (Y61D;M64D) to bind DNA by EMSA. They also attempted to test the effects of H-NST (from EPEC) on bridging by H-NS in vitro, but ran into problems with H-NST solubility.</p><p>Additional independent experiments would strengthen the case that certain ions and proteins influence bridging by altering the distance between specific regions of H-NS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by van der Valk, et al., systematically explores the effects of ions and accessory proteins on the multimerization and binding mode of H-NS on DNA. To do this they use a combination of a novel &quot;bridging assay&quot; (a pulldown of radioactive bait), molecular dynamics simulations, and TPM (tethered particle motion) assays.</p><p>Novel findings include that H-NS contains a &quot;hinge&quot; that allows it to go from an open to a closed conformation. In the closed conformation one of the DNA binding domains is proposed to be inaccessible because it interacts with the N-terminal &quot;head&quot; domain of the H-NS dimer. The primary determinants of whether the molecule is in an open or closed conformation are ions like K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as accessory molecules like Hha. This paper attempts to unify findings from many other previous publications into a single model.</p><p>I see the paper has been through at least one round of review already. I think it's in pretty good shape.</p><p>I'm not entirely convinced their models are correct regarding Hha vs. YdgT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It makes little sense that by having <italic>less</italic> affinity for H-NS, that Hha in some way disrupts multimerization while YdgT (which has more affinity) promotes more multimerization, but of the closed H-NS conformer. They may be over-interpreting and making a model from limited data without thinking of alternatives. Furthermore, if Hha disrupts cooperativity, would not the HNS multimerization domain mutant (Y61DM64D) act the same as H-NS plus Hha? How does the mutant abolish bridging while Hha promotes it?</p><p>Another issue I have is that in their proposed &quot;closed&quot; conformation I see no way the central dimerization domain would be available for making an H-NS oligomer. The central dimerization domain would also be made inaccessible to binding a new dimer of H-NS. Perhaps they could explain it better?</p><p>I think the molecular dynamics simulations are interesting and they propose that certain residues in the protein interact with ions like Mg<sup>2+</sup> to modulate the conformation of the molecule. It would be nice to see more simulations with &quot;mutant&quot; H-NS or even experimental data where the glutamates in question were changed to serine. I don't believe, however, those experiments are critical for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper that adds important mechanistic detail to the known changes in H-NS:DNA complexes induced by a change in the availability of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, other divalent cations, and H-NS-like proteins.</p><p>Overall, this paper represents an important contribution to the field and I am supportive of publication. However, I think that the paper suffers in two ways and attempts could be made to resolve these issues.</p><p>First, the reliance on molecular dynamics is a potential weakness in my opinion. To me, this seems like an excellent way to generate a hypothesis that can be tested experimentally (see subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup> alters H-NS structure”) but this has not been done yet. Second, the paper attempts to deal with two issues; the role of cations and the role of interaction partners. As a result, I feel that the paper falls just short of &quot;nailing&quot; either story. In some ways, the Discussion reflects this and mostly ignores the interaction partners.</p><p>For me, it would be great to see a paper focused on cation interactions bolstered by a couple of simple experiments testing the predictions of the molecular dynamics. I appreciate that the paper has already been through one round of revision and so this idea may not be greeted enthusiastically by the authors or journal. With this in mind, it may be possible for the authors to rewrite the subsection “Modulation of DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by truncated H-NS variants” so that it is presented as a test of the molecular dynamics predictions. E.g. would some of these truncated H-NS proteins block some of the intramolecular interactions predicted by the dynamics?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27369.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three of the reviewers found the proposed model for the switch in H-NS binding modes to be interesting and important.

Indeed, it has been reported earlier that fluorescently labeling H-NS with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide dramatically affects its functionality (Schroder et al., Biochem Biophys Res Comm 282, 2001). We have independently confirmed these findings and found that Alexa555 labeling of H-NS at C21 abrogates the DNA bridging capacity of H-NS, while it does not hamper DNA binding (confirmed by EMSA; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> – panel A) or DNA stiffening (confirmed by TPM; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> –panel B)).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>DNA binding and activity of H-NS and H-NSC21Alexa555.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 32P labeled (AT-rich) curved DNA substrate as described in Dame et al., Bioch., 2001.

It would be interesting to test additional factors, but we feel that this goes beyond the scope of the current studies, in which we aim to establish a framework using a series of well-defined and ‘simple’ modulatory factors. It is helpful to give the reader an impression of the concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> relevant to the cell. Whereas information on the effects of K<sup>+</sup> in relation to the well-characterized osmoresponsive proU operon is known, little is currently known of the in vivoeffects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on H-NS functionality, beyond the observation that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> stimulon (Minagawa et al., J. Bact, 2003) and some of the genes targeted by H-NS overlap. In order to describe the range of ion concentrations relevant in vivo, we have now included the following sentences in the Results section:</p><p>“The concentration range from 0 – 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> is considered to be physiologically relevant.”</p><p>And,</p><p>“This in vitroobservation mirrors the in vivoresponse of the ProU operon, at which KCl concentrations exceeding 100 mM are required to alleviate H-NS-mediated repression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors observe disparate effects of Hha and YdgT with respect to DNA stiffening.

Can Hha really be a proxy for YdgT in the molecular simulations?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, given the high sequence identity and homology, the differences between Hha and YdgT in their ability to modulate H-NS function are striking. At this point it is not possible to correlate the distinct effects to in vivodata since data addressing the effects of Hha or YdgT alone on H-NS are unavailable. In the field, Hha and YdgT are considered interchangeable and their functions overlapping, but our data, for the first time, show that these small differences in sequence have substantial effects on how H-NS function is modulated. This observation may have important implications as it suggests that Hha- and YdgT-H-NS heteromers may have distinct target specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors make very general statements about the implications of their observations?

In our study we have shown that bridging efficiency – and not filament formation – is modulated by various regulatory factors. Thus our studies provide a rationale for the conditional impact of H-NS on transcription observed in Kotlajich et al. Currently, we are setting up single-molecule transcription experiments in which we can study the effect of different bridging efficiencies – obtained under different experimental conditions – RNA polymerase progression.

Mol Biol, 1997), in which no mutations were found in the H-NS dimer-dimer interaction domain (a.a. residues 56-83), even though mutations were obtained throughout all other domains of H-NS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The modulation of DNA bridging and stiffening by truncated H-NS variants is interesting (subsection “Modulation of DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by truncated H-NS variants”). However, the authors should be careful about extrapolating the findings with these fragments of H-NS to other proteins such as H-NST. I think if the authors want to make strong claims about H-NST, then it would be better to directly test whether or not H-NST influences bridging (perhaps with the one from EPEC as it appears to have the most potent activity).</p></disp-quote><p>We invested a large amount of time into cloning and purifying the natural truncated H-NS variant and H-NS modulator, H-NST (the EPEC variant), and tested this protein in our assays.</p><p>We initially focused on obtaining an untagged variant of this protein. As described earlier by Williamson and Free (MolMic, 2005), we were unable to obtain this protein in soluble form, despite our use of different types of mild detergents to enhance solubility. We therefore resorted to purifying and testing the soluble, tagged variant described by Williamson and Free, which in their hands somewhat reduced binding of H-NS to DNA in vitro. This tagged protein in our hands still suffers from solubility issues and were therefore only able to obtain it at low concentration.</p><p>Nevertheless, we tested the effect of adding this protein in the H-NS-DNA stiffening assay up to 8 µM tagged H-NST. In this range we observed no clear effect on DNA stiffness. Note that also with the H-NS<sub>1-58</sub> peptide (which most resembles H-NST) the effect on DNA stiffness was mild, but significant in the range between 5-10 µM. Next, we investigated the effect of tagged H-NST on the H-NS-DNA bridging efficiency. In the bridging assay concentrations of up to 3 µM tagged H-NST can be achieved, while maintaining an identical buffer composition throughout the titration range. No significant reduction in bridging efficiency could be observed for tagged H-NST, whereas H-NS<sub>1-58</sub> maximally perturbs H-NS mediated bridging at a concentration of 1 µM. The low perturbation efficiency of tagged H-NST in our assays mirrors the smaller effect of tagged H-NST compared to wtH-NST on H-NS mediated repression, observed in vivo by Williamson and Free.</p><p>The limited solubility of H-NST underscores the importance of using mimics with high solubility, such as the natural H-NS truncated derivatives used in our studies, to be able to investigate fundamental mechanistic aspects of H-NS activity crucial to its functional modulation.</p><p>We have softened the statement referred to by this reviewer by deleting the word ‘strongly’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The authors' findings significantly advance understanding of H-NS filament formation and its regulation, but their presentation in the submitted manuscript will be largely inaccessible to a general audience without revisions to the text and figures. Additionally, one relatively straightforward experiment would greatly increase the relevance of the findings to in vivo regulation. All these changes are achievable within a reasonable time and would make the manuscript suitable for high-profile publication.</p><p>1) Both the TPM and bridging assays need to be better explained in the text and figures. For starters, the ability of readers to understand each assay would be immensely aided by simply graphics that illustrate the assay and what is being measured. For the TPM assay, what is the physical difference in bead behavior between 0% and 100% coverage? This could be illustrated. For the bridging assay, what is the difference between no bridging and complete bridging? Is it just one H-NS dimer bridge between the two DNAs – or more than one bridge? This could be illustrated. For example, an earlier paper from this group provided an excellent illustration of the assay used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Dame et al. 2006. Nature. 444:387). For both assays, what is the source of the DNA used (why was it chosen and where it is from)? Is the DNA from a gene naturally regulated by H-NS? These DNAs should be described, and perhaps shown as sequence in a supplemental figure, rather than referring readers to another paper.</p><p>The first paragraph of the subsection “The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening” should be rewritten to better explain the goals and set-up of the two assays, and the logic for why the experiments were carried out as described so that readers diverse backgrounds can follow the description.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a figure to better illustrate how the assays used work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We have also modified the Materials and methods to include the following to further elucidate the minutia of the experiment: “and normalized to a reference sample containing the amount of labeled <sub>32</sub>P 685 bp DNA used in the assay.” The DNA substrate is now referred to as “a random, AT rich, 685 bp (32% GC) DNA substrate” in the subsection “DNA preparation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One main conclusion is that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions interact with residues 22-35 of H-NS based on molecular dynamics. Do the authors believe this is principally an ionic interaction or some type of coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by these residues? Could this interaction be abolished by a mutation in H-NS? It would enhance the paper to discuss the properties of this interaction, but more experiments are not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>The simulations suggest that the interaction between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the glutamate residues in region 22-35 is mainly ionic, as the residence time of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions at those residues is relatively short, in the order of a few ns.</p><p>We altered the main text to include this information (lines 191 – 198):</p><p>“The likelihood of finding Mg<sup>2+</sup> interacting with (i.e. being within 0.6 nm of) H-NS residues, indicated by PMg<sup>2+</sup>, revealed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> has a preference for glutamate residues in region 22-35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), where the ions shield this region from interacting with the DNA binding domains. The magnesium ions transiently interact with the glutamate residues, with residence times in the order of a few ns (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there precedence in the literature for Mg<sup>2+</sup> interacting with proteins in a similar manner? If so, examples would be useful to cite and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to find any cases where Mg<sup>2+</sup> interacts with proteins in a similar manner. However, we do suspect that similar interactions occur on other proteins, potentially modulating also their function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The authors should also stipulate explicitly that the simulations were performed in the absence of DNA, and discuss whether the conclusions derived from simulations in the absence of DNA can be used to infer the behavior of H-NS in the presence of DNA. The current simulation provides evidence that the conformation of an H-NS dimer is dynamic in solution, but would this effect be different when H-NS is bound to DNA? A discussion of this question would make the results more complete.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been addressed in the Results section where we have added:</p><p>“Even though the simulations were performed in absence of DNA, these observations indicate that DNA bridging is no longer possible in such a conformation, as the H-NS dimer can bind DNA only through its remaining/second DNA binding domain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Additionally, it is unclear why the authors' results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> lead them to test the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to H-NS. Did they favor this model because the high [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] does not inhibit DNA binding (subsection “The role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and H-NS multimerization in DNA bridging and DNA stiffening”, last paragraph)?</p></disp-quote><p>A motivation of testing the direct effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on H-NS dimer structure has now been included:</p><p>“As Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not affect the multimeric state of H-NS in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a model involving an effect on H-NS multimerization can be excluded. A structural effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on individual units within H-NS filaments could explain the observed effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the bridging efficiency of H-NS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors propose that high K<sup>+</sup> can disrupt the bridging of H-NS, which they relate to changes in the cell during osmotic stress. Although this observation is interesting, the authors should rule out the possibility that the high [Cl<sup>-</sup>] could destabilize H-NS DNA interaction rather than high [K<sup>+</sup>] destabilizing the bridging interaction, since it is known that Cl<sup>-</sup> can destabilize protein-DNA interactions (Leirmo S, et al. 1987. Biochemistry 26:2095.). The authors should repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref> with potassium glutamate to test ionic conditions that actually correspond to the in vivo osmotic stress response. If K<sup>+</sup> is responsible for the changes in bridging, then the potassium glutamate result will show a similar decrease in bridging as KCl.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We have carried out additional experiments to determine the effects of potassium-glutamate on DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by H-NS. The experiments reveal that potassium glutamate, similar to our findings with potassium chloride, reduces the DNA bridging efficiency, yet that higher concentrations of this salt are needed to achieve the same effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>). Throughout this concentration range DNA stiffening is only mildly affected (as seen with KCl), indicating that the intrinsic binding of H-NS to DNA is minimally affected by altered potassium glutamate concentrations. We have also investigated the effects of potassium-glutamate on the DNA binding affinity of H-NS. Here we found that, unlike our expectations based on literature (Leirmo et al., Biochemistry, 1987), potassium-glutamate reduces the DNA binding affinity of H-NS as seen in the figure below in panels C and D. The observation that despite a low DNA binding affinity DNA bridging is enhanced, supports our findings that the observed effects of ions on DNA bridging is direct, and mediated by a structural change in the protein. These findings further strengthen our conclusions that it is indeed DNA bridging and not DNA stiffening that is sensitive to environmental stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The discussion on the Hha/YdgT effect on H-NS binding affinity is unclear because the experiment is not described well. The results are also confusing in that Hha and YdgT both increase bridging, but only Hha enhances binding affinity (by their assay). This result does not support the hypothesis put forth in the subsection “Modulation of H-NS by Hha and YdgT”, that both Hha and YdgT increase the binding affinity of H-NS. A clearer description of the results is needed to communicate the differences and similarities between the Hha and YdgT effects accurately. Additionally, a diagram illustrating how Hha and YdgT are proposed to affect filaments and a representation of this experiment also might improve the accessibility of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered this part of the text to correct for this inadvertent omission. It now reads as follows:</p><p>“One possible explanation for the effects of Hha and YdgT, is that they effectively increase the DNA binding affinity of H-NS<sub>47</sub>. We find that the affinity of H-NS is significantly enhanced by Hha, but it is not significantly altered by YdgT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).”</p><p>We have also added “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>: Schematic depiction of the effects of Hha and YdgT.” To more clearly explain our findings with Hha and YdgT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, including a graphical representation of coverage would immensely help in understanding the results.</p><p>a) It is surprising that Hha and H-NS together do not show cooperative DNA binding. The authors should discuss how these new results can be reconciled with previous publications showing that Hha (along with H-NS) is necessary for silencing of genes (e.g., Ali, S. S., et al. 2013. JBC. 288: 13356; Banos, R. C., et al. 2009. PLoS Genetics. 5:e1000513.) The results presented in those papers suggest that cooperative binding is necessary for forming a filament that can silence genes (a bridged filament), which would also suggest that filaments containing Hha and H-NS should cooperatively form a bridged filament. The result that Hha disrupts cooperative binding is inconsistent with that hypothesis, so the authors should discuss alternative mechanisms to explain how Hha and H-NS together silence genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, earlier studies of H-NS and Hha clearly demonstrate functional interactions between Hha and H-NS required for gene silencing. However, these studies provide <italic>direct</italic> information only on the effect of Hha on the affinity of H-NS, and not on cooperativity of H-NS binding arising from the interaction with Hha. Altered cooperativity, i.e. an altered propensity to form protein-DNA filaments, is reported for the first time in our work as we are capable of accurately quantifying this aspect of H- NS binding. This was not possible with the methods employed by previous studies (such as those employed by Ali, S. S., et al. 2013. JBC. 288: 13356). We have updated the text and added an illustrative figure to explain how Hha lowers the cooperativity of H-NS DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>):</p><p>“The absence of cooperativity observed in the presence of Hha, indicates that Hha (unlike YdgT) interferes with filament formation. A higher effective affinity of H-NS- Hha to DNA compared to DNA bound H-NS-Hha may favor nucleation over filament formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).”</p><p>It is also important to note that there exists no discrepancy between our findings concerning the cooperativity of DNA binding and DNA bridging as these two occur at significantly different H-NS concentrations (150 nM H-NS for DNA binding, whereas bridging only begins at roughly 3 μM H-NS).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There continues to be enthusiasm for your study, but after discussion, the reviewers feel the following additional revisions are critical for the study to live up to its potential as a significant advance.</p><p>1) Experimental tests of the predictions of the molecular dynamics simulations need to be carried out. This should involve mutating the residues (i.e. glutamates to serines) expected to interact with ions like Mg<sup>2+</sup> and mutating residue R11 expected to destabilise the closed H-NS conformation. Assaying the effects of such mutations, using the experimental tools applied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, should reveal differences in magnesium modulation of HNS binding as predicted by the simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of this suggestion we have cloned and purified several H-NS derivatives to test the occurrence of predicted structural changes in response to altered physico-chemical conditions:</p><p>a) H-NS<sub>E42S, E43S, E44S</sub> (a mutant with α helix 3 predicted to be stable)</p><p>b) H-NS<sub>E43A, E44A, S45A</sub> (another mutant with α helix 3 predicted to be stable)</p><p>c) H-NS<sub>R11E</sub> (a mutation that should prevent the closed conformation by removing an important salt bridge)</p><p>We investigated these H-NS derivatives in both our DNA bridging and Tethered Particle Motion assays.

Key components of the manuscript include use of an elegant biochemical assay to demonstrate that Mg, as well as the regulatory factors Hha and YdgT promote DNA-bridging by H-NS. They also show that K inhibits DNA-bridging by H-NS, and that truncated derivatives of H-NS can modulate the ability of H-NS to bridge the DNA--findings that have implications for naturally occurring inhibitors of H-NS, such as H-NST. Based on molecular dynamics simulations the authors suggest that Mg and Hha promote bridging through a common mechanism. This proposed mechanism involves interacting directly with H-NS and blocking an otherwise inhibitory interaction between an oligomerization determinant and a DNA-binding determinant of the protein. In my earlier review I had indicated that additional biophysical experiments would be needed to strengthen the case that certain ions and proteins influence bridging by altering the distance between specific regions of H-NS. The authors didn't comment on this concern but indicate in their response to reviewer 1 that Alexa555 labelling of H-NS is problematic. Thus, a limitation of both the original and the current study is that there are no independent experimental tests of the predictions from the molecular dynamics simulations used to develop the highly interesting model the authors propose.</p><p>In my earlier review I had also indicated there are no in vivo or in vitro tests of the physiological relevance of Hha or YdgT's ability to promote bridging by H-NS. The authors didn't comment on my concern but indicate in response to reviewer 1 that they are conducting a separate single-molecule study to test the effects of different bridging efficiencies on RNA polymerase progression.</p><p>The authors adequately addressed my specific comments. In particular, they now provide in vitro analysis of the ability of HNS (Y61D;M64D) to bind DNA by EMSA. They also attempted to test the effects of H-NST (from EPEC) on bridging by H-NS in vitro, but ran into problems with H-NST solubility.</p><p>Additional independent experiments would strengthen the case that certain ions and proteins influence bridging by altering the distance between specific regions of H-NS.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reviewer’s suggestion we have designed an H-NS mutant that is predicted to directly affect the ability of H-NS to form the open and closed conformations.</p><p>In this mutant, we sought to abrogate the ability of H-NS to attain a closed conformation. In this light, we substituted the glutamic acids E43, E44, and serine S45 with Alanines to prevent the closed conformation. The DNA bridging assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>) shows that this mutant indeed can bridge DNA in a Mg<sup>2+</sup> independent manner. We note that there is a strong similarity in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of the H-NS<sub>E43A,E44A,S45A</sub> protein and wildtype H-NS in the presence of 4 µM YdgT. This similarity further supports our idea that YdgT and Hha promote the open conformation of H-NS to enhance its bridging efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I'm not entirely convinced their models are correct regarding Hha vs. YdgT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It makes little sense that by having less affinity for H-NS, that Hha in some way disrupts multimerization while YdgT (which has more affinity) promotes more multimerization, but of the closed H-NS conformer. They may be over-interpreting and making a model from limited data without thinking of alternatives. Furthermore, if Hha disrupts cooperativity, would not the HNS multimerization domain mutant (Y61DM64D) act the same as H-NS plus Hha? How does the mutant abolish bridging while Hha promotes it?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as the reviewer summarizes, we find that Hha antagonizes the cooperativity inherent to H-NS DNA binding and multimerization. However, different from the results for the H-NS multimerization mutant (Y61DM64D), we find that H-NS + Hha is still capable of multimerization along the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We agree with the referee that the disparate behaviour of the two related proteins, Hha and YdgT, is unexpected and hard to explain at a molecular mechanistic level based on the currently available information (unfortunately a H-NS-YdgT co-crystal structure is lacking). Therefore, we have significantly reduced the text in relation to our structural interpretation of these observations, and have removed the model in the accompanying figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue I have is that in their proposed &quot;closed&quot; conformation I see no way the central dimerization domain would be available for making an H-NS oligomer. The central dimerization domain would also be made inaccessible to binding a new dimer of H-NS. Perhaps they could explain it better?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute question posed by the reviewer. We agree that the closed conformation in the shown simulation snapshots appears quite compact. It is important to realize that the structure is dynamic and that different physico-chemical conditions drive a bias within the population of proteins towards either open or closed conformation.</p><p>Interestingly, we found similar cooperativity in DNA binding by H-NS in the “open” conformation (H-NS<sub>E43A,E44A,S45A</sub> as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and the “closed” conformation (wildtype H-NS in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Only in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> does H-NS show a very high level of cooperative DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This indicates that cooperativity by H-NS is not promoted by either the “closed” or “open” conformations, but by the transition between the two states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the molecular dynamics simulations are interesting and they propose that certain residues in the protein interact with ions like Mg<sup>2+</sup> to modulate the conformation of the molecule. It would be nice to see more simulations with &quot;mutant&quot; H-NS or even experimental data where the glutamates in question were changed to serine. I don't believe, however, those experiments are critical for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an experimental test of our structural model (and the specific residues of importance for the structural changes and Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing in the protein) significantly strengthens our observations. We have therefore designed and generated an H-NS derivative, in which the glutamic acids E43, E44, and S45 are substituted with Alanines. These mutations are predicted to prevent buckle formation and to result in a stable a-helix structure. This prevents the occurrence of the closed conformation, and is expected to result in a high efficiency of DNA bridging, which is not dependent on Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Our bridging assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>) shows that this mutant indeed bridges DNA in a Mg<sup>2+</sup> independent manner.

However, I think that the paper suffers in two ways and attempts could be made to resolve these issues.</p><p>First, the reliance on molecular dynamics is a potential weakness in my opinion. To me, this seems like an excellent way to generate a hypothesis that can be tested experimentally (see subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup> alters H-NS structure”) but this has not been done yet. Second, the paper attempts to deal with two issues; the role of cations and the role of interaction partners. As a result, I feel that the paper falls just short of &quot;nailing&quot; either story. In some ways, the Discussion reflects this and mostly ignores the interaction partners.</p><p>For me, it would be great to see a paper focused on cation interactions bolstered by a couple of simple experiments testing the predictions of the molecular dynamics. I appreciate that the paper has already been through one round of revision and so this idea may not be greeted enthusiastically by the authors or journal. With this in mind, it may be possible for the authors to rewrite the subsection “Modulation of DNA bridging and DNA stiffening by truncated H-NS variants” so that it is presented as a test of the molecular dynamics predictions. E.g. would some of these truncated H-NS proteins block some of the intramolecular interactions predicted by the dynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the reviewers comment to heart, but we fear that this is a misrepresentation of our experiments with truncated H-NS proteins.
