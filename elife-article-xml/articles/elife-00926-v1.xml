Muscle fibers are particularly susceptible to injury, and defective sarcolemma resealing causes muscular dystrophy. Caveolae accumulate in dystrophic muscle fibers and caveolin and cavin mutations cause muscle pathology, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that muscle fibers and other cell types repair membrane wounds by a mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, release of acid sphingomyelinase, and rapid lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis. Wounding or exposure to sphingomyelinase triggered endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, which gradually merged into larger compartments. The pore-forming toxin SLO was directly visualized entering cells within caveolar vesicles, and depletion of caveolin inhibited plasma membrane resealing. Our findings directly link lesion removal by caveolar endocytosis to the maintenance of plasma membrane and muscle fiber integrity, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscle pathology associated with mutations in caveolae proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00926.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00926.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00926.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must be able to rapidly repair damage to their outer membranes. This is particularly important in the case of muscle cells, which are vulnerable to damage, and the failure of these cells to repair their outer membranes leads to the muscle wastage seen in muscular dystrophy. Researchers do not fully understand how cells repair membrane, but one popular theory is that they use the membranes of specialized vesicles to ‘patch’ areas that have been damaged.</p><p>A group of proteins called caveolins have also been implicated in membrane repair but, again, the details have not been worked out. These proteins are best known for their role in the formation of caveolae — small pouches formed by invaginated sections of the plasma membrane. Now, Corrotte et al. have obtained evidence that membrane repair relies not on patching, but on endocytosis (the process by which substances are taken into the cell in small vesicles that ‘pinch’ from the plasma membrane) of these caveolae pouches.</p><p>Corrotte et al. treated cells with streptolysin O, a toxin that forms pores in the membrane that cannot be repaired using patches, and found that this led to the formation of small membrane-derived vesicles that looked just like caveolae. Further tests confirmed that these vesicles contained caveolar proteins, and that they removed the toxin from the plasma membrane by endocytosis. Similar effects were seen in response to mechanical damage caused by tiny glass beads. Moreover, blocking the expression of caveolar genes prevented cells from repairing membrane damage.</p><p>Based on their findings, Corrotte et al. propose an alternative model for the repair process; namely that cellular damage triggers an influx of calcium ions, which causes vesicles called lysosomes to release chemicals that promote the formation of caveolae. These then remove the damaged area through endocytosis, restoring the integrity of the membrane. The results offer new insights into why mutations in caveolar proteins are associated with muscle disorders, including muscular dystrophy and cardiac dysfunction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00926.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00926.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>toxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM064625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Norma W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AI34867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Norma W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Council for Scientific and Technological Developement - Ciencia sem Fronteiras Program, Brazil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200890/2012-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castro-Gomes</surname><given-names>Thiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>Patricia E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells repair damage to their outer membranes not by patching them as previously thought, but by using proteins called caveolins to remove the damaged regions by endocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in wounded cells triggers a repair mechanism that reseals the plasma membrane (PM) within a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNeil et al., 2003</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induces exocytosis of lysosomes, a process required for PM resealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>). PM repair was initially suggested to be mediated by a membrane patch applied to the wound site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyake and McNeil, 1995</xref>), or through exocytosis-mediated reduction in PM tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Togo et al., 2000</xref>). However, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lysosomal exocytosis is also required for the resealing of cells injured by pore-forming toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>). These toxins generate stable, protein-lined transmembrane lesions that cannot be resealed by a membrane patch or simply by relieving PM tension. Recent studies clarified this issue, by showing that lysosomal exocytosis in wounded cells is followed by a rapid, cholesterol-dependent form of endocytosis that removes pores and lesions from the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>) and directs them to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corrotte et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of the lysosomal enzyme acid shingomyelinase (ASM) is required for the endocytic process that promotes wounded cell resealing. Transcriptional silencing of ASM abolished PM repair, and addition of exogenous ASM restored resealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). These findings provided a novel conceptual framework for the mechanism of PM repair, indicating that exocytosis promotes resealing not by generating a membrane patch, but by releasing enzymes that remodel the outer leaflet of the PM and stimulate endocytosis. ASM converts the abundant PM lipid sphingomyelin into ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schissel et al., 1996</xref>), and ceramide-enriched microdomains can trigger invagination of lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holopainen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>). However, the exact role of ceramide and the nature of the endocytic vesicles triggered by cell wounding are still unknown.</p><p>PM repair is of paramount importance in muscle. Muscle fibers are frequently injured in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNeil and Khakee, 1992</xref>) and failure to repair the sarcolemma causes muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bansal and Campbell, 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, the fragile muscle fibers from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy contain elevated numbers of caveolae-like vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonilla et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Repetto et al., 1999</xref>), and mutations in the muscle-specific caveolar protein caveolin-3 (Cav3) cause multiple forms of muscle pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>). These observations, taken together with the recently uncovered role for endocytosis in PM repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>), raised the possibility that caveolae-derived endocytic vesicles might play a direct, heretofore unrecognized role in the mechanism responsible for resealing PM wounds. In this study we show that injury-induced internalization of caveolae-derived vesicles is a dynamic process essential for the restoration of PM integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Permeabilization with a pore-forming toxin or exposure to sphingomyelinase induces accumulation of ceramide and &lt;80 nm vesicles</title><p>Prior studies suggested that ASM released from lysosomes during cell wounding triggers formation of ceramide-enriched endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tam et al., 2010</xref>).

Previous TEM studies detected numerous large, irregularly shaped endocytic vesicles in cells fixed 4–5 min after SLO permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, when cells were examined just 30 s after treatment with SLO or SM, the newly formed endocytic vesicles (identified by luminal BSA-gold added as an endocytic tracer) appeared as homogeneously round and small (&lt;80 nm). Similar peripheral &lt;80 nm endocytic vesicles were present in untreated cells, albeit in lower numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantification revealed that treatment with SLO or SM for 30 s increased the number of BSA-gold-containing vesicles relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Clathrin-coated vesicles in the same preparations did not contain BSA-gold, in agreement with the slower rate of formation of this class of endocytic vesicles (results not shown). At later time points (60 and 180 s) larger compartments suggestive of homotypic fusion of the &lt;80 nm vesicles were increasingly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantification of vesicle size, area and BSA-gold content supported the conclusion that the small endocytic vesicles induced by exposure to SLO or SM increase in size over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the number of &lt;80 nm vesicles containing the endocytic tracer BSA-gold also increased when cells were treated with recombinant human ASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Furthermore, transcriptional silencing of ASM reduced the number of peripheral &lt;80 nm vesicles seen by TEM in cells exposed to SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results reinforce the view that ASM released through lysosomal exocytosis in wounded cells can generate ceramide on the outer leaflet of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schissel et al., 1998</xref>) and promote endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tam et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SLO is removed from the PM by caveolar endocytosis</title><p>The newly-formed endocytic vesicles observed in SLO or SM-treated cells strongly resembled caveolae, the flask-like PM invaginations enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that are present in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palade, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). To investigate a potential role of caveolae-derived vesicles in the internalization of SLO pores, cells were permeabilized with GFP-tagged SLO (which retains full pore-forming activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>]) and analyzed by cryo-immuno EM using antibodies against GFP or the caveolae-associated protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drab et al., 2001</xref>). The amount of GFP-SLO associated with flat regions of the PM gradually decreased over time, consistent with a toxin internalization process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Importantly, during the first 60 s after injury GFP-SLO was increasingly detected on &lt;80 nm vesicles containing Cav1, which are properties of caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). By 300 s the amount of SLO co-localizing with Cav1 decreased, in agreement with the previously described traffic of internalized SLO into later compartments of the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corrotte et al., 2012</xref>). The number of &lt;80 nm vesicles positive for Cav1 alone or SLO alone also decreased over time, simultaneously with an increase in the number of &gt;80 nm vesicles containing either Cav1 alone or both Cav1 and SLO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These results are fully consistent with our TEM analysis of SLO-permeabilized cells, showing an initial increase in the number of &lt;80 nm endocytic vesicles followed by the gradual appearance of merged compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00926.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SLO is internalized in Cav1-positive caveolae-like vesicles that separate from the PM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-immuno EM localization of GFP-SLO and Cav1 in NRK cells. 5 nm gold: anti-GFP (arrowheads); 10 nm gold: anti-Cav1 (arrows).

However, the possibility still remained that caveolar vesicles containing SLO might still be connected to the PM. To directly address this issue, we developed a flow cytometry (FACS) assay for detection of cell-associated fluorescent SLO before and after quenching with specific antibodies. To ensure accessibility of the fluorescent moiety to the quenching antibodies, we used a single cysteine SLO mutant labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 at the N-terminus (a region not inserted into membranes during pore-formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shatursky et al., 1999</xref>]). When cells were incubated with the labeled toxin at 4°C, addition of anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies quenched &gt;90% of the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, under conditions that allow toxin binding but not endocytosis, most cell-associated toxin is accessible to quenching antibodies. When the same amount of labeled toxin was added to cells at 37°C, cells were fully permeabilized and about 30% resealed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> under the assay conditions, as indicated by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). By gating on the PI-negative (resealed) cell population we found that at least 50% of the cell-associated Alexa 488-SLO was protected from quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that it entered compartments no longer in contact with the extracellular medium. Antibody-mediated quenching of extracellular Alexa 488-SLO was also observed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and quench-protected intracellular toxin colocalized with Cav1-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00926.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Internalized SLO colocalizes with Cav1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were pre-incubated with 3 µg/ml Alexa 488-SLO (green) for 5 min at 4°C, washed and either kept at 4°C (0 s) or incubated at 37°C in DME+Ca<sup>2+</sup> (180 s), followed or not by anti-Alexa Fluor 488 quenching antibodies (blue) for 30 min at 4°C.

Thus, injury with SLO or exposure to the ceramide-generating enzyme SM increase the population of peripheral caveolae-like vesicles in a Cav1-dependent manner, a process that correlates with the ability of these cells to reseal their PM. Quantification by cryo-immuno EM revealed that ∼20% of the Cav1 detected on sections of NRK cells was initially associated with flat PM regions without caveolae, and this fraction was reduced to ∼9% after 60 s of exposure to SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup>, along with an increase in labeling of intracellular &lt;80 nm vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These results suggest that the intracellular accumulation of caveolae-like vesicles after exposure to SLO or SM results from internalization of pre-existing and, to a certain extent, of de novo assembled caveolae.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found no requirement for dynamin-1 and -2 in the internalization of caveolar vesicles triggered by SLO permeabilization or SM exposure. Cells depleted in dynamin-2 with Dyn2 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) were strongly deficient in transferrin endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but fully capable of repairing their PM after permeabilization with SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Clathrin-coated vesicles in the same preparations were strongly stained with extracellular ruthenium red and showed elongated ‘necks’ in continuity with the PM, typical features of dynamin deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In sharp contrast, no similar structures were observed associated with caveolae. To examine a potential compensatory role of dynamin-1, we performed similar assays using an inducible fibroblast cell line generated from dynamin-1 and -2 double conditional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>).

In contrast, Cav3-deficient myotubes exposed to SLO+Ca<sup>2+</sup> showed high levels of nuclear PI staining, indicating a sarcolemma repair defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,E</xref>). No nuclear staining with PI was detected in C2C12 myotube cultures not exposed to SLO, with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (results not shown).

Strikingly, our results revealed that a large fraction of the endocytic vesicles formed a few seconds after injury resemble caveolae, the ubiquitous flask-shaped PM invaginations that have been implicated in transcytosis, mechanosensing and signaling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lajoie and Nabi, 2010</xref>). Wounded cells show increased numbers of small, homogeneously shaped vesicles with the typical morphology and markers of caveolae. Several independent lines of evidence demonstrate that internalization of these vesicles occurs rapidly, with a time-course that matches the kinetics of PM repair. Cryo-immuno EM, endocytosis and live imaging assays showed that the pore-forming toxin SLO is removed from the PM and traffics into cells in vesicular carriers containing the caveolar marker Cav1. Furthermore, transcriptional silencing of Cav1 in non-muscle cells and Cav3 in myotubes inhibits caveolae formation and PM repair. Collectively, our study identifies caveolar vesicles as dynamic endocytic structures that play a key role in the restoration of PM integrity.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for the understanding of muscular dystrophy. Mutations in the muscle-specific caveolin Cav3 cause at least five forms of muscle pathology, including limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1C, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, hyperCKemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in PTRF/cavin1 also lead to muscular dystrophy and cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rajab et al., 2010</xref>), and overexpression of this caveolae-associated protein rescues membrane repair defects in dystrophic muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). In earlier studies these effects were not attributed to caveolae assembly and internalization, but rather to an independent role of caveolin and cavin molecules in regulating the traffic of unrelated proteins involved in muscle fiber repair, such as dysferlin and MG53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernández-Deviez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Our study sheds important new light on this issue, by showing that caveolar vesicles are directly involved in the endocytic mechanism by which cells remove wounds from their PM.</p><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy fibers were shown in numerous studies to contain elevated numbers of caveolae, but this important finding was also attributed to secondary effects of alterations in Cav3 expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonilla et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Repetto et al., 1999</xref>). However, it is important to note that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in dystrophin, a main component of the dystroglycan complex that confers stability to the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohn and Campbell, 2000</xref>). Duchenne dystrophic fibers are very susceptible to contraction-induced wounding, and are likely to undergo repeated cycles of injury and repair—a process that we now show to involve intracellular accumulation of caveolar vesicles, in several cell types including C2C12 myotubes and primary muscle fibers. Thus, our findings provide a novel explanation for the accumulation of caveolae within fragile muscle fibers that is fully consistent with a direct role of caveolar endocytosis in sarcolemma resealing. Our results are also in agreement with the elevated number of caveolar profiles observed in cell types subject to chronic membrane stress, such as endothelial cells and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Caveolae are thought to be dynamic structures, but the signals leading to their assembly and internalization remain a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lajoie and Nabi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sandvig et al., 2011</xref>). Caveolae are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, and contain the abundant surface lipid sphingomyelin that generates ceramide after cleavage of its phosphorylcholine head group by SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). Exogenously added glycosphingolipids selectively stimulate caveolar endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>), and the ceramide core of glycosphingolipids was identified as an important determinant of caveolae internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2003</xref>). However, the mechanism by which glycosphingolipids modulate caveolar endocytosis remained unclear, because a non-hydrolyzable synthetic glycosphingolipid analog was reported to have the same effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>). Our study clarifies this issue, by directly demonstrating that treatment of the outer leaflet of the PM with the ceramide-generating enzymes ASM or SM is sufficient to induce internalization of vesicles with properties of caveolae. In agreement with our findings, ASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Opreanu et al., 2011</xref>) and ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilderback et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czarny et al., 2003</xref>) were detected in caveolae-enriched membrane fractions.</p><p>Collectively, our results support a novel model proposing that injury to the PM triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, exocytosis of lysosomes, ASM release and generation of surface-associated ceramide—an event that facilitates caveolae internalization and lesion removal/repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A,B</xref>). We consistently observed a strong inhibition of PM repair in cells acutely depleted of Cav1 by RNAi (this study) or depleted in cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idone et al., 2008</xref>). These findings are in full agreement with our additional lines of evidence implicating caveolar vesicles as endocytic carriers responsible for lesion removal from the PM. However, it is also important to note that a complex cross-talk exists between caveolar and other cholesterol-dependent, clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. Thus, non-caveolar cholesterol/sphingolipid raft-dependent endocytic carriers may also play a role in removing lesions from the PM under some conditions, such as in Cav1-deficient cells, which were shown to upregulate non-caveolar endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2003</xref>).<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00926.022</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Model for PM repair mediated by caveolar endocytosis.</title><p>Permeabilization with transmembrane toxin pores (<bold>A</bold>) or mechanical wounding (<bold>B</bold>) triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, exocytosis of lysosomes, release of ASM, and generation of ceramide at the PM outer leaflet, a process that promotes caveolae internalization and fusion.

These findings led to suggestions that indirect effects on the actin cytoskeleton or sequestration of essential factors distinct from dynamin might explain the inhibition in caveolar endocytosis by dominant-negative dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). After extensive analysis of cells depleted in dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 we did not observe any defects in caveolar endocytosis in response to PM wounding, suggesting that this process may be dynamin-independent.

Strikingly, in this study we found that cell injury or exposure to purified SM initially generates homogeneous &lt;80 nm vesicles with a morphology typical of caveolae, which then rapidly merge originating larger, irregular intracellular compartments. Interestingly, wounded cells accumulate larger and more abundant endocytic vesicles after the cortical cytoskeleton is disrupted with cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tam et al., 2010</xref>), a condition that enhances caveolae motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomsen et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, removal of obstacles presented by the cortical cytoskeleton may facilitate internalization and intracellular merging of caveolae. Supporting this view, we observed reduced levels of EHD2, the ATPase proposed to link caveolae to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>), on caveolar vesicles that move deeper into cells after injury or exposure to SM.</p><p>In several instances caveolae appeared to merge intracellularly while still connected to the PM, particularly when cells were mechanically injured. We envision that the rapid intracellular merging of surface-connected caveolae, possibly enhanced by the higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flowing through large lesions, might generate forces on the PM that constrict and ultimately reseal wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). Such ‘bunch of grapes’ pattern of caveolar vesicles is also observed in cells not subjected to a specific wounding procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fra et al., 1995</xref>). However, it is important to note that lifting cells from dishes and other routine cell handling steps often results in PM wounding and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Detaching cells from their substratum was actually reported to trigger rapid and robust caveolae internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muriel et al., 2011</xref>). Our observations suggest a model where caveolae-derived branched endocytic structures still tethered to the PM would be generated as a consequence of the vigorous Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and localized release of lysosomal ASM triggered by large wounds. These branched caveolae-derived structures appear to accumulate around the periphery of the PM wounds, and as their deeper portions merge intracellularly, constriction forces may be generated on the PM facilitating bilayer resealing. This model predicts that when the complex caveolar structures pinch off from the PM, large intracellular vesicles would be generated next to injury sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). This scenario is fully consistent with previous EM observations of large vesicles close to wound sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNeil and Steinhardt, 2003</xref>). These large intracellular vesicles were at the time interpreted as exocytic ‘patches’, responsible for resealing the wound. Here we propose a very different scenario for the repair of mechanical injury to the PM: After Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lysosomal exocytosis and ASM release, caveolae-derived vesicles would move into cells while undergoing a homotypic fusion process, which would ultimately result in large compartments of endocytic origin (as opposed to a large exocytic patch, as proposed in earlier models—[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNeil and Steinhardt, 2003</xref>]).</p><p>A vesicle internalization/constriction mechanism for PM resealing predicts that significant local tension would be generated on PM sites close to the wound. This tension may be dissipated by the localized exocytosis of lysosomes, and/or by the recently demonstrated process of flattening of individual caveolae in response to membrane stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that mechanical wounds may actually occur preferentially in areas where caveolae are present, because membranes may be rendered more fragile by the flattening of caveolae that follows a mechanical stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). Caveolae are extremely abundant in cells that are under mechanical stress in vivo, such as smooth muscle fibers and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). Our findings now suggest that frequent PM injury and repair may represent the mechanism responsible for upregulation of the caveolar population in these cells.</p><p>In summary, our study provides a novel framework for understanding how endocytosis functions in the maintenance and restoration of PM integrity, particularly in tissues under high mechanical stress such as skeletal muscle. Importantly, this work also identifies caveolar endocytosis as a pathway that may be directly affected in several types of muscular dystrophy. Resealing of injured muscle fibers requires muscle-specific proteins such as dysferlin and MG53, which accumulate in vesicles close to sites of injury and have been assumed to facilitate formation of an exocytic membrane patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2009a</xref>). In light of our findings and of the newly uncovered role of endocytosis in PM repair, it will be of great interest to determine whether these muscle-specific proteins participate in wound resealing by facilitating caveolar assembly/internalization, and lesion removal by endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>NRK and HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in high glucose DME containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).

Since the amount of SLO fluorescence that becomes associated with cells under conditions that allow PM repair is limited, to bring the signal out from the noise floor inherent to the imaging system all datasets were processed using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments). First, drift correction was performed on datasets to account for drift with temperature changes at high magnification. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio and minimize the effects of the spurious noise, a 3-frame rolling average was employed followed by a regional maximum detection, which compares a pixel (or group of pixels) to its neighboring region and determines where there is a significant difference.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. The main point that the reviewers would like you to address involves showing that SLO is internalized in caveolar vesicles, not in communication with the extracellular space. Specifically:</p><p>1) The authors should do a direct endocytosis assay with SLO and ask if caveolin 1 is required for this. This should be easy enough given that they are set up for caveolin 1 siRNA experiments.</p><p>2) The authors should show that the caveolin-1-RFP construct that they use is a good reporter for the distribution of endogenous caveolin 1. This is very easy to do.</p><p>3) The authors should show that the very nice co-localisation between caveolin and SLO reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E, F</xref> represents <italic>internalised</italic> SLO, not SLO that is in caveolae still connected to the plasma membrane. This is maybe not so easy to do, but is certainly a very important thing to establish rigorously as it is the key part of the authors' model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00926.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should do a direct endocytosis assay with SLO and ask if caveolin 1 is required for this.

It is important to note that this was a challenging assay to set up because we could not use more extensive methods of amine-based labeling that would have resulted in brighter toxin – such methods are known to interfere with the oligomerization and extensive C-terminal conformational change that is required for SLO pore formation. Importantly, residues at the C-terminus of SLO are inserted in the lipid bilayer during pore formation, and in the process become protected from quenching. This was elegantly demonstrated by Rod Tweten, an expert in pore-formation by cholesterol-dependent toxins, who advised us in these experiments. He kindly provided us with a single cysteine SLO construct that can be labeled with thiol-reactive maleimide-Alexa 488 at the N-terminus, a region of the toxin that does not participate in oligomerization and membrane insertion, remaining exposed extracellularly after pore formation. Alexa 488 was chosen for the labeling because it is stable over a wide pH range, brighter than other fluorophores and very efficiently quenched by anti-Alexa 488 commercial antibodies.</p><p>The new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref> shows that &gt;90% of the labeled toxin was quenched at 4°C, demonstrating that in the absence of endocytosis any SLO bound to cells, including potentially to the lumen of caveolae (given the role of cholesterol as the SLO receptor) remain fully accessible to quenching antibodies. In contrast, at 37°C a much larger fraction of the cell-associated SLO was protected from quenching, as would be expected from a complete internalization process. The clear results of this assay argue strongly against the suggestion that the Cav1-positive caveolae containing SLO that we observed by cryo-immuno EM were still connected to the PM. The remaining quenchable SLO associated with cells that resealed their PM at 37°C is likely to correspond to bound but not fully oligomerized toxin.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not technically possible to perform this quench-based assay in cells silenced for Cav1, because of their strong plasma membrane repair defect after SLO or mechanical wounding (as shown extensively in this manuscript with several cell types). The appropriate quenching of extracellular fluorescence requires an intact plasma membrane (SLO forms pores large enough to allow entry of the quenching antibodies). Thus, as an alternative approach to complement our cryo-immuno EM colocalization of SLO and Cav1, we performed confocal microscopy in cells incubated with Alexa 488-SLO and treated with quenching anti-Alexa 488 antibodies. The quenching antibody activity was evident in these images, and some of the Alexa 488-SLO that survived quenching was observed associated with Cav1-positive intracellular pucta (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors should show that the caveolin-1-RFP construct that they use is a good reporter for the distribution of endogenous caveolin 1. This is very easy to do</italic>.</p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that after expression in HeLa cells mRFP-Cav1 traffics correctly to punctate structures containing endogenous Cav1.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should show that the very nice co-localization between caveolin and SLO reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D, E, F</italic></xref> <italic>represents</italic> internalised <italic>SLO, not SLO that is in caveolae still connected to the plasma membrane. This is maybe not so easy to do, but is certainly a very important thing to establish rigorously as it is the key part of the authors' model</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this was an important thing to do. As explained above in our response to point 1, the new FACS-based endocytosis assay demonstrates that Alexa 488-SLO enters compartments that pinch off from the PM, and the new confocal images show that labeled toxin protected from the quenching antibodies colocalizes intracellularly with Cav1. We also tried to repeat the cryo-immuno EM assays using ruthenium red and other membrane impermeable dyes, but these agents destroyed protein antigenicity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
