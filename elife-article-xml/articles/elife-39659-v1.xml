mechanisms remain elusive. A robust finding is that adding a third option can alter the relative preference for the original alternatives, but studies disagree on whether the third option’s value decreases or increases accuracy. To shed light on this controversy, we used and extended the paradigm of one study reporting a positive effect. However, our four experiments with 147 human participants and a reanalysis of the original data revealed that the positive effect is neither replicable nor reproducible. In contrast, our behavioral and eye-tracking results are best explained by assuming that the third option’s value captures attention and thereby impedes accuracy. We propose a computational model that accounts for the complex interplay of value, attention, and choice. Our theory explains how choice sets and environments influence the neurocognitive processes of multi-alternative decision making.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A man in a restaurant is offered a choice between apple or blueberry pie, and chooses apple. The waiter then returns a few moments later and tells him they also have cherry pie available. “In that case”, replies the man, “I’ll have blueberry”.</p><p>This well-known anecdote illustrates a principle in economics and psychology called the independence principle. This states that preferences between two options should not change when a third option becomes available. A person who prefers apple over blueberry pie should continue to do so regardless of whether cherry pie is also on the menu. But, as in the anecdote, people often violate the independence principle when making decisions. One example is voting. People may vote for a candidate who would not usually be their first choice only because there is also a similar but clearly less preferable candidate available.</p><p>Such behavior provides clues to the mechanisms behind making decisions. Studies show, for example, that when people have to choose between two options, introducing a desirable third option that cannot be selected – a distractor – alters what decision they make. But the studies disagree on whether the distractor improves or impairs performance.</p><p>Gluth et al. now resolve this controversy using tasks in which people had to choose between rectangles on a computer screen for the chance to win different amounts of money. Contrary to a previous study, their four experiments showed that a high-value distractor did not change how likely the volunteers were to select one of the two available options over the other. Instead, the distractor slowed down the entire decision-making process. Moreover, volunteers often selected the high-value distractor despite knowing that they could not have it. One explanation for such behavior is that high-value items capture our attention automatically even when they are irrelevant to our goals. If a person likes chocolate cake, their attention will immediately be drawn to a cake in a shop window, even if they had no plans to buy a cake. Eye-tracking data confirmed that volunteers in the above experiments spent more time looking at high-value items than low-value ones. Those volunteers whose gaze was distracted the most by high-value items also made the worst decisions.</p><p>Based on the new data, Gluth et al. developed and tested a mathematical model. The model describes how we make decisions, and how attention influences this process. It provides insights into the interplay between attention, valuation and choice – particularly when we make decisions under time pressure. Such insights may enable us to improve decision-making environments where people must choose quickly between many options. These include emergency medicine, road traffic situations, and the stock market. To achieve this goal, findings from the current study need to be tested under more naturalistic conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>value-based decision making</kwd><kwd>eye tracking</kwd><kwd>sequential sampling models</kwd><kwd>context effects</kwd><kwd>cognitive modeling</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100014_153616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gluth</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Rieskamp</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Speeded value-based decisions between two options can be affected by a third, high-value distractor that captures attention and slows down the choice process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, studying choices between multiple (i.e., more than two) alternatives has attracted growing interest in many research areas including biology, neuroscience, psychology, and economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowitsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen and Santos, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Landry and Webb, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lea and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spektor et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spektor et al., 2018b</xref>). In such choice settings humans and other animals often violate the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) principle of classical economic decision theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rieskamp et al., 2006</xref>). This principle states that the relative preference for two options must not depend on a third (or any other) option in the choice set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luce, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marschak and Roy, 1954</xref>). Violations of IIA have profound implications for our understanding of the neural and cognitive principles of decision making. For example, if choice options are not independent from each other, we cannot assume that the brain first calculates each option’s value separately before selecting the option with the highest (neural) value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vlaev et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, dynamic models in which option comparison and decision formation processes are intertwined appear more promising as they account for several violations of IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsetsos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The underling mechanisms of multi-alternative choice and the conditions under which decision makers exhibit different forms of violations of IIA are a matter of current debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frederick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spektor et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spektor et al., 2018b</xref>). Two recent studies by Louie and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; henceforth Louie2013) and by Chau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; henceforth Chau2014) investigated whether and how the value of a third option influences the <italic>relative choice accuracy</italic> between two other options (i.e., the probability of selecting the option with the higher value). Both studies reported violations of IIA which, however, contradicted each other: Louie2013 found a negative relationship, so that better third options <italic>decreased</italic> the relative choice accuracy (i.e., the probability of choosing the better of the two original options). They attributed this to <italic>divisive normalization</italic> of (integrated) value representations in the brain: To keep value coding by neural firing rates in a feasible range, each value code could be divided by the sum of all values. Thus, a third option of higher value implies a higher division of firing rates and reduces the neural discriminability between the other two options. In contrast, Chau2014 reported a positive relationship, that is, third options of higher values <italic>increased</italic> relative choice accuracy. They predicted this effect by a <italic>biophysical cortical attractor</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2002</xref>). Briefly, this model assumes pooled inhibition between competing attractors that represent accumulated evidence for the different options. A third option of higher value would increase the level of inhibition in the model and thus lead to more accurate decisions (because inhibition reduces the influence of random noise).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to resolve these opposing results by exploiting the multi-attribute nature of Chau2014’s task and extending it with respect to the paradigm and the analysis of the behavioral data. Notably, the paradigms of Louie2013 and Chau2014 differ in several aspects, the most critical being the type of choice options: In Louie2013, participants decided between different food snacks whereas in Chau2014, participants chose between rectangles that represented gambles with reward magnitude and probability conveyed by the rectangles’ color and orientation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Our initial hypothesis for the discrepancy between the studies’ results was that the explicit presentation of the magnitude and probability attributes in the latter induced IIA-violating ‘context effects’ that emerge through multi-attribute comparison processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pettibone and Wedell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>; we elaborate on this and on further hypotheses in the Materials and methods). To test this hypothesis, we added a set of novel trials in which the high-value option (HV), the low-value option (LV), and the unavailable distractor (D) were positioned in the two-dimensional attribute space in a way to allow a rigorous discrimination between the various multi-attribute context effects, divisive normalization, and the biophysical cortical attractor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Note that henceforth, by ‘divisive normalization’ we refer to the model proposed by Louie2013 which assumes that normalization occurs at the level of integrated values (i.e., after combining attribute values such as magnitude and probabilities into a single value). Other models that instantiate hierarchical or attribute-wise normalization can make qualitatively different predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Landry and Webb, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soltani et al., 2012</xref>). Also, we do not address the role of divisive normalization as a canonical neural computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>) beyond its conceptualization by Louie2013.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design and predictions for novel trials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example trial (upper panel) and general workflow (lower panel) of the Chau2014 paradigm as used in our four experiments (variations in specific experiments are mentioned in the main text).

The predictions vary with respect to the factors Similarity (i.e., whether D is more similar to HV or to LV) or Dominance (i.e., whether D is better or worse than HV/LV). In contrast to the other models, value-based attentional capture does not predict any influence of D’s value on relative choice accuracy (grey bars) but a detrimental effect on absolute choice accuracy (white bars). Predictions of absolute choice accuracy for the remaining models are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39659-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Qualitative predictions of absolute choice accuracy for alternative models.</title><p>Under the assumption that the distractor D is treated as a regular choice option (see Discussion), all models would predict that high-value D are chosen more often than low-value D, so that absolute choice accuracy in the novel trials with D &gt; HV and D &gt; LV are lowered compared to D &lt; HV and D &lt; LV. For the cortical attractor model proposed by Chau2014, however, it is unclear whether this effect reduces, levels out, or reverses the (opposing) effect on relative choice accuracy (as indicated by the dark- and light-gray dotted lines). Similarly, for the dominance relationship hypothesis, it is unclear whether absolute choice accuracy for D &lt; LV will be lower, equal or higher than for D &gt; LV (note that these are only qualitative and not exact quantitative predictions of the models).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39659-fig1-figsupp1-v1"/></fig></fig-group><p>Foreshadowing the results, our data from three behavioral and one eye-tracking experiments with a total of 147 participants are at stark odds with both the findings of Louie2013 and Chau2014. We did not observe a positive impact of D’s value on relative choice accuracy as reported by Chau2014 in the same task, nor a negative impact of D’s value as predicted by Louie2013. In other words, violations of IIA did not occur in the Chau2014 paradigm when participants made decisions under time pressure. Furthermore, a reanalysis of the original Chau2014 data suggested that the reported effect is a statistical artifact (see Materials and methods). In contrast to the absence of any effects on relative choice accuracy, however, we consistently found a negative impact of D’s value on <italic>absolute choice accuracy</italic> (i.e., the overall probability of choosing the best option), which is not a violation of IIA. We argue that our behavioral and eye-tracking results as well as the results of the original study are best accounted for by <italic>value-based attentional capture</italic>, that is, by assuming that options capture attention proportional to their value. Value-based attentional capture is a comparatively novel concept in attention research, which has repeatedly been demonstrated in humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Pelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yasuda et al., 2012</xref>). With respect to the Chau2014 task, it implies that a higher-value D draws more attention and thereby interferes with the choice process. To explain the results from our behavioral and eye-tracking experiments, we integrate the concept of value-based attentional capture into the well-established framework of evidence accumulation in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gluth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gluth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heekeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>). Our model predicts that only absolute but not relative choice accuracy will be affected by the value of the third option (i.e., no violation of IIA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It provides a novel and cognitively plausible mechanism of the complex interplay of value and attention on multi-alternative decision making.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: High-value distractors impair choice accuracy</title><p>Experiment 1 (with n<sub>1</sub> = 31 participants) aimed at comparing different model predictions with respect to the novel set of trials we introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and at establishing the core finding of Chau2014 by replicating it. In the decision-making task as introduced by Chau2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), two available options of different expected value, HV and LV, are presented in two randomly selected quadrants of the screen and participants are asked to choose the option with the higher expected value. In half of the trials, the remaining two quadrants are left empty, in the other half, a third distractor option, D, is shown in one quadrant but indicated as unavailable after 0.1 s. Then, participants have another 1.5 s to make their choice. The central behavioral analysis by Chau2014 was a logistic regression of <italic>relative choice accuracy</italic> (i.e., whether HV or LV was chosen while excluding all trials with other responses such as choosing D or the empty quadrant, or being too slow) on the value difference between the two available options, HV-LV, the sum of their values, HV +LV, the value difference of HV and D, HV-D, the interaction of value differences, (HV-LV)×(HV-D), and whether a distractor was present or not, D present. Most importantly, the authors reported a significantly negative regression coefficient of HV-D indicating that higher values of D increased choice accuracy.</p><p>To test whether our results replicate the findings of Chau2014, we analyzed decisions made in the (non-novel) trials that were identical to those used by Chau2014. Note that the choice sets in Chau2014 were generated by sampling magnitude and probabilities for HV, LV, and D until HV-LV and HV-D shared less than 25% variance. The options’ average expected values in the resulting trials were 5.13 for HV (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.08; min = 0.5; max = 10.5), 3.51 for LV (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.02; min = 0.25; max = 9), and 4.32 for D (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.11; min = 0.25; max = 9). Although the overall choice performance in our data was strikingly similar to the original data (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the negative effect of HV-D on relative choice accuracy could not be replicated. Instead, the average coefficient was positive but not significant (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 1.40, <italic>p</italic> = .171, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.25; left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; complete results of all regression analyses for all experiments are reported in Tables S2-S5).

Notably, higher values of D also slowed down response times (RT) for HV and LV choices (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 6.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We then looked at choice accuracy in the novel trials that we added to differentiate between specific context effects and the models proposed by Louie2013 and Chau2014.

Overall, behavior in the novel trials supported the notion that higher-valued Ds impair multi-alternative decision making.</p><p>In summary, we could not replicate the results on relative choice accuracy and the IIA violations reported by Chau2014 but obtained opposite effects. At first glance, these results seem to support the divisive normalization account by Louie2013 as an appropriate mechanistic explanation. Note, however, that this account specifically predicts changes in relative choice accuracy, for which we found only weak evidence (i.e., no effect of HV-D in the regression, no effect of D’s value on LV-errors). On the other hand, the effects on absolute choice accuracy were stronger. Accordingly, we reasoned that the results are better explained by value-based attentional capture: This account states that attention is modulated by value such that value-laden stimuli attract attention and impair goal-directed actions, even if those stimuli are irrelevant to the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Pelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yasuda et al., 2012</xref>). With respect to Chau2014’s paradigm, value-based attentional capture predicts that high-value Ds draw attention to a greater extent than low-value Ds, which leaves less cognitive resources to focus on the decision between HV and LV. Consequently, decisions slow down, leading to higher RT and to more too-slow errors, and choices of D increase, but the relative probability of choosing HV over LV is unaffected–implying no violation of IIA. In Experiment 2 and 3, we sought to establish value-based attentional capture as the underlying mechanisms by testing different predictions that this explanation (but not divisive normalization) makes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: Distractor effects depend on decision time</title><p>If attentional capture is the driving force behind the performance decrease in the Chau2014 task, then increasing available attentional capacity should improve choice accuracy and reduce the detrimental effects of D. In contrast, divisive normalization effects do not seem to require the imposition of time pressure (see Louie2013). Based on this rationale, we conducted a second behavioral experiment in which we compared two groups: A high-time pressure (HP) Group (n<sub>2,HP</sub> = 25) did exactly the same task as in Experiment 1, but a second, low-time pressure (LP) Group (n<sub>2,LP</sub> = 24) was given more time to decide (6 s instead of 1.5 s). According to the attentional-capture account, we should replicate the results of Experiment one under high time pressure, but under low time pressure the negative influences of D on (absolute) choice accuracy should disappear. For the novel trial sets, we expected a choice accuracy pattern in line with multi-attribute context effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), given that these effects are known to become more prominent with longer deliberation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettibone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with Experiment 1, we could not replicate the HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy reported in Chau2014. Again, our results showed a tendency in the opposite direction (<italic>t</italic>(24) = 0.50, <italic>p</italic> = .622, <italic>d</italic> = 0.10). With respect to absolute choice accuracy, there was a strong and significantly positive effect of HV-D in Group HP of Experiment 2 (<italic>t</italic>(24) = 5.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.01). In contrast and as predicted, this effect was much weaker and did not reach significance in Group LP (<italic>t</italic>(23) = 1.85, <italic>p</italic> = .079, <italic>d</italic> = 0.38; but note that the difference between groups was not significant: <italic>t</italic>(47) = 0.61, <italic>p</italic> = .544, <italic>d</italic> = 0.17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

With respect to the novel trial set, we could not replicate the main effect of Dominance on relative choice accuracy in Group HP that we had found in Experiment 1 (<italic>F</italic>(1,24) = 0.25; <italic>p</italic> = .622, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>= .01; left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In other words, a higher value of D leads to more attention to D, which in turn impairs absolute choice accuracy. This effect has been referred to as <italic>value-based oculomotor capture</italic> and is thought to underlie the (behavioral) effect of value-based attentional capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Failing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Le Pelley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). To directly test whether value-based oculomotor capture drives the negative influence of D on decision making in the Chau2014 paradigm, we obtained eye-movement data as a measure of attention in Experiment three with n<sub>3</sub> = 23 participants using the same paradigm as in Experiments 1 and 2 (Group HP).</p><p>The behavioral results of this experiment were in line with our previous experiments (see Tables S2-S7 for statistical results): The negative HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy reported in Chau2014 could not be replicated, but its effect on absolute choice accuracy was significantly positive; the value of D led to more choices of D and slowed down choices of HV and LV; there was a main effect of Dominance on absolute (but not relative) choice accuracy in the novel trial set. With respect to the eye-movement results, we first tested whether options of higher value received more attention, defined as relative fixation duration (see Materials and methods). Thereto, we calculated within each participant the correlation between expected value and relative fixation duration separately for HV, LV, and D. These correlations were consistently higher than zero (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 4.79, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.00; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.80; D: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 6.25, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, we asked whether the dependency of attention to D on D’s value mediated the negative influence of the latter on choice accuracy. A path analysis confirmed this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>): In the path model, the value of D had a positive effect on attention to D (<italic>t</italic>(22) = 6.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.31), which in turn had a negative effect on choice accuracy (<italic>t</italic>(22) = −6.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = −1.42). In fact, the influence of D’s value on choice accuracy was fully mediated by attention with the direct path being not significant (<italic>t</italic>(22) = −0.76, <italic>p</italic> = .455, <italic>d</italic> = −0.16). Finally, we tested whether participants whose attention was affected by D’s value to a greater extent also showed a stronger negative influence of D’s value on absolute choice accuracy. This was confirmed by a significantly negative correlation across participants between the coefficient quantifying the correlation between D-value and D-fixations and the coefficient quantifying the negative impact of D-value on absolute choice accuracy (<italic>r</italic>(21) = −0.61; <italic>p</italic> = .002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

After correcting this error, the effect of HV-D disappears.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A computational model integrating value, attention, and decision making</title><p>Although value-based attentional capture is a well-established empirical finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Pelley et al., 2016</xref>), to the best of our knowledge it has never been implemented into a decision-making model so far. In the following, we propose and test the <bold>M</bold>utual <bold>I</bold>nhibition with <bold>V</bold>alue-based <bold>A</bold>ttentional <bold>C</bold>apture (<bold>MIVAC</bold>) model that accounts for the complex interplay of value and attention on choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; details are provided in Methods). MIVAC is an extended mutual inhibition (MI) model, a sequential sampling model that assumes a noisy race-to-bound mechanism of separate, leaky, and mutually inhibiting accumulators for each choice option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). Notably, the MI model (without the extensions we propose for MIVAC) is equivalent to a mean-field reduction of the cortical attractor model that was applied by Chau2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>), and it is indeed capable of predicting a positive effect of the value of D on relative choice accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). MIVAC assumes an accumulator for each choice option, so four accumulators in the case of the Chau2014 paradigm (for HV, LV, D, and the empty quadrant). A choice is made as soon as an accumulator reaches an upper boundary that collapses in time (to account for the time limit of the task; for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gluth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gluth et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gluth et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our behavioral and eye-movement results, we propose three additional mechanisms. First and foremost, value-based attentional capture is implemented by assuming that the probabilities of fixating particular options depend on their expected values. In other words, more valuable options receive more attention. Second, the input to the accumulator of the currently fixated option is enhanced, consistent with the influence of attention on choice reported in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shimojo et al., 2003</xref>) and observed in our own data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods). Finally, D can be identified as unavailable, in which case the expected value of D is assumed to be 0, and its accumulation rate and fixation probability are adjusted accordingly. This feature is a specific requirement for the Chau2014 paradigm in which participants are instructed not to choose D (this feature can be omitted for other experimental paradigms).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the computational model MIVAC.</title><p>Depicted is the development of accumulators of the MIVAC model with estimated parameters from a representative example participant in an example trial (upper panel) together with schematic outlines of the model at two different time points (lower panels). MIVAC consists of four accumulators representing HV, LV, D, and the empty quadrant.

Furthermore, we illustrate that simpler models without the added mechanisms of MIVAC (in particular, without value-based attentional capture) cannot explain these findings. Thereto, we conducted rigorous quantitative model comparisons in which MIVAC was compared to three models, each of them missing one of the three novel components (i.e., without VAC = without value-based attentional capture; without AE = without attentional enhancement; without DD = without distractor detection) and a baseline MI model, without any of these components. When fitting the models to trials in which a distractor D was present, we found a clear advantage of MIVAC compared to the simplified versions in terms of both average model fit and best model fit per participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We then performed a generalization test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busemeyer and Wang, 2000</xref>) by using the models’ estimated parameters from the trials with D to predict behavior in the trials without D. Again, MIVAC outperformed the simpler alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This generalization test provides strong support for a genuinely better description of the data by MIVAC and rules out an overfitting problem. Qualitatively, MIVAC predicts choice proportions of all potential actions very accurately, and it does so better than the simplified versions without value-based attentional capture with respect to both trials with D present and D absent (upper and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The most important test for MIVAC was whether the model accurately predicts the observed increase in choices of D as a function of the value of D. As can be seen in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, MIVAC predicts this pattern, and the alternative models either fail to do so or overpredict the frequency of choices of D. MIVAC also reproduces all RT effects reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, that is, negative effects of the difference and the sum of values of HV and LV, and positive effects of the value of D and the presence of D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is particularly remarkable because MIVAC was fitted only to the choice but not to the RT data. Finally, generalizing MIVAC to the novel trials shows that the model exhibits the observed qualitative patterns for both relative and absolute choice accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). All these results hold when replacing the EV-based input to the accumulators by EU-based subjective values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) or when simulating the model with fixations drawn from the empirical fixation duration distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Quantitative and qualitative tests of MIVAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: average model fits for MIVAC and its simplifications for trials with D present (BIC = Bayesian Information Criterion; lower BICs indicate better fits).

The purpose of our study was to shed light on the unresolved debate of whether the value of a third option leads to violations of IIA in the sense that it either decreases or increases relative choice accuracy between the other two options. Strikingly, we obtained strong evidence that neither violation of IIA is likely to occur when making decisions under time pressure, but that value-based attentional capture leads to a general performance decline (i.e., a decline in absolute but not relative choice accuracy representing no violation of IIA) and slows down the decision process. MIVAC, a computational model that we propose to explain the findings, is based on the assumptions that value drives attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>) and attention in turn affects the accumulation of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>). We found that MIVAC reproduced the central behavioral findings for choice accuracy and RT with remarkable precision.</p><p>Specific characteristics of the Chau2014 task design are likely to have facilitated an influence of value-based attentional capture. Having to choose between four potential actions within about 1.5 s puts participants under severe time pressure. This forces them to make use of implicit stimulus-reward associations for identifying attractive options as quickly as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krebs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Serences, 2008</xref>). Using such implicit associations requires options that are distinguishable via low-level perceptual features, such as color or orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2016</xref>), which is exactly what was used in Chau2014. In fact, the Chau2014 paradigm closely resembles the visual search tasks used to study value-based attentional capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>), in which participants also have 1.5 s to identify a target out of several alternatives, while a distractor is characterized by a specific color (that was previously associated with low or high rewards). Yet, there are crucial differences between the two paradigms. Whereas the typical visual search tasks are framed as perceptual tasks, the Chau2014 paradigm is a value-based task. For example, choosing the LV option in the Chau2014 task can still lead to a reward, whereas choosing a non-target in the visual search task is treated as an error. Perceptual and preferential tasks have been shown to elicit different behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutilh and Rieskamp, 2016</xref>) and to rely on partially distinct neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>). Such differences likely explain why we did not only find an influence of the value of D on RT but also on choice accuracy, which has been reported in only a minority of studies on value-based attentional capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itthipuripat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moher et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An important role of attention in value-based decision making has been established in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGinty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shimojo et al., 2003</xref>). With some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itthipuripat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Towal et al., 2013</xref>), research on the interaction of attention and choice has focused on the bias that the former exerts on the latter: Individuals are more likely to choose options that receive comparatively more attention. We replicated this effect in our eye-tracking experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, several other eye-movement patterns in our data differed from previous findings. First, participants were more likely to look at more valuable options (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and this effect was significant even for the first fixation in a trial (Materials and methods). Second, the duration of first fixations was not shorter but longer compared to middle fixations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, the effect of attention on choice was not modulated by value (in the sense that the effect would be more pronounced for options of high compared to low value; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is in line with some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>) but not with other previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>). Correspondingly, the MIVAC model differs from previous attention-based instantiations of sequential sampling models, in particular the attentional Drift Diffusion Model (aDDM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>), in at least two aspects. First, attention is not distributed randomly across choice options but depends on the options’ values (i.e., value-based attentional capture), and second, the accumulation of evidence for attended options is enhanced additively (i.e., independently of value). The latter feature is more in line with the results and model presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al. (2014)</xref>. Interestingly, this study also used abstract choice stimuli as compared to the food snacks used in the studies by Krajbich and colleagues, and participants were put under at least mild time pressure (i.e., choices had to be made within 4 s). We conclude that attention and its influence on decision making can depend to some extent on the experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spektor et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>An alternative explanation for the interplay of attention, value, and choice could be that attention does not influence choice, but that choice intention influences attention. Stated differently, when having the intention to choose an option this option will receive more attention which then leads to longer fixation durations, so that high-value options are looked at longer only because they are more likely to be chosen. This reversed interpretation of the role of eye movements is particularly plausible for later stages of an ongoing decision because the last fixation is often directed at the eventually chosen option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shimojo et al., 2003</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al. (2010)</xref>, for an account of this ‘gaze-cascade effect’ within the aDDM framework). However, our analyses of first fixations and first-fixation durations are incompatible with such an interpretation (see Materials and methods). As stated above, the probability to fixate an option first depended on that option’s value, consistent with value-based attentional capture. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the eventual choice, suggesting that it does not simply reflect the intention to choose the first-fixated option. Furthermore, we found that not only the first fixation and its duration but also the value of the first-fixated option contributed to predicting the eventual choice. In our view, this combined contribution of gaze time and value is best accounted for by assuming that people accumulate evidence for choosing an option based on both the option’s value and the amount of attention spent on it. Therefore, we implemented these mechanisms into MIVAC accordingly.</p><p>At first glance, an effect opposite to what was observed by Chau2014 appears as support for the divisive normalization account by Louie2013. However, our results refute such an interpretation because the relative choice proportions between HV and LV were unaffected by the value of D. As with the different eye-movement results discussed above, the absence of a ‘divisive normalization’ effect in our data might be related to dissimilarities between the task paradigms. First of all, participants in Chau2014 (but not Louie2013) made decisions under time pressure, which promoted value-based attentional capture effects but suppressed violations of IIA. Furthermore, the decoy was highlighted as unavailable in Chau2014, whereas in Louie2013, the decoy was simply defined as the option with the lowest value. Finally, Chau2014 used abstract two-dimensional stimuli, whereas Louie2013 used concrete food snacks, for which it is currently debated whether and how specific attributes are taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rangel, 2013</xref>). Louie2013 did not address the distinction between single- and multi-attribute decisions, but their model should predict a negative influence of D’s value on relative choice accuracy in both cases (because it assumes normalization to occur at the level of the integrated value signal). Although it goes beyond the scope of the current study, it will be critical to test to what extent effects of value-based attentional capture can be generalized to different implementations of multi-alternative decisions in future research.</p><p>Notably, the principle of normalization can be implemented into sequential sampling models, albeit in a different way compared to the mutual inhibition mechanism of MIVAC. According to Teodorescu and colleagues (2016), normalization acts on the input level of the accumulation process such that the input to one accumulator is reduced by the input to all other accumulators (a mechanism also referred to as ‘feed-forward inhibition’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>), whereas mutual inhibition acts on the accumulator level such that the accumulation of evidence for one option is reduced by how much evidence has been accumulated for the competing options. Separating between these different instantiations of inhibition is best achieved by taking their RT predictions into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teodorescu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Generally, we did not obtain any reliable value-dependent violation of IIA in the standard version of the Chau2014 paradigm, but only when we gave participants more time to decide. In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettibone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>), these findings demonstrate the time-dependency of context effects: Being under time pressure or not determines whether effects related to value-based attentional capture or multi-attribute context effects can be expected to occur. One reason for this dependency could be that people adaptively select decision strategies based on the current decision context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gluth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Payne et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rieskamp and Otto, 2006</xref>), and not all strategies are prone to the same contextual or attentional biases. Furthermore, multi-attribute context effects could be the consequence of dynamic choice mechanisms that require comparatively long deliberation times to exert a measurable influence on decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, even though the negative influence of D on absolute choice accuracy is not a violation of IIA, our results cannot be well accounted for by standard economic choice models, such as the multinomial logit model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McFadden, 2001</xref>). We compared three variants of multinomial logit models with MIVAC (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Two of these models either exclude or include D as a regular choice option. Excluding D leads to the prediction that D does not decrease absolute choice accuracy at all. Including D leads to the prediction that D is chosen as a function of its value relative to HV and LV and thus to the prediction that D is chosen in too many trials. A third alternative is to assume that choices are based on a combination of the options’ EVs (as signaled by the rectangles’ colors and orientations) with a subjective value assigned to the colors of the frames that signal whether an option is a target or a distractor. Although this version of a multinomial logit model is able to predict that D is chosen in only a minority of trials, its predictions are clearly worse than those of MIVAC, as the logit model predicts too few choices of HV and too many choices of LV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, standard economic choice models do not take RT into account and thus cannot predict that high-value D options slow down the choice process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) such that the probability of making too-slow errors is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A dynamic component, like the accumulation of evidence as implemented in MIVAC, is required to explain these RT-related effects. Also note that even though the current version of our model does not predict violations of IIA (consistent with our data under high time pressure), it is straightforward to extend MIVAC to allow such violations. In Materials and methods, we describe one possible extension of MIVAC and demonstrate how it allows the model to predict the IIA violation in our data under low time pressure.</p><p>Methodologically, the current study is an eminent example of the importance of replication attempts for the advancement of empirical science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Munafò et al., 2017</xref>), which is particularly timely given the current debate on replicability of research in psychology, neuroscience and other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poldrack et al., 2017</xref>). Our initial hypothesis for explaining the IIA violation reported in Chau2014 was based on the assumption of a robust and reliable effect. However, we could not replicate this effect (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> for additional analyses that challenge both the replicability and the reproducibility of the effect proposed by Chau2014). When developing novel ideas and experiments on the basis of past findings, it is important that these findings are reliable and have been replicated, to avoid leading research fields into scientific cul-de-sacs, in which time and resources are wasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Munafò et al., 2017</xref>). In our case, only the (unsuccessful) attempt to replicate an original study allowed us to identify truly robust behavioral effects, which favor an entirely different mechanistic explanation than originally proposed: Attention can be captured by irrelevant but value-laden stimuli, which slows down the goal-directed choice process and impairs decision making under time pressure. Crucially, neither our study nor replication studies in general are destructive. We gained novel insights about the role of attention in multi-alternative decision making, and we will gain similarly important insights when attempting to replicate other studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-one participants (21 female, age: 20 – 47, <italic>M</italic> = 27.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.59, 29 right-handed) completed Experiment 1. A total of 51 participants signed up for Experiment 2. Due to computer crashes, the data of two participants (one from Group HP and one from Group LP) were incomplete and excluded from the analyses, resulting in a final sample of 49 participants, 25 were in Group HP (13 female, age: 20–46, <italic>M</italic> = 26.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.62, 24 right-handed) and 24 were in Group LP (11 female, age: 19–35, <italic>M</italic> = 23.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.43, 20 right-handed). Participants were assigned randomly to the two groups. Thirty participants signed up for the eye-tracking Experiment 3. One participant was excluded for not passing the training-phase criterion, and additional six participants were excluded due to incompatibility with the eye-tracking device (for further details see section <italic>Eye-tracking procedures and pre-processing</italic>), resulting in a final sample of 23 participants (14 female, age: 18–54, <italic>M</italic> = 25.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.66, 19 right-handed). Forty-seven participants signed up for Experiment 4.

The sample size for Experiment 1 was based on the assumption that testing 1.5 times as many participants as in the original study (Chau2014) would suffice to replicate its main results. In Experiment 4, we tested more participants to ensure a statistical power of &gt;0.90 for replicating the effect of HV-D on relative choice accuracy (note that the effect size in Chau2014 was <italic>d</italic> = −0.495). The sample size for Experiments 2 and 3 were based on observing strong effects (i.e., <italic>d</italic> ≥ 0.8) of value-based attentional capture in Experiment 1 (but it should be noted that no formal power analysis was conducted). All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Department of Psychology at the University of Basel. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Participants repeatedly chose between either two (binary trials) or three (distractor trials) two-outcome lotteries (gambles), each yielding an outcome of magnitude X in Swiss Francs (CHF) with probability <italic>p</italic> or 0 otherwise. The gambles were represented by rectangles, each shown in a random quadrant of the screen, whereby the rectangles’ colors represented outcomes X and the angles represented the probabilities <italic>p</italic>. Outcomes ranged from CHF 2 to CHF 12 in steps of CHF 2 and were represented by colors ranging from either green to blue or blue to green. Probabilities ranged from 1/8 to 7/8 in steps of 1/8 and were represented by orientation angles ranging from 0° to 90° or from 90° to 0° in steps of 15° (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for all colors and orientations). Associations between colors/outcomes and orientations/probabilities were counter-balanced between participants. In binary trials, participants saw the two options for 100 ms before orange frames appeared around each option (pre-decision phase). After the frames appeared, participants had up to 1.5 s to make a choice by pressing 7, 9, 1, or 3 on the numeric keypad for upper left, upper right, lower left, or lower right quadrant, respectively (participants belonging to Group LP of Experiment 2 had 6 s after appearance of the frames to decide). Distractor trials were similar to binary trials: All of the options were presented for 100 ms before frames appeared around them. Contrary to the binary trials, one of the options had a magenta frame (the distractor), signaling that it could not be chosen. Choosing the distractor resulted in a screen telling that the option was not available after which a new trial began. Similarly, choosing an empty quadrant resulted in a screen showing that the quadrant was empty after which a new trial began.</p><p>If a valid choice was registered, the trial continued with a choice-feedback phase for 1 to 3 s, in which the chosen option was highlighted in a dark red color. To ensure that participants paid attention to all available options, participants had to complete a ‘match’ trial before the choice-feedback phase in 15% of all trials. On match trials, one of the options from the decision phase (including the distractor, if distractor trial) was presented in the middle of the screen. Participants had up to 2 s (6 s in Experiment 2, Group LP) to press the key corresponding to the option’s quadrant. If correct, participants saw a screen saying ‘correct’ and an extra CHF 0.10 were added to the participant’s account, otherwise they saw a screen saying ‘wrong’. After every match trial, the trial continued with the choice-feedback phase.</p><p>After the choice-feedback phase, participants received feedback about the outcomes of the gambles for 1 to 3 s. The frames’ colors changed to grey if the option did not yield a reward (i.e., the outcome was CHF 0) or to golden yellow if the option yielded a reward. Participants also received feedback about the distractor’s outcome on distractor trials. After this outcome-feedback phase, a new trial began with an inter-trial interval of 1.5 to 3 s in which a fixation cross was shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p>After giving informed consent and filling out the demographic questionnaire, participants received detailed instructions about the task and were familiarized with the outcome and probability associations by making six judgments for each dimension in a paired comparison. In all experiments, participants completed a training phase and an experimental phase. In the training phase, participants encountered up to 210 trials, half of which were distractor trials. These trials were randomly generated with the boundary condition that 2/3 of the trials were not dominant (i.e., HV did not have a higher probability <italic>and</italic> a higher outcome than LV) and the rest were dominant. The training phase continued until participants encountered at least 10 dominant binary trials, and chose HV in at least 70% of the last 10 encountered dominant binary trials. The training phase ended when this criterion was reached and the experimental phase began. If the participants finished all 210 training trials without passing the criterion, the experiment ended. As reported above, participants who did not pass the criterion were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>The experimental phase consisted of either 412 (Experiment 1 to 3) or 300 (Experiment 4) trials. The 300 trials used in Experiment four were shared across all experiments and are those used by Chau2014. In Experiment 4, all trials were presented in exactly the same orders as in Chau2014’s experiment, whereas in the other experiments, the distractor trials were presented in the order provided to us by the authors of Chau2014 with the randomized binary trials interleaved. In addition to these trials, Experiments 1 to 3 included 56 novel distractor trials and, correspondingly, the 56 binary trials belonging to these novel trials (details are provided in the next two sections). Throughout the experiment, participants had the opportunity to make four breaks. After completing the experiment, participants received their show-up fee (CHF 5 for 15 min), the average reward of the chosen option (distractor and empty quadrant choices counted as no reward), and the accumulated match bonuses. If participants reached the experimental phase, the experiments took approximately 75 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Initial hypothesis for the effects reported in Chau2014</title><p>Before conducting our experiments, we assumed that the positive relationship between the value of D and relative choice accuracy as reported by Chau2014 was a robust effect. To explain the apparent contradiction with the findings of Louie2013, we reasoned that the explicit presentation of two attributes (i.e., magnitude X and probability <italic>p</italic> of reward) in the Chau2014 task led people to compare the options on those attributes directly (i.e., a multi-attribute decision between attributes X and <italic>p</italic> instead of a decision between expected values, EV). Importantly, certain attribute-wise comparison processes are known to produce IIA violations, so-called ‘context effects of preferential choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowitsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pettibone and Wedell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>). More specifically, our initial hypothesis was that individuals can recognize that D is either better or worse than LV and/or HV with respect to each attribute (e.g., D might dominate LV with respect to probability). Critically, since LV is per definition worse than HV, it is more likely that D dominates LV than that it dominates HV on some attribute. However, this is only true as long as D has not very low attribute values (leading to a low EV overall). Thus, the <italic>dominance relationship</italic> between D and LV/HV may help participants to identify the option with the highest EV. The positive relationship between D and relative choice accuracy would then be an epiphenomenon of this dominance relationship mechanism.</p><p>To give an example, let us assume that HV, LV, and D are specified as follows:</p><p>HV: <italic>p</italic> = 5/8; X = CHF 8 → EV = CHF 5</p><p>LV: <italic>p</italic> = 3/8; X = CHF 4 → EV = CHF 1.5</p><p>D: <italic>p</italic> = 6/8; X = CHF 6 → EV = CHF 4.5</p><p>In this case, D is superior to HV and LV with respect to probability. With respect to magnitude, however, D is superior to LV but inferior to HV. Hence, by counting the number of times D is superior to LV and HV on the attributes (i.e., two for LV vs. one for HV), a decision maker could correctly identify the option with the highest EV. Critically, this information is not helpful anymore when we replace D by a distractor D<italic>*</italic> of lower EV:</p><p>D<italic>*: p </italic>= 6/8; X = CHF 2 → EV = CHF 1.5</p><p>In this new case, the distractor is inferior to both HV and LV with respect to magnitude and (still) superior to both with respect to probability (i.e., the count is one for LV vs. one for HV). Thus, the option with the highest EV cannot be identified anymore based on the dominance relationship alone. This demonstrates that the high-value D might better support choosing between HV and LV than the low-value D*. Notably, the idea that the relative ranking of options influences decision making has also been suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stewart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsetsos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Besides this dominance relationship hypothesis, the paradigm of Chau2014 might also involve other context effects that influence behavior. We considered the <italic>attraction effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 1982</xref>) and the <italic>phantom-decoy effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pettibone and Wedell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pratkanis and Farquhar, 1992</xref>). According to the attraction effect, the preference between two options (in our case between HV and LV) can be changed by adding a third option (in our case D) that is similar but clearly inferior to only one of the two options (in our case, if D is similar to HV and worse than it, HV should be preferred; if D is similar to LV and worse than it, LV should be preferred). The phantom-decoy effect predicts that if an option is similar but worse than D (and D is unavailable, as in the Chau2014 task), it is more likely to be chosen. According to a combination of attraction and phantom-decoy effects, independent of whether D is worse or better than the similar option, the option being more similar to D should be more likely be chosen. In contrast to the context effects, the Chau2014 model, and the divisive normalization account, value-based attentional capture does not predict any influence of D on relative choice accuracy, but a negative effect on absolute choice accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As described in the following section, we sought to distinguish between all these different context effects and the model proposed by Chau2014 by implementing a novel set of trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>The novel trial set and predictions of different models and context effects</title><p>In the novel set of trials used to dissociate predictions from various models and context effects, the HV and LV options were arranged such that i.) HV was superior to LV with respect to one attribute (magnitude or probability) but ii.) inferior with respect to the other attribute, and iii.) D could be placed such that it either fully dominated HV/LV or it was fully dominated by HV/LV (for an example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in the main text). In the Chau2014 task, there are 14 possible combinations of HV and LV that fulfil these criteria. For each of these 14 combinations, D was placed directly ‘above’ or ‘below’ HV or LV resulting in four trials per combination and 56 novel trials in total (we also added 56 binary trials without D, so that Experiment 1 to 3 had 112 trials more than the original study).</p><p>The (qualitative) predictions of the models and context effects with respect to these novel trials are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Chau2014’s biophysical cortical attractor model predicts a positive effect of the value of D on relative choice accuracy. Thus, the performance should be higher in trials with dominant distractors (i.e., D &gt; HV and D &gt; LV). The divisive normalization model by Louie2013 predicts higher accuracy for low-value Ds, or in other words, it predicts the opposite of Chau2014’s model. Our initial dominance relationship hypothesis predicts higher choice accuracy if HV dominates D (i.e., D &lt; HV), or if LV is dominated by D (i.e., D &gt; LV), because in these cases HV is better than D on more attributes than LV. The combination of attraction and phantom-decoy effects predicts more accurate choices when D is dominated by HV (i.e., D &lt; HV) or dominates HV (i.e., D &gt; HV), or in other words, when D is more similar to HV than to LV. Importantly, all these predictions refer to relative choice accuracy (for which we do not find any robust effects in the Chau2014 task with short deliberation time; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). On the contrary, value-based attentional capture predicts no effect on relative choice accuracy, but a reduction of absolute choice accuracy when D has a high value (i.e., D &gt; HV and D &gt; LV).</p><p>Note that the different predictions can also be formulated in terms of main effects and interactions of an ANOVA with the factors Dominance (D dominates or is dominated by HV/LV) and Similarity (D is more similar to HV or to LV). Within this ANOVA, the cortical attractor model predicts a main effect of Dominance. The divisive normalization model also predicts this main effect but in the opposite direction. The dominance relationship hypothesis predicts an interaction effect of Dominance and Similarity. The combined attraction/phantom-decoy effect predicts a main effect of Similarity. Value-based attentional capture predicts a main effect of Dominance in the same direction as the divisive normalization model but on absolute (not relative) choice accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>In each trial, there was always a higher-valued option HV and a lower-valued option LV. We used two different dependent measures, <italic>relative</italic> and <italic>absolute</italic> choice accuracy. Relative choice accuracy refers to the proportion of HV choices among choices of HV and LV only, whereas absolute choice accuracy refers to the proportion of HV choices among all choices (including choices of D, choices of the empty quadrant, and missed responses due to the time limit). Importantly, an influence of the value of D on relative choice accuracy implies a violation of IIA, but an influence on absolute choice accuracy does not necessarily imply this. For each of the two dependent variables, we estimated intra-individual logistic regressions and tested the regression coefficients between subjects against 0 using a two-sided one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test with an α level of .05. We used the set of predictor variables reported in Chau2014, which consisted of the difference in EV of the two available options, HV-LV, the sum of their EVs, HV+LV, the EV difference between HV and D, HV-D, the interaction between HV-LV and HV-D, (HV-LV)×(HV-D), and whether it was a binary or distractor trial, D present. In the binary trials, the predictors HV-D and (HV-LV)×(HV-D) were kept constant (i.e., replaced by the mean values in the distractor trials in the regression analysis). The predictor variables HV-LV, HV+LV, and HV-D were standardized. Importantly, standardization was conducted before generating the interaction term (HV-LV)×(HV-D) in order to avoid <italic>nonessential</italic> multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahwah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap and Kemery, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marquardt, 1980</xref>). The interaction term itself and the binary predictor D present were not standardized (note that this would not have changed any statistical inferences but only the absolute values of coefficients). In addition, we analyzed the influence of the (standardized) value of D on the tendency to choose D (logistic regression) and on the RT of HV and LV choices (linear regression). The RT analysis included additional predictor variables with a significant influence on RT (i.e., HV-LV, HV+LV, D present). Note that only the 300 trials that were also used in the Chau2014 paradigm (but not our 112 novel trials) were included in these regression analyses. The novel trial sets used to dissociate different model predictions were analyzed by a 2 (Dominance) x 2 (Similarity) ANOVA (for details see above).</p><p>Because participants received feedback after each decision, we tested whether improvements over time affected the results of relative or absolute choice accuracy by re-analyzing the regressions with an additional predictor variable that coded for the (standardized) trial number. Although we found a small learning effect on absolute choice accuracy (<italic>t</italic>(122) = 2.12, <italic>p</italic> = .036, <italic>d</italic> = 0.19), this did not affect any other effects qualitatively. When adding the trial number predictor to the analysis of the influence of D’s value on the tendency to choose D, we found a strong learning effect (<italic>t</italic>(122) = −10.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = −0.92), suggesting that participants improved in avoiding to choose D over the course of the experiment (but the effect of D’s value remained significant). Hence, future instantiations of our model could incorporate a dynamic component to accommodate this learning effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Eye-tracking procedures and pre-processing</title><p>Experiment 3 was conducted while participants’ gaze positions were recorded using an SMI RED500 eye-tracking device. The experimental procedure was adapted to make it suitable for an eye-tracking experiment. Participants completed the experiment on a 47.38 × 29.61 cm screen (22&quot; screen diagonal) with a resolution of 1680 × 1050 pixels. During the inter-trial interval, participants were instructed to look at the fixation cross and the random duration of the inter-trial interval was removed. Instead, there was a real-time circular area of interest (AOI) with a diameter of 200 pixels around the fixation cross. Participants’ gazes had to (continuously) stay within this AOI for 1 s for the trial to begin. This was done to make sure that participants were indeed looking at the fixation cross and to check the calibration at every trial. If this criterion was not reached within 12 s, the eye tracker was re-calibrated. This procedure was explained to the participants by the experimenter. In case these re-calibrations happened too frequently (e.g., three times in a row within the same trial, or at least three times in ten trials), the sampling frequency was reduced from the initial 500 Hz to 250 Hz. If the issues continued until the lowest possible frequency of 60 Hz was reached, the experiment was aborted and participants received their show-up fee and decision-based bonuses accumulated until then. The first calibration took place just before the training phase and the eye tracker was re-calibrated after each of the four breaks. This experiment took approximately 90 min to complete.</p><p>The raw gaze positions were re-coded into events (fixations, saccades, and blinks) in SMI’s BeGaze2 software package using the high-speed detection algorithm and default values. AOIs were defined around the positions where the frames of the options were, and all fixations inside the frame were counted towards the option within that quadrant. Fixations at empty quadrants as well as all fixations outside of the pre-defined AOIs were counted as <italic>empty gazes</italic>. Fixations within a trial were collapsed and summed to form the dependent variables <italic>relative fixation duration</italic> and <italic>number of fixations</italic>. We report results based on the relative fixation duration (i.e., the sum of the duration of all fixations on a specific quadrant divided by the sum of the duration of all fixations on any quadrant). Note that this measure is highly correlated with the number of fixations, which yielded similar results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Eye-tracking analysis I: Tests of value-based attentional and oculomotor capture</title><p>To test the hypothesis that the negative influence of D on absolute choice accuracy is driven by value-based attentional/oculomotor capture, we conducted the following three analyses: i.) We tested for the dependency of relative fixation duration of HV, LV, and D on their respective EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thereto, the correlations between the options’ relative fixation durations and EVs were calculated for each participant, and the individual Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients were subjected to one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test against 0 on the group level (after checking for normality assumptions via the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1). ii.) We conducted a path analysis (within each participant) in which the influence of the value of D on absolute choice accuracy was hypothesized to be mediated by the relative fixation duration on D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). iii.) We run an (across-participant) correlation between the behavioral regression coefficients representing the influence of the value of D on absolute choice accuracy and the regression coefficients representing the influence of the value of D on relative fixation duration on D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Eye-tracking analysis II: Direct vs. value-dependent influences of attention on choice</title><p>To inform our computational model, we tested whether there is evidence for a direct effect of attention on choice (i.e., an option that receives relatively more attention is more likely to be chosen–independent of the option’s value) as reported by Cavanagh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>), or whether the effect of attention is modulated by value (i.e., only options with high value that receive more attention are more likely to be chosen) as proposed by Krajbich and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>). Thereto, we conducted a logistic regression analysis with absolute choice accuracy as dependent variable and the following six predictor variables: the expected value of HV, the expected value of LV, the relative fixation duration of HV, the relative fixation duration of LV, the interaction of the value of HV and the relative fixation duration of HV, and the interaction of the value of LV and the relative fixation duration of LV. The first three predictors were standardized, and the interaction variables were generated based on standardized variables to avoid <italic>nonessential</italic> multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marquardt, 1980</xref>). A <italic>direct</italic> attention model predicts a positive effect of the relative fixation duration of HV and a negative effect of the relative fixation duration of LV. A <italic>value-dependent</italic> attention model predicts positive and negative effects of the interaction terms for HV and LV, respectively. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Besides the positive effect of HV-LV, there were significantly positive and negative effects of the relative fixation duration of HV (<italic>t</italic>(22) = 9.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.96) and LV (<italic>t</italic>(22) = −8.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = −1.71), respectively.

Thus, we found unequivocal evidence for a direct effect of attention on choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>) but not for an interaction of attention and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>).

We found that the probability to fixate HV, LV, D first was positively linked to the respective option’s value (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 6.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.26; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 3.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.80; D: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 3.57, <italic>p</italic> = .002, <italic>d</italic> = 0.74). Importantly, the effects for HV and D remained significant when controlling for the eventual choice (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 4.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.92; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 0.62, <italic>p </italic>= .539, <italic>d</italic> = 0.13; D: <italic>t</italic>(21) = 2.70, <italic>p</italic> = .013, <italic>d</italic> = 0.58), indicating that the effect was not solely driven by an intention to choose a particular option. Instead, the effect can be explained by assuming that value-based oculomotor capture biases early competition on the saccade map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we tested whether the first fixation and its duration was predictive of choice (when controlling for HV-LV and D), which would be consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>) and suggest a biasing influence of attention on evidence accumulation. Indeed, the probability to choose HV, LV or D was predicted by whether the first fixation was made to the respective option (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 6.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.27; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 4.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.04; D: <italic>t</italic>(20) = 7.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.53). Similarly, the duration of the first fixation predicted the choice of all three options (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 7.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.51; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 6.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.29; D: <italic>t</italic>(20) = 2.92, <italic>p</italic> = .008, <italic>d</italic> = 0.64). Yet, the value difference HV-LV remained being predictive of the choice of HV and LV (HV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 8.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.69; LV: <italic>t</italic>(22) = −11.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = −2.40), and the value of D remained being predictive of the choice of D (<italic>t</italic>(20) = 4.88, <italic>p</italic> = .003, <italic>d</italic> = 1.07). Thus, the first fixation and its duration contributed to the probability of choosing an option but was not fully predictive of it. In our view, these results are best explained by assuming that gaze time biases the evidence accumulation towards the fixated option as implemented in the MIVAC model. Note that the analysis of first fixations included trials from the training phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Testing the assumption of integration of magnitude and probability information</title><p>Many analyses in Chau2014 and our study, such as the regression analysis of relative choice accuracy, relied on the assumption that participants were able to integrate magnitude and probability information to calculate the expected value (EV) of each option and to choose the option with the largest EV.

We used the same minimization algorithm and model-comparison approach as for MIVAC (see section <italic>Modeling procedures for MIVAC III: parameter estimation and nested model comparison</italic>). Models were compared on the basis of the choice data from the 300 trials that were part of the initial choice set of Chau2014 and from the 123 participants of our study who conducted the Chau2014 paradigm under time pressure. Because the EU model provided the most parsimonious account of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we reanalyzed the central behavioral tests of our study (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–5C</xref>) and replaced the options’ EVs by the EU-based subjective values estimates. Furthermore, we reran the MIVAC model to test whether using EU-based subjective values as input to the model’s accumulators would lead to qualitatively different predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; details are provided in section <italic>Modeling procedures for MIVAC IV: MIVAC with subjective values as inputs</italic>). Note that the analyses and predictions for the novel trial sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>) do not depend on whether EV or EU is assumed as the underlying choice model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Modeling procedures for MIVAC I: The baseline mutual inhibition model</title><p>The computational model we propose, MIVAC, is an extended version of the mutual inhibition (MI) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). The MI model belongs to the sub-class of accumulator models within the framework of sequential sampling models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ratcliff and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>). Sequential sampling models assume that evidence for choice options is accumulated over time until a decision threshold is reached after which a choice is made. Accumulator models use separate evidence accumulators for each choice option. MIs further assume mutual (or lateral) inhibition of these accumulators, that is, the more evidence for one choice option has been accumulated, the stronger this accumulator inhibits the competing accumulators (in contrast to feedforward inhibition models that assume inhibition between the inputs to accumulators). In addition, accumulators are leaky, that is, they tend to decay toward the starting point (i.e., 0). One reason why we chose this framework (and not, for instance, the aDDM) is that the MI is equivalent to a mean-field reduction of the biophysical attractor model that was applied by Chau2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, without a value-based attentional capture mechanism, the MI model is able to predict a positive effect of the value of the distractor (D) on choice accuracy similar to the model proposed by Chau2014 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, we begin with a <italic>baseline MI</italic> and then add additional assumptions (about the interplay of value, attention, and choice) that are necessary to explain the observed behavioral findings.</p><p>Formally, the MI assumes four accumulators representing the four choice options high-value option (HV), low-value option (LV), D, and the empty quadrant.

Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gluth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gluth et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gluth et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>), we assume that the decision threshold decreases (linearly) with time (note that we found the empirical response-time [RT] distribution in this task to lack the typical right-skewed shape, which is possibly due to the strict time limit and would be in line with a decreasing decision threshold; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hawkins et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to the leaky competing accumulator model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>) but in line with suggestions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>, we allowed <bold>A</bold> to take on negative values.</p><p>Potentially, the baseline MI could have six free parameters: the leakage parameter δ, the inhibition parameter ϕ, the standard deviation σ of the noise vector, the height of the decision threshold at the start and end of the decision period θ<italic><sub>0</sub></italic> and θ<italic><sub>tmax</sub></italic>, and a non-decision time parameter τ<sub>non-dec</sub>. However, because we sought to extend this model by three additional components and because predictions of the MI cannot be derived analytically but must be simulated, we drastically constrained the model by fixing all but one of the aforementioned parameters (it should be noted at this point that we had to make several simplifying assumptions to simulate the model in a reasonable amount of time). Leakage and inhibition were set to δ = 0.96 and ϕ = −0.036, respectively, the start and end points of the decision threshold were set to θ<italic><sub>0</sub></italic> = 1’000 and θ<italic><sub>tmax</sub></italic> = 200, respectively, and the non-decision time was set to τ<sub>non-dec</sub> = 200 ms (so that <italic>tmax</italic> – τ<sub>non-dec</sub> = 1’400 ms). Thus, only σ remained as a free parameter (this parameter controls the stochasticity of the decision process and allows to account for performance differences between participants). Importantly, fixed parameter values were chosen carefully so that the model made various sensible predictions (i.e., the relative choice ratio between HV and LV, the average RT, and the proportion of misses due to no threshold crossings until <italic>tmax</italic> were ensured to lie all within the range of the empirical observations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Modeling procedures for MIVAC II: Extending the baseline MI to MIVAC</title><p>For the MIVAC model, we propose three additional mechanisms that are required to account for the behavioral data and that describe the interplay of value, attention, and decision making as observed in the eye-tracking experiment. First, we implemented value-based attentional capture by modelling fixations to the choice options and by assuming that the probability of fixating a particular option depends on the option’s value (relative to the other options). Similar to a recent study on reinforcement learning and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leong et al., 2017</xref>), we used a logistic function to describe the relationship of value and fixation probability:<disp-formula id="equ8"><label>(8)</label><mml:math id="m8"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p> where <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic> is the probability of fixating option <italic>i</italic>, γ is a free parameter, and <italic>nEV<sub>i</sub></italic> is the expected value of option <italic>i</italic> normalized with respect to all currently presented options (normalization was used to avoid that value-based attentional capture effects depend too much on the sum of all values). We assumed that every 200 ms, a new fixation is made, and with probability <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic> it is made to option <italic>i</italic> (with the possibility to re-fixate the same option). This time window roughly corresponds to the average fixation duration of 230 ms in our data. We chose this implementation to maintain a high speed of model simulations and to make more conservative model predictions, as a more data-driven implementation of using empirical fixation patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>) may improve model fit but limit generalizability. In the section <italic>Modeling procedures for MIVAC V: MIVAC with fixation durations drawn from empirical distributions</italic>, we show that using empirical fixation durations (instead of a fixed duration of 200 ms) does not change the models’ predictions and the model comparison results qualitatively.</p><p>The second additional mechanism is the enhanced input to the currently attended accumulator. This assumption is based on previous work showing that options which receive more attention are more likely to be chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shimojo et al., 2003</xref>), which we replicated in our eye-tracking experiment. Note, however, that we found evidence for a direct effect of attention on choice rather than for a modulatory effect that depends on the value of the attended option (see section <italic>Eye-tracking analysis II: direct vs. value-dependent influences of attention on choice</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, we assumed that the input <italic>I<sub>a,t</sub></italic> of the currently attended option <italic>a</italic> is enhanced additively rather than multiplicatively:<disp-formula id="equ9"><label>(9)</label><mml:math id="m9"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">β</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula>where EV(<italic>a</italic>) is the expected value of <italic>a</italic>, and β is a free parameter representing the attention-based enhancement of accumulation. Together with value-based attentional capture, this means that MIVAC assumes that options of higher value receive more attention, and that the evidence for an attended option is accumulated faster (but MIVAC does not assume that there is an interaction of value and attention, in the sense that the increase of accumulation due to attention is stronger for higher- compared to lower-valued options).</p><p>Finally, we assumed that participants can detect that the distractor is unavailable but occasionally fail to do so. This assumption was necessary because participants usually followed the instructions of the Chau2014 paradigm and avoided choosing D in most of the trials but still picked it more often than the empty quadrant: In trials with D present, there were 6.7% choices of D and only 0.1% choices of the empty quadrant (<italic>t</italic>(122) = 12.17; p&lt;0.001); in trials without D, there were only 3.1% choices of both empty quadrants together. Therefore, we assumed that after every 100 ms, D can be identified as being unavailable with probability π, which is a free parameter (restricting the identification of D to every 100 ms was again necessary to maintain fast simulations of the model; note that 100 ms also corresponds to the point in time at which participants were told which of the options D is). If D is identified, the input to its accumulator is set to 0 (plus noise) just as for the empty quadrant. The probability to fixate D is also affected by its identification (i.e., <italic>nEV<sub>D</sub></italic> is set to 0 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, MIVAC has four free parameters, the standard deviation σ of accumulation from the baseline MI model, the value-based attentional capture parameter γ, the attention-based enhancement β of accumulation, and the probability π to identify D as being unavailable (see Table S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for estimated parameter values). In addition to the baseline MI and MIVAC, we tested three simplified versions of MIVAC that each lacked one of the additional features (i.e., either γ, β, π, or all of them were set to 0).</p><p>It should be noted that the proposed model does not predict violations of IIA, such as the attraction or the phantom-decoy effect (for which we found evidence in the experiment with long deliberation time). We refrained from implementing this because our central goal was to model the Chau2014 paradigm with short deliberation time, for which we did not find any IIA violations, and because we wanted to maintain a high speed of model simulations. Importantly, however, MIVAC can be extended to allow predicting IIA violations straightforwardly, for instance by implementing a stage of attribute-wise comparisons that modify the input <bold>I</bold><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trueblood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>). In the section <italic>Modeling procedures for MIVAC VI: Extending MIVAC to allow for violations of IIA</italic>, we provide one example of how such an extension could work, and show that it allows accounting for the IIA violation observed in the experiment with long deliberation time. Thus, in principle MIVAC is compatible with the rich literature on violations of IIA in value-based and perceptual decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowitsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rieskamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spektor et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spektor et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trueblood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsetsos et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Modeling procedures for MIVAC III: Parameter estimation and nested model comparison</title><p>As mentioned, parameter estimation required time-consuming simulations of the models. Similar to our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gluth et al., 2013b</xref>), we chose a step-size Δ<italic>t</italic> of 10 ms for fast simulations, and approximated the likelihood by simulating every trial 100 times. Trial-wise predictions were truncated to a minimum probability of .01 and a maximum probability of .99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gluth et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nassar and Frank, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rieskamp, 2008</xref>). Note that the estimation of parameters was based on predicting choices but not RT, because our main goal was to explain the choice data, and because predicting RT would have required more simulations per trial and estimating the non-decision time (and possibly also the decision threshold), which would have prolonged computations to an infeasible amount of time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, however, the model reproduces all of the observed RT effects (i.e., higher value differences and sums of HV and LV decrease RT, higher values of D and the presence of D increase RT). Parameter estimation was realized by combining an initial grid search algorithm to obtain reasonable starting values, which were then passed on to a constrained simplex minimization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelder and Mead, 1965</xref>) as implemented MATLAB’s <italic>fminsearchcon</italic> to obtain the final estimates. For the grid search, 31 steps per parameter were used, equally spaced within the following bounds: σ between 5 and 50, γ between −1.12 and 3.08, β between −2.1 and 18.9, π between 0 and 1 (the same values were used as constrains during the simplex minimization). The simplex algorithm was run 16 times in total, 3 times with the parameter set obtained from the best grid search model fit, 9 to 13 times with a parameter set randomly selected from the best 1% of grid search model fits (20% in case of the baseline MI), and 0 to 4 times with the best parameter set obtained from the simplex search of nested models (e.g., all other models are nested in MIVAC, so the algorithm for MIVAC was started 4 times with the four other models’ best parameters as starting values). The final estimates of parameters were taken from the simplex search with the best model fit. Only trials of the Chau2014 set with D present were used to estimate parameters. This allowed testing a generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busemeyer and Wang, 2000</xref>) of the models to the trials without D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and to the novel trials that we added in Experiment 1 to 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>The central goal of computational modeling was to compare MIVAC against simpler versions that lacked either one or all of the novel mechanisms. Thus, model comparison comprised the baseline MI, MIVAC, and three versions of MIVAC without either γ, β, or π (which were set to 0 for the respective model). Since all other models are nested within MIVAC, they could be compared using a likelihood ratio test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewandowsky and Farrell, 2011</xref>). However, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz, 1978</xref>) to compare the models, because it is more conservative when comparing the most complex model against simpler ones, and because the BIC allows to estimate participant-wise model evidence: For each participant, we classified model evidence as ‘weak’, ‘positive’, ‘strong’, or ‘very strong’, when the BIC difference <italic>x</italic> between the best and the second-best model was <italic>x</italic> &lt; 2, 2 &lt; <italic>x</italic> &lt; 6, 6 &lt; <italic>x</italic> &lt; 10, or <italic>x</italic> &gt; 10, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raftery, 1995</xref>). Following our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gluth et al., 2017</xref>), we tested the generalizability of the models by comparing their deviances for the trials without D and for the novel trials, which were not used for parameter estimation. We also compared the models on a qualitative level with respect to i.) how well they predict choices in D present trials, ii.) how well their predictions can be generalized to trials without D, and iii.) how well they account for the dependency of choosing D on the value of D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Note, that all quantitative and qualitative model comparisons are based on out-of-sample predictions by running 10’000 new simulations per trial, participant, and model using the estimated parameters. A simple parameter recovery analysis (in which we generated synthetic data using MIVAC’s estimated parameters of each participant and the 150 trials from the Chau2014 paradigm and re-estimated parameters for these synthetic data) confirmed that the model is identifiable with the set of trials used in Chau2014 and our study (for all parameters, correlations between data-generating and re-estimated parameter values were significantly positive at p&lt;0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Modeling procedures for MIVAC IV: MIVAC with subjective values as inputs</title><p>Similar to our behavioral analyses, MIVAC assumes that people are able to integrate magnitude and probability information to estimate an option’s EV (since the EV serves as the basic input signal to each accumulator; see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref>). Because our analyses of the choice data suggested that an EU-based choice model provided a more accurate account of the data than an EV-based model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we reran MIVAC and replaced the EVs as inputs to the options’ accumulators by the EU-based subjective value estimates.

First, we sought to avoid overfitting MIVAC by equipping it with actual fixation patterns: If the main behavioral effects had been solely due to differences in fixation patterns across options, then using those patterns would have allowed MIVAC to make accurate predictions, even though the model’s proposed features (e.g., value-based attentional capture) would not have been critical.

Because the three models and MIVAC used different sets of data (i.e., the ‘Exclude D’ model used only trials in which either HV or LV were chosen, the other two logit models also included trials in which D was chosen, MIVAC further included trials in which the empty quadrant was chosen or no decision was made), the models could not be compared via quantitative criteria. Instead, we compared their ability to predict the observed choice proportions of HV, LV, and D in trials with D present, and of HV and LV in trials with D absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Reanalysis of the Chau2014 dataset</title><p>The authors of Chau2014 provided us with the behavioral data of their fMRI experiment that included 21 participants. We reanalyzed the data to check for evidence of effects related to value-based attentional capture: We tested for an effect of HV-D on absolute choice accuracy, for an effect of D’s value on the propensity to choose D, and for an effect of D’s value on RT. The results of all of these analyses were in line with predictions of a value-based attentional capture account (see Results).</p><p>When trying to reproduce the results of the original study, we also found that the HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy (i.e., the central behavioral result of Chau2014) was only significantly negative when the interaction term (HV-LV)×(HV-D) in the same regression analysis was generated on the basis of uncentered HV-LV and HV-D variables. In multiple regression analyses, centering (i.e., subtracting each entry by the mean) or standardizing (i.e., subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) predictors before generating their interaction term is critical to avoid <italic>nonessential</italic> multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahwah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap and Kemery, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marquardt, 1980</xref>). This is particularly important when one or both of the predictors do not have a meaningful 0 (i.e., are always positive or always negative). This is the case for HV-LV which is always positive by definition. Accordingly, the uncentered interaction term (HV-LV)×(HV-D) is correlated substantially with HV-LV (<italic>r</italic> = .287) and correlates particularly strong with HV-D (<italic>r</italic> = .862) (upper row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the mean-centered interaction term is only weakly correlated with HV-LV (<italic>r</italic> = .004) and HV-D (<italic>r</italic> = −.064) (lower row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To test how susceptible the original results of HV-D are to the generation and implementation of the interaction term, we conducted several control analyses. First of all, we repeated the regression analysis on relative choice accuracy, but used the correct interaction term (i.e., the term generated on the basis of standardized HV-LV and HV-D predictors). Strikingly (but in line with our own results), the effect of HV-D in the Chau2014 data was positive and not significant (<italic>t</italic>(20) = 1.56, <italic>p</italic> = .134; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, which shows the effect sizes of HV-D in all experiments when the correct vs. incorrect interaction term is used in the analysis). Second, we took the interaction term out of the regression analysis, which yielded similar results (<italic>t</italic>(20) = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> = .510). Third, we reanalyzed the original data in the following way: We separated the dataset by each level of HV-LV, which yielded 12 bins, and conducted the regression analysis on relative choice accuracy for each bin separately. This procedure allowed us to take out the interaction term (together with the predictor variable HV-LV itself), and to test for a ‘cleaner’ effect of HV-D in each bin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> a significantly negative effect of HV-D on relative choice accuracy is seen in only 1 of the 12 bins, but there is also a significantly positive effect in another bin. Conducting this analysis with our own data yielded very similar results. Fourth, we simulated data from hypothetical decision makers who decide solely on the basis of HV-LV (via a logistic/soft-max choice function [see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ16">Equation 14</xref> above] for which we set the choice-sensitivity parameter to 0.5 to roughly match the choice accuracy observed in the data). For these simulated participants, we know that their behavior is not influenced by HV-D. We conducted 1’000 simulations of 21 participants (the sample size of Chau2014) and performed four logistic regression analyses, either with or without the interaction term, and either with standardized or uncentered HV-LV and HV-D predictors. We found a spurious negative influence of HV-D on relative choice accuracy when including an interaction term with uncentered predictors (<italic>t</italic>(999) = −3.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; upper row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This influence was absent when including the interaction term with standardized predictors (<italic>t</italic>(999) = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> = .717) or when excluding the interaction term with either standardized or uncentered predictors (both: <italic>t</italic>(999) = −0.89, <italic>p</italic> = .375; lower row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, the negative effect of HV-D on relative choice accuracy is a statistical artifact of the incorrect implementation of the interaction term (HV-LV)×(HV-D) into the logistic regression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Test of detectability and Bayesian analysis</title><p>The reanalysis of Chau2014 raises strong doubts on the reproducibility of the original results. Yet, theoretically there might still be a true negative HV-D effect that in principle could have been found in our own four experiments (while being absent in the original study due to its low statistical power). To test for the ‘replicability’ of this effect without reverting to the (equivocal) effect size of the original study, we conducted a recently proposed <italic>test of detectability</italic> that is independent of the reported effect size of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simonsohn, 2015</xref>). This approach uses only the sample size (and the statistical design) of the original study to specify the (hypothetical) effect size that would have given the study only 33% statistical power, which can be regarded as undoubtedly insufficient. If the effect size of the study that attempts to reproduce the effect of the original study is significantly below this <italic>d</italic><sub>33%</sub> threshold, then one can conclude that the studied effect is not large enough to have been detectable with the original sample size. The results of this test for the HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy show that the 95% confidence intervals of the effect sizes for each of our Experiments 1, 2 HP, 3, and four as well for all these experiments combined and for the original study itself (when using the correct implementation of the interaction term) were indeed closer to 0 than the <italic>d</italic><sub>33%</sub> threshold for the sample size of 21 participants used in Chau2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). But even when using the incorrect implementation of the interaction term (that biases the results toward more negative HV-D effects), the confidence intervals of the effect size for our four experiments combined are closer to 0 than the <italic>d</italic><sub>33%</sub> threshold.</p><p>Finally, we conducted a Bayesian analysis of the HV-D effects on relative (and absolute) choice accuracy to be able to quantify the evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagenmakers, 2007</xref>). Specifically, we applied the <italic>ttestBF</italic> function of the <italic>R</italic> package <italic>BayesFactor</italic> (with default settings) to obtain Bayes Factors (BF) in favor of the null (or alternative) hypothesis that the HV-D regression coefficients of relative and absolute choice accuracy are equal to (or deviate from) 0. We included the 123 participants from Experiments 1, 2 HP, 3, and 4 who performed the task under high time pressure. For the HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy we obtained a BF<sub>01</sub> in favor of the null hypothesis of 20.05 when testing against the alternative hypothesis of a negative HV-D effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>, upper panel). This means the data are about twenty times more likely to have occurred under the null hypothesis, which is also seen as <italic>strong</italic> evidence for the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>). When testing against the alternative hypothesis of a positive HV-D effect (which would be the opposite of what Chau2014 had reported and in line with the divisive normalization account of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louie et al., 2013</xref>), we obtained a BF<sub>01</sub> in favor of the null hypothesis of 3.14, which can be considered as <italic>positive</italic> evidence for the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>). For the HV-D effect on absolute choice accuracy we obtained a BF<sub>10</sub> in favor of the alternative hypothesis of 4.07 × 10<sup>13</sup>, which is seen as <italic>decisive</italic> evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>, lower panel).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Bolton Chau and Matthew Rushworth for providing us with the data from the original study and for helpful and constructive discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gluth and colleagues present data from four experiments with an initial motivation to replicate preference reversals in economic choice in response to distractor values as described by Chau et al. (2014). None of these experiments provided evidence for these sorts of reversals. Careful statistical analysis and comprehensive quantitative modeling of the behavioral data combined with eye tracking provided an explanation for the discrepancies and suggest that distractor effects are best described in terms of value-based attentional capture. They further noted that some of the key effects reported by Chau et al. may have arisen as a statistical artifact. This paper is a very nice example of progress and self-correction in the scientific literature. Overall the experiments and analysis appear quite thorough.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The below points reflect a prioritized amalgamation of individual reviewer comments.</p><p>1) The experimental design and analyses rest heavily on the assumption that individual participants appropriately compute expected values from probability and value information, yet unless I missed it, there was no direct test of this notion. It would be useful to verify this, and also to show that the basic predictions and results hold for subjective value estimates as well as expected values.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the fixation duration as a measure of attention, but their data and that of some of the most relevant cited literature (Cavanagh et al., 2014) would be just as consistent with it providing a measure of intention to select a particular option. Under such an interpretation, its less clear whether the eye-tracking data provide selective evidence for the proposed attentional mechanisms.</p><p>3) The authors state several times that divisive normalization predicts a change in the relative choice accuracy/frequency between HV and LV options. The predictions for relative and absolute choice accuracy in this task are still a bit fuzzy for several models, but especially divisive normalization. Wouldn't divisive normalization also predict a decrease in absolute choice accuracy as the value of D increases? It would help to show both the relative and absolute accuracy predictions for all alternative models at least once (perhaps in Figure 1D).</p><p>I think that the authors should refer to the divisive normalization model in Louie et al. (2013) as &quot;divisive normalization of integrated values&quot; or some similar, but better term. The idea would be to make sure readers understand that normalization at the level of integrated attribute values is one specific form of normalization. Just as with the extension of the MIVAC, assuming attribute-level or hierarchical (divisive) normalization leads to key differences in model predictions.</p><p>Further, normalization is inherent in mutual inhibition models and I think that fact should be stated more clearly in the paper. It is important to separate the qualitative and quantitative distinctions between the specific form of divisive normalization proposed in Louie et al. (2013), from other forms of normalization (e.g. the weighted subtraction in competing accumulator models). However, it is also important not to equate divisive normalization, in general, with a specific instantiation from one paper.</p><p>4) Methods questions:</p><p>– In the logistic regression examining additive and interactive effects of value and fixation duration, the authors specify interactions between fixation and HV or LV separately, but include only a main effect for the value difference, HV-LV. I don't know if this coding of the two main effects as a contrast vector makes any difference in fitting or interpreting the model, but I think it would be worthwhile and easy to check.</p><p>– How were correlations between expected value and relative fixation duration aggregated across participants to generate the t and p-values listed in the Results? I did not find any details on this analysis in the Materials and methods section and so assume it was a standard parametric t-test. Is this parametric test appropriate for the distribution of <italic>r</italic>-values across participants?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39659.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The below points reflect a prioritized amalgamation of individual reviewer comments.</p><p>1) The experimental design and analyses rest heavily on the assumption that individual participants appropriately compute expected values from probability and value information, yet unless I missed it, there was no direct test of this notion.

Therefore, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and examined whether (and how) people integrate probability and outcome magnitude when making decisions by comparing the following five choice models against each other (with regard to how accurately they predict choices of HV vs. choices of LV; details can be found in the Materials and methods subsection “Testing the assumption of integration of magnitude and probability information”):</p><p>1) “Only Magnitude” (OM): A model that assumes choices are solely based on magnitude differences.</p><p>2) “Only Probability” (OP): A model that assumes choices are solely based on probability differences.</p><p>3) “Expected Value” (EV): A model that assumes choices are based on EV differences.</p><p>4) “Expected Utility” (EU): An extension of the EV model that assumes a power utility function (u[x] = x<sup>α</sup>; EU[x] = u[x] * p), with one additional free parameter allowing to represent risk preferences.</p><p>5) “Prospect Theory” (PT): An extension of the EU model that assumes that probabilities are weighted according to Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992), with one additional free parameter.</p><p>Comparing these models against each other (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, left and middle panels) showed that the EV model provided a better account of the data than the single-attribute models (OM and OP). Only 15 of 123 participants were best explained by one of the two single-attribute models. Therefore, we can conclude that (the great majority of) participants integrated magnitude and probability when making decisions.</p><p>However, the comparison also revealed that the EU model explains choices better than the EV model (whereas the increased complexity of the PT compared to the EU model does not seem to be justified by the data). The distribution of the power utility parameter α of the EU model (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, right panel) shows that for most participants the parameter lies in the range between 0 and 2, with some more extreme values to the right.</p><p>For reasons of simplicity and comparability to Chau et al. (2014), we kept using the EV-based value estimates for initial presentation of statistical and modeling analyses in the revised manuscript. However, given that the EU model provided a better account of the data than the EV model, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and checked whether the central results would hold when replacing EVs by EU-based subjective value estimates. As can be seen in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the central behavioral results of our study are largely unaffected by this change of analysis: The HV-D effect on relative choice accuracy remains insignificant; the HV-D effect on absolute choice accuracy remains significantly positive, as do the effect of D’s value on choices of D and all RT-related effects. Only the effect of D’s value on too-slow errors does not reach significance anymore (<italic>p</italic> =.077).</p><p>We also tested whether the predictions of MIVAC would change. Thereto, we reran the model using the EU-based subjective value estimates instead of the EVs as inputs to the model (for details, see the Materials and methods subsection “Modeling procedures for MIVAC IV: MIVAC with subjective values as inputs”). As can be seen in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, the predictions of the model do not change qualitatively.</p><p>Also note that the (qualitative) predictions of the different models with respect to the novel trials remain the same. That is, as long as we can be certain that people did not solely rely on only one of the attributes (which the above-mentioned model comparison clearly suggests), the predictions regarding the multi-attribute space (see Figure 1C and 1D) as well as the analyses (Figure 5D) remain unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors interpret the fixation duration as a measure of attention, but their data and that of some of the most relevant cited literature (Cavanagh et al., 2014) would be just as consistent with it providing a measure of intention to select a particular option. Under such an interpretation, its less clear whether the eye-tracking data provide selective evidence for the proposed attentional mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it can be difficult to disentangle whether people look at choice options to pay attention to them (to accumulate evidence about the option’s value) or whether they look at it because they intend to choose it. In the revised manuscript, we discuss these two possibilities (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Compared to previous studies (Cavanagh et al., 2014; Shimojo et al., 2003), however, we believe that our results provide convincing evidence for interpreting fixation duration as a measure of attention and – more importantly – as driving a biased evidence accumulation process (i.e., the mechanism implemented in MIVAC).</p><p>First of all, we reported in the original manuscript that the first fixation was influenced by value. This is consistent with value-based attentional capture but difficult to explain by assuming that participants developed an intention to choose an option already before the first fixation. In the revised manuscript, we show that the influence of value on first fixations remains significant (for options HV and D) even after controlling for the eventual choice (Materials and methods, subsection “Eye-tracking analysis III: analysis of initial fixations”, first paragraph).</p><p>Second, we added an analysis testing whether the first fixation and its duration predicted choice over and above the value difference between HV and LV and the value of D. These analyses yielded significant effects of the first fixation and its duration as well as of value information (Materials and methods, subsection “Eye-tracking analysis III: analysis of initial fixations”, last paragraph). Stated differently, whether and how long an option is fixated first predicts choice, but it is not a perfect and not the only predictor. Rather, fixating an option (gradually) increases the probability of choosing an option, consistent with its implementation as a bias-in-evidence-accumulation mechanism in MIVAC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state several times that divisive normalization predicts a change in the relative choice accuracy/frequency between HV and LV options.

It is correct that the divisive normalization model also predicts a decrease in absolute choice accuracy as the value of D increases (as long as the model treats the distractor as a potential choice option). In fact, all models make this prediction (although for the biophysical cortical attractor network model proposed by Chau et al., 2014, it remains unclear whether the positive effect on relative choice accuracy is reduced, evened out, or reversed by the negative effect on absolute choice accuracy).</p><p>Therefore, it is not the presence of an effect on absolute choice accuracy but the absence of an effect on relative choice accuracy in our data that speaks against the divisive normalization model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think that the authors should refer to the divisive normalization model in Louie et al. (2013) as &quot;divisive normalization of integrated values&quot; or some similar, but better term. The idea would be to make sure readers understand that normalization at the level of integrated attribute values is one specific form of normalization. Just as with the extension of the MIVAC, assuming attribute-level or hierarchical (divisive) normalization leads to key differences in model predictions.</p><p>Further, normalization is inherent in mutual inhibition models and I think that fact should be stated more clearly in the paper. It is important to separate the qualitative and quantitative distinctions between the specific form of divisive normalization proposed in Louie et al. (2013), from other forms of normalization (e.g. the weighted subtraction in competing accumulator models). However, it is also important not to equate divisive normalization, in general, with a specific instantiation from one paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Introduction of the revised manuscript, we make clear that we refer exclusively to the model by Louie et al. (2013) and give references to work showing that hierarchical normalization models can make qualitatively different predictions (Hunt et al., 2014; Landry and Webb, 2017; Soltani et al., 2012). We also mention that divisive normalization is a much more general (“canonical”) neural computation, and that the model proposed by Louie et al. (2013) is only one specific instantiation of this principle (Introduction, third paragraph).</p><p>Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between normalization and mutual inhibition (Discussion, sixth paragraph). In our view, it would not be fully correct to equate normalization with the principle of mutual inhibition/weighted subtraction of competing accumulators. Note that Teodorescu et al. (2016) compared normalization-based and LCA-based models against each other and showed that these models can make different predictions in particular with respect to response times. According to Teodorescu et al., normalization occurs at the level of input while mutual inhibition occurs at the accumulator level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Methods questions:</p><p>– In the logistic regression examining additive and interactive effects of value and fixation duration, the authors specify interactions between fixation and HV or LV separately, but include only a main effect for the value difference, HV-LV. I don't know if this coding of the two main effects as a contrast vector makes any difference in fitting or interpreting the model, but I think it would be worthwhile and easy to check.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the regression analysis using two separate predictor variables for HV and LV instead of a single HV-LV predictor variable. Expectedly, HV is positively linked to accuracy and LV is negatively linked to accuracy in this analysis. More importantly, the effects of the remaining predictor variables are unaffected by this change of analysis. In the revised manuscript, we replaced the old analysis by this new analysis in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 but mention that using a single HV-LV predictor variable yields equivalent results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How were correlations between expected value and relative fixation duration aggregated across participants to generate the t and p-values listed in the Results? I did not find any details on this analysis in the Materials and methods section and so assume it was a standard parametric t-test. Is this parametric test appropriate for the distribution of r-values across participants?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to test whether the correlation coefficients between value and fixations differed from 0. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests, we can confirm that the distributions of these coefficients do not differ significantly from a normal distribution (at <italic>p</italic> &lt;.1). However, because correlation coefficients are bounded between -1 and 1, we adapted our analysis for the revised manuscript: Correlation coefficients were first transformed via Fisher z-transformation, and these transformed values were then subjected to Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests (again not significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt;.1) and one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests against 0. Thus, the values shown in Figure 4A are still correlation coefficients (i.e., <italic>r</italic>-values) but the statistical analysis are based on Fisher z-transformed values. These changes are mentioned in the Materials and methods subsection “Eye-tracking analysis I: tests of value-based attentional and oculomotor capture”, and the Results are updated accordingly (subsection “Experiment 3: value affects attention and attention affects decisions”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
