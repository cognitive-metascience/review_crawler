The combination of site specific mutagenesis of the three ZDHHC6 palmitoylation sites, experimental determination of kinetic parameters and data-driven mathematical modelling allowed us to obtain detailed information on the eight differentially palmitoylated ZDHHC6 species.

This requires tight control of protein function in time and in space, which largely occurs through reversible post-translational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and S-palmitoylation. The latter consist in the addition on an acyl chain, generally C16 in mammals, to cysteine residues, thereby altering the hydrophobicity of the protein and tuning its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaskovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamberlain and Shipston, 2015</xref>). More precisely, palmitoylation may control the interaction of a protein with membranes or specific membrane domains, affect its conformation, trafficking, stability and/or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaskovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberlain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conibear and Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukata et al., 2016</xref>). In the cytosol, the acyl chain is attached to the protein via a thioester bond through the action of DHHC palmitoyltransferases, a family of multispanning transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaskovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberlain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conibear and Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukata et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The list of proteins undergoing palmitoylation is ever increasing ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swisspalm.epfl.ch/">http://swisspalm.epfl.ch/</ext-link>) and the modification is found to be important in numerous key cellular processes including neuronal development and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>), cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pei et al., 2016</xref>), systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beard et al., 2016</xref>), innate immunity to viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukai et al., 2016</xref>), cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), EGF-signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Runkle et al., 2016</xref>), protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skotte et al., 2017</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thuma et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While novel roles and targets of palmitoylation are constantly reported, little is known about the regulation and dynamics of this post-translational modification. Here we focused on one of the 23 human palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC6, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and controls a panel of key ER substrates such as the ER chaperone calnexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lakkaraju et al., 2012</xref>), the ER E3 ligase gp78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairbank et al., 2012</xref>), the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fredericks et al., 2014</xref>) as well as cell surface proteins such as the transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senyilmaz et al., 2015</xref>). For each of these proteins, palmitoylation controls stability, localization, trafficking and/or function.</p><p>As most DHHC enzymes, ZDHHC6 is a tetra-spanning membrane protein. It has a short N-terminal extension and a long C-terminal tail composed of an approximately 100-residue domain of unknown structure followed by a variant SH3_2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the C-terminus, it contains a KKNR motif which when transferred to the ZDHHC3 enzyme leads to its relocalization from the Golgi to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorleku et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that it contributes to the ER localization of ZDHHC6.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27826.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZDHHC6 can undergo palmitoylation on three cysteines of its SH3 domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of ZDHHC6 enzyme.

Interestingly, palmitoylation occurs via an upstream palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC16, revealing for the first time the existence of palmitoylation cascades. Depalmitoylation is mediated by the Acyl Protein Thioesterase APT2. Palmitoylation can occur on three different sites, leading to potentially eight different ZDHHC6 species defined by acyl site occupancy. These species can interconvert through the actions of ZDHHC16 and APT2. Using mathematical modelling combined with various kinetic measurements on WT and mutant ZDHHC6, we probed the complexity of this system and its importance for ZDHHC6 activity. Altogether, this study shows that palmitoylation affects the quaternary assembly of ZDHHC6, its localization, stability and function. Moreover we show that the presence of 3 sites is necessary for the robust control of ZDHHC6 abundance upon changes in ZDHHC16 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Palmitoylation of the ZDHHC6 SH3_2 domain</title><p><italic>ZDHHC6</italic> KO cells were generated using the CRISPR-cas9 system in the near haploid cell line HAP1. Using the Acyl-RAC method to isolate palmitoylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werno and Chamberlain, 2015</xref>), we verified that the ER chaperone calnexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lakkaraju et al., 2012</xref>), the E3 ligase gp78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairbank et al., 2012</xref>), the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fredericks et al., 2014</xref>) and the transferrin receptor (Trf-R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senyilmaz et al., 2015</xref>) are indeed ZDHHC6 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly calnexin and Trf-R were no longer captured by Acyl-RAC in the HAP1 ZDHHC6 KO cells, confirming that they are exclusively modified by ZDHHC6, while capture of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor and gp78 was reduced but not abolished indicating that they can also be modified by other palmitoyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairbank et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fredericks et al., 2014</xref>). As negative controls, we tested flotillin1, a known target of ZDHHC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2012</xref>) and the anthrax toxin receptor one modified by a yet to be determined DHHC enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrami et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>When probing samples for ZDHHC6, we found that the palmitoyltransferase itself was captured by Acyl-RAC in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and also in different mouse tissues (shown for mouse lung tissue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Palmitoylation of ZDHHC6 was reported in two large-scale proteomics analysis to occur on Cys-328, Cys-329 and Cys-343 in the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). These cysteines are conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We generated single (ACC, CAC, CCA), double (AAC, CAA, ACA) and triple (AAA) cysteine-to-alanine mutants and monitored <sup>3</sup>H-palmitate incorporation during 2 hr. Palmitoylation of ZDHHC6 WT, but not the AAA mutant, was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DE</xref>). All single cysteine mutants, especially C328A, and all double mutants showed a decrease in the <sup>3</sup>H-palmitate signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DE</xref>).

We performed: (1) metabolic <sup>35</sup>SCys/Met pulse-chase experiments, with pulses of either 20 min or 2 hr, to monitor the turnover of newly synthesized proteins, for WT and the different single, double and triple cysteine mutants; (2) <sup>3</sup>H palmitate incorporation into WT and cysteine mutants; (3) palmitate loss, monitored by <sup>3</sup>H palmitate pulse-chase experiments, for WT and mutants. Some of these experiments were in addition performed upon over expression of ZDHHC16 or siRNA of <italic>LYPLA2</italic>.</p><p>We used the <sup>35</sup>S-decay data for WT, ACC, CAA and AAA, the WT <sup>3</sup>H-palmitate incorporation data and the <sup>3</sup>H-palmitate release data for WT, ACC and CAA, to calibrate the model. The pulse labelling times were included in the model. During parameter estimation, these calibration datasets were fitted simultaneously, as multi-objective optimization problem with as many fitness functions as experiments. As often for optimization problems, the output of the algorithm is a local Pareto set of solutions. These are equally optimal with respect to the fitness functions in the sense that for each set of parameters, none of the objective functions can be improved in value without deteriorating the quality of the fitness for some of the other objective values. We therefore employed a stochastic optimization method to generate a population of models consistent with the calibration experiments. From a population of 10’000 models, we selected 152 based on the scores of the objective functions that fitted the experimental data most accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The pool of selected models was subsequently used for the simulations and analyses. Importantly, all predictions were obtained by simulating each model independently. Outputs of all models were averaged and standard deviations with respect to the mean were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The remaining experiments, not used to calibrate the model, were used to validate it. Importantly, as can be seem in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, the model reliably predicted the results of these experiments, indicating that it accurately captures the ZDHHC6 palmitoylation system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Dynamics and consequences of site-specific ZDHHC6 palmitoylation</title><p>The model was first used to estimate the half-lives of the different species.

Thus, the model indicates that palmitoylation strongly affects ZDHHC6 turnover in a site dependent manner. It is interesting to note that during the course of this study during which we performed iterative cycles of experiments and modelling, which led to the current model, the mathematical approach provided the initial hint that palmitoylation of Cys-328 had a stabilizing effect. This was not visible from our initial 20 min metabolic pulse experiments of WT and cysteine mutants. The model predicted that increasing the pulse labelling time to 2 hr should make the difference between WT ZDHHC6 and mutants turnover apparent, which turned out to be correct. We subsequently tested the effect of ZDHHC16 overexpression and <italic>LYPLA2</italic> silencing, providing further confirmation. Thus the evolving model led to experiments that were key for proper parameter estimation and for deeper understanding of the system.</p><p>We next analysed the dynamics of the system. We first determined the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation fluxes. The major fluxes through the system are from C<sup>000</sup> to C<sup>100</sup>, backwards, corresponding to palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of Cys-328 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Depalmitoylation of Cys-329 is also predicted as quite prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>In order to quantify how much time each protein molecule spends in the different states and the transition dynamics between the different states, we derived a stochastic formulation of the model, as we have previously done for calnexin palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dallavilla et al., 2016</xref>) (Suppl. Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). While the deterministic simulation could provide an estimate of these properties, the stochastic simulations in addition provides a quantification of the distribution of the times of interest and allow asking questions about ‘individual’ molecules. We performed 10’000 simulations to track single proteins in the system. ZDHHC6 molecules were predicted to spend most of their time, by far, in the C<sup>000</sup> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with the flux analysis, each ZDHHC6 molecule was on average 2.7 times in the C<sup>100</sup> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and remained in that state for about 0.7 hr (median value). Seven out of 10 molecules also explored the C<sup>010</sup> state for almost 2 hr and more briefly the C<sup>011</sup> state.</p><p>Estimation of the steady state distribution of species indicated that in experimental setting –HeLa cells in culture– the ZDHHC6 cellular population is about 70% non-palmitoylated and 20% palmitoylated, the most abundant species being C<sup>010</sup> and C<sup>011</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We tested this prediction experimentally by performing a PEGylation assay. This is a mass-tag labelling method that consists in replacing the palmitate moiety with PEG following disruption of the thioester bond with hydroxylamine, resulting in a mass change detectable by electrophoresis and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Percher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yokoi et al., 2016</xref>). As a control we analysed calnexin, which has two palmitoylation sites and migrated as expected as three bands, corresponding to the non-, single and dual palmitoylated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). For ZDHHC6, only the non-palmitoylated form was detected, consistent with the prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FG</xref>). Indeed given the dynamic range and sensitivity of Western blots, a band with a ≈7-fold lower intensity than the C<sup>000</sup> ZDHHC6 band would not be detectable.</p><p>The model altogether predicts that in tissue culture HeLa cells, each ZDHHC6 molecule undergoes multiple rounds of palmitoylation-depalmitoylation during its life cycle mostly on Cys-328. Only a subset of molecules acquires palmitate on the two other sites. At any given time, approximately 60% of the molecules are not acylated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Multi-site palmitoylation protects ZDHHC6 from degradation</title><p>Analysis of the activity of the ZDHHC6 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) showed that the most active variants are those with a cysteine at position 328, suggesting that palmitoylation at this position influences palmitoyltransferase activity. However palmitoylation at this site also targets ZDHHC6 to ERAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These effects raise the question of how cells can increase cellular ZDHHC6 activity.</p><p>We first predicted the consequences of ZDHHC6 hyperpalmitoylation. Calculations were performed under conditions of ZDHHC16 overexpression and of <italic>Lypla2</italic> silencing, simulated by an absence of APT2.

Interestingly, the overall ZDHHC6 content dropped by only 15% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). <italic>Lypla2</italic> silencing in contrast led to a 72% drop in ZDHHC6 content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). Since removing all depalmitoylating activity is likely to freeze the system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), we also tested a decrease of APT2% to 10% of normal levels. The ZDHHC6 content rose by 20% and, as upon ZDHHC16 overexpression, C<sup>011</sup> became the most abundant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We made similar calculations for the CAA mutant. Under control conditions, the total CAA content is predicted to be 84% of WT, and mostly in the non-palmitoylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The CAA cellular content is however predicted to drop to 32% of WT control levels upon ZDHHC16 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). All together, these predictions suggest that the presence of 3 palmitoylation sites, as opposed to just Cys-328, renders the ZDHHC6 protein content robust to changes in ZDHHC16 activity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27826.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Importance of multiple palmitoylation sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single molecule tracking with stochastic simulations upon ZDHHC16 overexpression.

The enzymes involved must therefore also be regulated. The DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases was identified almost 15 years ago, yet little is known about the mechanisms that control their activity. DHHC9 was found to require a co-factor, GCP16, for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swarthout et al., 2005</xref>), as also found in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lobo et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, ZDHHC6 was proposed to require Selenoprotein K to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fredericks and Hoffmann, 2015</xref>). Here we show that ZDHHC6 activity is controlled by palmitoylation in its C-terminal SH3_2-domain. In the non-palmitoylated form, ZDHHC6 has no detectable activity. Only upon modification by an upstream palmitoyltransferase, which we identified as ZDHHC16, does it acquire significant transferase activity. ZDHHC16, also known as Ablphilin 2 (Aph2), is, as ZDHHC6, expressed in many human tissues in particular in the heart, pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Its name Ablphilin stems from its ability to interact with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl at the ER surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>). ZDHHC16/Aph2 is essential for embryonic and postnatal survival, eye and heart development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), for the proliferation of neural stem cells, where it is involved in the activation of the FGF/erk pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2016</xref>) and was reported to play a role in DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that some of these effects may involve ZDHHC6.</p><p>We found that ZDHHC6 palmitoylation is highly dynamic, involving Acyl Protein Thioesterase 2. APT2, which was recently found to be involved in cell polarity-mediated tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>) but is otherwise poorly characterized, also undergoes palmitoylation by a yet to be determined palmitoyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vartak et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>ZDHHC6 palmitoylation can occur on three sites in its SH3_2 domain. We combined mathematical modelling, with mutagenesis of palmitoylation sites, expression levels of the involved enzymes (ZDHHC16 and APT2) and experimental determination of palmitoylation, depalmitoylation, metabolic pulse-chase experiments and activity determination, to understand the importance of the different ZDHHC6 palmitoylation species and the dynamics of their interconversion. In addition to the predictive power of mathematical modelling of biological systems, this study provides single molecule understanding, as opposed to population analysis.</p><p>We found that in tissue culture cells, under standard conditions, ZDHHC6 molecules spend more than 70% of their lifetime in the non-palmitoylated inactive C<sup>000</sup> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Each ZDHHC6 molecule does however undergo several rounds of palmitoylation-depalmitoylation on Cys-328 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), leading to C<sup>100</sup>, the most active state of the enzyme. According to large-scale quantitative proteomics analyses, DHHC enzymes are typically present in less than 1000 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagaraj et al., 2011</xref>). Together this information indicates that, at any given time, tissue culture cells contain a very low number of active ZDHHC6 enzymes. In these cells, target proteins do however undergo palmitoylation, and some of these targets are highly abundant proteins such as calnexin (half a million to a million copies per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagaraj et al., 2011</xref>]). Thus when active, ZDHHC6 appears be a very potent enzyme and our observations indicate that cells tend to avoid having too much of it. Indeed the C<sup>100</sup> species of ZDHHC6 is either rapidly depalmitoylated or targeted to degradation via the ERAD pathway.</p><p>PEGylation analysis of mouse tissues indicate that in vivo ZDHHC6 palmitoylation is far more pronounced than in tissue cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This situation was mimicked experimentally by overexpression of ZDHHC16 and revealed the importance of having 3 palmitoylation sites, rather than just Cys-328. We indeed found that in the presence of 3 sites, the cellular ZDHHC6 activity could be enhanced by ZDHHC16 overexpression. Increase ZDHHC16 activity led to a shift of species distribution: C<sup>011</sup>, the most stable form, became the most abundant species. Altogether this study indicates that ZDHHC6 can adopt in 3 types of states: 1) stable and inactive (C<sup>000</sup>); 2) highly active, short-lived and rapidly turned over (C<sup>100</sup>); 3) moderately active, long-lived and very slowly turned over (C<sup>010</sup> and C<sup>011</sup>). Such a regulatory system allows the cell to tightly control the activity of ZDHHC6. Why excessive ZDHHC6 activity is detrimental to a cell or an organism will require further studies.</p><p>By combining experimentation and the predictive power of data-driven mathematical modelling, we were able to obtain unprecedented insight into the dynamics of palmitoylation and the role and properties of single acylated species. We found that depending on the site of modification both the activity and turnover of ZDHHC6 were strongly affected, indicating that palmitoylation has a more subtle and precise effect than merely increasing hydrophobicity, consistent with recent findings on single acylated species of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pedro et al., 2017</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification and dynamics of the DHHC16-DHHC6 palmitoylation cascade&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Philippe IH Bastiaens (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anthony Magee (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very interesting multidisciplinary study deals with a palmitoylation/depalmitopyaltion reaction network around the palmitoyl transferase DHHC6 that controls its DHHC16 induced PAT activity. The work presents a very thorough study that led to the identification of the first palmitoylation cascade. This is a very exciting discovery, which poses many interesting questions at multiple levels, from basic biochemistry and cell biology, to the systems level properties of palmitoylation cascades.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are the different palmitoylated species of DHHC6 differentially localized and thereby palmitoylate different substrates? The authors should analyse the localisation of the different palmitoylation deficient mutants of DHHC6 and possibly investigate their activity on one of the other substrates of DHHC6 to clarify that the system is not a substrate selection network.</p><p>2) It is unclear why the authors had to use stochastic simulation for part of their analyses given the copy numbers of the analyzed molecules. Can the authors use their model to propose experiments that would make the model parameters more identifiable?</p><p>3) The authors do not measure enzyme activity directly; rather it is assessed indirectly by in vivo labelling of substrates. This should be discussed and addressed. Ideally an in vitro direct assay of DHHC6 activity should be used.</p><p>4) The methodology leave open the possibility that these proteins do not genuinely interact physically but could simply be associated with the same detergent-insoluble structures. More stringent solubilisation methods (e.g. stronger detergents or the extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin) should be used to confirm the result.</p><p>5) The pulse is relatively long as compared to the chase in some pulse-chase experiments (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> a 2h pulse is used). This can incorrectly estimate the rate of turnover. This point should be addressed and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27826.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Are the different palmitoylated species of DHHC6 differentially localized and thereby palmitoylate different substrates?

This distribution might represent the situation of ectopic expression, but this is also situation in which the activity of the mutants was measured. Thus the differences in target protein modification do not correlate with differences in localization.</p><p>Additional substrates: We have now monitored the palmitoylation of another endogenous DHHC6 target, the transferrin receptor, by the various DHHC6 cysteine mutants. We found that the differential activity of the mutants is the same as for calnexin (new figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), further supporting that the palmitoylated species have different activities rather than different targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>2) It is unclear why the authors had to use stochastic simulation for part of their analyses given the copy numbers of the analyzed molecules.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We used stochastic simulations because we wanted to quantify how much time each protein molecule spends in the different states and the transition dynamics between the different states. While the deterministic simulation could provide an estimate of these properties, the stochastic simulations in addition provides a quantification of the distribution of the times of interest and allowed us to ask questions about “individual” molecules. Moreover, the concentration of the species is in the range of nanomolar concentration, which is the range where the intrinsic noise is manifested and it is also observed in our simulations. This is now mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Can the authors use their model to propose experiments that would make the model parameters more identifiable?</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>A number of experiments predicted by the earlier versions of the model are actually already part of the paper. For example, initial protein decay experiments were performed with a classical (for our lab) 20 min metabolic 35S Cys/Met pulse. Under these conditions we could not detect any effect of palmitoylation on apparent half-lives when comparing WT DHHC6 and the various cysteine mutants. The model then predicted that palmitoylation on the first cysteine leads to major destabilization, for which we had no experimental evidence at that point, and that longer 35S Cys/Met pulse periods would reveal differences in apparent decay kinetics between the WT protein and the various cysteine mutants. These predictions turned out to be correct and subsequently led us to test overexpression of DHHC16 and silencing of APT2 on decay kinetics. This is now mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>3) The authors do not measure enzyme activity directly; rather it is assessed indirectly by</italic> in vivo <italic>labelling of substrates. This should be discussed and addressed. Ideally an</italic> in vitro <italic>direct assay of DHHC6 activity should be used.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>Having an in vitro assay for DHHC6 activity would indeed show that calnexin or the transferrin receptor are directly modified by DHHC6. Unfortunately the fact that DHHC6 is a membrane protein, that it requires palmitoylation by another membrane protein DHHC16 activity for and the fact that all identified DHHC6 substrates are so far membrane proteins make the establishment of an in vitro assay extremely challenging and beyond the scope of this study. We have now modified the text throughout the manuscript to avoid using the word “activity” incorrectly and rather refer to the ability of DHHC6 to mediated modification of reported targets, such as calnexin and transferrin receptor, in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>4) The methodology leave open the possibility that these proteins do not genuinely interact physically but could simply be associated with the same detergent-insoluble structures. More stringent solubilisation methods (e.g. stronger detergents or the extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin) should be used to confirm the result.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear to us to what experiment the reviewers are referring. We assume it is either the co-IP of WT and AAA mutant or the blue native gels.</p><p>We have now carefully reworded the text to include the two options, i.e. that WT and AAA mutant either form different complexes or reside in different membrane domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>5) The pulse is relatively long as compared to the chase in some pulse-chase experiments (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> a 2h pulse is used).

This point should be addressed and discussed.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>Indeed the pulse time has a major influence on the apparent turnover rate, both for 35S Cys/Met and 3H-palmitate labeling. We have now clearly conveyed this point in the text. For <sup>35</sup>S pulse-chase experiments, we have actually performed experiments changing the pulse time in order to calibrate and validate the model (see point 2 above). We have specified that the protein turn over rates that we provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> correspond to the turnover rates calculated by the model, which are independent of labeling time, not apparent turnover rates determined experimentally and which are indeed heavily influenced by labeling time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
