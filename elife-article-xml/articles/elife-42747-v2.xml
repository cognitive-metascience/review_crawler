Around 90% of complexes adsorbed to the air-water interface are partly denatured. We show that the unfolded regions face the air-water interface.

To achieve high contrast and high resolution in cryo-EM, a small volume of protein solution is applied to an EM support grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Passmore and Russo, 2016</xref>) and blotted before vitrification by plunge-freezing in liquid ethane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDowall et al., 1983</xref>). During this process, the protein is inevitably exposed to the atmosphere at a high surface-to-volume ratio. It has often been suggested that the air-water interface is a hostile environment for proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser and Han, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramsden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor and Glaeser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trurnit, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshimura et al., 1994</xref>). Numerous studies from the first half of the 20th century (reviewed by Neurath and Bull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neurath and Bull, 1938</xref>)) have shown that globular proteins applied to dilute buffers will eventually form an insoluble monolayer of ~10 Å thickness at the air-water interface, which means that they denature completely. A recent systematic investigation by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) of 31 different proteins on cryo-EM grids has shown that all have a more or less pronounced tendency to adhere to the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noble et al., 2018</xref>). Even if the proteins do not denature, adsorption often results in preferential orientation, which is undesirable for image processing and high-resolution structure determination. The standard method of preparing cryo-EM specimens by plunge-freezing of thin, unsupported layers of protein solution is therefore potentially problematic. Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaeser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser and Han, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2017</xref>) have drawn attention to the effects of the air water interface on proteins in solution, in particular on their integrity and orientation on cryoEM grids.</p><p>Proteins diffuse from the bulk phase of a thin layer of aqueous solution to the air-water interface in a millisecond or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Israelachvili, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Naydenova and Russo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor and Glaeser, 2008</xref>), so that each protein can make thousands of contacts with the atmosphere during the few seconds it takes to prepare a cryo-EM grid. At each encounter, the protein is at risk of partial unfolding. Fast nanodispensers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jain et al., 2012</xref>) in combination with self-blotting grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei et al., 2018</xref>) have been developed to minimize protein exposure to the air-water interface, and initial results look promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dandey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Attempts to overcome preferential orientation include saturation of the surface with surfactants, such as fluorinated detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Popot, 2010</xref>) that interact poorly with the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blees et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Efremov et al., 2015</xref>). These approaches require careful screening or access to a sophisticated (and costly) apparatus that is not universally available. As a simpler and potentially more general solution, we propose to use a physical support that largely prevents protein contact with, and consequently denaturation at, the air-water interface.</p><p>Continuous thin layers of amorphous carbon help to spread proteins evenly on cryo-EM grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Imprima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011</xref>). Amorphous carbon is, however, far from ideal as a support film for cyro-EM because it adds background and conducts electrons poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brink et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larson et al., 2011</xref>). Beam-induced movement is more severe on amorphous carbon support films than on unsupported films of vitrified solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to amorphous carbon, graphene, a monomolecular layer of crystalline carbon, has a number of desirable properties. It is the thinnest and strongest material known and at the same time an excellent conductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geim and Novoselov, 2007</xref>). It is stable under a 300 kV electron beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sader et al., 2013</xref>), and almost completely electron-transparent to 2.13 Å resolution (the position of the first Bragg peak) and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantelic et al., 2012</xref>). The main problem of graphene for cryo-EM is its extreme hydrophobicity. For an even spread of the protein solution, the graphene surface has to be made hydrophilic. Graphene oxide is less hydrophobic than graphene, but more difficult to apply to EM grids as a monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boland et al., 2017</xref>). Graphene can be rendered hydrophilic by plasma etching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>) or non-covalent chemical doping, exploiting the π-π stacking interaction between graphene and aromatic planar compounds such as 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pantelic et al., 2014</xref>). For cryo-EM, advantages of non-covalent doping include (i) the graphene structure is preserved; (ii) surface charge can be selectively modified; (iii) the number of adsorbed particles per unit area can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of the doping chemical.</p><p>We explored the denaturing effect of the air-water interface on fatty acid synthase (FAS) from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as an example of a large protein complex, and devised a way to avoid it. The structure of FAS is well-characterized by protein crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lomakin et al., 2007</xref>) and cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gipson et al., 2010</xref>). This makes it easy to detect and analyze which part of the complex contacts the interface and to what extent it is denatured. We use cryo-ET to locate the FAS particles on cryo-EM grids and visualize the denaturation of individual protein complexes in contact with the air-water interface. Finally, we demonstrate by high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM that a stable substrate of hydrophilized graphene avoids the denaturation of FAS complex during cryo-EM specimen preparation completely.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fatty acid synthase is intact prior to cryo-EM grid preparation</title><p>The FAS complex used for cryo-EM data collection was pure and homogeneous, as shown by size exclusion chromatography, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Thermal shift assays indicated that the complex was stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and at 1500–3000 mU/mg it was enzymatically fully active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fichtlscherer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oesterhelt et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wieland et al., 1979</xref>). Negative-stain EM of freshly purified FAS samples indicated that the complex was structurally intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Cryo-EM of the same samples in plunge-frozen, unsupported thin layers of vitrified solution on holey carbon film revealed that around 90% of the particles had suffered major structural damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). FAS particles in two-dimensional (2D) and in particular three-dimensional (3D) classification lacked between one third and one half of their density or had weak density at the distal part of the beta-domes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). A reconstruction of ~8000 particles was limited to 9.5 Å resolution, according to the gold-standard 0.143 FSC criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The particles were mostly flattened on one side and appeared incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The flattened regions aligned with the plane of the air-water interface. Particles attached to the lower and upper meniscus appeared to be equally affected, although the small number of particles on the upper meniscus precluded a statistically significant analysis. Our observations thus suggest that at some point during cryo-specimen preparation, the large majority of FAS complexes encountered the air-water interface, attached to it, and the air-exposed side unfolded before vitrification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Orientation of damaged FAS particles on the air-water interface</title><p>FAS particles at the air-water interface were investigated by subtomogram averaging (STA). A set of 1724 subvolumes was manually selected, and a subset of 20 randomly picked volumes was used as a reference for initial alignment. No symmetry constraints were applied. The final reconstruction indicated that one side of the FAS map lacked density, whereas the opposite side of the complex appeared complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). FAS attached with its long axis parallel to the air-water interface, which accounts for the scarcity of top views in the single-particle analysis. To determine the orientation of the partly denatured FAS complexes relative to the air-water interface, we fitted a surface through the centers of all particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then calculated the vectors pointing from the center of a complex towards its flattened side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we assessed by how much the vectors diverged from the normal of the previously calculated plane through all particles at that position, and whether they pointed toward the air-water interface or away from it. This analysis indicated clearly that the vectors pointed towards the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42747.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sub-tomogram averaging and orientation of denatured FAS in unsupported vitrified buffer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subtomogram averaging confirms localized denaturation of FAS.

The ‘gold-standard FSC’ procedure of estimating map resolution by comparing reconstructions derived from two independent halves of the particle data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>) had not been introduced at the time and was not applied. Therefore, the 0.5 FSC resolution estimate of that map was realistic, as confirmed by a comparison of the FAS alpha wheel in the earlier structure to the gold-standard FSC maps in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). The resolution of the earlier map is clearly between that of the 6.4 Å map of FAS on graphene and the 9.5 Å map of FAS in unsupported vitrified buffer, which were obtained with ∼8000 particles each. The better quality of the earlier map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gipson et al., 2010</xref>) is fully accounted for by the larger number of particles contributing to it, and the application of D3 symmetry. The 4 Å resolution of our present map from 28,000 particles on hydrophilized graphene is most likely limited by the inherent flexibility of the complex. This is implied by the cryo-EM structure of a FAS complex from the thermophilic fungus <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kastritis et al., 2017</xref>), which attained a gold standard, FSC 0.143 resolution of 4.7 Å from only ∼ 4000 particles. It is well known that protein complexes from thermophilic organisms are more stable than those of mesophilic origin. By comparison, more than 100,000 particles contributed to the 7.5 Å cryo-EM structure of a FAS complex from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehringer et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the mycobacterial complex is significantly less stable.</p><p>In many of the cryo-EM grids examined by electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noble et al., 2018</xref>), the curvatures of the upper and lower meniscus were different. In the case of FAS, the less densely populated upper meniscus was more strongly curved than the lower meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The reason for the difference in curvature is not known and most likely stochastic. The asymmetric distribution of protein on the upper and lower meniscus is surprising, because the grids were blotted symmetrically from both sides. Possibly, the more densely populated lower meniscus remained in contact with air for longer during the blotting process, so that more protein accumulated on it. At this stage, the reason for the asymmetrical particle distribution on the two surfaces is unknown.</p><p>Our cryo-EM analysis of FAS, a soluble 2.6 MDa protein complex, revealed that only a minority of the particles in unsupported vitreous films retained intermediate-resolution features, whereas up to 90% were at least partly denatured by the air-water interface. A survey of recently reported high-resolution cryo-EM structures shows that usually only a minor fraction of a large single-particle data set contributes to the final high-resolution map. Percentages of good particles were 19% for the 3.8 Å map of a human synaptic GABAA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>); 15% for human P-glycoprotein at 3.4 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Chen, 2018</xref>); 11.8% for a 4 Å nucleosome map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takizawa et al., 2018</xref>); 8.9% for the 3.4 Å structure of human γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015b</xref>); and only 5.7% for the 4 Å structure of a sodium channel complex from electric eel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). All were prepared in unsupported vitrified buffer. These numbers suggest that up to 94% of the particles may have suffered partial denaturation at the air-water interface. Future studies will show whether this is indeed the case, and whether denaturation can be avoided by using hydrophilized graphene grids, as we have shown for yeast FAS. If hydrophilized or otherwise functionalized graphene grids prove to work as well for other proteins to overcome denaturation at the air-water interface, a much higher proportion of particles would contribute to the final structure. This would result in a large increase in data collection efficiency and significantly better maps. It would be a major boost for cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain cultivation and protein purification</title><p>Yeast cultures were grown and FAS was purified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gajewski et al., 2017b</xref>).

Grids were dried under nitrogen flow for 30 min and then heated to 150°C for one hour to anneal the graphene layer to the Quantifoil film. Graphene-coated grids were stored under vacuum until use. Graphene-coated grids were washed in pure acetone for one hour to dissolve the protective PMMA layer and then rinsed with isopropanol for another hour, followed by drying under a nitrogen stream. Finally, the grids were dipped into 50 mM 1-pyrenecarboxyilic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) dissolved in DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for one minute, rinsed in one change of isopropanol and ethanol, and dried under a nitrogen stream. Grid quality was assessed in a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTwin (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 120 kV, at a nominal magnification of 9300x, yielding a pixel size at the specimen level of 1.19 nm. Electron diffraction patterns were recorded at a nominal camera length of 540 mm, with a 1 s exposure time and 150 μm aperture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Negative staining</title><p>FAS was diluted in purification buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) 0.05 mg/ml and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) sodium silicotungstate (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK).

Freshly purified FAS solution was diluted to 0.01 mg/ml with purification buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5). For experiment 1, air was bubbled through 200 μL of protein solution through a pipette tip for about 10 s, and EM grids were prepared from a 3 μl aliquot. For experiment 2, 200 μl of protein solution were passed over a 5 cm 100 μl intraMARK disposable glass micropipette (Brand, Wertheim, Germany) sealed at both ends, and collected for EM analysis in negative stain. For experiment 3, 20 μl of FAS solution were pipetted onto EM grid coated with amorphous carbon and incubated in air. After 15 s, the drop was touched with a second carbon-coated EM grid and blotted. Both grids were negatively stained as before.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-particle cryo-EM</title><p>Three μl of FAS solution (1.0 mg/ml for unsupported grids or 0.2 mg/ml for hydrophilized graphene grids) were applied to freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R2/2 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Jena, Germany) for unsupported samples or Quantifoil R0.6/1 holey carbon grids for hydrophilized graphene. Grids were vitrified in a Vitrobot Mark IV plunge-freezer at 100% humidity and 10°C after blotting for 6–8 s. Cryo-EM images were collected in a Titan Krios (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) electron microscope operating at 300 kV. Images were recorded automatically with EPU at a pixel-size of 1.053 Å, on a Falcon III EC direct electron detector (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) operating in counting mode. A total of 2648 and 1055 dose-fractionated movies were recorded to a cumulative dose of ∼ 32 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> for FAS in unsupported vitrified buffer and on hydrophilized graphene, respectively.

All subsequent image processing steps were performed within Relion 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>). An initial dataset of 81,163 unsupported particles was automatically picked, 2D classified, and used for the first consensus refinement with a 50 Å low pass filtered FAS EM map (EMD-1623 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gipson et al., 2010</xref>)) as initial reference. No symmetry was imposed. The same procedure was applied to the data collected on hydrophilized graphene grids, starting from a dataset of 57,021 particles. The best particles, sorted by 3D classification, were combined to perform a reconstruction imposing C1 (no symmetry) or D3 symmetry. This yielded maps at 9.5 Å resolution (unsupported samples, C1 symmetry), 4.8 and 4.0 Å resolution (hydrophilized graphene, C1 and D3 symmetry, respectively). All maps were corrected for the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the detector and sharpened with a B-factor of −130 Å<sup>2</sup>.

A set of 1724 and 2090 particles was manually picked from unsupported and hydrophilized graphene-coated grids, respectively. In both cases a subset of 20 random particles was used to generate an initial reference, and subtomogram averaging was performed according to the ‘gold standard’ procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>). The final map was band-pass filtered to 308 and 12 Å. To assess mask bias, FSC was also performed on the masked half-maps with phases randomized beyond 60 Å. The correlation dropped at the resolution above which the phases were randomized, indicating that the mask did not affect the resolution estimate. Finally, particle heterogeneity was explored by multi-reference alignment. To exclude reference bias, average volumes of damaged and intact FAS complexes were used as initial models for the graphene and the dataset unsupported dataset, respectively. Both references were low-pass filtered to 50 Å. For illustrative purposes, final maps were Gaussian-filtered (standard deviation of two physical pixels) within UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and tomographic volumes segmented with the convolutional neural network method implemented in EMAN2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Estimation of particle-to-interface orientation</title><p>To determine the orientation of partly denatured FAS with respect to the air-water interface, MATLAB was used to correlate the tomographic reconstruction with a geometrical model assuming that, upon adsorption, the plane describing the denatured side of the FAS particles would be parallel to the air-water interface. The missing density due to denaturation (R<sub>missing</sub>) was treated as the difference between the reconstruction of intact FAS (R<sub>intact</sub>) and the map obtained from sub-tomogram averaging of denatured particles (R<sub>denat</sub>). The analysis consisted of five sequential steps: (i) coordinates of the center of FAS complexes previously determined by sub-tomogram averaging were used to model the air-water interface (S<sub>estimate</sub>) by the <italic>Thin-plate interpolator</italic> option of the <italic>Curve Fitting</italic> Toolbox in MATLAB; (ii) for each particle location the vector P<sub>normal</sub> was calculated, which represents the normal of S<sub>estimate</sub> at that position; (iii) a vector P<sub>denat</sub> was computed that describes the relative orientation of the denatured side as the vector pointing from the center of R<sub>intact</sub> to the center of mass of R<sub>missing</sub>; (iv) the P<sub>denat</sub> vector was calculated for every particle detected in all the tomographic volumes; (v) finally, the displacement angle δ between the vectors P<sub>denat</sub> and P<sub>normal</sub> was calculated with a 7.5° sampling step. The distribution of δ was plotted as a bild file.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Protein denaturation at the air-water interface and how to prevent it&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Axel Brunger as Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert M Glaeser (Reviewer #2); Georgios Skiniotis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study explores the effects of adsorption to the air-water interface on protein particle structure and orientation. Using both single-particle cryo-EM and cryo-ET coupled to sub-tomogram averaging, the authors provide a thorough topological and structural analysis of vitrified protein particles using the well characterized yeast fatty acid synthase (FAS) as a model system. This work follows the recent cryo-ET study by Carragher and colleagues showing that most particles prepared with the typical vitrification process preferentially adsorb to the air-water interface with potentially detrimental effects to their structure. Here, D'Imprima and colleagues build on those findings and demonstrate convincingly that up to ~90% of particles residing at the interface have suffered damage through denaturation, with the denatured region facing the interface. The cryo-EM analysis, coupled to simple but very elegant negative stain imaging of particle integrity under different conditions, clearly reveals that particles have been damaged during vitrification and that this is associated with exposure to air; an event that accounts for a large fraction of discarded particles with important implications for data collection and structural analysis. The authors go further to demonstrate that the use of hydrophilized (through non-covalent doping) graphene prevents FAS denaturation and allows the calculation of highly improved 3D reconstructions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors propose the use of hydrophilized graphene oxide as a general solution to avoid protein denaturation during vitrification. To make such a strong impact however, this work should include a demonstration of the general use of this support with additional and different types of samples. In the absence of such additional experiments, the paper may be acceptable only if it focuses its message on yeast FAS. Statements in the title, Abstract and throughout the paper about the general application of this method should be removed.</p><p>The treatment by 1-pyrCA is interesting. In previous publications (e.g., Russo and Passmore, 2014), hydrogen-plasma treatment was used. Did the authors try this method? If so, how does it compare with the 1-pyrCA method?</p><p>It is common that papers about using graphene or graphene oxide as support films claim that such specimen-support films give much less background noise in the images than is the case for evaporated carbon support films. While that is clearly expected to be true, in this case the data seem to show that the background noise is much higher after the functionalization steps than it was before, and the authors properly point this out. The authors should either not make such a big point at the beginning about there being a low-noise background (i.e. do not raise false expectations), or point out, whenever making such statements, that the FGM reported here do not fully deliver the desired low-noise support film.</p><p>• It is not enough to suggest, as the authors do, that the increased RMS background is similar in height to that of the functionalized chemical groups that were added.</p><p>• Nor is it enough to point out, as the authors might do, that the noise did not interfere with getting a high-resolution map of FAS, because this quite a large particle.</p><p>• The community will still be skeptical that the same type of grids will be useful for particles in the size range of 200 kDa or smaller.</p><p>The manuscript does not fully represent the extent to which the cryo-EM community now appreciates that the air-water interface can do bad things. The unintended consequence is that the manuscript appears to claim more credit for originality than is perhaps due.</p><p>• A simple change might be to remove the statement, at the end of the first paragraph of the Introduction, which says &quot;Effects of adsorption.… are not widely appreciated.&quot;</p><p>• A more extensive change would be to add a more comprehensive review of recent literature.</p><p>Please clarify which surface it is, in Figure 2B, to which the sample was applied. When sample is applied to a holey carbon grid, there are small disks of air-water interface within each hole and a large, continuous air-water interface on the top side of the sitting drop of sample. Of these two air-water interfaces, which is the one that has so many particles adsorbed to it?</p><p>It would be informative if the authors would describe whether bubbling air through their sample, in the way that they described, resulted in foam, and if so, how long it persisted.

On the contrary, we were careful not to make such a claim. In this respect, we explicitly say that future studies will have to show that our method works as well for other proteins, and if it does, it will be a major boost. The final paragraph of the Discussion reads:</p><p>“These numbers suggest that up to 94% of the particles may have suffered partial denaturation at the air-water interface. […] This would result in a large increase in data collection efficiency and significantly better maps. It would be a major boost for cryo-EM.”</p><p>Nevertheless, to avoid any appearance of making such a claim, we added “potentially” to the sentence “As a simpler and potentially more general solution, we propose to use a physical support that largely prevents protein contact with, and consequently denaturation at, the air-water interface.”</p><p>We modified the sentence “We used fatty acid synthase (FAS) from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to explore the denaturing effect of the air-water interface and how to avoid it.” with “We explored the denaturing effect of the air-water interface on fatty acid synthase (FAS) from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as an example of a large protein complex and devised a way to avoid it.”</p><p>We modified the sentence “Finally, we demonstrate by high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM that a stable substrate of hydrophilized graphene avoids the denaturation during cryo-EM specimen preparation completely.” with “Finally, we demonstrate by high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM that a stable substrate of hydrophilized graphene avoids denaturation of FAS complex during cryo-EM specimen preparation completely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The treatment by 1-pyrCA is interesting.

While the contrast we obtained is significantly better than for standard evaporated carbon support films, we cannot exclude some extent of hydrocarbon contamination before or after doping. After submitting our manuscript, we found that 1-pyrCA renders graphene hydrophilic at a very much lower concentration, i.e. in the nanomolar range. The millimolar concentration of 1-pyrCA reported in the manuscript may have contributed to background noise in the images.</p><p>We modified statements in the text which may have raised unrealistic expectations regarding our chemical doping method. Specifically, we modified “The advantage of non-covalent doping is that the pristine graphene surface is preserved, and that particle adsorption can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of the doping chemical.” to “The advantage of non-covalent doping is that the mechanical and chemical properties of graphene surface are preserved, and that particle adsorption can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of the doping chemical.”. We exchanged “Typical micrographs recorded at 0.9 μm defocus showed good contrast (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).” with “Typical micrographs recorded at 0.9 μm defocus showed well-preserved particles (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), although image contrast was not as good as expected. Presumably the pristine graphene surface became contaminated to some extent with atmospheric hydrocarbons during specimen preparation, and the high dopant concentration may contribute to some loss of contrast. These factors may compromise the detection and alignment of particles that are significantly smaller than yeast FAS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript does not fully represent the extent to which the cryo-EM community now appreciates that the air-water interface can do bad things.

This agrees with our thoughts that the more populated meniscus had been exposed to air for longer than the fresh meniscus that forms upon blotting. It also explains why we did not detect damaged particles in graphene supported samples, since the “lower meniscus” (as in Figure 2B) is protected by a graphene layer (as shown in Figure 5D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be informative if the authors would describe whether bubbling air through their sample, in the way that they described, resulted in foam, and if so, how long it persisted.

When the film becomes too thin, all FAS particles in the small remaining volume are at risk from damage at the air-water interface. Most likely the few damaged particles in Figure 4D became denatured in the thin film of solution before stain was applied.</p></body></sub-article></article>
