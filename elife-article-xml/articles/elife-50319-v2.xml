(MT) dynamics at the plasma membrane. They play important roles in neurons, as suggested by inhibition of axon growth and regeneration through the ARF activator Efa6 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and by neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the mammalian kinesin Kif21A. How cortical collapse factors influence axon growth is little understood. Here we studied them, focussing on the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Efa6 in experimentally and genetically amenable fly neurons. First, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Efa6 can inhibit MTs directly without interacting molecules via an N-terminal 18 amino acid motif (MT elimination domain/MTED) that binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and cells. If N-terminal MTED-containing fragments are in the cytoplasm they abolish entire microtubule networks of mouse fibroblasts and whole axons of fly neurons. Full-length Efa6 is membrane-attached, hence primarily blocks MTs in the periphery of fibroblasts, and explorative MTs that have left axonal bundles in neurons. Accordingly, loss of Efa6 causes an increase of explorative MTs: in growth cones they enhance axon growth, in axon shafts they cause excessive branching, as well as atrophy through perturbations of MT bundles. Efa6 over-expression causes the opposite phenotypes. Taken together, our work conceptually links molecular and sub-cellular functions of cortical collapse factors to axon growth regulation and reveals new roles in axon branching and in the prevention of axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the MTED delivers a promising tool that can be used to inhibit MTs in a compartmentalised fashion when fusing it to specifically localising protein domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axons are the cable-like neuronal extensions that wire the nervous system. They are only 0.1–15 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hoffman, 1995</xref>), but can be up to a meter long in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prokop, 2013</xref>). It is a fascinating challenge to understand how axons can extend over these enormous distances and branch in orderly manners, but also how these delicate structures can be maintained for a lifetime, that is many decades in humans. It is not surprising that we gradually lose about 40% of our axons towards old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calkins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marner et al., 2003</xref>), and that axon decay is a prominent neurodegenerative phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adalbert and Coleman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fang and Bonini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Medana and Esiri, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Essential for axon biology are the parallel bundles of microtubules (MTs) running all along the axon shaft; these bundles provide (1) structural support, (2) highways for life-sustaining cargo transport, and (3) a source of MTs that can leave these bundles to drive morphogenetic changes. Through being organised in this way, MTs essentially drive processes of axon growth, branching and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conde and Cáceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prokop, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voelzmann et al., 2016a</xref>). The dynamics of MTs are orchestrated through MT-binding and -regulating proteins, for most of which we know the molecular mechanisms of function. However, such knowledge alone is usually not sufficient to explain their cellular roles.</p><p>For example, cortical collapse factors are cell surface-associated proteins which specifically inhibit MTs that approach the cell periphery. Previous reports suggested important roles for cortical collapse factors in regulating axon growth: the ARF activator Efa6 (exchange factor for ARF6) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> negatively impacts on developmental and regenerative axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>); the mammalian type four kinesin KIF21A also affects axon growth and links to the neurodevelopmental eye movement disorder ‘congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles’ (OMIM reference #135700; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heidary et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tiab et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). However, we can currently only hypothesise how the molecular functions of these two collapse factors link to axon growth, most likely by acting in growth cones (GCs).</p><p>GCs are the amoeboid tip structures through which axons extend to wire the nervous system during development or regeneration. The axonal MT bundles terminate in the centre of GCs; from here, single MTs splay into the actin-rich periphery of GCs. These explorative MTs can trigger extension of the entire MT bundle into their direction, thus elongating the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lowery and Vactor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Prokop et al., 2013</xref>); by inhibiting such explorative MTs, cortical collapse factors could negatively impact on axon growth.</p><p>In line with this argument, and depending on where cortical collapse factors are present and functionally active, further functional predictions could be made: for example, collateral branching of axons along their shafts has been described to depend on explorative MTs that leave the parallel axonal bundles and polymerise towards the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Cortical collapse factors might therefore be negative regulators of axon branching.</p><p>Other roles might concern axon maintenance: the model of 'local axon homeostasis' states that the force-enriched environment in axons biases MTs to buckle or project out of the bundle to seed pathological areas of MT disorganisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prokop, 2016</xref>). By inhibiting off-track MTs in the axon shaft, cortical collapse factors might prevent such processes, acting in parallel to other bundle-maintaining factors. For example, spectraplakins serve as spacers that keep polymerising MTs away from the cortex by linking the tips of extending MTs to the axonal surface and guiding them into parallel bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alves-Silva et al., 2012</xref>). Their deficiency in any organism causes severe MT disorganisation, potentially explaining human dystonin-linked HSAN6 ('type six hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy''; OMIM ID: 614653; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Voelzmann et al., 2017</xref>). If our hypothesis is correct, loss of cortical collapse factors in axon shafts would also cause MT disorganisation, but through a very different mechanistic route.</p><p>Here, we make use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons as a well-established, powerful model for studying roles of MT regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He and Roblodowski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Prokop et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2007</xref>). Using in vitro and cellular assays, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Efa6 is a cortical collapse factor acting through its N-terminal MT elimination domain (MTED). We find that the MTED binds tubulin and blocks MT polymerisation in vitro which indicates that the effect of the peptide is due to a direct interaction between the peptide and tubulin. By localising to neuronal membranes, it only abolishes explorative MTs. This subcellular role translates into negative regulation of axon growth and branching and the prevention of pathological MT disorganisation, both in cultured neurons and in vivo. We propose Efa6 to function as a quality control or axonal maintenance factor that keeps explorative MTs in check, thus playing a complementary role to spectraplakins that prevent MTs from leaving axonal bundles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efa6 is widely expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons and restricts axonal growth</title><p>To evaluate the function of Efa6 in neurons, we first determined its expression in the nervous system.

None of the identifiable N-terminal domains/motifs is particularly well conserved (details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> N-terminus contains (1) a putative PDZ domain (aa16-88; mainly found in insect versions of Efa6), (2) two SxIP motifs (aa 233–6 and 262–5; found primarily in Efa6 of flies, some other insects and molluscs; some vertebrate/mammalian species display derived SxLP motifs), and (3) a motif of 18aa (from now on referred to as MT elimination domain, MTED) displaying 89% similarity with a motif in the N-terminus of <italic>Ce</italic>Efa6 suggested to be involved in MT inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>; conserved in nematodes, arthropods and molluscs).</p><p>To assess potential roles of the 18aa long <italic>Drosophila</italic> MTED, we generated a series of GFP-tagged N-terminal constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>): <italic>Efa6-ΔCterm-GFP</italic> (encoding the entire N-terminal half upstream of the Sec7 domain), <italic>Efa6-Nterm-GFP</italic> (restricting to the N-terminal part containing all the identified functional domains), <italic>Efa6-Nterm<sup>ΔMTED</sup>-GFP</italic> (lacking the MTED) and <italic>Efa6-MTED-GFP</italic> (encoding only the MTED). All these N-terminal Efa6 variants showed localisation throughout neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D,F,G</xref>), and in the cytoplasm and nucleus of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C,D,F,G</xref>). Cytoplasmic and nuclear localisations occurred even at low expression levels, indicating that the absent C-terminus (and likely PH domain within) usually mediates membrane association. This nuclear localisation occurs in the absence of any predicted N-terminal nuclear localisation sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), likely reflecting a known artefact of GFP-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alves-Silva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Seibel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In spite of their very similar localisation patterns, the functional impact of these constructs was clearly MTED-dependent: only constructs containing the MTED (Efa6-ΔCterm::GFP, Efa6-Nterm::GFP and Efa6-MTED::GFP) caused strong axon loss in neurons and MT network depletion in fibroblasts, whereas Efa6-Nterm<sup>ΔMTED</sup>::GFP caused no phenotypes in fibroblasts and very mild axon loss in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D,F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D,G,H</xref>). Potential tendencies of Efa6-Nterm<sup>ΔMTED</sup>::GFP to cause some aberration, were complemented by findings that MTED::GFP-induced effects were less strong than those by two longer N-terminal constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This might suggest that there are some relevant N-terminal motifs or regions outside the MTED.</p><p>Likely candidates are the two SxIP motifs predicted to bind EB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Accordingly, we found that Efa6-Nterm::GFP tip-tracks, and that Efa6-FL::GFP and EB3::RFP co-localise at points where MTs enter Efa6-FL::GFP-rich areas in fibroblast (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Animations 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Such binding to EBs at MT plus ends, might enhance Efa6's ability to capture MTs for inhibition. However, when replacing each of the two SxIP motifs by four alanines, we found that the resulting Efa6-Nterm<sup>∆SxIP</sup>::GFP construct induced similarly strong axon loss in neurons and MT network depletion in fibroblasts as observed with Efa6-Nterm::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6D,E</xref>).

Furthermore, we deduced a MTED consensus sequence from 39 <italic>Efa6</italic> genes (details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>), identified the most likely human MTED-like sequence (position 31-49aa of PSD1; MTED-core in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and synthesised codon-optimised versions of (10) this human as well as the (11) fly and (12) worm MTEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>). When transfected into fibroblasts, we found that all six fly/worm constructs had strong MT-inhibiting properties, whereas the six human constructs (PSD1-4 full length, PSD1-Nterm, PSD1-MTED-like) showed only a slight increase in MT network defects that were far from the strong MT depletion observed with the fly/worm constructs; complete depletion of MT networks was never observed with the human constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Therefore, the presence of a well-conserved canonical MTED seems to be a good predictor for MT-inhibiting capabilities of Efa6 proteins.</p><p>To gain insights into the mechanisms through which MTEDs might act, we carried out a series of in vitro experiments. Purified Efa6-Nterm::GFP clearly associated with MTs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but failed to depolymerise MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore tested the same protein in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract to assess potential co-factor requirements, but saw again no activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) - in spite of the fact that injection of a corresponding mRNA into <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs caused strong cell division phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>We suspected problems with recombinant expression of Efa6-Nterm::GFP which is predicted to have large disordered regions. We used therefore synthetic MTED peptide as an alternative approach and tested it in MT growth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). We found that the amount of MT polymer produced in control MT growth assay conditions without peptide, was approximately 10-fold reduced when synthetic MTED peptide was added, whereas a scrambled version of the peptide failed to show this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). The effect of the MTED peptide is not as potent as that of the well-characterised MT depolymerising kinesin, KIF2C/MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin), which can completely inhibit MT growth at lower concentrations but requires ATP to this end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>).</p><p>The MT growth assay suggested that MTED can directly interfere with MT polymerisation in the absence of any auxiliary factors, and the decoration of MTs with Efa6-Nterm::GFP in our in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) is in agreement with this notion. To confirm direct interaction with tubulin, we coated sepharose beads with MTED and pulled down un-polymerised GDP-tubulin. We found that the MTED-coated beads pulled down three times more tubulin than the same beads uncoated, and five times more tubulin than beads coated with a scrambled version of the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, top). These data indicate a direct interaction of the MTED peptide with tubulin and suggest that a scrambled version of this peptide appears to passivate the bead surface reducing non-specific interaction of tubulin. When using the same set-up for MCAK and comparing it to uncoated beads, approximately 1.5 times more tubulin is pulled down by beads coated with MCAK in the presence of either AMPPNP or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> bottom; MCAK is known to strongly bind tubulin in the AMPPNP state and weakly bind tubulin in the ADP state; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagenbach et al., 2008</xref>). In these experiments, the overall amount of tubulin pulled down with MCAK was considerably lower than with MTED; this is not surprising when considering (1) that far fewer of the large MCAK molecules can be accommodated on the beads, (2) that the tubulin-binding domain via its four lysines could be a frequent site of bead attachment, thus blocking access for tubulin, and (3) that the conditions required for this method of bead attachment were less favourable for retention of activity than in previous binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagenbach et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the MTED exists primarily in Efa6 homologues of invertebrate species and its presence correlates with MT-inhibiting properties of these proteins. This conclusion is strongly supported by our finding that <italic>Drosophila</italic> MTED directly interferes with MT polymerisation. This can explain why MTs fail to enter Efa6-enriched areas in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Animation 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The C-terminal domain restricts the microtubule-inhibiting activity of Efa6 to the cortex</title><p>Our structure-function analyses strongly suggested that Efa6 is membrane-associated. This is further supported by the observation that fibroblasts expressing Efa6-FL::GFP or the C-terminal derivative Efa6-∆Nterm::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), display a membrane ruffle phenotype (curved open arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplements 6B,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7B,D</xref>). Efa6-∆Nterm::GFP had no obvious effects on MT networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3I</xref>), and its membrane ruffling phenotype likely reflects an evolutionarily conserved function of the Efa6 C-terminus through its Sec7, PH and/or CC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Derrien et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macia et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we find the same membrane ruffling when expressing PSD1-FL::GFP (curved open arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7E</xref>).</p><p>However, even if the C-terminus plays no active role in the MT inhibition process, it still regulates this function: the Efa6-ΔCterm::GFP and Efa6-Nterm::GFP variants which lack the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), fail to associate with the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C,D</xref>), do not cause ruffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C</xref>), but induce MT phenotypes far stronger than Efa6-FL::GFP does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D,H</xref> <italic>vs</italic> B). To assess whether lack of membrane tethering could explain this phenotypic difference, we generated the Efa6-Nterm::GFP::CAAX variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) where Efa6-Nterm::GFP is fused to the membrane-associating CAAX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hancock et al., 1991</xref>); this addition of CAAX changed the properties of Efa6-Nterm::GFP back to Efa6-FL::GFP-like behaviours: the hybrid protein localised to the cortex and caused only a moderate MT phenotype in fibroblasts, the axon loss phenotype was mild (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B,I</xref>; 3B,E) and, also in live analyses, the CAAX construct reproduced the effect of excluding MTs from Efa6-N-term::GFP::CAAX-enriched areas, confirming that this inhibition is mediated by the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Animation 4</xref>).

To perform these functions, Efa6 does not affect the dynamics of MTs contained within the central axonal bundles, but it inhibits mainly those MTs that leave these bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). By inhibiting explorative MTs in GCs, it negatively impacts on a key event underlying axon growth (explained below; yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). By inhibiting off-track MTs in the axon shaft, it tones down the machinery that seeds new interstitial branches (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), but also prevents these MTs from going astray and causing MT disorganisation (curled MTs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for axonal roles of Efa6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The model of local axon homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prokop, 2016</xref>) states that the maintenance of axonal MT bundles (green bars) is an active process. For example, the polymerisation (1) mediated by plus end machinery (blue circle) is guided by spectraplakins (here Shot) along cortical actin into parallel bundles (2), or MTs are kept together through cross-linkage (brown ‘L’; 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bettencourt da Cruz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krieg et al., 2017</xref>); here we propose that MTs accidentally leaving the bundle become susceptible to inhibition through cortically anchored Efa6 (red ‘T’ and orange circle).

This model is consistent with our findings for Efa6. Thus loss of Efa6 can contribute to enhanced axon growth in two ways: firstly, through allowing more MTs to enter filopodia; secondly, by allowing them to dwell in filopodia for longer, thus enhancing the likelihood of their stabilisation (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

However, in contrast to Efa6, both of these kinases perform growth-enhancing functions and play a secondary, delayed role downstream of Efa6. They are therefore unsuited to explain the direct MT-inhibiting roles of the MTED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, virtually all structure-function analyses performed with <italic>Ce</italic>Efa6 in developing and regenerating axons perfectly match our data and can be explained through our proposed model. Based on our findings, one might argue that <italic>Ce</italic>Efa6 detachment from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) could be the consequence of injury-induced physiological changes that would then pose a threat to axonal MT bundles; localisation to MT minus ends could therefore represent a protective sequestration mechanism. Another <italic>C. elegans</italic> study reported that loss of Efa6 has no impact on MT length in developing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yogev et al., 2016</xref>), which appears consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). They also found an increase in MT numbers, but there is currently no mechanism to explain this in non-injury conditions where <italic>Ce</italic>Efa6 stays at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, mammalian Efa6 also plays a role in axon regeneration. However, this mechanism is entirely different, in that it requires the C-terminus to activate Arf6 which, in turn, regulates integrin trafficking at the axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eva et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Roles of Efa6 during axonal branching</title><p>Axon branching can occur via GC split, in that diverging MTs get stabilised in parallel in the same GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acebes and Ferrús, 2000</xref>; yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Alternatively, it can occur through interstitial branching which involves the active generation (e.g. through MT severing) and then stabilisation of off-track MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Both models agree with our observations in Efa6-deficient/over-expressing neurons: we find greater/lower numbers of MTs in GC and shaft filopodia at 6 HIV, which then correlate with enhanced/reduced axonal branch numbers in mature neurons (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>If interstitial branch formation is negatively regulated by <italic>Efa6</italic>, this poses the question as to whether Efa6 has to be actively down-regulated in healthy neurons for branching to occur. Efa6 could either be physically removed from future branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) or its MT inhibition function could be switched off. However, in our view, no such regulation is required because Efa6 seems to be in a well-balanced equilibrium. Enough Efa6 appears to be present to inhibit occasional, likely accidental off-track MTs; this capacity is surpassed when the number of off-track MTs is actively increased, for example through MT severing proteins during axonal branch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Such a saturation model is supported by our experiments with <italic>shot</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>): filopodial MT numbers are elevated in <italic>shot</italic> mutant neurons, although Efa6 is present and functional (as demonstrated by the further increase in filopodial MT numbers in <italic>shot Efa6</italic> double-mutant neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,E</xref>). This is consistent with a model where Efa6 function occurs at a level that is easily saturated when increasing the number of explorative MTs. Such a view would also explain why loss of <italic>Ce</italic>Efa6 promotes axon regeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), in that the constant base-line of MT inhibition present in the wild-type, is removed in the mutant condition, thus favouring growth-mediating explorative MTs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Roles of Efa6 during axonal MT bundle maintenance</title><p>Axonal MT disorganisation in Efa6-deficient neurons occurs gradually and can even be induced by knock-down of Efa6 at mature stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). Therefore, Efa6 appears to prevent MT disorganisation during axon development and maintenance, as is consistent with its continued expression in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such a continued role makes sense in a scenario where MT bundles remain highly dynamic throughout a neuron's lifetime, constantly undergoing polymerisation to drive renewal processes that prevent senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voelzmann et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose that Efa6 acts as a quality control or maintenance factor within our model of ‘local axon homeostasis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prokop, 2016</xref>). This model states that MTs in the force-enriched environment of axons have a tendency to go off-track and curl up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearce et al., 2018</xref>), thus potentially seeding MT disorganisation. Different classes of MT-binding regulators, amongst them spectraplakins, prevent this by actively promoting the bundled conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>). We propose that cortical collapse factors act in a complementary way to spectraplakins in that they play no role in maintaining MTs in bundles, but they inhibit those MTs that have escaped the bundling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this scenario, MTs are protected from cortical collapse as long as they are actively maintained in axonal bundles; this can explain the long known conundrum of how axonal MTs extend hundreds of micrometres in relative proximity to the cell cortex in axons, whereas in non-neuronal cells cortical proximity of MTs tends to trigger either their inhibition or tethered stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaverina et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolutionary and mechanistic considerations of Efa6 function</title><p>We found that the MTED motif correlates well with MT inhibiting functions of Efa6 family members, whereas the rest of the N-terminus bears no obvious further similarity. Our experiments with N-terminal protein and synthetic MTED peptide, both reveal association with MTs/tubulin. The MTED strongly interferes with MT polymerisation. Future co-crystallisation experiments are required to reveal how the MTED works. Given its small size we hypothesise that it simply blocks assembly, rather than acting via more complex mechanisms such as active promotion of depolymerisation (e.g. kinesin-8 and −13, XMap215; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Bassam and Chang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</xref>) or severing (e.g. spastin, katanin, fidgetin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McNally and Roll-Mecak, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharp and Ross, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In any case, the small size of MTEDs might come in handy as experimental tools to inhibit MTs, potentially displaying complementary properties to existing genetic tools such as the kinesin-13 Kif2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schimizzi et al., 2010</xref>), stathmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marklund et al., 1996</xref>) or spastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eckert et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the experiments with the CAAX domain have shown that Efa6's MT inhibiting function can be targeted to specific subcellular compartments to clear them of MTs, thus opening up a wide range of future applications.</p><p>Interestingly, the MT-inhibiting role of Efa6 seems not to be conserved in chordates when taking the MTED as indicator for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). However, roles of cortical collapse factors in neurons seem to have been taken over by other proteins such as the kinesin-4 family member Kif21A. The CFEOM1-linked Kif21A<sup>R954W</sup> mutation causes the protein to relocate from the axon shaft to the growth cone of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). In consequence, increased Kif21A levels in GCs cause reduced axon growth - and we observed the same with Efa6 over-expression (green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The decreased levels of Kif21A in proximal axons correlate with a local increase in side branches - and we observed the same with Efa6 loss of function (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,L</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we found that the C-terminal domains of Efa6 might display some degree of functional conservation. So far, work on mammalian PSDs has revealed functions for C-terminal domains in regulating ARF6, ARF1 or ARL14 during actin cytoskeletal reorganisation and membrane ruffling, tumour formation, axon regeneration and immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Derrien et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eva et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pils et al., 2005</xref>).

Promising research avenues will be to refine our mechanistic understanding of how Efa6 blocks MT polymerisation, not only to better understand how it can be regulated in axons, but also to better exploit MTEDs as molecular tools in cell biological research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Loss-of-function mutant stocks used in this study were the two deficiencies uncovering the <italic>Efa6</italic> locus <italic>Df(3R)Exel6273</italic> (94B2-94B11 or 3R:22,530,780..22,530,780; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_7740">BDSC_7740</ext-link>) and <italic>Df(3R)ED6091</italic> (94B5-94C4 or 3R:22,587,681..22,587,681; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/DGGR_150165">DGGR_150165</ext-link>): <italic>shot<sup>3</sup></italic> (the strongest available allele of <italic>short stop</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kolodziej et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sanchez-Soriano et al., 2009</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_5141">BDSC_5141</ext-link>); <italic>Efa6<sup>KO#1</sup></italic> (ends-out targeting mutant that contains a small 74 bp deletion in exon 8) and three null alleles generated as genomic engineering intermediates: the knock-out founder line <italic>Efa6<sup>GX6[w+]</sup></italic> and the two founder lines <italic>Efa6<sup>GX6[w-]</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_60587">BDSC_60587</ext-link>) and <italic>Arf51F<sup>GX16[w-]</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_60585">BDSC_60585</ext-link>; all published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).

Depolymerisation rates were determined from plots of the length of individual microtubules versus time, obtained by thresholding and particle analysis of images using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Microtubule growth assays</title><p>30 μM 25% rhodamine-labelled porcine brain tubulin was incubated in 80 mM PIPES pH6.9, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 5% DMSO and 1 mM GTP at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of either no peptide, 30 μM MTED peptide (APRFEAYMMTGDLILNLSRT; synthesised by Genosphere Biotechnologies Genscript), 30 μM scrambled peptide (MITAPREFDYLNLRAGLSMT; synthesised by Genosphere Biotechnologies) or 8 μM MCAK (1 mM Mg.ATP was included with MCAK). To stabilise MTs and to reduce their density so that they can be easily imaged, the reactions were then diluted 200-fold into BRB80 buffer (80 mM PIPES pH6.9, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) containing 1 mM taxol. Samples were added to poly-lysine coated cover glasses and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The amount of tubulin polymer in each field of view was quantified by segmenting the images into background and microtubules by application of a threshold and measuring the total area of tubulin polymer for each image. Five fields of view were quantified from each of two separate experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Tubulin pull-down assays</title><p>MTED peptide or scrambled peptide was coupled (5 ng peptide/μl beads) via the N-terminal amine to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). 15 μM porcine brain tubulin was incubated with either MTED peptide-coated, scrambled peptide-coated or uncoated sepharose beads in BRB80 with 0.2% Tween 20 for 30 mins at 20°C. The beads were washed five times with a 2:1 <italic>v/v</italic> ratio of BRB80 with 0.2% Tween 20 to beads. An equal volume of 2x Laemmli buffer was added to the washed beads, incubated at 90°C for 5 min, spun down and the supernatant run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The intensity of the bands was quantified in FIJI. Full length human MCAK was coupled (1 µg/ µl beads) to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads via any solvent exposed lysine or the N-terminal amine. MCAK coated beads were incubated with 5 mM AMPPNP or ADP for 30 min at 20°C and then incubated with 15 μM porcine brain tubulin for 30 mins at 20°C. The beads were then treated as for peptide-coated beads (above) but with inclusion of the appropriate nucleotide in the washing buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title><italic>Xenopus</italic> assays</title><p>Interphase cytosol extracts from <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Allan and Vale, 1991</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Efa6 regulates axon growth, branching and maintenance by eliminating off-track microtubules at the cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The three reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three referees agreed your work represents a thorough and detailed characterization of the function of Efa6 in axon growth and the potential roles in the microtubule cytoskeleton. However, as you will see in the reviews, and in the following discussions, the referees agreed that the advance over previous work was minimal. The O'Rourke and Chen studies referenced by two referees appears to undermine the novelty of the work as well. In light of these and other considerations based on the referee comments, we are unable to pursue your manuscript further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors show that the exchange factor for Arf6 (EFa6) functions in depolymerizing microtubules (MTs) in axons to keep MTs bundled in the axon shaft. This is a well-documented and quantified study that adds to our knowledge of this protein in nervous system function. Although the authors show that the full-length protein and the MT-eliminating domain (MTED) serve to depolymerize MTs in the axon and growth cone, they are not able to discern the molecular mechanism by which this protein and domain function in MT elimination. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, previous studies have shown that the Efa6 protein and the MTED domain function in limiting MT growth at the cell cortex in dividing cells (O'Rourke et al., 2010) and that Efa6 functions in axon regeneration through interactions with MT-associated proteins Tac-1 and Zyg-8 (doublecortin-like kinase) (Chen et al., 2011; 2015). Thus, this study adds to the literature by showing Efa6 and its MTED also function in axon outgrowth, branch formation and maintenance in a similar manner and provide evidence that Efa6 cooperates with Shot protein to accomplish these tasks. Shot appears to act, shown through previous studies by this lab, as a MT bundle organizer and Efa6 is proposed to work as a quality control mechanism to keep MTs from going off track. The major concern of this reviewer is how much this study really adds to our understanding of Efa6 function in the nervous system. The protein was already known to limit MT polymerization at the plasma membrane and the MTED was previously shown to be critical for this function, both in non-neuronal cells and neurons. Yes, this work adds to the literature by showing Efa6 also acts in axon outgrowth, branching and maintenance but the authors are not able to determine the mechanism of action. Thus, this seems to be an incremental advance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Qu et al. investigate <italic>Drosophila</italic> Efa6 in neurons and show that reduction in Efa6 results in an increase in axon length and more branches, while overexpression of Efa6 has the opposite phenotype. Further, Efa6 reduction results in more axonal swellings and some of these contain disorganised microtubules. Overexpression of Efa6 or of N-terminal fragments containing the so-called microtubule elimination domain (MTED) in fibroblasts reduces MTs at the cell cortex. These data are nice and convincing, but in line with previous findings in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (O'Rourke et al., 2010 and Chen et al., 2015). Thus, the study largely corroborates previous findings. Unfortunately, a conceptual advance how Efa6 functions is lacking, mainly because the attempt to reconstitute the proposed process of cortex-induced catastrophe with purified proteins failed. This is probably not surprising as interacting partners of the 18 amino acid MTED have already been identified by others (Chen et al., 2015), which could mediate microtubule-regulating functions. While it might not be absolutely necessary to reconstitute the effect in vitro, the cell biology experiments provided are also lacking mechanistic insight as most only show a snapshot of defects after several days of inhibition/overexpression. The high-resolution imaging possible in the fibroblasts experiments has not been employed to study the interactions of Efa6 with microtubules at the cell cortex and thus to provide direct evidence that and new insight how Efa6 eliminates off-track microtubules.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear why the authors used lower amounts of Efa6 in their in vitro assays than MCAK even though they show that Efa6 binds weaker to microtubules than MCAK. Also, why would the authors assume that Efa6 could depolymerise GMPCPP-stabilised microtubules? Surely one would try to see an effect on dynamic microtubules first. If the proposal is that Efa6 triggers catastrophe at the cell cortex, then slowing down assembly is all what it takes to have the desired effect. Further, it seems dangerous to lyophilise and then reconstitute purified Efa6 in water. While this might be appropriate for some proteins, I wouldn't want to conclude that a protein has no effect on microtubule dynamics unless I used at least once a fresh prep of protein. Thus, I am not convinced that we can take the manuscript as negative evidence for a direct function of Efa6 on microtubules.</p><p>2) The authors propose that shot causes more off track MTs and Efa6 removes them. This is testable by expressing Efa6 in shot mutants, which should correct the defects. Shot mutants should increase the incidents of off track MTs whose interactions with Efa6 could then be studied more easily, ideally by recruiting Efa6 locally and determining the cortex dwell times of off track MTs in the Efa6 positive regions relative to normal or depleted cell cortex.</p><p>3) The number of EBs and filopodia per neuron or growth cone will depend at least partially on its size. Thus as neurons are small and don't have a proper growth cone when Efa6 is overexpressed (Figure 6G,H), it is expected that the numbers of other items are also reduced and vice versa in Efa6 mutants. The data in Figure 6 and Figure 7 need to be shown relative to neuron size / axon length / growth cone (surface) area. The distributions should be shown also for the control and actual values presented. For example, lifetime should be given in seconds and speed in nm/s, counts as a frequency per µm of axon or µm<sup>2</sup> of growth cone. The authors will need to reassess whether statistically significant effects are present once the data have been normalised correctly.</p><p>4) Distributions or error bars are missing for a number of panels. Count data with two categories do not need to be shown as stacked bars, but should rather contain error bars or the exact values for technical repeats / independent experiments. Some data are just mentioned in the text. In particular, dwell times of microtubule tips at the cell cortex are key given the title of the manuscript, but no quantitative data are shown in the figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work is a comprehensive study on the function of efa6 in regulating axonal growth and axonal maintenance. It uses a combination of systems to conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> (and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, together with published work) efa6 may be a cortical MT collapse factor eliminating MTs that have left the axon bundle (but that its function is not conserved in vertebrates).</p><p>The phenotypes regarding axon length, and MT organization and/or levels are quite striking, both in flies and in fibroblasts. However, it is a pity that the mechanism of action is not clarified, especially since MTED had already been described to have such a function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. I am not sure the data has eliminated the possibility of efa6 having an effect on the biophysics of the membrane/cortex, and this effect indirectly impacting on MTs. Could the authors discuss this?</p><p>Can the authors explain why they analyzed efa6 in the first place? It is not described in the Introduction what was the argument for this study.</p><p>An extremely dense paper, where it feels on occasions that the authors want to present everything they have tested, which makes some parts of the manuscript difficult to read. I would suggest the shortening/reduction of some sections. For example, the domain characterization could start with MTED, since this domain has already been shown to have a MT destabilizing function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> efa6 has no PDZ domain, for example.</p><p>The domain analysis was done in the presence of endogenous protein, so it is harder to conclude what the primary function of the domain is, as the phenotypes can result from complex dominant effects, or they may rely on the endogenous full length. For the key domains, would it be possible to test the effect in the absence of endogenous prot? Maybe transfecting primary cultured neurons from the mutant flies? For example, what happens when the only efa6 protein expressed in cells is a full length one with a mutated MTED?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Efa6 protects axons and regulates their growth and branching by inhibiting microtubule polymerisation at the cortex&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article and your letter of appeal and response to referee comments have been considered by a Senior Editor, a reviewing editor, and three referees of your original submission, and we regret to inform you that we are upholding our original decision.</p><p>Please note that the referees believe your work is improved, but is not sufficiently rigorous in many instances due to missing controls and analysis (noted by the referees in the comments below) to provide mechanistic Efa6 functions in microtubule regulation. There have also been a number of issues raised about the writing and more importantly referencing key papers in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I think that the paper has improved significantly mainly by shortening the writing, however, major issues remain and I don't feel that my previous comments have been adequately addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Note: As I feel that reviewers should not be expected to download and consider data from an author's private website, I did not take into consideration the source data tables nor the supplementary movies that were not uploaded together with the manuscript. However, I don't expect that their availability would have changed my conclusions significantly.</p><p>The authors now claim to have directly shown that MTED blocks MT growth in vitro and in cells, thereby providing new mechanistic insight. The data that supposedly show this are provided in a minimalistic Figure 4 and a supplementary movie which wasn't available on the journal's website.</p><p>The &quot;successful&quot; in vitro experiments were done with equimolar and a tenfold excess of MTED peptide to tubulin. It is highly unlikely that 30 – 300 μm MTED is physiologically relevant and the observed effect might not even be specific. An adequate control for this experiment would be to show that a scrambled peptide does not have a similar effect at this concentration. As the authors have a Efa6::GFP knock-in line, it should be possible to determine the endogenous concentration of Efa6 relative to a GFP standard and then repeat in vitro experiments at physiologically relevant peptide concentrations including an adequate control. Furthermore, the results should be quantified in order to sustain the claim in subsection “The MTED is a good predictor of MT-inhibiting function directly affecting MT polymerisation”: &quot;resulted in strong suppression of MT polymerisation in a dose-dependent manner&quot;. The figure only shows a single snapshot of Taxol-stabilised MTs. Polymerisation itself has not been measured or visualised for either concentration of MTED peptide. In light of the data supporting a direct role of Efa6 MTED towards microtubules being so weak, I repeat that it would be appropriate to discuss previously published findings of Efa6 interactors that are known to interact with microtubules and might work together with Efa6 to affect microtubule assembly in the vicinity of the cell cortex. Given the SxIP related motifs in Efa6, EBs are additional potential interactors that have been implicated in regulating microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex before.</p><p>The requested data describing microtubule behaviour in Efa6-expressing fibroblasts were not provided beyond a statement referring to a supplementary movie. As those are key to the mechanistic understanding of Efa6 action and for supporting a key claim in the manuscript title, data need to be provided in a main figure or table and include a robust quantification of the phenomenon.</p><p>Therefore, the manuscript still falls short in providing convincing evidence for Efa6 to inhibit microtubule polymerisation at the cell cortex.</p><p>There are several incidences of overstatement / oversimplification, e.g.:</p><p>1) The data in Figure 3B show that overexpression of Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup> has a significant effect on axon loss. This is weaker than that of Efa6-Nterm or of Efa6-FL, but it is still statistically significant, suggesting that there is residual activity in that fragment. Likewise, in fibroblasts, Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup> results in complete loss of microtubules in a few cells, which did not happen in the GFP control. However, the authors state in subsection “The N-terminal 18aa motif of Efa6 is essential for microtubule-436 inhibiting activity of Efa6”: &quot;Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup>::GFP behaved like GFP controls&quot;. The statements should be corrected and any additional activity towards microtubules outside of the MTED region should be discussed.</p><p>2) The data in Figure 3C-D show that human full length PSD1-3 have a significant effect on microtubules (p=0.001!!!), but the authors state in subsection “The MTED is a good predictor of MT-inhibiting function directly affecting MT polymerisation”: &quot;none of the 6 human constructs.… showed MT collapse (Figure 3C-E)&quot;. Actually, the effect of the full-length PSD constructs cannot be matched by the N-terminal portion of the molecules or the MTED-like region in the human proteins. This discrepancy should be described and discussed rather than hidden in the paper.</p><p>Comments on writing and data presentation:</p><p>1) The paper suffers from an inadequately high rate of self-citations, while lacking balanced representation of other work in the field. One example is the citing of two review articles and a preprint involving the senior author for the statement in the Introduction: &quot;Here we make use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons as a well-established, powerful model for studying roles of MT regulators&quot;. This statement should instead be followed by references to landmark papers in the field in which key discoveries were first described.</p><p>2) The figures don't align with the text. Some panels are never cited and those that are cited are in random order, for example Figure S3 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and Figure S5 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 2)are cited well before Figure S1 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 5) and Figure S2 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 4) are mentioned. Figure 2D is cited before Figure 1A-C or 2A-C were mentioned etc.</p><p>3) The figure legends lack structure and information on the number of independent experiments from which the data were obtained – the methods section doesn't provide this information either for the majority of the experiments. Any raw data to be considered should be uploaded with the manuscript as supplementary information. The authors need to state for each panel what the sample number refers to: individual measurements, cells/embryos analysed or independent experimental repeats.</p><p>4) There is unnecessary reference to methods and papers where methods have been used before in the Results section … and specific bar colours within the main text (e.g. Results section and Discussion section), reducing readability.</p><p>5) The methods section does not contain sufficient information without needing to refer to a whole lot of the lab's previous papers. For example, in subsection “<italic>Drosophila</italic> primary cell culture”: &quot;per 100 μl dispersion medium (Prokop et al., 2012)&quot; even the composition of media is not included.</p><p>6) The authors should explain the differences between the various Efa6 mutant strains used and a rationale why certain experiments were done with only one particular strain. For example, why is EB1 comet lifetime in filopodia shown for GX6[w+], but in growth cones for GX6[w-]? Why are filopodia per growth cone with Eb1 comets shown for GX6[w-] and KO#1, but filopodia per growth cone with MTs for GX6[w-] and GX6[w+], but not for the KO line? One can't help to suspect that data that didn't fit the scheme were excluded. If this isn't the case, the authors should provide an explanation for the inconsistencies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In my previous review my main concern was how much this study really adds to our understanding of Efa6 function in the nervous system. The protein was already known to limit MT polymerization at the plasma membrane and the microtubule elimination domain (MTED) was previously shown to be critical for this function, both in non-neuronal cells and neurons. The authors have now added new data (Figures 4, Figure 6G and Figure 8N). Importantly, Figure 4 shows that the MTED peptide is capable of limiting MT polymerization in vitro when only tubulin and MTED peptide is present. Furthermore, they show that the MTED peptide is able to immunoprecipitate purified tubulin. These experiments suggest that the MTED can function directly with tubulin. These data do provide some mechanism that was lacking in the previous version of the manuscript. However, it is somewhat crude to compare MTED inhibition of polymerization to no addition of MTED (in the growth assay in Figure 4A) or by comparing MTED-coupled beads to empty beads (in the IP in Figure 4B). These are very weak negative controls, given that tubulin readily interacts non-specifically with other proteins in many assays and there are not any positive controls in the assays they perform in Figure 4. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B they use MCAK in their in vitro assays as a positive control. Since the Efa6-δ-Cterminal peptide does not seem to work in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A/B (the authors suggest this may be due to large disordered regions in that part of the protein), some other (scrambled?) peptide could be used as a negative control and/or MCAK (or peptide thereof) as a positive control. Such experiments would provide a more compelling mechanism with relatively little additional work. Additionally, the authors have also modified the previous manuscript to make it more coherent and compact and addressed my previous minor concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This work is a comprehensive study on the function and molecular mechanism of efa6 in regulating MT organization during axonal growth and axonal maintenance.

For example, what happens when the only efa6 protein expressed in cells is a full length one with a mutated MTED?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see what would be gained from this experiment: (1) we now know that the MTED clearly affects MT polymerisation in vitro in the absence of other protein; (2) the data obtained from our comprehensive series of experiments in fibroblasts (which do not harbour any MT-eliminating endogenous Efa6) draw a very clear picture and are fully consistent with our findings in neurons.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Efa6 protects axons and regulates their growth and branching by inhibiting microtubule polymerisation at the cortex&quot; for consideration at eLife. Your article and your letter of appeal and response to referee comments have been considered by a Senior Editor, a reviewing editor, and three referees of your original submission, and we regret to inform you that we are upholding our original decision.</p><p>Please note that the referees believe your work is improved, but is not sufficiently rigorous in many instances due to missing controls and analysis (noted by the referees in the comments below) to provide mechanistic Efa6 functions in microtubule regulation. There have also been a number of issues raised about the writing and more importantly referencing key papers in the field.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>An adequate control for this experiment would be to show that a scrambled peptide does not have a similar effect at this concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments together with MCAK as a positive control are now provided and shown in Figure 4. These data clearly show that scrambled peptide does not inhibit microtubule growth, whereas MTED and MCAK inhibit growth of microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors have a Efa6::GFP knock-in line, it should be possible to determine the endogenous concentration of Efa6 relative to a GFP standard and then repeat in vitro experiments at physiologically relevant peptide concentrations including an adequate control.</p></disp-quote><p>Since Efa6 is compartmentalised to the membrane, it is close to impossible to deduce any concentration statements from whole cell extracts. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that in vitroconditions will hardly match the cell conditions, and mechanisms might not work as well as in the cellular context. However, the live movies provided (Video 1, Video 2 and Video 4) make a very powerful complementary statement that matches the qualitative statement of our in vitroexperiments and demonstrate their functional relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the results should be quantified in order to sustain the claim in subsection “The MTED is a good predictor of MT-inhibiting function directly affecting MT polymerisation”: &quot;resulted in strong suppression of MT polymerisation in a dose-dependent manner&quot;.

As those are key to the mechanistic understanding of Efa6 action and for supporting a key claim in the manuscript title, data need to be provided in a main figure or table and include a robust quantification of the phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>Robust quantifications are now provided in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, the manuscript still falls short in providing convincing evidence for Efa6 to inhibit microtubule polymerisation at the cell cortex.</p><p>There are several incidences of overstatement / oversimplification, e.g.:</p><p>1) The data in Figure 3B show that overexpression of Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup> has a significant effect on axon loss. This is weaker than that of Efa6-Nterm or of Efa6-FL, but it is still statistically significant, suggesting that there is residual activity in that fragment. Likewise, in fibroblasts, Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup> results in complete loss of microtubules in a few cells, which did not happen in the GFP control. However, the authors state in subsection “The N-terminal 18aa motif of Efa6 is essential for microtubule-436 inhibiting activity of Efa6”: &quot;Efa6-Nterm-<sup>ΔMTED</sup>::GFP behaved like GFP controls&quot;. The statements should be corrected and any additional activity towards microtubules outside of the MTED region should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement has been improved to reflect our data accurately: &quot;only constructs containing the MTED (Efa6-ΔCterm::GFP, Efa6-Nterm::GFP and Efa6-MTED::GFP) caused strong axon loss in neurons and MT network depletion in fibroblasts, whereas Efa6-Nterm<sup>ΔMTED</sup>::GFP caused no phenotypes in fibroblasts and very mild axon loss in neurons (Figures 3B; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D,F,G; Figure 3—figure supplement 6C,D,G,H).&quot; From this statement we lead over to assessing the SxIP motif as a potential second motif in the N-terminus (see also two points above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in Figure 3C-D show that human full length PSD1-3 have a significant effect on microtubules (p=0.001!!!), but the authors state in subsection “The MTED is a good predictor of MT-inhibiting function directly affecting MT polymerisation”: &quot;none of the 6 human constructs.… showed MT collapse (Figure 3C-E)&quot;. Actually, the effect of the full-length PSD constructs cannot be matched by the N-terminal portion of the molecules or the MTED-like region in the human proteins. This discrepancy should be described and discussed rather than hidden in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement has been moderated to accurately reflect our data: “When transfected into fibroblasts, we found that all 6 fly/worm constructs had strong MT-inhibiting properties, whereas the 6 human constructs (PSD1-4 full length, PSD1-Nterm, PSD1-MTED-like) showed only a slight increase in MT network defects that were far from the strong MT depletion observed with the fly/worm constructs; complete depletion of MT networks was never observed with the human constructs (Figure 3C-E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on writing and data presentation:</p><p>1) The paper suffers from an inadequately high rate of self-citations, while lacking balanced representation of other work in the field. One example is the citing of two review articles and a preprint involving the senior author for the statement in the Introduction: &quot;Here we make use of Drosophila neurons as a well-established, powerful model for studying roles of MT regulators&quot;. This statement should instead be followed by references to landmark papers in the field in which key discoveries were first described.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully read through the paper under this aspect and do not agree with the reviewer. Since there are currently very few other groups that focus their research on the wider field of axonal MTs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it seems natural that our own papers rank higher in proportion. It is particularly difficult to find reviews that cover this particular topic, but we tried our best to find a better balance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The figures don't align with the text. Some panels are never cited and those that are cited are in random order, for example Figure S3 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and Figure S5 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 2)are cited well before Figure S1 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 5) and Figure S2 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 4) are mentioned. Figure 2D is cited before Figure 1A-C or 2A-C were mentioned etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We took care to make sure that now all panels are mentioned and that all figures occur in the order as they are mentioned in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The figure legends lack structure and information on the number of independent experiments from which the data were obtained – the methods section doesn't provide this information either for the majority of the experiments. Any raw data to be considered should be uploaded with the manuscript as supplementary information. The authors need to state for each panel what the sample number refers to: individual measurements, cells/embryos analysed or independent experimental repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-read the figure legends and made some improvements. The original statement in the methods part: &quot;Images were derived from at least 2 independent experimental repeats performed on different days, for each of which at least 3 independent culture wells were analysed by taking a minimum of 20 images per well.&quot; has now been moved into a more prominent location together with statistics explanations, and also been mentioned in the figure legends for clarity. We added to the figure legends what entities were used to indicate sample numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is unnecessary reference to methods and papers where methods have been used before in the Results section and specific bar colours within the main text (e.g. Results section and Discussion section), reducing readability.</p></disp-quote><p>In a few positions we removed &quot;see methods&quot;, but left it where the methods part explains complex procedures that are kept concise in the Results section (e.g. the Gal80 approach). We disagree with deleting bar colour information from the text, since they directly point the reader to the relevant information in mentioned figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The methods section does not contain sufficient information without needing to refer to a whole lot of the lab's previous papers. For example, in subsection “Drosophila primary cell culture”: &quot;per 100 μl dispersion medium (Prokop et al., 2012)&quot; even the composition of media is not included.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-read the methods part in its entirety and strongly disagree. The amount of detail provided is of high standard. We have added the details for the culture medium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should explain the differences between the various Efa6 mutant strains used and a rationale why certain experiments were done with only one particular strain. For example, why is EB1 comet lifetime in filopodia shown for GX6[w+], but in growth cones for GX6[w-]? Why are filopodia per growth cone with Eb1 comets shown for GX6[w-] and KO#1, but filopodia per growth cone with MTs for GX6[w-] and GX6[w+], but not for the KO line? One can't help to suspect that data that didn't fit the scheme were excluded. If this isn't the case, the authors should provide an explanation for the inconsistencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Comment has been inserted: &quot;Efa6 knock-down (Efa6-RNAi), two overlapping deficiencies uncovering the entire Efa6 gene locus (Efa6Def), and three precise gene deletions including Efa6<sup>GX6[w+]</sup>, Efa6<sup>GX6[w-]</sup> and Efa6<sup>KO#1</sup> (see methods for details; Huang et al., 2009). In all these conditions, axon length at 6 HIV was increased compared to wild-type by at least 20% (Figure 2A,B,D). Since there were no obvious differences between the precise deletion lines, these alleles were used interchangeably for further experiments.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In my previous review my main concern was how much this study really adds to our understanding of Efa6 function in the nervous system. The protein was already known to limit MT polymerization at the plasma membrane and the microtubule elimination domain (MTED) was previously shown to be critical for this function, both in non-neuronal cells and neurons. The authors have now added new data (Figure 4, Figure 6G and Figure 8N). Importantly, Figure 4 shows that the MTED peptide is capable of limiting MT polymerization in vitro when only tubulin and MTED peptide is present. Furthermore, they show that the MTED peptide is able to immunoprecipitate purified tubulin. These experiments suggest that the MTED can function directly with tubulin. These data do provide some mechanism that was lacking in the previous version of the manuscript. However, it is somewhat crude to compare MTED inhibition of polymerization to no addition of MTED (in the growth assay in Figure 4A) or by comparing MTED-coupled beads to empty beads (in the IP in Figure 4B). These are very weak negative controls, given that tubulin readily interacts non-specifically with other proteins in many assays and there are not any positive controls in the assays they perform in Figure 4. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B they use MCAK in their in vitro assays as a positive control. Since the Efa6-Δ-Cterminal peptide does not seem to work in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A/B (the authors suggest this may be due to large disordered regions in that part of the protein), some other (scrambled?) peptide could be used as a negative control and/or MCAK (or peptide thereof) as a positive control. Such experiments would provide a more compelling mechanism with relatively little additional work. Additionally, the authors have also modified the previous manuscript to make it more coherent and compact and addressed my previous minor concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, all the requested controls are now provided in Figure 4: A scrambled form of the peptide has no impact on microtubule growth and does not pull down tubulin when attached to beads. MCAK as a positive control also potently inhibits microtubule growth.</p><p>We also attached MCAK to beads by the same method used for the peptides, which is covalent attachment via N-terminal amine or lysine side chains. Since the peptides contain no lysine they are attached via the N-terminal amine. MCAK, attached to beads in this way, brings down very little tubulin and does not show the nucleotide-dependent binding previously observed by several labs (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and Wagenbach et al., 2008). This behaviour is likely due to the method of attachment. MCAK may be denatured by the conditions required for covalent attachment to CNBr-activated beads and/or may be bound in an orientation that masks the tubulin binding site which contains several lysine residues. When MCAK is attached to beads in a more controlled way (e.g. to Protein A coated beads via an anti-his tag antibody, Figure 1) it pulls down tubulin when in the ATP-bound state as mimicked by the nonhydrolysable ATP analogue AMPPNP. There is no peptide of MCAK currently known to bind tubulin, the interaction via the major tubulin binding site is nucleotide-dependent and requires the full motor domain.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Tubulin pull down by MCAK attached to sepharose beads using different methods of attachment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MCAK covalently attached to beads via any lysine or N-terminal amine (Figure 4 of this publication).
