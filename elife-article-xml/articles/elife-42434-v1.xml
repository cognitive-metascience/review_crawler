epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mosaic expression of a membrane reporter in nascent mesoderm enabled recording cell shape and trajectory through live imaging. Upon leaving the streak, cells changed shape and extended protrusions of distinct size and abundance depending on the neighboring germ layer, as well as the region of the embryo. Embryonic trajectories were meandrous but directional, while extra-embryonic mesoderm cells showed little net displacement. Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm transcriptomes highlighted distinct guidance, cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix signatures. Specifically, intermediate filaments were highly expressed in extra-embryonic mesoderm, while live imaging for F-actin showed abundance of actin filaments in embryonic mesoderm only. Accordingly, <italic>Rhoa</italic> or <italic>Rac1</italic> conditional deletion in mesoderm inhibited embryonic, but not extra-embryonic mesoderm migration. Overall, this indicates separate cytoskeleton regulation coordinating the morphology and migration of mesoderm subpopulations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42434.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells divide and specialize to form different tissues and organs. Early in development the cells arrange into so-called germ layers, which each produce particular types of tissue. One of these layers, called the mesoderm, develops into the muscles, bones and circulatory system of the embryo. It also contributes to the support structures that feed and protect the embryo, such as the placenta, umbilical cord and yolk sac. If these ‘extra-embryonic’ structures do not develop correctly, the embryo may not grow properly.</p><p>Much of what we know about how the cells of the mesoderm move around to form different tissues comes from studies of species that lay eggs; for example, chicks, frogs and fish. The initial steps of embryo development in these animals are similar to how mammals develop, but bigger differences emerge as the extra-embryonic tissues start to form. Recent methodological advances are now making it possible to dynamically study this later stage of development in live mouse embryos.</p><p>Saykali et al. studied mouse embryos whose mesoderm cells contained a ‘reporter’ that allowed them to be identified when viewed using a microscopy technique known as two-photon live imaging. This approach allows cells to be tracked as they move through living tissue. Saykali et al. found that the mesoderm cells change shape depending on which region of the embryo they are in, and on which germ layer they are next to. The cells that become extra-embryonic are larger and longer, and develop small protrusions. Instead of moving directly to their destinations, they tend to zigzag.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm cells produce different amounts of several proteins, including the distinct types of filaments that act as the cell’s internal skeleton. Mesoderm cells that are destined to become extra-embryonic depend less on signaling proteins called Rho GTPases to move around.</p><p>Knowing how mesoderm cells form extra-embryonic structures will help researchers to understand how problems with these structures can affect how embryos grow. The techniques used by Saykali et al. will also help to design new ways to cultivate mesoderm cells in the laboratory for future experiments. These could, for example, investigate whether human mesoderm cells develop in the same way as mice mesoderm cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>extra-embryonic</kwd><kwd>live Imaging</kwd><kwd>RhoGTPases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDR T008416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Migeotte</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Walloon Excellence in Lifesciences and Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Welbio CR-2015S-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Migeotte</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Erasme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Migeotte</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Erasmus Mundus Phoenix</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saykali</surname><given-names>Bechara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008537</institution-id><institution>Fonds Alice et David van Buuren</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathiah</surname><given-names>Navrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Jaumotte-Demoulin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathiah</surname><given-names>Navrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saykali</surname><given-names>Bechara</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathiah</surname><given-names>Navrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>At gastrulation, mesoderm arises as a migratory germ layer that will participate to both foetal and placental development through region-dependant adaptation of cytoskeleton composition, cell shape and migration mode.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mice, a first separation of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages begins in the blastocyst at embryonic day (E) 3.5 when the trophectoderm is set aside from the inner cell mass. A second step is the segregation of the inner cell mass into the epiblast, the precursor of most fetal cell lineages, and the extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chazaud and Yamanaka, 2016</xref>). At E6, the embryo is cup-shaped and its anterior-posterior axis is defined. It comprises three cell types, arranged in two layers: the inner layer is formed by epiblast, distally, and extra-embryonic ectoderm, proximally; the outer layer, visceral endoderm, covers the entire embryo surface. The primitive streak, site of gastrulation, is formed at E6.25 in the posterior epiblast, at the junction between embryonic and extra-embryonic regions, and subsequently elongates to the distal tip of the embryo. The primitive streak is the region of the embryo where epiblast cells delaminate through epithelial-mesenchymal transition to generate a new population of mesenchymal cells that form the mesoderm and definitive endoderm layers.</p><p>All mesoderm, including the extra-embryonic mesoderm, is of embryonic epiblast origin. At the onset of gastrulation, emerging mesoderm migrates either anteriorly as so-called embryonic mesodermal wings, or proximally as extra-embryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sutherland, 2016</xref>). Cell lineages studies showed that there is little correlation between the position of mesoderm progenitors in the epiblast and the final localization of mesoderm descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawson et al., 1991</xref>). Rather, the distribution of mesoderm subpopulations depends on the temporal order and anterior-posterior location of cell recruitment through the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinder et al., 1999</xref>). Posterior primitive streak cells are the major source of extra-embryonic mesoderm, while cells from middle and anterior primitive streak are mostly destined to the embryo proper. However, there is overlap of fates between cells delaminating at different sites and timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinder et al., 2001</xref>). Extra-embryonic mesoderm contributes to the amnion, allantois, chorion, and visceral yolk sac. It has important functions in maternal-fetal protection and communication, as well as in primitive erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watson and Cross, 2005</xref>). Embryonic mesoderm separates into lateral plate, intermediate, paraxial and axial mesoderm, and ultimately gives rise to cranial and cardiac mesenchyme, blood vessels and hematopoietic progenitors, urogenital system, muscles and bones, among others. Endoderm precursors co-migrate with mesoderm progenitors in the wings and undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition to intercalate into the visceral endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viotti et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mesoderm migration mechanisms have mostly been studied in fly, fish, frog and chicken embryos. During fly gastrulation, mesodermal cells migrate as a collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2012</xref>). In the fish <italic>Fundulus heteroclitus</italic>, deep cells of the dorsal germ ring move as loose clusters with meandering trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trinkaus et al., 1992</xref>). At mid-gastrulation, zebrafish lateral mesoderm cells are not elongated and migrate as individuals along indirect paths, while by late gastrulation, cells are more polarized and their trajectories are straighter, resulting in higher speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jessen et al., 2002</xref>). In zebrafish prechordal plate, all cells have similar migration properties but they require contact between each other for directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumortier et al., 2012</xref>). In chick, cells migrate in a very directional manner at high density. Cells are continually in close proximity, even though they frequently make and break contacts with their neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chuai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Relatively little is known about mesoderm migration in mice because most mutant phenotypes with mesodermal defects result from anomalies in primitive streak formation, mesoderm specification, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>), precluding further insight into cell migration mechanisms. We previously identified a role for the Rho GTPase Rac1, a mediator of cytoskeletal reorganization, in mesoderm migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Migeotte et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent advances in mouse embryo culture and live imaging have overcome the challenge of maintaining adequate embryo growth and morphology while performing high-resolution imaging. It facilitated the uncovering of the precise spatial and temporal regulation of cellular processes and disclosed that inaccurate conclusions had sometimes been drawn from static analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viotti et al., 2014</xref>). Live imaging of mouse embryos bearing a reporter for nuclei has pointed towards individual rather than collective migration in the mesodermal wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichikawa et al., 2013</xref>). Very recently, a spectacular adaptive light sheet imaging approach allowed reconstructing fate maps at the single cell level from gastrulation to early organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDole et al., 2018</xref>). However, little is known about how mesoderm populations regulate their shape and migration mechanisms as they travel across distinct embryo regions to fulfill their respective fates.</p><p>Here, high-resolution live imaging of nascent mesoderm expressing membrane-bound GFP was used to define the dynamics of mesoderm cell morphology and its trajectories. Mesoderm cells exhibited a variety of cell shape changes determined by their spatial localization in the embryo, and the germ layer they were in contact with. The embryonic mesoderm migration path was meandrous but directional, and depended on the Rho GTPases Rhoa and Rac1. Extra-embryonic mesoderm movement was, strikingly, GTPases independent. Transcriptomes of different mesoderm populations uncovered specific sets of guidance, adhesion, cytoskeleton and matrix components, which may underlie the remarkable differences in cell behavior between mesoderm subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mesoderm migration mode and cell shape differ in embryonic versus extra-embryonic regions</title><p>The T box transcription factor <italic>Brachyury</italic> is expressed in posterior epiblast cells that form the primitive streak, maintained in cells that delaminate through the streak, then down-regulated once cells progress anteriorly in the mesodermal wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilkinson et al., 1990</xref>).

Lateral views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) allowed comparing cells as they migrated laterally in mesodermal wings, or proximally in extra-embryonic region. Anterior views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) showed cell movement towards the midline. The imaging time frame did not allow following individual cells from their exit at the primitive streak to their final destination. However, the trajectories we acquired (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) fitted with the fate maps built using cellular labeling or transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinder et al., 2001</xref>), or adaptive light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDole et al., 2018</xref>). The first converted (GFP positive) cells in ES embryos dissected around E6.75 usually left the posterior site of the primitive streak to migrate towards the extra-embryonic compartment. Embryonic migration started almost simultaneously, and migration towards both regions proceeded continuously.</p><p>Strikingly, migration behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) and cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) were different depending on the region cells migrated into. In the embryonic region, mesoderm cells had a global posterior to anterior path, even though they zigzagged in all directions (proximal-distal, left-right, and even anterior-posterior). Cells did not migrate continuously, but showed alternations of tumbling behavior with straighter displacement, as described for zebrafish mesendoderm progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diz-Muñoz et al., 2016</xref>). Embryonic mesoderm cells from ES/MS embryos tracked for 2.5 hr moved at a mean speed of 0.65 µm/min to cover approximately 90 µm and travel a net distance of 40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a'</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Cells in the extra-embryonic region moved slightly slower (0.45 µm/min) to do approximately 70 µm, but their net displacement (20 µm) and straightness (0.3) were significantly smaller, reflecting trajectories with no obvious directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a'</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42434.010</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Tracking details for embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm.</title><p>Cells were tracked for approximately 150 min.

Interestingly, the density of thin protrusions was much higher in cells in contact with the visceral endoderm.

Intercalation of prospective definitive endoderm cells in the visceral endoderm layer, which occurs from LS stage onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viotti et al., 2014</xref>), was very rarely observed, either because Brachyury does not label endoderm progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</xref>), or because the <italic>T</italic>-Cre transgenic line does not bear the regulatory elements driving T expression in prospective endoderm. Cells in tight clusters surrounded by other mesoderm cells in the wings had a smoother contour, with the caveat that protrusions couldn’t be visualized between cells of similar membrane color.

The transcriptional network and signaling pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramkumar and Anderson, 2011</xref>). However, pre-gastrulation embryo geometry varies widely between species, which has important consequences on interactions between germ layers and mechanical constrains on nascent mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams and Solnica-Krezel, 2017</xref>). Live imaging of mouse embryo has allowed recording posterior epiblast rearrangements, as well as cell passage through the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). Contrary to the chick embryo, there is no global epiblast movement towards the primitive streak in the mouse. However, cell shape changes, including apical constriction and basal rounding, are similar. Morphological data on mouse mesoderm cells acquired through scanning electron microscopy of whole mount samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Migeotte et al., 2011</xref>), and transmission electron microscopy of embryo sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegelman and Bennett, 1974</xref>) revealed an array of stellate individual cells linked by filopodia containing a lattice of microfilaments.</p><p>We took advantage of mosaic labeling of nascent mesoderm to define the dynamics of cell shape changes associated with mesoderm migration. Cells just outside the streak retracted the long apical protrusion and adopted a round shape with numerous filopodia making contacts with adjacent, but also more distant mesoderm cells. In mesodermal wings, cells close to the epiblast were more loosely apposed, and extended fewer filopodia towards its basal membrane, compared to cells adjacent to the visceral endoderm, which were tightly packed and displayed numerous filopodia pointing to the visceral endoderm basal membrane.</p><p>Cells travelling in a posterior to anterior direction towards the midline displayed long protrusions, up to twice the cell body size, which extended, retracted, occasionally bifurcated, several times before the cell body itself initiated movement, suggesting an explorative behavior. Remarkably, extension of long protrusions was not limited to the first row of cells. Migration was irregular in time and space, as cells often stopped and tumbled, and displayed meandrous trajectories. After division, cells remained attached by thin protrusions. Contrary to neural crest cells, mesoderm cells did not show contact inhibition of locomotion. Cells in close proximity tended to follow parallel paths.</p><p>Extra-embryonic mesoderm first accumulates between extra-embryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm at the posterior side of the embryo, leading to formation of the amniochorionic fold that bulges into the proamniotic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2011</xref>). This fold expands, and lateral extensions converge at the midline. Accumulation and coalescence of lacunae between extra-embryonic mesoderm cells of the fold generate a large cavity closed distally by the amnion, and proximally by the chorion. At LS stage, extra-embryonic mesoderm forms the allantoic bud, precursor to the umbilical cord, in continuity with the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inman and Downs, 2007</xref>). Extra-embryonic mesoderm cells had striking differences in morphology and migration mode, compared to embryonic mesoderm cells. They were larger and more elongated, displayed fewer filopodia, and almost no large protrusions. They migrated at a similar speed, but in a much more tortuous fashion, resulting in little net displacement.</p><p>Direction cues could come from cell-matrix contact, homotypic or heterotypic (with epiblast or visceral endoderm) cell-cell interaction, diffuse gradients of morphogens, and/or mechanical constraints. Transcriptome data were compatible with roles for guidance molecules such as Netrin1 and Eph receptors in directing mesoderm migration. <italic>Epha4</italic> was strongly expressed in the PS and mesoderm, particularly in the embryonic region. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, interaction of Epha4 in mesoderm and Efnb3 in ectoderm allows separating germ layers during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Epha1</italic> and its ligands <italic>Efna1</italic> and <italic>3</italic> had partially overlapping, but essentially reciprocal compartmentalized expression patterns during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffy et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we found abundant <italic>Epha1</italic> expression in somites and presomitic mesoderm at E8.5 (not shown). Interestingly, <italic>Epha1</italic> KO mice present a kinked tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duffy et al., 2008</xref>). The specific and dynamic expression patterns of <italic>Epha4</italic>, <italic>Epha1</italic>, and their respective ligands during gastrulation are compatible with roles in germ layers separation, including nascent mesoderm specification and migration. Identification of those potential guidance cues will help design strategies to better understand how mesoderm subpopulations reach their respective destinations.</p><p>Visualization and modification of Rho GTPases activity through FRET sensors and photoactivable variants has shed light on their fundamental role during cell migration in in vivo contexts, such as migration of fish primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kardash et al., 2010</xref>) or <italic>Drosophila</italic> border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Study of a epiblast-specific mutant showed that Rac1 acts upstream of the WAVE complex to promote branching of actin filaments, lamellipodia formation, and migration of nascent mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Migeotte et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, extra-embryonic mesoderm cells did not display leading edge protrusions, and <italic>Rac1</italic> and <italic>Rhoa</italic> mesoderm-specific mutants were deficient for embryonic, but not extra-embryonic mesoderm migration. Interestingly, in embryos mutants for <italic>Fgfr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</xref>) or <italic>Fgf8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 1999</xref>), extra-embryonic mesoderm populations are almost normal, while embryonic mesoderm derivatives are severely affected. Measurement of Rho GTPases activity in those mutants would allow exploring the possibility that Rac1 and Rhoa act downstream of the FGF pathway to promote mesoderm migration, as proposed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Impel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition, F-actin filaments were more abundant in embryonic, compared to extra-embryonic, mesoderm, reinforcing the hypothesis that they might rely on distinct cytoskeletal rearrangements. Intermediate filaments are major effectors of cell stiffness, cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, as well as individual and collective migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Members of type I and II keratin families form obligate heterodimers, which assemble into filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loschke et al., 2015</xref>). Type II Keratins 7 and 8, and type I Keratins 18 and 19 are the first to be expressed during embryogenesis. Combined Keratins 8/19 and 18/19 deletions cause lethality at E10 attributed to fragility of giant trophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hesse et al., 2000</xref>). Deletion of the entire type II Keratins cluster results in growth retardation starting at E8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vijayaraj et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, knockdown of Keratin 8 in frog mesendoderm highlighted a role for intermediate filaments in coordinating collectively migrating cells. Keratin-depleted cells were more contractile, displayed misdirected protrusions and large focal adhesions, and exerted higher traction stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sonavane et al., 2017</xref>). Transcripts for <italic>Keratins 8</italic> and <italic>18</italic>, as well as <italic>Vimentin,</italic> were enriched in extra-embryonic, compared to embryonic mesoderm. While Vimentin was present in all mesoderm, Keratin 8 was only detectable in extra-embryonic mesoderm. An antagonistic relationship between Vimentin intermediate filaments and Rac1-mediated lamellipodia formation has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>), and a similar opposition may exist between Rac1 activity and keratin intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2012</xref>). Extra-embryonic mesoderm cells' elongated morphology, paucity in lamellipodia, and lack of directional migration may thus result from their high content in intermediate filaments, and low Rho GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The recent development of a K8-YFP reporter mouse strain for intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>), and the availability of reliable Rho GTPases FRET sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spiering and Hodgson, 2011</xref>), will be instrumental in dissecting their relationship in mesoderm.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42434.044</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm cells show distinct shape, trajectory, Rho GTPases dependency, and cytoskeletal composition during gastrulation in the mouse embryo.</title><p>In the extra-embryonic region (top), mesoderm cells are stretched, with higher Keratin 8 and Vimentin abundance.

We found that embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm populations, both arising by epithelial-mesenchymal transition at the primitive streak, display distinct shape dynamics, migration modes, Rho GTPase dependency, cytoskeletal composition, as well as expression of different sets of guidance, adhesion, and matrix molecules. Landmark experiments in the 1990 s showed that the fate of a mesoderm cell depends on the time and place at which it emerges from the primitive streak. We have unveiled morphological and behavioral specificities of mesoderm populations through whole embryo live imaging, and provided a molecular framework to understand how cells with distinct fates adapt to, and probably modify, their tridimensional environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Protocol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>T</italic>-Cre</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18708576">18708576</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3811072">MGI:3811072</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12617844">12617844</ext-link>;

Transcripts were quantified using the featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) software tool using the UCSC RefSeq gene annotations (exons only, gene as meta features). Normalized expression levels were estimated using the EdgeR rpm function and converted to log2 FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) after resetting low FPKMs to one to remove background effect. Differential analysis was performed using the edgeR method (quasi-likelihood tests) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>). The edgeR model was constructed using a double pairwise comparison between embryonic mesoderm versus extra-embryonic mesoderm at two different time points (MS and LS). First, the count data were fitted to a quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model using the R glmQLFit method. To identify differentially expressed genes, null hypothesis EM_E7.0==EEM_E7.0 and EM_E7.25==EEM_E7.25 were tested using the empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-tests (glmQLFTest method) applied to the fitted data. The F-test P-values were then corrected for multi-testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustment method. Transcripts with a greater than background level of expression (mean log2 count per million &gt;0), an absolute fold change &gt;2, and a low false discovery rate (FDR &lt;0.05) were considered as differentially expressed.</p><p>The sample visualization map was produced by applying the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) dimensionality reduction method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>) to log2 FPKM expression levels (all transcripts). The R tSNE method from 'Rtsne' library was applied without performing the initial PCA reduction and by setting the perplexity parameter to 2. The heatmap was produced using the R heatmap.2 methods using the brewer.pal color palette. GO analysis was performed using the DAVID software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the animal house, FACS, and light microscopy (LiMiF) core facilities at the ULB (Erasme Campus), and the Brussels Interuniversity Genomics High Throughput core (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brightcore.be">www.brightcore.be</ext-link>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct mesoderm migration phenotypes in extra-embryonic and embryonic regions of the early mouse embryo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Margot Williams (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Using beautiful in vivo imaging, the manuscript describes migratory behaviors of individual internalized embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm cells in gastrulating mouse embryo, and reveals differences between them. The differences in migration, cell shape, actin organization and protrusive activities between embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm (ExM) are correlated with RNA-seq dataset that reveals interesting differences in gene expression.</p><p>The authors first provide evidence of reduced speed, displacement, and straightness of ExM migration compared with embryonic mesoderm (EM), and correlate these with quantitative and qualitative differences in cell shape and number and type of cellular protrusions produced. They then profile gene expression in purified ExM and EM populations to identify possible molecular regulators of the distinct cell behaviors they identified. Differentially expressed genes include those with potential roles in cell migration, including adhesion, extracellular matrix, guidance, and cytoskeleton genes. Notably, genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton tend to be reduced in ExM, while those encoding intermediate filaments are increased in ExM.</p><p>In light of the observed differences between cytoskeleton and migratory behavior between ExM and EM, the authors evaluate the role of Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1 in mesoderm migration by conditional loss-of-function in cells traversing the primitive streak. They find that migration of ExM is less affected than EM by loss of both GTPases, demonstrating distinct molecular regulation of these two mesoderm populations. Based on these functional studies, the authors argue that embryonic but not extra-embryonic mesoderm depends on Rho GTPases, indicating reliance on distinct cytoskeletal rearrangements.</p><p>It has long been recognized that genetic regulation of ExM migration is distinct from that of embryonic mesoderm, but the cellular and molecular basis of this distinction was largely unknown. This is an interesting, concise and carefully conducted study that sheds light on this issue. The descriptive aspects of the manuscript are novel and should be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readership. The RNA-seq data set, in particular for the ExM, provides valuable data for future analyses and intra as well as inter-species comparisons, especially now when aspects of mouse and human gastrulation are studied in synthetic in vitro scenarios. For these reasons, the reviewers feel this work makes important advances in our understanding of gastrulation morphogenesis. However, there are some missed opportunities that could have provided exciting data regarding the relationship between mesodermal cells and surrounding tissues, in particular, the visceral endoderm. There are additional issues (listed below) that the authors should address before this report is published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been shown that the proximal third of the visceral endoderm cells overlying the epiblast in the posterior region remain relatively coherent forming a crescent that tapers anteriorly (Kwon et al., 2008). This region has been proposed by Kwon and co-workers to be a signaling center. This area of visceral endoderm appears to overlay the area of spread of embryonic mesodermal cells in the proximal posterior side of the embryo. Is there a relationship between the movements of posterior mesoderm and posterior visceral endoderm? This issue should be at least discussed by the authors, if addressing it experimentally would extend the revision beyond 2 months.</p><p>2) Kwon et al. (2008) also argued that distal visceral endoderm cells intercalate with definitive endoderm cells. Was this phenomenon evident in the authors' experiments?</p><p>3) The laboratory of Karen Downs has argued that posterior visceral endoderm cells located in the extra-embryonic region exfoliate and contribute to extra-embryonic mesoderm derivatives like the allantois (Rodriguez and Downs, 2017). Was this phenomenon observed in the present studies? Are GTPases not required for extraembryonic mesoderm migration, or simply are there different genetic redundancies between the two cell types? There should be at least some discussion regarding upstream regulators of Rho/Rac1 in embryonic mesoderm.</p><p>4) Several figures contain graphs depicting the number of filopodia per cell. Is this filopodia per unit time? Or at a single time point? It just seems unrealistic that a mesoderm cell would produce only 7 filopodia over the course of several hours of imaging. This could be the result of the imaging interval, though. Cell protrusions are extremely dynamic, and one stack every 20 minutes likely does not provide sufficient temporal resolution required for this type of quantification. Could the authors please clarify how such measurements were made?</p><p>5) In gene expression profiling experiments, EM and ExM samples are compared to &quot;non-mesoderm controls&quot; – what types of tissues are these? And why do they cluster with embryonic mesoderm but not the ExM?</p><p>6) When describing the results of these profiling experiments, the authors discuss the enrichment of certain GO terms and gene clusters among differentially expressed genes, but it is not clear whether genes associated with these terms/clusters exhibit increased or decreased expression in ExM vs. EM. This is even the case in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, where the p value of each enriched term is presented, but no information is given about which is increased or decreased in ExM or EM.</p><p>7) A major conclusion of this report is that &quot;extra-embryonic mesoderm movement was… GTPase dependent&quot;. However, no quantification is provided in support of this critical finding. Although ExM cells can be seen in the extra-embryonic region of RhoA and Rac1; T-cre conditional KO embryos, it was not determined whether the number of these cells is comparable to control embryos, and whether they exhibit similar dynamics during migration. The authors have demonstrated their ability to quantify size and number of protrusions, migration speed, persistence etc. of migrating mesoderm cells. Cell trajectories and migration speed of ExM cells should be analyzed for Rac1 and RhoA mutant ExM cells and compared to wild type, as done in Table 1.</p><p>8) The T(s)-Cre transgenic line was used to drive cre expression in the primitive streak. In this line, cre expression is driven by the Brachyury (T) promoter. T, however, is also expressed in extra-embryonic ectoderm (Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005; Perea-Gomez et al., 2004). I assume that in T(s)-cre embryos, cre is not expressed in the extra-embryonic ectoderm. If this is the case, the authors need to stress that the transgene is only expressed in the primitive streak. Also, please stress that it is a random insertion transgenic line not a knock-in line into the T locus that inactivates T.</p><p>9) &quot;Posterior views (Figure 1A) showed proximal to distal primitive streak extension and rounding of cells exiting the streak&quot;. Epiblast cells are elongated in apical-basal direction. In this image, indeed shapes of the cells in the midline appear round. It is not clear however, whether this represents a cross-section of elongated cells or a true round shape in 3D. Additional images or information should be provided to support this conclusion. In addition, is this confirming earlier observations or a novel observations of the authors?</p><p>10) &quot;Extra-embryonic cells were stretched, sometimes spanning the entire widths of the embryo, and twice larger&quot;. Could the authors comment on their third dimension? Were they flatter compared to embryonic cells?</p><p>It is also striking that these extraembryonic cells have twice the volume of embryonic mesodermal cells (Table 2). What is the reason for this difference? Are the precursors in the primitive streak different? Or fewer cell divisions in the extra-embryonic population?</p><p>11) In general, the manuscript would be improved by clearly stating the questions motivating individual lines of experiments and providing conclusions. For example, the title of this section is &quot;Cell-cell communication within the mesodermal layer&quot;, yet no question is posed. The results describe relative migratory behaviors of daughter cells in mesodermal cell layer. In the second part of this section the behavior of mesodermal cells upon contact that usually not result in contact inhibition is contrasted to that previously reported for neural crest cells. One concern about this section is why it is titled &quot;cell-cell communication&quot; as there is no direct evidence for communication between cells apart from cells migrating &quot;in the same direction, remaining close to one another, and staying linked by thin projections.&quot; Second, the behavior of daughter cells and cells close to one another at the beginning of a time-lapse should be compared. Is the described behavior of two daughter cells unusual or is it typical for two cells that happen to be close to one another? Finally, there is no conclusion at the end of the section.</p><p>12) The findings on the migratory cell behaviors of mesodermal cells should be also better presented in the context of gastrulation studies in other systems and the work in the mouse. Whereas the authors emphasize collective cell behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other vertebrates, meandering migration of mesodermal cells was documented in the <italic>Fundulus</italic> fish by pioneering studies of John Trinkaus and in zebrafish by studies from Solnica-Krezel laboratory, as well as in the chick embryo by studies from Weijer laboratory. In particular the meandering directed migration of individual mesodermal cells with protrusive activity is highly similar to that described by Jessen et al., 2002 in the zebrafish gastrula. Therefore, Migeotte and colleagues demonstrate that in mouse embryo, mesoderm gastrulation movements entail directed migration on embryonic mesodermal cells in addition to the well described intercalation movements of axial mesoderm.</p><p>Furthermore, while reflecting upon differences between regulation of embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm migration, it may be helpful to note results from previous studies that also observed critical differences in these two populations:</p><p>A) Embryonic mesoderm fails to migrate away from the PS in FGF8 and FGFR1 mutant mouse embryos, but extraembryonic mesoderm can migrate away (Yamaguchi et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1999).</p><p>B) Mutations affecting BMP signaling, including BMP4, Pace/Furin, and BMP receptors prevent formation of an embryonic primitive streak, but allow for production of some extraembryonic mesoderm (Gu et al., 1999; Song et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2002; Winnier et al., 1995).</p><p>Also, the authors note on the presence of tumbling behavior alternating with straighter displacement, which is strikingly similar to &quot;tumble and run&quot; movements described in zebrafish embryos (Diz-Munoz et al., 2016). This similarity is worth noting and citing.</p><p>References:</p><p>Perea-Gomez A, Camus A, Moreau A, Grieve K, Moneron G, Dubois A, Cibert C, Collignon J.

The manuscript significantly advances our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of mesoderm migration during mouse gastrulation, and reveals interesting cellular and molecular mechanisms between embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm migration.

This region has been proposed by Kwon and co-workers to be a signaling center. This area of visceral endoderm appears to overlay the area of spread of embryonic mesodermal cells in the proximal posterior side of the embryo. Is there a relationship between the movements of posterior mesoderm and posterior visceral endoderm? This issue should be at least discussed by the authors, if addressing it experimentally would extend the revision beyond 2 months.</p></disp-quote><p>Visceral endoderm cells are marked with membrane Tomato. We designed the condition of two-photon live imaging in order to get an optimal GFP signal, and just enough Tomato to get the anatomy of the embryo, to reduce phototoxicity. Due to the relatively weak Tomato signal and the morphology of the posterior visceral endoderm cells, which tend to be rather flat, we were not able to reliably track visceral endoderm cells movements.</p><p>We added a reference to the potential signaling function of the posterior visceral endoderm proposed by Kwon et al. (subsection “Mesoderm cells have distinct morphology depending on their interaction with different germ layers”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Kwon et al. (2008) also argued that distal visceral endoderm cells intercalate with definitive endoderm cells. Was this phenomenon evident in the authors' experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Cells crossing the streak to become definitive endoderm do not appear to express Cre, as we very rarely observed GFP positive cells in the endoderm layer, even when looking at later time points (E7.75).</p><p>The transgenic T(s)::Cre line was engineered using a construct composed of regulatory elements of the Brachyury gene directing gene expression in the primitive streak fused to a Cre cDNA. It does not recapitulate all aspects of endogenous T expression. This observation fits with the characterization of the line published in Feller et al., 2008: in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, a T(s)::Cre; Rosa26-LacZ embryo at head fold stage has no visible blue cells in the endoderm.</p><p>Alternatively, Burtscher and Lickert (2009) described anti-parallel gradients of FoxA2 and T along the streak, so it is possible that T might not label endoderm progenitors, just midline and mesoderm. We have not done the experiment to distinguish those two possibilities.</p><p>We clarified the design of the T-Cre transgenic line (subsection “Mesoderm migration mode and cell shape differ in embryonic versus extra-embryonic regions”, first paragraph), stated that we did not visualize definitive endoderm, and proposed explanations (subsection “Mesoderm cells have distinct morphology depending on their interaction with different germ layers”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The laboratory of Karen Downs has argued that posterior visceral endoderm cells located in the extra-embryonic region exfoliate and contribute to extra-embryonic mesoderm derivatives like the allantois (Rodriguez and Downs, 2017). Was this phenomenon observed in the present studies? Are GTPases not required for extraembryonic mesoderm migration, or simply are there different genetic redundancies between the two cell types? There should be at least some discussion regarding upstream regulators of Rho/Rac1 in embryonic mesoderm.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, Tomato expressing cells could not be visualized with as much clarity, which rendered their tracking unreliable. In addition, experiments suggesting delamination of posterior visceral endoderm cells to become extra-embryonic mesoderm were mostly conducted from the Zero Bud stage onwards, while most of our recordings were performed between Early Streak and Zero Bud stages, so we would not have been in the best position to observe this phenomenon.</p><p>Indeed, our data cannot differentiate between absence of dependency on RhoGTPases, and different redundancy. We have corrected this in the manuscript (subsection “Extra-embryonic mesoderm migration is Rho GTPases independent”, last paragraph). We have also proposed that RhoGTPases might be downstream of Fgf signaling (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Several figures contain graphs depicting the number of filopodia per cell. Is this filopodia per unit time? Or at a single time point? It just seems unrealistic that a mesoderm cell would produce only 7 filopodia over the course of several hours of imaging. This could be the result of the imaging interval, though. Cell protrusions are extremely dynamic, and one stack every 20 minutes likely does not provide sufficient temporal resolution required for this type of quantification. Could the authors please clarify how such measurements were made?</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed confusing. It is &quot;filopodia per cell per time point&quot;. It has been clarified in the legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In gene expression profiling experiments, EM and ExM samples are compared to &quot;non-mesoderm controls&quot; – what types of tissues are these? And why do they cluster with embryonic mesoderm but not the ExM?</p></disp-quote><p>The non-mesoderm controls contain a mixture of all non-GFP cells, which include extra-embryonic ectoderm, epiblast, visceral endoderm, and probably some non-labeled mesoderm cells. We did not analyze those data in detail, as results were quite heterogeneous between samples, likely due to unequal proportions of cells from each population in different samples, as we did not collect all non-GFP cells from each pool of embryos. Embryonic controls tend to be closer to embryonic mesoderm indeed, probably because the majority of the cells are likely to be of epiblast origin. Since data from those samples were not discussed, we eliminated them from the tSNE plot and Table 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) When describing the results of these profiling experiments, the authors discuss the enrichment of certain GO terms and gene clusters among differentially expressed genes, but it is not clear whether genes associated with these terms/clusters exhibit increased or decreased expression in ExM vs. EM. This is even the case in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, where the p value of each enriched term is presented, but no information is given about which is increased or decreased in ExM or EM.</p></disp-quote><p>GO had been performed based on the list of differentially regulated genes, whichever the direction. The QLF list has now been divided in two according to the region of higher expression, and GO has been performed based on those two lists. This analysis is displayed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, and describe in the text (subsection “Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm molecular signatures”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A major conclusion of this report is that &quot;extra-embryonic mesoderm movement was… GTPase dependent&quot;. However, no quantification is provided in support of this critical finding. Although ExM cells can be seen in the extra-embryonic region of RhoA and Rac1; T-cre conditional KO embryos, it was not determined whether the number of these cells is comparable to control embryos, and whether they exhibit similar dynamics during migration. The authors have demonstrated their ability to quantify size and number of protrusions, migration speed, persistence etc. of migrating mesoderm cells. Cell trajectories and migration speed of ExM cells should be analyzed for Rac1 and RhoA mutant ExM cells and compared to wild type, as done in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to consolidate the data pointing to the difference of dependency on GTPases, we have added quantitative analysis of the live imaging data.</p><p>The number of GFP positive cells at the early stages of gastrulation, when tracking of cells shape and speed could be done with precision, was quite variable among wild-type embryos, which we attribute to the mosaicism of T-Cre expression. Comparing cell numbers between wild-type and mutant embryos was thus not practical.</p><p>We could however segment cells in mutant embryos, and record quantitative data on cell shape and movements. We segmented mesoderm cells in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of mutants. It was difficult to perfectly register mutant embryos due to their irregular shape. Because of the relatively low number of cells available, we tracked them for as long as possible, which resulted in different times of observation. Therefore, we could not directly compare net and travel displacements. We could nonetheless observe a significant decrease in embryonic, but not extra-embryonic mesoderm cells speed for both Rho and Rac mutants, compared to wild-type embryos. The data has been added to Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1—source data 1 and 2), and is described in the manuscript (subsection “Extra-embryonic mesoderm migration is Rho GTPases independent”, last paragraph).</p><p>In addition, we performed live imaging of a Rac1fl/ko; mTmG; Sox2-Cre embryo, and confirmed the presence of GFP positive extra-embryonic mesoderm cells dispersed in the extra-embryonic region, while GFP positive mesoderm cells were confined in a bulge adjacent to the primitive streak in the embryonic region (subsection “Extra-embryonic mesoderm migration is Rho GTPases independent”, last paragraph). Those images have been added to Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The T(s)-Cre transgenic line was used to drive cre expression in the primitive streak. In this line, cre expression is driven by the Brachyury (T) promoter. T, however, is also expressed in extra-embryonic ectoderm (Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005; Perea-Gomez et al., 2004). I assume that in T(s)-cre embryos, cre is not expressed in the extra-embryonic ectoderm. If this is the case, the authors need to stress that the transgene is only expressed in the primitive streak. Also, please stress that it is a random insertion transgenic line not a knock-in line into the T locus that inactivates T.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to response to point 2. We have examined mTmG; T-cre embryos between E6.25 and E6.5, and have not identified any GFP positive cells in the extra-embryonic ectoderm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;Posterior views (Figure 1A) showed proximal to distal primitive streak extension and rounding of cells exiting the streak&quot;. Epiblast cells are elongated in apical-basal direction. In this image, indeed shapes of the cells in the midline appear round. It is not clear however, whether this represents a cross-section of elongated cells or a true round shape in 3D. Additional images or information should be provided to support this conclusion. In addition, is this confirming earlier observations or a novel observations of the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>It represents a cross-section of bottle shape cells in their round portion. This confirms earlier observation, in particular those of Williams et al. It has been made clear in the text (subsection “Mesoderm migration mode and cell shape differ in embryonic versus extra-embryonic regions”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) &quot;Extra-embryonic cells were stretched, sometimes spanning the entire widths of the embryo, and twice larger&quot;. Could the authors comment on their third dimension? Were they flatter compared to embryonic cells? It is also striking that these extraembryonic cells have twice the volume of embryonic mesodermal cells (Table 2). What is the reason for this difference? Are the precursors in the primitive streak different? Or fewer cell divisions in the extra-embryonic population?</p></disp-quote><p>Extra-embryonic cells were larger and more elongated. The increase in volume was larger than the increase in surface, which indicates they were not flatter.</p><p>We quantified cell divisions in time-lapse recordings. Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm cells were observed over an average of 360 min from 4 different embryos at Mid Streak stage and division events were recorded. Cells migrating close to embryonic/extra-embryonic interface were not taken into consideration to avoid misallocation. Division events counts were normalized over total number of GFP positive cells per region. We found indeed a higher frequency of division in embryonic, compared to extra-embryonic mesoderm. This data has been added to the text (subsection “Mesoderm migration mode and cell shape differ in embryonic versus extra-embryonic regions”, fourth paragraph) and is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In general, the manuscript would be improved by clearly stating the questions motivating individual lines of experiments and providing conclusions.

In the embryonic region, paired mesoderm cells traveled a similar distance over 152 min (net displacement ratio: 0.88 ± 0.03, n=13 pairs from 4 embryos), in the same direction (angle: 9.9° ± 2.77). Travel displacement ratio and final distance between paired cells were 0.75 ± 0.04 and 15.2 µm ± 3.84 µm, respectively (Figure 3—source data 3). All values were similar to what was observed for daughter cells displacements, so indeed the behavior of daughter cells resembles that of two cells that happen to be close to one another. This data is included in the third paragraph of the subsection “Impact of cell-cell contact on trajectory within the mesoderm layer”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The findings on the migratory cell behaviors of mesodermal cells should be also better presented in the context of gastrulation studies in other systems and the work in the mouse.

Mutations affecting BMP signaling, including BMP4, Pace/Furin, and BMP receptors prevent formation of an embryonic primitive streak, but allow for production of some extraembryonic mesoderm (Gu et al., 1999; Song et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2002; Winnier et al. 1995).</p></disp-quote><p>In the ActRIA mutant (Gu et al., 1999), there is no primitive streak, and some mesenchymal cells in the extra-embryonic region (identified by morphology, not markers).

In the BMP4 KO (Winnier et al., 1995), there is also no streak, and some small amount of extra-embryonic mesoderm (also identified by morphology). We are afraid the comparison might be confusing here, as due to absence of the primitive streak the phenomenon is likely to differ. The extra-embryonic mesoderm cells observed could arise from another layer (cf. Rodriguez and Downs, 2017). Furin/Pace 4 double mutants are reduced in size at E7.5, there is no amnion, allantois or chorion, and some mesoderm expressing FgF8 and Lhx1 bulges into the cavity, but markers of extra-embryonic mesoderm are not shown (Beck et al., 2002).</p><p>Therefore we would rather not include those references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors note on the presence of tumbling behavior alternating with straighter displacement, which is strikingly similar to &quot;tumble and run&quot; movements described in zebrafish embryos (Diz-Munoz et al., 2016).
