In this study, we investigated differentiation-induced transformations in MSC cellular and nuclear biophysical properties and queried their role in mechanosensation. Our data show that nuclei in differentiated bovine and human MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical-loading-induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the ‘stiff’ differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the ‘soft’ undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. Interestingly, dynamic loading of undifferentiated MSCs, in the absence of soluble differentiation factors, stiffened and condensed the nucleus, and increased mechanosensitivity more rapidly than soluble factors. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanostat to modulate cellular mechanosensation during differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

(MSCs) are used in a variety of regenerative applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco et al., 2013</xref>). While considerable work has shown the importance of soluble differentiation factors in MSC lineage specification, recent studies have also highlighted that physical signals from the microenvironment, including substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engler et al., 2006</xref>), cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>), and dynamic mechanical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2010a</xref>) can influence fate decisions. However, the manner in which soluble and physical cues are integrated to inform lineage specification and commitment is only just beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guilak et al., 2009</xref>). One potentially confounding feature is that the physical properties of MSCs themselves likely change coincident with lineage specification, and such changes might alter cellular perception of super-imposed mechanical perturbations that arise from the microenvironment.</p><p>Strain transfer to (and deformation of) the nucleus has been proposed as a direct link between mechanical inputs from the microenvironment and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). The cytoskeleton forms a mechanically continuous network within the cell and transmits extracellular mechanical signals from sites of matrix adhesion to the nucleus through specialized proteins that comprise the linker of nucleus and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haque et al., 2006</xref>). These connections allow for direct transfer of mechanical signals to the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martins et al., 2012</xref>) annscription upregulation viad can regulate intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driscoll et al., 2015</xref>). Chromatin remodeling induced by mechanical signals depends in part on a pre-tensed (contractile) actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heo et al., 2016</xref>) and can regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tajik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shivashankar, 2011</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that changes in cytoskeletal organization, connectedness to the nuclear envelope, and pre-tension in the acto-myosin network all impact how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals.</p><p>Since the nucleus is the stiffest of organelles, changes in nuclear architecture might also impact how forces are transmitted through the cell. It is well established that chromatin condensation increases nuclear stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahl et al., 2005</xref>), as do changes in the amount and distribution of other intra-nuclear filamentous proteins, including the lamin protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho and Lammerding, 2012</xref>). For example, nuclear lamins stabilize and stiffen the nuclear envelope and are regulated both by differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lammerding et al., 2006</xref>) and the micro-elasticity of the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swift et al., 2013</xref>). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking lamin A/C (LMAC) have aberrant nuclear morphologies and exaggerated nuclear deformation in response to deformation of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lammerding et al., 2004</xref>). Knockdown of LMAC in the nuclei of differentiated cells decreases nuclear stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pajerowski et al., 2007</xref>), while overexpression in neutrophils decreases their ability to pass through micron-sized openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, lamins may contribute to chromatin remodeling, gene silencing, and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrés and González, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mewborn et al., 2010</xref>) via the action of lamin binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson and Foisner, 2010</xref>) and their sequestration of chromatin to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurudatta et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As progenitor cells differentiate, a host of physical changes occur within the cell, depending on cell type and the lineage to which they are being driven. These biophysical changes extend to the nucleus, where for instance ES cell differentiation is accompanied by an increase in chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bártová et al., 2008</xref>) leading to an increase in nuclear stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pajerowski et al., 2007</xref>). Lamins change during differentiation as well; mouse ES cells start expressing high levels of A-type lamin during cell differentiation, suggestive of a role in the maintenance of differentiated state. Further, chromatin reorganization mediated by lamins can enhance heterochromatin formation in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galiová et al., 2008</xref>), and haplo-insufficiency of LMAC can limit certain lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sehgal et al., 2013</xref>). In C2C12 cells, a myogenic cell line, LMAC becomes heavily concentrated at the nuclear periphery with myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Markiewicz et al., 2005</xref>), and mutant isoforms of LMAC can block myogenic lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Markiewicz et al., 2005</xref>). In MSCs, LMAC knockdown promotes adipocyte differentiation (and decreases osteoblast differentiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swift et al., 2013</xref>), while forced expression of the progerin mutant isoform of LMAC increases osteogenic differentiation (and reduces adipogenic differentiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given the centrality of the nucleus in mediating both the transcriptional activities that define lineage specification, as well its role in mediating mechanical force transduction, the objective of this study was to investigate the manner in which both cellular and nuclear biophysical properties change during differentiation and how such changes might impact the mechanobiology of the cell. Specifically, we examined the nuclear mechanics and mechanosensitivity of MSCs as they transited toward a differentiated (fibrochondrogenic) lineage on aligned nanofibrous scaffolds. These scaffolds not only direct new tissue formation for fibrous tissue engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nerurkar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2012</xref>) but also provide a useful template for the application of coordinated cell deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Using this experimental platform, we show that MSC fibrochondrogenesis mediated by soluble factor addition over the long term (days to weeks) increases nuclear stiffness, alters organization of key nuclear structural elements, and as a consequence, changes the manner in which MSCs respond in the short term (seconds to minutes) to dynamic mechanical signals from the microenvironment. We further demonstrate that the repeated application of this short term dynamic mechanical stimulation (as opposed to application of soluble differentiation factors) can itself evoke some of these same changes in nuclear structure and mechanics, and that it does so more rapidly than soluble factor addition alone. This implies that nuclear stiffening may be both a consequence and mediator of differentiation, tuning how progenitor cells interpret mechanical cues from their microenvironment. Such changes may act to first inform, and then reinforce, signals that promote and preserve lineage specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differentiation attenuates stretch-induced nuclear deformation</title><p>When bovine MSCs were exposed to differentiation media (Diff), expression of fibrochondrogenic markers (aggrecan and collagen II) increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Mauck, 2007</xref>). To assess mechanical changes in the nucleus with differentiation, MSCs cultured on aligned scaffolds were subjected to 10% tensile stretch of the scaffold (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heo et al., 2011</xref>]) on specific days over the first 10 days of culture. This terminal assay provides an indirect measure of nuclear stiffness/deformability in the context of a living cell. At early time points, stretch of the scaffold resulted in both cell and nuclear deformation, as evidenced by a marked increase in the absolute nuclear aspect ratio (NAR) values in both control (Ctrl) and differentiation (Diff) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, c</xref>). From day 5 onward, however, there was no change in the NAR in differentiated MSCs (Diff) with scaffold stretch, while nuclear deformation persisted in undifferentiated MSCs (Ctrl, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18207.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MSC differentiation reduces nuclear deformation with applied stretch.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) On day 1, bovine MSCs on aligned nanofibrous scaffolds have elongated nuclei that are oriented in the prevailing fiber direction in both Ctrl and Diff conditions. Application of 10% scaffold stretch increased nuclear deformation under both culture conditions (bottom panels). (<bold>b</bold>) By day 7, application of 10% stretch continued to increase nuclear deformation in Ctrl conditions, while in Diff conditions nuclear deformation was almost completely absent. Scale: 20 µm. (<bold>c</bold>) Quantification of nuclear morphology showed that 10% stretch significantly increased MSC nuclear aspect ratio (NAR) in Ctrl conditions, irrespective of culture duration.

Stiffness was measured in both undifferentiated and differentiated MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref>). In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driscoll et al., 2015</xref> ), we established that nuclear deformation with scaffold stretch was mediated primarily by the tensed actin cytoskeleton and its connections to the nucleus through nesprin-1 giant. Therefore, the peri-nuclear stiffness was measured both with and without the addition of cytochalasin D to remove potential contributions from the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref>). Over seven days, the peri-nuclear stiffness did not change for undifferentiated MSCs (Ctrl), but increased by &gt;50% in differentiated MSCs (Diff, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Treatment with CytoD (and DMSO vehicle) did not alter these values, indicating that stiffening was not due to changes in f-actin organization or mechanics, although this does not rule out potential contributions from other cytoskeletal elements (i.e. microtubules, and intermediate filaments).</p><p>Given that MSC differentiation culminates in abundant matrix production, which may shield the cell from applied stress, we next investigated the potential role of this deposited extracellular matrix on our observation of a loss of nuclear deformation with stretch. To do so, MSCs were removed from the scaffold on day 7 (with trypsin) and re-seeded for 24 hr onto fresh scaffolds. Re-seeded MSCs from both Ctrl and Diff conditions adopted a highly aligned morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Consistent with the above findings, nuclei of these re-seeded differentiated MSCs (Diff) did not deform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g</xref>) when the scaffold was stretched to 10%, while re-seeded undifferentiated MSC nuclei (Ctrl) increased in NAR by ~25%. These findings indicate that deposited extracellular matrix is not responsible for the observed attenuation in nuclear deformation with scaffold stretch. Additionally, we measured substantial increases in cytoskeletal contractility (which would tend to increase rather than decrease nuclear deformation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To interrogate the force generating and strain transfer capacity of the actin cytoskeletal network, MSCs were also cultured on elastomeric micropost array detectors following culture on aligned scaffolds for 7 days in Ctrl or Diff conditions. Traction force increased over the first 16 hr of exposure to TGF-β3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Actin stress fibers were prominent in both undifferentiated (Ctrl) and differentiated (Diff) cells, although differentiated cells induced significantly greater post deflections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Quantification of the total strain energy per cell revealed a significant increase in traction forces (~5 fold) with differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). On scaffolds, blockade of acto-myosin contractility decreased nuclear deformation in undifferentiated cells (Ctrl/Y27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), implicating the need for a patent and contractile cytoskeleton in the transfer of deformation from the scaffold to the nucleus. Taken together, these findings suggest that nuclear stiffening with differentiation dominates the response, resulting in a nucleus that no longer deforms when the cell is stretched.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural reorganization and condensation of the nucleus with MSC differentiation</title><p>To understand the origin of these increases in nuclear stiffness with MSC differentiation, we next interrogated the amount and distribution of nuclear structural proteins, as well as the degree to which chromatin condensed under differentiating conditions.

Given this transformation, we next asked whether such changes in nuclear stiffness alter the degree to which mechanical perturbation of the whole cell regulates signal transduction as a function of differentiation state. To answer this question, cells on scaffolds were stretched rapidly, and short-term changes in calcium signaling were used as an early readout of altered mechanotransduction. Additionally, the stiff nuclei of differentiated MSCs (Diff) were softened via chemical pre-treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerlitz and Bustin, 2010</xref>]) and the soft nuclei of undifferentiated cells (Ctrl) were transiently stiffened by short-term osmotic shock using D-mannitol (DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irianto et al., 2013</xref>) prior to the application of this mechanical perturbation.</p><p>Treatment of differentiated cells with TSA for 24 hr induces chromatin relaxation and, in this study, resulted in a marked reduction in both heterochromatin content and nuclear stiffness (Diff/TSA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>).

To examine the link between nuclear stiffness and cellular mechanotransduction, we next evaluated changes in intracellular calcium in response to a rapidly applied stretch.

The marked upregulation of TGF-β expression is interesting, given that it is a key factor included within differentiation medium.

While the mechanisms by which nuclear deformation regulates transcriptional activities are only now beginning to be elucidated, our data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanical rheostat within progenitor cells, where increases in nuclear stiffness sensitize the entire transduction machinery to prime the cell response to mechanical perturbation. Our data show that soluble differentiation factors as well as mechanical perturbation on its own, elicit marked changes in nuclear deformability, stiffness and organization as a direct consequence of chromatin condensation and restructuring of the Lamin A/C network in both adult progenitor cells and in embryonic stem cells. This change in nuclear mechanics and organization led to a greater mobilization of intracellular calcium when pre-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells were exposed to stretch, likely as a consequence of the nucleus transforming from a strain sink (an object that readily deforms) to a strain concentrator (an object that stops deforming, forcing other components to deform more). These changes would be expected to increase stress and/or deformation occurring at nucleo-cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal linkages (i.e. LINC complex) to the ECM (i.e. focal adhesions). When one element of an elastic mechanical linkage stiffens, the other weaker elements must deform more when the system is elongated by a set amount. Indeed, the enhanced mechanical sensitivity seen in differentiated cells was reversed when the ‘stiff’ differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the ‘soft’ undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment.</p><p>This notion of the nucleus as a dynamic mechanical feature of the cell that is responsive to the microenvironment is consistent with and extends several recent findings. Swift and colleagues recently showed that the stiffness of native tissue extracellular matrices defines the resting levels and ratios of Lamin isoforms in adult cells, with stiffer microenvironments increasing nuclear mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swift et al., 2013</xref>). Our data extend this concept to cells transiting from an undifferentiated to a differentiated phenotype as a result of soluble factor addition and exposure to repeated mechanical deformtion. This phenomenon may drive cell differentiation or maintain the differentiated phenotype to better match the dynamic mechanical tissue environment in which they operate. For instance, as soon as muscular contraction begins in the developing embryo, mesenchymal precursors are exposed to dynamic mechanical perturbation, and blockade of mechanical signaling during development interrupts joint formation and tissue maturation. In the context of injury and repair, recruited stem cells experience the mechanical environment of the tissue being repaired, and so for musculoskeletal tissues, experience dynamic mechanical stimulation as part of their normal microenvironment. Thus, dynamic mechanical forces transmitted through the environment may continuously adjust nuclear mechanics to modulate progenitor cell mechanosensitivity during tissue formation and repair.</p><p>The mechanism through which soluble factor addition or mechanical perturbation results in nuclear reorganization is not wholly elucidated, but these inputs may share some common downstream pathways. For example, both BMP and TGF-β signaling increase baseline cellular contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhadriraju et al., 2007</xref>). Our data show that TGF-β expression is highly upregulated with dynamic stretch at early time points and while TGF-β in the media did not reach detectable levels, we did observe increased Smad3 signaling in response to stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furumatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2015</xref>]). Thus, elements of the TGF-signaling pathway may be mechano-responsive, in a ligand or ligand-less fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heo et al., 2016</xref>). Mechanical perturbation itself can also increase cell contractility and spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2015</xref>), and influence the subsequent mechano-response. Kaunas et al. showed that artificially increasing Rho GTPase activity in endothelial cells sensitizes their response to applied stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaunas et al., 2005</xref>), and Deguchi et al. showed that fluid shear stress, which also increases contractility, can stiffen the endothelial cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deguchi et al., 2005</xref>). Recent work by the Shivashankar and Burridge groups has shown that local application of mechanical force to the apical surface of cells causes local chromatin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iyer et al., 2012</xref>) and that pulling on isolated nuclei results in changes in Lamin organization and nuclear stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guilluy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the path to nuclear reorganization, our data provide evidence that the stiffer nucleus of differentiated cells can act as a stress concentrator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), sensitizing these cells to mobilize calcium to a greater extent when external deformation is applied. This increased calcium mobilization may itself impact lamin processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalinowski et al., 2013</xref>), creating a feed-forward loop to ensure that the nucleus remains patent under conditions of high mechanical activity. We recently showed that ATP-purinergic signaling is a central modulator in the load-induced-chromatin condensation in MSCs, as is signaling thorough Smad proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heo et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2016</xref>). Further, we have established that the giant isoform of nesprin-1 (a component of the LINC complex that mediates actin connectivity to the nucleus) is essential for mechanical force transfer to the nucleus and activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway in response to exogenous mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driscoll et al., 2015</xref>). These signaling pathways may likewise impact lamin processing and chromatin condensation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18207.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Altered nuclear mechanobiology with stem cell differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The nucleus is mechanically linked to the extracellular environment through linker of nucleus and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex connections to a contractile cytoskeleton that interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through focal adhesion complexes.

In the undifferentiated state, the nucleus deforms along with the cell, resulting in little added strain (or stress) in the cytoskeleton (green filaments). In the differentiated state, the lack of deformation of the nucleus concentrates deformation (and stress) in the cytoskeletal network (red filaments) and at its connections. This transformation hyper-sensitizes the differentiated cell to respond to mechanical perturbation (red stars) by increasing stress at each point of cytoskeletal connectivity (focal adhesions and LINC complex). Mechanical inputs (when repeated dynamically) can evoke similar changes in nuclear architecture and mechanics and increase cell mechanosensitivity to direct lineage specification in the absence of exogenous soluble differentiation factors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18207.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18207.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18207-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>While both mechanical forces and soluble factors had similar effects on nuclear properties and reorganization, those mediated by soluble factor addition arose more slowly than those wrought by mechanical forces. This suggests that the mechanical environment plays a significant role in dynamically modulating nuclear properties. Given that such changes act to first inform, and then reinforce, signals that promote and preserve lineage specification, this time dependence has implication for therapeutic use. That is, as MSCs transit between phenotypes, one would expect that their current differentiation status and time history of exposure to soluble or mechanical factors could influence their mechanobiologic response upon implantation. This understanding may aid in the design of biomaterials that can promote (or restrict) certain lineages based on nuclear remodeling. For example, if nuclear stiffening via Lamin reorganization is counter the intended differentiation pathway, then materials may be modified with ligands that interrupt mechano-sensing pathways, for example by decreasing cell contractility based on ligand presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosgrove et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, materials could be engineered to promote nuclear deformation (e.g. by aligning the cell population from the outset) so as to more efficiently transfer strain from the material to the nucleus to promote nuclear remodeling and achieve a differentiated status more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to material design, we also noted a path-dependent aspect in terms of the end results of nuclear reorganization; soluble factors resulted in complete abrogation of nuclear deformation, while mechanically mediated reorganization of the nucleus resulted in only a diminution of nuclear deformation with stretch. If nuclear deformation is essential for physiologic function, then complete elimination of nuclear deformation (as a consequence of soluble factor addition) may result in aberrant mechano-signaling. This has implications for establishing better cellular biophysical benchmarks by which small molecule drivers of differentiation are judged. These benchmarks may prove relevant for cell-based therapeutics, wherein naive stem cells are placed in a mechanically loaded environment. While it is not yet clear how permanent these changes are once soluble and mechanical stimuli are removed, it does suggest that care must be taken to preserve the appropriate mechano-response. In conclusion, the data presented herein demonstrates a mechanism whereby nuclear architecture and stiffness can be tuned to dynamically regulate cellular mechanosensitivity to promote and preserve lineage specification.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell isolation, scaffold seeding and culture</title><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) and chondrocytes were isolated from juvenile bovine tibiofemoral joints (3–6 months old, Research 87, Inc., Boylston, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Mauck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2010b</xref>).

Human MSCs were isolated from surgical waste tissue from patients undergoing total joint replacement at the University of Pennsylvania, with institutional approval. A human embryonic stem cell line was acquired from a commercial source (BioTime, Alameda, CA) and expanded according to the manufacturers guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sternberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fabrication of aligned nanofibrous scaffolds</title><p>Aligned poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibrous scaffolds ( ~0.50 mm thick) were fabricated by electrospinning onto a rotating mandrel. Briefly, PCL (Bright China Limited, China) was dissolved in a 1:1 solution of tetrahydrofuran and N, N-dimethylformamide (T427-1 and D119-1; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at 14.3% w/v over 48 hr. The PCL solution was loaded into a 20-ml syringe tipped with an 18G stainless steel needle. This needle served as a ‘spinneret’ and was charged to +13 KV (ES30P-5W; Gamma High Voltage Research Inc., Ormand Beach, FL) relative to ground. The PCL solution was extruded at a rate of 2.5 ml/hr using a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Model 780100). Fibers were collected onto a grounded cylindrical mandrel rotating with a surface velocity of 10 m/s, with the mandrel positioned 15 cm from the spinneret. Aluminum shields charged to +5 kV were used to focus the fiber jet onto the collecting mandrel. Additional details on this scaffold fabrication process can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heo et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single cell measures of contractility with differentiation</title><p>To query cell contractility changes with differentiation, a custom micro-post array detector (mPAD) was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). After 7 days on scaffolds, MSCs were detached and re-seeded onto an array of elastomeric micro-pillars (spring constant: 18.19 nN/μm), and cultured for 1 day before traction force measurements were taken. Images of live single cells deflecting the underlying micro-pillars were acquired (n = 20/group) using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled incubator. Post deflections were visualized via DiI labeling of post tips and used to calculate strain energy per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Cells were fixed (4% PFA), permeabilized and stained with phalloidin and DAPI to visualize the actin cytoskeleton and nucleus, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assays of cell migration with differentiation</title><p>Migration of undifferentiated, differentiated and TSA-treated MSCs was evaluated using a standard ‘scratch’ assay. MSCs were released from scaffolds by trypsin treatment on day 7 and reseeded into 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in the same media in which they had been cultured (i.e. Ctrl or Diff conditions). After 1 day (to allow for attachment), confluent monolayers were scratched with a 2.5 µl pipette tip and washed three times with PBS to remove cell debris. In some Diff groups, TSA was added to Diff media 24 hr prior to wounding. Images of the wound area were taken at regular intervals using an inverted microscope and the degree of wound closure computed using Image J (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>).

Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Prolong Gold Reagent, P-36931, Life Technologies, NY). The spatial localization of LMAC was evaluated by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM 510, Penn Biomedical Imaging Core). The ratio of LMAC nuclear occupancy was calculated from the volume of LMAC stain divided by total DAPI-stained nuclear volume using Volocity software (Volocity 5.0, Improvision Inc.). To assess chromatin condensation, nuclei on scaffolds were stained with DAPI, and scanned across their mid-section using a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510). To generate a chromatin condensation parameter (CCP), a gradient-based Sobel edge detection algorithm was employed using MATLAB to measure the edge density for individual nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irianto et al., 2013</xref>).

Cell-seeded scaffolds were stretched to 0% and 10% grip-to-grip strain at 2.5 %/min on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Constructs were fixed in the deformed state (in 4% paraformaldehyde) immediately after stretch, and nuclei were stained with DAPI after permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 10 min. All images were captured on an inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon T30, Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a CCD camera. At each strain level, the nuclear aspect ratio defined as the long axis (b) divided by the perpendicular short axis (a) (NAR=b/a) was calculated from DAPI-stained nuclei using Image J. In subsequent studies, changes in NAR were tracked for individual MSC nuclei at each strain step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driscoll et al., 2015</xref>).

For this, cells were removed from scaffolds by trypsinization and re-plated onto tissue culture plastic for 24 hr. Cells were probed using a silicon nitride probe with a pyramidal tip (a spring constant of 0.06 N/m, DNP, Veeco) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solon et al., 2007</xref>). To quantify peri-nuclear stiffness, the first 400 nm of tip deflection from the horizontal (Dd) were fit with the Hertz model modified for a conical tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solon et al., 2007</xref>). To confirm that AFM measurements represented changes in nuclear stiffness, rather than overall cell stiffness, control experiments were performed wherein the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted with 1 μM cytochalasin D (CYTOD, C2618, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 mins prior to AFM probing. Control cells were treated with the carrier DMSO. Values of peri-nuclear stiffness were taken as the average of measurements made in three different regions of the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of cell and nuclear structural proteins</title><p>Semi-quantitative analysis of protein levels and phosphorylation states were assessed using Western blot analysis. For this, cell-seeded scaffolds were washed three times with PBS and lysed for 30 min on ice using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing protease (p-8340, Sigma, St Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (p-2580, Sigma, St Louis, MO). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assay (DC Protein Assay Kit, Biorad, CA). Cell lysates were separated on gradient poly-acrylamide gels (Mini-Protean TGX gels Any KD, 456–9034, Biorad, CA) in running buffer (Tris/Glycine/SDS Buffer, 161–0732, Biorad, CA).

Scaffolds were incubated with dye solution for 30 min, followed by incubation in fresh control medium. Real-time images were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon T30, Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) during scaffold stretch. Additional samples were pre-incubated for 24 hr with TSA as above prior to application of scaffold stretch. To measure the calcium response after DL pre-conditioning, cells were seeded on scaffolds for 2 days and then dynamically loaded for 5 days (3% strain, 1 Hz, 6 hr/day). Afterwards, samples were stained with fluo-4AM dye and subjected to a static stretch. For the osmotic challenge study, cells were seeded on scaffold for 2 days, treated with D-mannitol (DM) for 30 min, stained with Cal-520AM (#21130, AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA) and then subjected to static stretch. A step static stretch was applied at a rate of 1 %/sec up to 10%. Individual MSCs were tracked during this deformation, and the signal intensity before and after stretch was measured using MetaMorph and normalized to background intensity.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differentiation Alters Stem Cell Nuclear Architecture, Mechanics, and Mechano-Sensitivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The primary concern to address is the ability to discriminate differences in nuclear mechanics independent of differentiation and the large differences in time scales examined (see reviewer 2's comments below). Specifically, examination of potential differences in undifferentiated and differentiated cells both with and without TSA treatment should be performed.</p><p>2) Small molecule inhibition studies would strengthen the definitive nature of the authors' claims, specifically regarding autocrine/paracrine signaling.</p><p>3) Attempt to examine the influence of other cytoskeletal elements on perinuclear properties besides just F-actin. Even if they had no effect, this would provide some evidence for specificity of particular elements, like F-actin.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Overall, this is an exciting and novel study that links nuclear mechanics to cellular differentiation. The study appears to be a collaboration among several of the main cell/nuclear mechanics groups, Mauck, Lee, Chen, etc.</p><p>Several studies have previously shown this concept empirically but this study goes a level or two deeper by making multiple measurements and examining this concept mechanistically using MSC.</p><p>The study shows that nuclei indifferentiated MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical loading induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the 'stiff' differentiated nucleus was softened, and was enhanced when the 'soft' undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as an additional mechanism to modulate cellular mechanosensation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article by Heo et al. evaluates the effect of MSC differentiation and stretch on nuclear mechanics and calcium signaling. The conceptual advance results from observations that differentiation-dependent changes in chromatin condensation and nuclear structure/mechanics can alter the cellular responses to physical cues by shifting the nucleus from a strain sink to a strain concentrator. This change results in differential responses to load in the magnitude of calcium signaling. This is an interesting idea and is supported by several interesting results in the article. However, the article draws additional conclusions that are less well supported, in part because it is difficult to dissect the effects of chromatin condensation on differentiation from those on nuclear mechanics – as well as the effects on mechanosensitivity of mechanical (dynamic load) or soluble factors (TGF-β) factors. This article definitely brings forward some exciting new ideas that advance our understanding of mechanobiology, but additional experiments are needed to clarify the interpretation of the conclusions.</p><p>Significant Issues:</p><p>The most important issue is the need to more clearly discriminate nuclear mechanics from differentiation. Given that TSA affects HDAC activity, and has important effects on gene expression and differentiation, another approach is needed to discriminate the effects of nuclear softening/stiffening on cellular mechanotransduction and calcium signaling, relative to the effects on differentiation. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is missing important controls that are needed to interpret these findings. In addition to verifying that the TSA and D-mannitol alter the modulus of the cells in this system using the AFM-based assay (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), data for undifferentiated cells with TSA, and differentiated cells with D-mannitol, should also be shown. The same outcomes should be assessed in each condition. It could additionally be helpful to evaluate the lamin or chromatin outcomes in these conditions.</p><p>The study is manipulating and observing events over multiple time scales – including slow processes like differentiation – and quick ones like calcium signaling. After 6 days of differentiation, TSA is administered for 24h and mannitol for 30 minutes. In some cases, load is applied in a short term manner – to assess nuclear resistance to deformation, and in others, in a long term manner. These differences are very important to interpreting the data and understanding the implications of the results. Please comment on the time scale more clearly in the Results and in the Discussion.</p><p>For the two reasons above, it is difficult to interpret the interesting data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors suggest that dynamic load is driving similar changes in nuclear architecture and cellular function as TGF-β – but more quickly (i.e. at the end of subsection “Dynamic Loading Alters MSC Nuclear Mechanics and Mechano-perception”). However, some data indicate that these are distinct processes or that they achieve similar results in lamin A or gene expression via different mechanisms. In addition to clarifying the discussion and interpretation of these results, it would be helpful to design an experiment that could more fully discriminate the extent to which these stimuli are operating in the same or in distinct pathways. In other words, can you uncouple the mechanical vs soluble mechanosensitivity or show causal epistasis more convincingly?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Overall Assessment: I found this to be a compelling piece of research, with well-planned and systematic experiments. It may be a bit narrow in scope for <italic>eLife</italic> but if the scope fits in with the aspirations of the editors, I would recommend it strongly.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Most studies on mechano-transduction have focused on the cell as a whole and actin cytoskeleton, while the role of nuclear architecture and how it is impacted in this process stills needs to be comprehensively elucidated. Furthermore, little is known about the manner in which soluble and physical cues are integrated to direct fate decisions, especially as the cell-state changes during the differentiation process. In this study the authors investigate how the biophysical properties of the cell and nucleus first change in response to soluble cues and microenvironment, and how these changes in the biophysical properties of the nucleus subsequently influences the mechano-transduction/sensing, to promote and preserve lineage specification.</p><p>The authors have employed a previously established biomaterial platform involving aligned nanofibrous scaffolds to guide fibrochondrogenesis and apply coordinated cell deformation. Using this platform, they have systematically illustrated that nuclear architecture/nuclear stiffness is modulated during differentiation and these changes influence subsequent mechano-sensitivity, by conducting well-planned experiments to measure nuclear deformation, peri-nuclear elastic modulus and to assess the specific role of nuclear stiffness as well as structural organization. They show that nuclear stiffening during differentiation dominates the response to subsequent external mechanical stimuli with respect to nuclear mechanics/deformation (even in presence of patent and contractile cytoskeleton). It transforms the nuclei from being a 'strain sink' to a 'stress concentrator', and increases mechano-sensitivity. Furthermore, their results indicate that nuclear stiffening is both a consequence and a mediator of differentiation, as it is manifested by soluble cues inducing differentiation, as well as mechanical stimulation by itself.

Specifically, examination of potential differences in undifferentiated and differentiated cells both with and without TSA treatment should be performed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. Our investigations were carried out over several time scales. The first time scale, that of differentiation, occurs over the course of ~1 week, during which time we observed changes in nuclear structure, mechanics, and distribution of internal nucleoskeletal elements. The other time scale of interest was that which occurs in response to physical perturbation. These mechanotransductive events (i.e., calcium signaling) occur within a few seconds to minutes after load is initiated. As we show, changes in nuclear mechanics that occur over a longer term can alter how these cells interpret shorter term mechanical perturbations, altering their acute mechanotransduction response. Likewise, we show that the summation of these short time-scale mechanotransduction events will eventually change the cell phenotype, over the course of several days, as is evidenced by longer term loading resulting in the restructuring of chromatin and Lamin A/C that we observed. With respect to the impact of TSA on undifferentiated cells, and D-mannitol on differentiated cells, and in response the previous review, we have performed new studies to address these questions. Please see our responses to reviewer 2’s comments below, along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> showing the findings of these new studies.</p><p><italic>2) Small molecule inhibition studies would strengthen the definitive nature of the authors' claims, specifically regarding autocrine/paracrine signaling.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. In other parallel work, focused on the very short term (3 hours to less than 10 minutes) response to loading of naïve MSCs, we probed many of the potential mechanical signaling pathways that might be involved in this process. This work was published in Scientific Reports last year, with a follow up manuscript just published in the Biophysical Journal (Please see Heo et al., 2015, 2016). Those two studies examined chromatin condensation in response to loading, and defined some of the operative molecular pathways involved in this process. Summarizing that work, we found that purinergic signaling (i.e., ATP) is a central player in the initial events that result in chromatin condensation, and that this initial response is dependent on the cell having a sufficient level of baseline contractility so as to respond to the mechanical perturbation. Our conclusions from that set of studies was that loading applied to cells that had a minimal amount of tension in their cytoskeleton (due in part to basal activity in Smad signaling in the TGF/BMP pathway) resulted in the rapid release of ATP (from intracellular stores), which initiated calcium signaling in an autocrine and paracrine fashion (shown via conditioned media assays), ultimately changing the activity of chromatin modifying enzymes, such as EZH2, impacting the chromatin condensation state in the short term.</p><p>In the current study being considered by <italic>eLife</italic>, we show how the culmination of these short term loading events ‘sum up’ to restructure the nucleus in much the same way as TGF-β application to induce differentiation, and implicate the nucleus as a mediator of mechano-sensitivity in this cell type as it undergoes this longer term differentiation.</p><p><italic>3) Attempt to examine the influence of other cytoskeletal elements on perinuclear properties besides just F-actin. Even if they had no effect, this would provide some evidence for specificity of particular elements, like F-actin.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. Our focus on f-actin in this study was motivated by several previous studies exploring the basic mechanisms of nuclear deformation in this cell type and in this 3D context. In a previously published work (Nathan et al., Acta Biomat, 2011), we measured nuclear deformation in naïve MSCs on aligned scaffolds in the context of blockers of f-actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. Only blockers of f-actin polymerization altered nuclear deformation in this context, leading to our focus in the current study. More recently, we have established that the giant isoform of Nesprin 1 (a component of the LINC complex that mediates actin connectivity to the nucleus) is responsible for nuclear deformation in this cell type (and is also downstream YAP mechano-signaling) (Driscoll et al., Biophys J, 2015). Based on these two observations, it seems that f-actin is the dominant player mediating strain transfer to the nucleus in this cell type.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…]Significant Issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>The most important issue is the need to more clearly discriminate nuclear mechanics from differentiation. Given that TSA affects HDAC activity, and has important effects on gene expression and differentiation, another approach is needed to discriminate the effects of nuclear softening/stiffening on cellular mechanotransduction and calcium signaling, relative to the effects on differentiation. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is missing important controls that are needed to interpret these findings. In addition to verifying that the TSA and D-mannitol alter the modulus of the cells in this system using the AFM-based assay (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), data for undifferentiated cells with TSA, and differentiated cells with D-mannitol, should also be shown. The same outcomes should be assessed in each condition. It could additionally be helpful to evaluate the lamin or chromatin outcomes in these conditions.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that TSA impacts HDAC activity, and so can have important effects on differentiation in the long term. To address this, applied the minimum dose of TSA for the shortest period of time, so as to capture how mechano-response changed in response to changes in nuclear properties. To ensure that TSA was not altering differentiation to a great extent (over this short period of application), we evaluated two canonical markers of the fibrochondrogenic lineage, aggrecan and type II collagen. Baseline expression of these two important markers in differentiated cells did not change with this short term TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). With respect to additional controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the experiments suggested have now been performed. When TSA was applied to undifferentiated cells, only a small decrease in chromatin condensation was observed, with a correspondingly slight increase in nuclear deformability (p&lt;0.05) in these undifferentiated cells. Conversely, when we applied D-mannitol to differentiated cells, no significant additional change in chromatin condensation was observed (p&gt;0.05). These data suggest that, over the time scale of D-mannitol action on the nucleus, it did not condense further in these differentiated cells. Likewise, addition of D-mannitol did not further attenuate nuclear deformation. Indeed, differentiation on its own had sufficiently stiffened the nucleus such that very little deformation was occurring to begin with. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18207.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chromatin condensation parameter (CCP) as a function of treatment group (*p&lt;0.05 vs. Ctrl, <sup>†</sup>p&lt;0.05 vs. Ctrl/TSA, n = 24).

After 6 days of differentiation, TSA is administered for 24h and mannitol for 30 minutes. In some cases, load is applied in a short term manner – to assess nuclear resistance to deformation, and in others, in a long term manner. These differences are very important to interpreting the data and understanding the implications of the results. Please comment on the time scale more clearly in the Results and in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. Please see our response to the editor above (general comment #1). We have carefully reviewed the manuscript to ensure that the timing of each study, and the intended outcome parameter measured are clearly defined in each section, and have specifically modified the last paragraph of the Introduction to make these time scales clear from the outset. In essence, when we were probing short term mechano-transductive events, we examined cells on the order of minutes to hours, the time course over which these pathways are generally active after mechanical perturbation. Similarly, for studies examining nuclear deformation, stretch was applied on the time scale of minutes, and the elastic deformation of the nucleus was visualized immediately at each deformation step, as an indirect measure of nuclear stiffness. When we were probing the consequence of the summation of repeated mechanical perturbations, these were applied over multiple days to provide sufficient time for the cell to respond and remodel in response the loading environment. These clarifications have been emphasized in the revised manuscript. Please see revised manuscript, Introduction, last paragraph.</p><p><italic>For the two reasons above, it is difficult to interpret the interesting data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors suggest that dynamic load is driving similar changes in nuclear architecture and cellular function as TGF-β – but more quickly (i.e. at the end of subsection “Dynamic Loading Alters MSC Nuclear Mechanics and Mechano-perception”).

Our data in this paper and other related studies suggest that these are related, but distinct phenomenon. That is, it seems that loading and application of TGFbeta result in alterations in nuclear stiffness, and that this altered nuclear stiffness changes mechano-sensitivity in similar ways.</p><p>However, the overall state of the cell between these two conditions is by no means identical. In recent unpublished data, we carried out microarray analysis comparing the response to TGFbeta at day 4 versus the response to 2 bouts of dynamic loading (each applied for three hours per day at 3% strain at 1Hz) over 4 days. As is shown in the PCA plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>, each loading event drives alterations in global gene expression, which accumulate and stabilizes after the second loading event. Notably, the loaded samples group in the PCA plot in a quite different location than do those samples treated with TGFbeta over this time course. Thus, it appears that while ‘load-induced’ and ‘TGFbeta induced’ nuclear reorganization have some pathways and outcomes in common, the overall state of the cell is quite different based on whether the input is mechanical or soluble factor in nature. While outside the scope of the current work, ongoing studies are focused on probing positional and methylation events across the genome using RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation to better understand these distinct cell states.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18207.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>PCA plot showing shifts in global gene expression in response to one loading event (DL), after a period of free swelling culture (FS) following DL, after a second loading event (2<sup>nd</sup> DL), and with another free swelling period (2<sup>nd</sup> FS).</title><p>Note that the last two points (green and grey) reside essentially on top of one another, suggesting a permanence in expression patterns across the genome following a second loading event.

To the first point, we found that blockers of Smad2/3 (SB431542) or Smad1/5/8 (LDN193189), which mediate TGF and BMP signaling, respectively, eliminated the early (less than 3 hour) chromatin condensation we observed in response to mechanical loading. Interestingly, these blockers also dramatically decreased cell contractility (please see Heo et al. Biophys J, 2016). Of further note, when we added functional blocking antibodies to TGFbeta during and after loading, this treatment had no impact on early nuclear remodeling. This suggested to us that basal activity (in the absence of exogenous ligand) in the canonical TGF/BMP pathways is important for establishing tension in the cytoskeleton, and so influences the ability of cells to detect mechanical perturbation.</p><p>Thus, while related in that both loading and TGF result in nuclear remodeling and stiffening, and sensitization to additional mechanical stimuli as a result, the state of the cell is quite different depending on the path traveled to achieve this nuclear remodeling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]Suggested revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the figure caption is a bit confusing and can be clarified.
