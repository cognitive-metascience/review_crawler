metal ion transport superfamily, is the major Mg<sup>2+</sup>-influx pathway in prokaryotes. CorA structures in closed (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound), and open (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free) states, together with functional data showed that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-influx inhibits further Mg<sup>2+</sup>-uptake completing a regulatory feedback loop. While the closed state structure is a symmetric pentamer, the open state displayed unexpected asymmetric architectures. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), we explored the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating transition of single CorA channels: HS-AFM movies during Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion experiments revealed the channel’s transition from a stable Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound state over a highly mobile and dynamic state with fluctuating subunits to asymmetric structures with varying degree of protrusion heights from the membrane. Our data shows that at Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentration below K<sub>d</sub>, CorA adopts a dynamic (putatively open) state of multiple conformations that imply structural rearrangements through hinge-bending in TM1. We discuss how these structural dynamics define the functional behavior of this ligand-dependent channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AFM</kwd><kwd>CorA</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd><italic>T. maritima</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM120561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perozo</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1AT010874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheuring</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-speed atomic force microscopy reveals that the open state of the divalent ion channel CorA is highly dynamic and defined by the fast exchange between conformations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is a key divalent cation in biology. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>It regulates and maintains numerous, physiological functions such as nucleic acid stability, muscle contraction, heart rate and vascular tone, neurotransmitter release, and serves as cofactor in a myriad of enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altura, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Baaij et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jahnen-Dechent and Ketteler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryan, 1991</xref>).

Through CorA, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis is achieved by a negative feedback mechanism in which Mg<sup>2+</sup> acts as both, charge carrier and ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalmas et al., 2014b</xref>). The binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the cytoplasmic subunit interfaces leads to channel closing and thereby limits further Mg<sup>2+</sup>-influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dalmas et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalmas et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palombo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindl et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Determining the structure of CorA in its Mg<sup>2+</sup>-unbound (Apo) form is considered a fundamental step towards understanding its gating mechanism. Yet, the first CorA crystal structure in the absence of divalent cations showed little or no changes compared to the fully Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed channel structure, with only a slight kink between TMDs and intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfoh et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, EPR spectroscopy indicated much larger structural rearrangements within the protein upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dissociation, suggestive of a more dramatic closed-to-open channel transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalmas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalmas et al., 2014b</xref>). These results were confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), reporting surprising asymmetric rearrangements of the individual subunits within the homo-pentamer in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cleverley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>). Based on ~7 Å cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>), a model was proposed in which Mg<sup>2+</sup>-unbinding leads to an increase in the inter-subunit conformational flexibility of CorA, thereby resulting in at least two asymmetric structures with, presumably, open gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite progresses in the structural characterization of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free CorA structure(s), the transition from the closed (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound) state to the conductive unliganded conformation is still unclear. At 7.1 Å, the putative open CorA asymmetric cryo-EM structures were solved only from a relatively low number of particles (26,271 and 27,416 of 173,653 particles for open-I and open-II states, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>), and due to its intrinsic averaging for structure determination, the cryo-EM data cannot inform about time-dependent behavior. We posit that these structures could be sampled from three different dynamic processes: they could represent two different open state conformations with significant state dwell-times (structurally resolved by cryo-EM); they could be intermediates along a conformational trajectory; or finally, they might be mere snapshots of a highly dynamic, fluctuating molecule without a long-lasting and well-defined high-resolution structure.</p><p>In order to elucidate the sequence of events underlying gating-related CorA conformational changes, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2014</xref>) to capture CorA structural rearrangements during Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion experiments. HS-AFM is unique in its ability to concomitantly characterize molecular structures and dynamics under native-like conditions. In agreement with electrophysiological, spectroscopic and biophysical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalmas et al., 2014b</xref>), we found that during Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion experiments individual CorA molecules lost pentameric symmetry and became highly dynamic at Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations below ~2 mM. Under these conditions, the symmetric state is reversibly adopted by means of dynamic fluctuations among the individual subunits, indicative of spontaneous Mg<sup>2+</sup>-rebinding. However, in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CorA transitions to an asymmetric state. Thus, the conformational energy landscape likely comprises two deep energy minima represented by the fully symmetric (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound) and the asymmetric (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depleted) states interspersed by a wide plateau of conformational fluctuations of a highly flexible molecule, which likely represents the conductive state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipid composition determines reconstitution density and morphology</title><p>In recent years, HS-AFM has demonstrated its power to observe molecular mechanisms and structural dynamics of single molecules under physiological conditions with extraordinary detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kodera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marchesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preiner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rangl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have used HS-AFM to track the conformational changes of CorA as a result of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentration changes in real-time. For this, wild-type (wt) CorA was reconstituted at low lipid-to-protein ratios (LPRs between 0.2 and 0.4) in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

CorA-containing vesicles were generated from protein reconstitutions in POPC/POPG (3:1, w:w). When imaged by HS-AFM, vesicles spread on the mica support resulting in large membrane patches with densely packed CorA (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

First, to measure the CorA Mg<sup>2+</sup>-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pilchova et al., 2017</xref>) in our experimental set-up, we used a microfluidic system connected to a constant pressure and flow pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miyagi et al., 2016</xref>), with which we slowly exchanged the complete 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> measuring solution to a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer (containing additional 2 mM EDTA).

The Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent loss of symmetry and increased protrusion height are also consistent with expected structural features of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free (open) CorA structures, where individual subunits move towards the former 5-fold axis and thus stand taller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, bottom). The large, ~1.5 nm, protrusion height difference (ΔHeight) of such a conformation change presents a useful signature to detect and follow the conformational dynamics of individual channels in the membrane. However, these two ΔHeight-states must not be mistaken with functional or even structural states.

We suggest that molecules with increased height where one subunit moves up close to the channel axis represent Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>On the basis of real-time HS-AFM imaging, we find that CorA Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating can be best described in three phases: Above the apparent Mg<sup>2+</sup>-affinity of the intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensor sites (~2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>), the channel adopts a stable 5-fold symmetric state reminiscent of the high-resolution structures (phase 1). After several minutes of exposure to a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solution, CorA transitions into a set of asymmetric architectures, which are characterized by elevated cytoplasmic domains (phase 3). These structures are adopted through major conformational changes implicating hinge-bending of TM1 and reorientation of the cytoplasmic domains. This picture is wholly consistent with data derived from functional (electrophysiology), biochemical (crosslinking), biophysical (EPR, Fluorescence) and structural (cryo-EM) approaches. However, these results contrast with recent crystallographic data of CorA Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site mutants that reported limited or no structural changes compared to the closed wt channel, thereby challenging the hypothesis that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion leads to large conformational changes and channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowatz and Maguire, 2019</xref>). We argue, that the constrains of the crystal lattice on CorA limits the range of conformational changes that can be observed in X-ray structures. In contrast, HS-AFM imaging under physiological conditions shown here is more consistent with the single particle cryo-EM data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cleverley et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al. (2016)</xref> and the EPR spectroscopic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalmas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalmas et al., 2014b</xref>), that is when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is investigated under lattice-free conditions. These facts must be considered a critical factor in explaining these differences. Among multiple conformational states within phase 3, we identified CorA structures that resembled the low-resolution cryo-EM open-I and open-II structures. These phases 1 and 3 are characterized by structural stability or at least limitations by the structural freedom of CorA. Here, more work is required to identify and clearly distinguish between different sub-structures in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free elevated state of CorA. In contrast, at intermediate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations, and/or after short incubation times at 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the channel reveals a highly mobile and fluctuating state (phase 2). Active subunits change and the entire molecule displays high structural variability, likely adopting many more conformations than the three states so far identified by cryo-EM. Indeed, while we can assign the fully 5-fold symmetric state with certainty, our assignment of molecules to state open-I and open-II must be considered as putative. Perhaps more importantly, at intermediate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations ~ 50% of the molecules could not be assigned and were pooled in a class of undefined quaternary structures (open-+). In this context, the details of the cryo-EM study become relevant: open-I and open-II only pooled 26,271 and 27,416 particles, respectively, of the total 173,653 particles, and thus a significant portion of the particles remained outside of these classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 2016</xref>). We note, however, that this initial assignment is ultimately constrained by the resolution limitations of both cryo-EM structural assignments and the present application of HS-AFM. We expect that given a larger number of particles to process (in cryo-EM) or improvements in the spatial and/or temporal resolution of HS-AFM, additional states are likely to emerge. We propose that the various CorA structural states and the associated subunit movements observed by HS-AFM may reflect variations of number and location of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions bound to the cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>Among the main structural features of CorA is its long (~11 nm) first transmembrane helix (TM1), ranging all the way from the periplasmic face to the surface of the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensor. TM1 is actually the only connection between the TM region and the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that the large fluctuations of the cytoplasmic domains might be directly translated by TM1 into fluctuations within the channel pore. We suggest this mechanism as the basis for ion conductance through a particularly long (in comparison to other channels) ~55 Å pore, in which moving TM1s allow the asynchronous progression of ions through the pore. Considering the typical persistence length of an α-helix of ~100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choe and Sun, 2005</xref>), allowed us to estimate how much an 11 nm long thermally activated helix fluctuates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – Information Supplement 1). We find that at 1<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T TM1 could bend at its cytoplasmic end ~2 nm out of axis, in good agreement with observed bending of this helix in the open-I and open-II cryo-EM structures and the HS-AFM movies of subunit displacement. Thus, we propose that in the open state the pore is by far less narrow than assumed based on static structures. Indeed, constantly fluctuating TM1s would provide a considerable channel diameter towards the cytoplasmic side. This model would predict that amino acids close to the periplasmic side of the pore play the key role for gating. In agreement with this hypothesis, we find that the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-channel signature motif (GMN) is located right at the periplasmic end of the channel, whereas amino acids towards the cytoplasmic face of TM1 are less conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The idea that there are multiple conductive conformations of CorA, or, as a paradigm shift, the conductive conformation of CorA is a fluctuating molecule, is favored by both, the subunit movement analysis and state transition analysis. In the long-term absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CorA molecules adopt a rather stabilized asymmetric state resembling the putatively open state cryo-EM structures. However, a living cell under physiological conditions is unlikely to ever reach Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations below ~1 mM. Thus we hypothesize that <italic>in cellula</italic> the physiologically relevant open state is a collection of fluctuating conformational states. Thus, the conformational energy landscape of CorA gating would consist of two deep energy minima representing the stable closed (symmetric) and putatively open (asymmetric) conformations connected by a wide plateau in which a variety of open conformations are adopted through permanent molecular fluctuations. The compelling utility of HS-AFM for the study of macromolecular dynamics at high spatio-temporal resolution and in native-like conditions is demonstrated, elucidating a process so far inaccessible to other structural or biophysical techniques. The present data set and our proposed mechanistic interpretation of the conformational dynamics of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CorA gating sets the stage for an unprecedented understanding of CorA as a ‘reverse’ polarity ligand gated ion channel with an unique gating mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>CorA from <italic>T. maritima</italic> was expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalmas et al., 2010</xref>).

Videos were then drift corrected with respect to the membrane patch, or aligned on individual CorA molecules using an in-house developed analysis software plug-in for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fechner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Husain et al., 2012</xref>). Dimensions of the CorA were calculated by height histogram analysis (n = 20,500 height values) and cross section analysis (n = 25) for each condition. Estimation of dwell-times was based on CorA protrusion height: ΔHeight/time traces were generated by subtracting the minimum pixel value from the maximum pixel value in the 5 × 5 nm center area of the molecule. For the molecular height transition detection the ΔHeight traces were analyzed by a Step Transition and State Identification (STaSI) method in a MatLAB (MathWorks) routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heath and Scheuring, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shuang et al., 2014</xref>). StaSI indicated a minimum description length (MDL) for fitting the data with two ΔHeight states (where the increased height states comprises all conformational states with elevated topography). For in depth analysis, 25 molecules of two individual experiments were tracked over 900 and 1600 frames at different Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions, resulting in ~30,500 analyzed frames. Molecules in different height states and the corresponding dwell-times were binned either over 20 events along the time axis. Note, the transition analysis only discerned between states where subunits fluctuate between different height levels and did not classify between sub-states that exposed equivalent height levels to the putative closed (symmetric) state or the putatively open, activated (asymmetric and elevated) state. Such, the height/time traces did also not discriminate which of the open states was assumed. Notably however, our experiments showed that structures exposing increased protrusion heights are likely representatives of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depleted molecules and thus detection of elevated height is a valuable fingerprint for the state transition. For conformational transition analysis membrane patches of ~20 CorA channels were imaged at Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of 10 mM, 3 mM, 0 mM, and after re-addition of 25 mM. Extracted CorA molecules from high-resolution movie sections (1,000–2000 molecular representations extracted from about 20 molecules for each Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition) were manually assigned to different structural states of (C) symmetric flower-shaped, (O-1) asymmetric elevated, (O-2) dome-shaped, elevated and (O-+) all others. The significance of the occurrence of each conformation under the four tested Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations was tested using a two-tailed students test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

CorA is the bacterial ortholog of eukaryotic genes encoding a mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion channel found in all eukaryotes. CorA function is negatively regulated by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These channels are open when the binding site is unoccupied but they close in the presence of high Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Previous structural studies primarily using EPR and cryo-EM suggest that the channel undergoes a closed to open conformational switch in absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which results in loss of five symmetry. Cryo-EM studies show that the open channel exists in at least two conformations which could either represent snapshots of a fluctuating channel or intermediates in the gating pathway. Recent crystallographic studies, however, suggest that the unbound channels may not undergo as much of a conformational change as suggested by the cryo-EM and EPR studies.</p><p>In this study, the authors have used high-speed AFM to monitor the time-dependent conformational changes as Mg<sup>2+</sup> is removed from the channel. HS-AFM technique allows them to track conformational changes in a single CorA channel over time and correlate these changes with putative gating transitions. Functional experiments show that the gating process of the channel is relatively slow – currents decay over 15-20 minutes in electrophysiology experiments. Thus, the conformational changes are expected to be within the bandwidth of these measurements (500 ms per frame). Mg<sup>2+</sup> depletion experiments show that the stable starting structure with five-fold symmetry becomes dynamic with time and ultimately settles to one or more asymmetric structures. One of the most interesting aspects of this study is that unlike most ion channels, the open channel conformation is both asymmetric and dynamic. Overall this is a technically work which advances the field both in terms of providing new information about the gating mechanism of CorA and demonstrating the power of HS-AFM to monitor single molecule structural transitions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Real time dynamics of gating-related conformational changes in CorA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All of the reviewers are concerned about the two-state model assumption for data analysis. The authors themselves state that there are two open states and one closed state. The model fit shown in Figure 3A is clearly inadequate. The open conformation is quite heterogenous, correct? The kymograph shown really looks like 3 states to me (the third being at a lower height, near a Δ Height of 0). And if the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound state is the baseline, lowest-height state, why doesn't the &quot;down&quot; state have a Δ-Height of zero? The choice of 2 states affects the dwell time analysis (everything else in Figure 3), and without a better rationale, I don't see why this choice is valid. There are other possible reasons for poor fit. For instance, some of the conformational transitions in CorA is much faster than the sampling rate and this could result in aliasing. This is difficult to rule out but should be discussed.</p><p>Also the height histogram on the right side shows a very disperse distribution, only two not very distinct local maxima that were not taken as level thresholds (so why 2-state?). As this data depiction is crucial for all the analysis done in the rest of Figure 3 it needs to be clearly and convincingly communicated.</p><p>STaSI is a model-independent idealization algorithm but it tends to overfit data. Have the authors tried any of the other HHM based algorithms? Given that they are assuming a two-state model, it would make more sense to use HMM.</p><p>2) The reviewers are convinced that the CorA molecule becomes highly dynamic in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and find it very interesting that this conformation is conducting. However, we all agree that the assignment of these highly dynamic structures to discrete states is restrictive and perhaps also subjective. It is not clear how the conformational states (closed, open I, open II) taken from EM work were assigned to the conformations recorded with high speed AFM. Was it done manually? What were the objective criteria? How many structures were taken? Figure 5B only gives percentages. Again, this is crucial for all the data analysis done in Figure 5. As the authors have stated, the classification of discrete state in this highly flexible molecule is a challenge. In Figure 5A, it is not clear whether the images shown below are idealized (expected) images or averaged images for each of the states. It should be stated clearly in the legend. The actual averaged image should be shown as an inset. In addition, in some instances, the state assignments are based on changes in the shape rather than height. If both heights and changes in shape are taken into consideration, it appears that the number of possible states will be much more and trying to bin these highly dynamic structures into a few discrete states becomes less meaningful.</p><p>3) My other main critique is that it is very difficult to understand how changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration were achieved for each experiment, and why the experiments were designed the way that they were. It seems like two different methods were used to change Mg<sup>2+</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations: either pipetting in EDTA, or slow perfusion with an EDTA-containing solution over 10's of minutes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). (Subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion induces large conformational changes 1 of the intracellular face” paragraph two: it's unclear whether perfusion is performed with EDTA solution or not. This could be clarified in the main text so that the reader doesn't have to go to the supplemental figure legend).</p><p>I assume that adding EDTA nearly instantaneously removes bulk Mg<sup>2+</sup>, so that any slow kinetic component is due to channel kinetics. Whereas with perfusion, changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the channel's conformational journey from &quot;phase 1&quot; to &quot;phase 3&quot; both occur on over a minutes-long time scale. Because of the slow kinetic component to channel dynamics, it's really important for the logic of the paper to be clear about which method of Mg<sup>2+</sup> depletion was used in the data in Figures 2 through 5.</p><p>Do I understand correctly that many (all?) of the experiments in Figure 3 involved a ramp from high Mg<sup>2+</sup> to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> over about 14 minutes with another 12 minutes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free conditions (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2)? In Figure 3, the sharp delineation of the green, blue, and red boxes seem to indicate Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration steps, and the legend refers to images collected at saturating, 2, and 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This is confusing. The text goes back and forth between describing imaging at 2 mM (subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion induces large conformational changes 1 of the intracellular face” paragraph one and ~2 mM). According to my reading, Figure 5 then uses 3 discrete Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, but the use of the color-fade arrows seems to indicate a ramp.</p><p>I'm not clear what advantage ramping the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations provided. Given the amount of functional data already available for this channel, including a good idea of the Kd for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, I might have gone straight to imaging at discrete Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Could the rationale be explained?</p><p>4) Abstract: &quot;finally equilibrates to an asymmetric structure.&quot; Is the final state a single asymmetric structure or it is at least two conformations. Based on the state identification matrix in Figure 5, it would seem that at 0 Mg, there are more than one asymmetric structures, unlike the Mg bound state.</p><p>5) Abstract: – &quot;putative open state adopts multiple conformations through hinge-bending motions&quot;. This sentence contradicts the previous sentence and it is not clear whether the data provided in this study show hinge-bending motion. The conformational changes are compatible with hinge-bending but there is no direct evidence here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47322.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All of the reviewers are concerned about the two-state model assumption for data analysis.

As such, the analysis as presented in 3A is not based on explicit structural states nor determines dwell times directly associable with specific structural states. Let us first go over the analysis carried out in Figure 3 in some detail: Each molecule is analyzed as described in 3A and then the behaviors of all molecules are pooled in 3B and 3C.</p><p>Originally, we made a significant effort to track the movement of the individual subunits and make state assignments by transforming the CorA ring profiles into height cross-sections. Theses profiles were associated to the states described by cryo-EM. However, given the large variability within the molecules (lateral and rotational movements), combined to the temporal resolution limits of the experiment (and the bias from the polar transformation), it turned out to be impossible to determine states and/or individual subunit movements in any significant way.</p><p>Thus, as a subterfuge to define and assign a given structural state to each molecule at any instant, we simply tracked the height increase and fluctuations of CorA during Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion experiments. In light of the nature of the structural changes between the closed (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound) and many open (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free) conformations, we are confident that height is a reliable measure to track the main closed-open transition. In other words, unable to define several states that could be integrated into a gating model as the reviewer suggests, we use a 2-state model with no other ambition than assigning OFF vs ON, where all of the poorly defined “open” state conformations are “pooled” as the ON state. This is clearly not ideal, but we argue that given the fact that the open state is unlikely to be defined in the classical, “single conformation” sense (as is one of the main conclusions of this work), this simple model is just intended to assess the kinetics of entry and exit of the closed state i.e. the symmetric state vs all other states.</p><p>How was this assessed: To determine CorA’s height changes we only used the center area of each molecule (5x5nm) and calculated the relative ΔHeight (the maximum pixel value minus the minimum pixel value). The reason that absolute height was not reported is mostly due to the larger variability in absolute height values under a wide number of experimental conditions. The region of interest of this measurement was defined in the center area of each molecule. In cases of limited resolution, the pore might simply not be observed in an otherwise low CorA molecule (ΔHeight &lt;1nm). Hence, when considering straightforward changes in height, CorA formally switches between only 2 states, yet due to resolution limitations, the ΔHeight of the lower state is somewhat widened.</p><p>The major conformational difference between the closed and the multiple open states, leads to an increased height of the center or the rim by ~2nm ΔHeight in the open state(s) (e.g. one subunit ‘stands up’ in one of the bean-shaped asymmetric conformations). When all subunits are low but there is a central pore (e.g. closed state, 5-fold symmetric molecule) the observed height difference between pore and rim is ~1nm, and poorly resolved closed state molecules have a ΔHeight &lt;1nm. In brief, failing to make significant structural state assignments, we used the best AFM criterion (i.e. height) to assign the closed state versus all other (putatively activated) states as a function of the progression of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion. We thank the reviewers for pointing to these uncertainties and have changed the text accordingly as highlighted in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other possible reasons for poor fit. For instance, some of the conformational transitions in CorA is much faster than the sampling rate and this could result in aliasing. This is difficult to rule out but should be discussed.</p><p>Also the height histogram on the right side shows a very disperse distribution, only two not very distinct local maxima that were not taken as level thresholds (so why 2-state?).

The fluctuations of the CorA subunits are indeed faster than our sampling rate of about 2 frames s<sup>-1</sup>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we show a video section of 2 CorA molecules with a doubled scan rate of 250ms per frame and detect structural differences in single frames (see 1.75s compared to neighboring images 1.5s and 2s). Certainly, the structural fluctuations are much faster than this, and likely the reason why our classification efforts failed. Given the bandwidth limitation of image acquisition and the dynamics of the inter-state transitions in CorA, we have concluded that it would be difficult to capture individual states (other than the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound state and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free states) at the current speed of image acquisition. In consequence, the only reasonable measure is whether the molecule is in its Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound symmetric state (that can be well resolved) or an overlap of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depleted dynamic molecules. We discuss the aspect of scan speed, subunit dynamics and the ‘merging of all activated states into one state as defined by height’ in our revised manuscript version. As detailed above and in the response to question 1a), the HS-AFM analysis essentially reduces the data to a 2-state model (inactivated or activated).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HS-AFM image sequence of depicting CorA every 250ms.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47322-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>STaSI is a model-independent idealization algorithm but it tends to overfit data.

We performed a thorough analysis how well STaSI performs, down to low signal to noise ratios (SNR=0.5), and found that STaSI makes the correct conservative 2-state assignment with ~95% accuracy. We compared STaSI with vbFRET (another Bayesian based approach for state assignment and state transition fitting) and StaSI performed better in our hands. We like that STaSI uses a minimum description length (MDL) and proposes the number of states in a fully unbiased way, resulting in idealized traces. How many structural states are hidden behind the assigned height-states is of course another question that would need time analysis of these height-states with large sample statistics. This is well beyond the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers are convinced that the CorA molecule becomes highly dynamic in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and find it very interesting that this conformation is conducting. However, we all agree that the assignment of these highly dynamic structures to discrete states is restrictive and perhaps also subjective. It is not clear how the conformational states (closed, open I, open II) taken from EM work were assigned to the conformations recorded with high speed AFM. Was it done manually? What were the objective criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>This is one of the key points we are trying to make. Here, we elaborate in more detail:</p><p>1) We agree with the reviewer that there is difficulty to assign snapshots of the highly dynamic molecule to the states observed by cryo-EM. In its dynamic (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free) condition, CorA channels adopt a large variation of conformations and any attempt to automatically assign particular structures, was unsuccessful by lack of resolution, bandwidth and/or the fact that neighboring molecules touched the molecules under scrutiny (we also tried the EM-centered program Relion for particle classification).</p><p>2) We also argue that the cryo-EM structures (Open-I and Open-II) must represent conformations that sit in some sort of energy well (likely very shallow) otherwise, cryo-EM would not have been able to average any kind of structure (even at low resolution). However, the fact that cryo-EM was able to discriminate these two conformations by no means implies that there might not be many more. In fact, we are convinced this is the case and one important reason why it is so hard to make structural assignments under a regime of relatively low bandwidth.</p><p>3) Given 2), it is not unreasonable to argue that our data are somewhat equivalent to the cryo-EM open state low resolution structures.</p><p>4) How have we assigned molecules to individual classes? Manually. We used the following criteria (underlined) that correspond to features observable in the cryo-EM structures: “The channel adopts several structures that we classified into 4 categories: First, the fully-liganded channel corresponding to the 5-fold symmetric closed conformation. Second, a structure of reduced diameter with three asymmetrically distributed protrusions of increased height, assigned to the cryo-EM open-I state. Third, a round- or star-shaped conformation with an elevated center. This HS-AFM topography can be easily identified as it only displays small structural variations and resembles the cryo-EM open-II state.”</p><p>5) However, we came to the same conclusion as the reviewers that an explicit assignment to the cryo-EM open states was too restrictive. Hence, we introduced another class of “not assigned” molecules: “Finally, given that our tentative assignment to open-I and open-II states only covers a fraction of all molecular observations, a fourth category must necessarily include the remaining range of structural variations, which we named Open-+ states…”. Indeed, we see that the majority of the molecules are in this 4<sup>th</sup> class.</p><p>6) Finally, a key conclusion – see Figure 5C – is that the channel goes from a stabilized Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound to a more-or-less stabilized Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free state over a large range of dynamic conformations. Thus, we do not think that we were restrictive trying to ‘push’ our findings towards assignment with the cryo-EM structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many structures were taken? Figure 5B only gives percentages. Again, this is crucial for all the data analysis done in Figure 5. As the authors have stated, the classification of discrete state in this highly flexible molecule is a challenge.</p></disp-quote><p>For each Mg<sup>2+</sup>-condition between ~1,000-2,000 molecular representations were considered for classification into the 4 subgroups and then normalized to the total number of frames. In particular 943 HS-AFM images of mostly stable closed CorAs were analyzed in saturating 10mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>-condition, 1,122 frames at 3mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 2,394 CorA snapshots for 0mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and 1,104 representations were classified for the recovery experiment after re-addition of 25mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These numbers are now mentioned in the Materials and methods section and the corresponding figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5A, it is not clear whether the images shown below are idealized (expected) images or averaged images for each of the states. It should be stated clearly in the legend. The actual averaged image should be shown as an inset.</p></disp-quote><p>The CorA molecules shown in Figure 5A bottom and Figure 5B left and top are sketches depicting the main structural classes of CorA. To avoid confusion, we now clarify this it in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, in some instances, the state assignments are based on changes in the shape rather than height. If both heights and changes in shape are taken into consideration, it appears that the number of possible states will be much more and trying to bin these highly dynamic structures into a few discrete states becomes less meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and believe that there are many more structures in the dynamic open state of CorA, considering the observed structural variations in the presented HS-AFM videos (see our responses to comments above).</p><p>This is why we state: “Active subunits change and the entire molecule displays high structural variability, likely adopting many more conformations than the 3 states so far identified by cryo-EM. Indeed, while we can assign the fully 5-fold symmetric state with certainty, our assignment of molecules to state open-I and open-II must be considered as putative. Perhaps more importantly, at intermediate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations ~50% of the molecules could not be assigned and were pooled in a class of undefined quaternary structures (open +).”, and, “We expect that given a larger number of particles to process (in cryo-EM) or improvements in the spatial and/or temporal resolution of HS-AFM, additional states are likely to emerge.”</p><p>Due to the current limitations in high-resolution single particle HS-AFM data in this study (~5,600 molecular representations in total) more work is required to further optimize sample preparation, which will allow more observations, and HS-AFM technology to distinguish between possible different sub-structures in the open state. However, our experiments observed a clear Mg<sup>2+</sup>- and time- depended sequence of conformational events for CorA: First, a transition into highly mobile, elongated structures occurs, followed by a transition into features resembling to those of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free cryo-EM structures, these molecules have a clearly increased height. As detailed above, the height changes (around Figure 3) are used to automatically detect activation of the molecules only, while the specific shapes are assigned later (see response to 2a) to describe the transition in more detail. We have added additional text in the Discussion section to point out these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) My other main critique is that it is very difficult to understand how changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration were achieved for each experiment, and why the experiments were designed the way that they were. It seems like two different methods were used to change Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations: either pipetting in EDTA, or slow perfusion with a EDTA-containing solution over 10's of minutes (Figure 2—figure supplement 32). (Subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion induces large conformational changes 1 of the intracellular face” paragraph two: it's unclear whether perfusion is performed with EDTA solution or not. This could be clarified in the main text so that the reader doesn't have to go to the supplemental figure legend).</p><p>I assume that adding EDTA nearly instantaneously removes bulk Mg<sup>2+</sup>, so that any slow kinetic component is due to channel kinetics. Whereas with perfusion, changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the channel's conformational journey from &quot;phase 1&quot; to &quot;phase 3&quot; both occur on over a minutes-long time scale. Because of the slow kinetic component to channel dynamics, it's really important for the logic of the paper to be clear about which method of Mg<sup>2+</sup> depletion was used in the data in Figures 2 through 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer understood the two concentration change protocols and we have fully and explicitly described them now in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do I understand correctly that many (all?) of the experiments in Figure 3 involved a ramp from high Mg<sup>2+</sup> to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> over about 14 minutes with another 12 minutes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free conditions (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2)? In Figure 3, the sharp delineation of the green, blue, and red boxes seem to indicate Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration steps, and the legend refers to images collected at saturating, 2, and 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This is confusing. The text goes back and forth between describing imaging at 2 mM (subsection “Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion induces large conformational changes 1 of the intracellular face” paragraph one and ~2 mM). According to my reading, Figure 5 then uses 3 discrete Mg++ concentrations, but the use of the color-fade arrows seems to indicate a ramp.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the confusion of analyzed Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations and the depletion methods used. We only used the fast and manual EDTA titration procedure to deplete Mg<sup>2+</sup> in discrete steps. In all but 1 experiment (Figure 3A and 3B, bottom panel) shown in Figure 3, Mg<sup>2+</sup> was fully depleted in a single titration step (i.e. addition of ~10mM EDTA). For further analysis (Figure 3C) only molecules monitored at 0mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> were analyzed. For the in-depth analysis of the individual structural classes the distinct Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of 10mM, 3mM, 0mM and re-addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to 25mM were achieved pipetting. We clarify the distinct Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the text and all figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not clear what advantage ramping the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations provided. Given the amount of functional data already available for this channel, including a good idea of the Kd for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, I might have gone straight to imaging at discrete Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Could the rationale be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the ramping experiments using a high-precision buffer exchange system first, to test for the affinity of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in our particular experimental set-up (reconstituted and densely packed CorA channels adsorbed on a sample surface), independent of previously determined apparent affinities. Concerning the Kd, the ramp experiments merely corroborate the findings from functional data. Anyway, ramps help us make sure that the addition of EDTA does not physically disturb and influence the measurements. We agree with the reviewer that the transition analysis itself should be performed at distinct Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, particularly when considering the long transition times. Accordingly, all CorA transition experiments used for in-depth analysis and presented in the main manuscript (Figure 2-5 and corresponding videos) were recorded and analyzed at distinct Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. We clarify this by rephrasing the main text in the revised manuscript and as discussed above (point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Abstract: &quot;finally equilibrates to an asymmetric structure.&quot; Is the final state a single asymmetric structure or it is at least two conformations. Based on the state identification matrix in Figure 5, it would seem that at 0 Mg, there are more than one asymmetric structures, unlike the Mg bound state.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that the expression “equilibrates to an asymmetric structure” might be misleading. Our HS-AFM experiments revealed multiple, dynamically fluctuating asymmetric structures, that show an elevated Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensor domain after spending ~10 minutes in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions. Due to the flexibility and the fast dynamics of the large and elevated substructures of CorA we are resolution limited, and thus can only make tentative assignments to the two found cryo-EM structures. Our high resolution CorA analysis at the onset of complete Mg<sup>2+</sup>-depletion (Figure 4 and 5) is highly suggestive of more than two open states of elevated heights. To this end, we changed the Abstract to “… that equilibrates to asymmetric structures of increased membrane protrusion height level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Abstract: &quot;putative open state adopts multiple conformations through hinge-bending motions&quot;. This sentence contradicts the previous sentence and it is not clear whether the data provided in this study show hinge-bending motion. The conformational changes are compatible with hinge-bending but there is no direct evidence here.</p></disp-quote><p>Good catch. As mentioned in point 4, we corrected the misleading phrasing of a single asymmetric state (point 4 above) and have also clarified in the revised version of the manuscript that the observed CorA subunit movements in the putative open state are consistent with the hinge-bending movement detected by cryo-EM. As discussed in the text and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, TM1 is the only connection between the TM region and the cytoplasmic domain. Logically, the large rearrangements in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensor are likely translated to the channel pore via hinge bending in TM1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
