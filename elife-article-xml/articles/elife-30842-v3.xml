largely unknown. We previously found that DNA demethylation on p53-deficient background leads to transcription of repetitive heterochromatin elements, followed by an interferon response, a phenomenon we named TRAIN (Transcription of Repeats Activates INterferon). Here, we report that curaxin, an anticancer small molecule, destabilizing nucleosomes via disruption of histone/DNA interactions, also induces TRAIN. Furthermore, curaxin inhibits oncogene-induced transformation and tumor growth in mice in an interferon-dependent manner, suggesting that anticancer activity of curaxin, previously attributed to p53-activation and NF-kappaB-inhibition, may also involve induction of interferon response to epigenetic derepression of the cellular ‘repeatome’. Moreover, we observed that another type of drugs decondensing chromatin, HDAC inhibitor, also induces TRAIN. Thus, we proposed that TRAIN may be one of the mechanisms ensuring epigenetic integrity of mammalian cells via elimination of cells with desilenced chromatin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>TRAIN</kwd><kwd>CBL0137</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>curaxin</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1CA197967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurova</surname><given-names>Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA198395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurova</surname><given-names>Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-15-01526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yakubovskaya</surname><given-names>Marianna G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001320</institution-id><institution>Roswell Park Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA016056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurova</surname><given-names>Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Incuron LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurova</surname><given-names>Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Type I interferon signaling protects cells from the loss of epigenetic integrity, since it is activated in cells in response to accumulation of transcripts originating from normally silenced heterochromatin, caused by small-molecule-mediated nucleosome unfolding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Control of the integrity of genetic information in cells includes the activation of the DNA damage response, DNA-repair pathways and elimination of cells with damaged DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Lindahl, 2016</xref>]). The control of the integrity of epigenetic information is equally important and critical for the development and function of multicellular organisms, but far less studied. Epigenetic information is stored as chromatin, the highly organized complex of DNA, histone proteins and their chemical modifications (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miska and Ferguson-Smith, 2016</xref>]). Destabilization of chromatin should lead to the dysregulation of the cellular transcriptional program and loss of cell identity. One of the examples that demonstrate the high stability of the cellular epigenome is the well-known, extremely low efficiency of reprogramming of differentiated cells (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebrahimi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hussein and Nagy, 2012</xref>]). Another example is the absence of one common ‘cancer cell’ phenotype: transcriptome analysis has clearly demonstrated that tumors, including cell lines propagated for years in culture, bear easily identifiable traits of the tissue of origin in their transcriptional program (TCGA data). Nonetheless, we do not know what mechanisms control the stability of chromatin in cells, that is, whether there is any stress response to chromatin destabilization or negative selection against cells that lose epigenetic integrity.</p><p>One of the reasons for this deficit was the absence of tools to induce ‘chromatin damage’ without simultaneous introduction of DNA damage. This possibility appeared, when we found anticancer small molecules, known as curaxins, that were able to cause chromatin disassembly in cells in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). These small molecules were identified in a phenotype-based screening for the ability to simultaneously activate p53 and inhibit NF-kappaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>). Our search for the mechanism of action of curaxins resulted in the discovery that curaxins bind DNA via intercalation of the carbazole body accompanied by the protrusion of two side chains into the major groove and a third side chain into the minor groove of DNA. Curaxins have no effect on DNA chemical structure, that is, they do not cause any DNA damage in mammalian cells. However, their binding to DNA changes both the helical shape and flexibility of DNA and reduces its negative charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The structural unit of chromatin in eukaryotic cells is the nucleosome, which consists of a core of positively charged histone proteins wrapped in negatively charged DNA. The stability of the nucleosome is based on the electrostatic interactions between the histones and phosphate backbone of DNA, which are supported by several precise spatially-oriented points of contact between histone amino acids and the base pairs of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). When nucleosomal DNA is unwrapped, histone octamer becomes unstable due to the repulsion of the positively charged histones from each other. Alterations of DNA helical shape, charge and flexibility, caused by curaxins, force DNA to dissociate from the octamer in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). At lower concentrations of curaxin CBL0137, DNA is first unfolded from the outer parts of the nucleosome, that is, from H2A/H2B dimers located at both sides of the inner H3/H4 tetramer, which leads to the detachment of the H2A/H2B dimer(s) and exposure of the surface of the H3/H4 tetramer. At higher CBL0137 concentrations, DNA is unwrapped from the inner H3/H4 tetramer, which leads to complete nucleosome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). At genomic regions where the DNA helix loses histones, it becomes significantly under twisted, which in principle may be alleviated by topoisomerases or free rotation of DNA. However, in cells, free rotation is impossible due to the length of DNA and the binding to multiple proteins. Moreover, topoisomerases cannot cleave DNA in the presence of curaxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). Under these conditions, the excessive energy of negative supercoiling causes base unpairing and DNA transition from B-DNA into alternative non-B DNA structures. We have shown a massive transition of right-handed B-DNA in cells treated with curaxin CBL0137 into the left-handed Z-DNA form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, treatment of cells with CBL0137 leads to dose-dependent destabilization and disassembly of chromatin in the absence of DNA damage and, most importantly, of the classical DNA damage response, providing an opportunity to study how a cell reacts to chromatin damage and the role of chromatin perturbations in the anticancer activity of curaxins.The first type of response that we observed in curaxin-treated cells was the activation of p53, a well-known reaction of cells to DNA damage. However, no phosphorylation of p53 N-terminal serines, which are obligatory markers of the DNA damage response, was detected in curaxin-treated cells. Furthermore, there was no activation of DNA-damage-sensitive kinases, such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK. Instead, p53 in curaxin-treated cells was phosphorylated at serine 392 by casein kinase 2 (CK2) that formed a complex with the histone chaperone Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>). FACT consists of two conservative proteins present in all eukaryotes, Suppressor of Ty 16 (SPT16) and Structure Specific Recognition Protein 1 (SSRP1). In basal conditions FACT is involved in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>), (Gurova and Studitsky, 2018; in preparation). Human FACT binds poorly intact nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsunaka et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>) however, it may bind histone oligomers via different domains of SSRP1 and SPT16, when they become exposed during transcription (Gurova and Studitsky, 2018; in preparation). FACT binding prevents histone oligomers from dissociating while DNA is transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>). We have found that nucleosome disassembly caused by curaxin opens multiple FACT-binding sites, which are normally hidden inside the nucleosome. Chromatin unfolding occurs first in heterochromatic regions, and all cellular FACT is rapidly relocated into these regions and depleted from the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). We named this phenomenon chromatin-trapping or c-trapping. Although curaxins do not bind and inhibit FACT directly, they cause exhaustion of FACT by trapping it in heterochromatin. Therefore, c-trapping is equivalent to functional FACT inhibition. We also observed that FACT not only binds partially disassembled nucleosomes but also Z-DNA via the CID (c-terminal intrinsically disordered) domain of the SSRP1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, it was already known that the immediate neighboring domain, HMG (high mobility group), also binds non-B DNA, bent or cruciform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gariglio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krohn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yarnell et al., 2001</xref>). In all cases of SSRP1 binding to DNA, there is a CK2-mediated signal for p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krohn et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, c-trapping may be part of the general response to the destabilization of chromatin and may serve to recruit FACT to the regions of potential nucleosome loss to prevent this loss and to restore chromatin structure.</p><p>However, there are many unclear issues within this model. Among the most immediate are two related questions: (i) what are the consequences, besides c-trapping, of nucleosome destabilization and chromatin unfolding in cells? (ii) Are all the effects of curaxins explained by the functional inactivation of FACT? In this study, we tried to answer these questions starting from the comparison of the effects of CBL0137 on transcription. We found that independently of the presence of FACT, CBL0137 activates transcription from heterochromatic regions normally silenced in cells, including centromeric and pericentromeric repeats and endogenous retroviral elements, associated with accumulation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) in cells and activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response. This phenomenon, named TRAIN (Transcription of Repeats Activates INterferon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>) was observed previously upon DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guryanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). Although IFN activation has been traditionally viewed as part of an antiviral defense, TRAIN may present a more general cell response to the problems with chromatin organization in cells or a defense against loss of epigenetic integrity. We proposed that the reason for TRAIN in CBL0137-treated cells may be the direct effect of the drug on nucleosome structure leading to the opening of chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Treatment with CBL0137 changes transcription of genes in FACT-positive and -negative tissues</title><p>The effect of CBL0137 on gene expression may be due to its binding to DNA and the unfolding of chromatin or due to the functional inhibition of FACT. To detect the potential FACT-independent effects of CBL0137, we sought to compare gene expression profiles in FACT-positive and -negative cells before and after CBL0137 treatment. All tumor and non-tumor cell lines tested to date express FACT subunits at different levels. The suppression of FACT expression with shRNA resulted in either partial reduction of FACT expression or complete knockdown of FACT in only a fraction of cells, which were quickly overgrown by FACT-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dermawan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>). To overcome this problem, we tested the effect of CBL0137 in vivo in tissues that either naturally express FACT or not. Liver and lung were selected as FACT-negative, and spleen and testis were used as FACT-positive tissues ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Surprisingly, very few genes changed expression in the testis (FACT-positive organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which may be due to either limited accumulation of the drug in testis as the result of the blood-testis barrier (‘Sertoli cell barrier’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mruk and Cheng, 2015</xref>) or the specific chromatin structure in most cells of this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu and Chu, 2008</xref>).

Many transcripts in two or three organs increased similarly in a dose-dependent manner in response to CBL0137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that there may be a common pathway(s) induced by CBL0137 independently of FACT. To identify this pathway(s), we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Molecular Signature Database (Broad Institute). The interferon (IFN) signaling pathway was upregulated in response to doses above 30 mg/kg in all organs except testis, which was not analyzed due to the low number of upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata6">6</xref>).

Based on the literature, the kinetics of the IFN response are different depending on the inducer, with viral components and cytokines being the quickest (minutes – several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silin et al., 2009</xref>]), followed by DNA damage (16–48 hr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brzostek-Racine et al., 2011</xref>]), and demethylating agents (&gt;48 hr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>]). To compare the effect of CBL0137 vis-à-vis these stimuli, we assessed the kinetics of induction of the IFN response after CBL0137 treatment. We first measured <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA in the spleen and lung of mice treated with three doses of CBL0137 for 24, 48, or 96 hr before organ collection. The peak of induction was already seen at 24 hr following treatment with either 60 or 90 mg/kg CBL0137, while 30 mg/kg showed slower kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Similar kinetics were observed at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, the CBL0137-induced IFN response is faster than that reported with other small molecules and is closer to the response observed with biologicals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased expression of IFN-responsive genes induced by CBL0137 is dependent on IFN signaling</title><p>Experiments with mice demonstrated that CBL0137 caused a rapid and robust induction of the IFN response in all tissues of mice that were tested.

Since different components of the IFN response are frequently inactivated in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kulaeva et al., 2003</xref>), we employed a reporter assay that detected an IFN response through the activation of a consensus IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE), which drove the expression of mCherry or luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imam et al., 1990</xref>).

However, our attempts to detect IFNs (alpha, beta or gamma) in the plasma of mice treated with CBL0137 or in cell culture medium failed, which may be due to the short half-life, low levels of IFNs even after induction, or both. To overcome this limitation and to test whether the induction of IFN responsive transcription after CBL0137 treatment was due to IFNs, we used cells with different components of the IFN signaling pathway inactivated, such as MEF from mice with a knockout of either the type I IFN receptor (via <italic>Ifnar1</italic>) or <italic>Irf1</italic>, or MEF with shRNA to <italic>Irf7</italic> (transcription factors controlling the expression of IFN-responsive genes in response to IFN).

There are several ways by which cells can detect viral invasion. First, viral dsRNA can be detected by several intra-cellular receptors, such as TLR3, 7 or 8, RIG1, and MDA5 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unterholzner, 2013</xref>]). Additionally, the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm or non-B DNA, such as left-handed Z-DNA, found in some viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nordheim and Rich, 1983</xref>) can also be recognized by a cell as a viral infection. In the latter case, the IFN response is activated via Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), also known as the DNA-dependent activator of IFN (DAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takaoka et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, we have recently shown that high doses of CBL0137 caused disassembly of nucleosomes in cells, which led to the extensive negative supercoiling of DNA and a transition from B-DNA into left-handed Z-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). Although this effect was observed at significantly higher CBL0137 concentrations (&gt;2.5 μM) than that which induced an IFN response, we investigated whether the induction of Z-DNA transition by CBL0137 could be responsible for its effect on the IFN response. To do this, we deleted the <italic>ZBP1</italic> gene from HeLa and HT1080 cells using CRISP/Cas9 recombinase and two human ZBP1 gRNAs. The loss of <italic>ZBP1</italic> expression was confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We compared the effect of CBL0137 on ISRE-mCherry reporter activity in these cells to wild-type cells and cells transduced with control gRNA and observed insignificant changes in the induction of the reporter activity 48 hr after CBL0137 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, there was no Z-DNA present in the cells treated with CBL0137 doses that caused a robust IFN response as judged by the absence of staining with Z-DNA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, we concluded that Z-DNA transition induced by CBL0137 does not play role in the induction of IFN response in CBL0137-treated cells.</p><p>We next determined whether dsRNA induced an IFN response in CBL0137-treated cells. Using an antibody to dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Targett-Adams et al., 2008</xref>), we observed increased staining in CBL0137-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). One potential endogenous source of dsRNA may be from the transcription of repetitive elements, such as endogenous retroviruses, centromeric, or pericentromeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>). Transcription of these elements may be enhanced as a result of nucleosome destabilization and chromatin unfolding caused by CBL0137. Short Interspersed Nuclear Element (SINE) retrotransposons constitute one of the main components of the genomic repetitive fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramerov and Vassetzky, 2011</xref>). Hence, we first tested whether transcription of B1 SINE is increased upon CBL0137 treatment using northern blotting. In samples of untreated MEFs, binding of the B1 probe was detected for a number of different length transcripts, possibly due to the presence of B1 repeats within the introns of multiple mRNAs. After CBL0137 treatment, a single lower molecular weight band appeared that was strongly bound by the B1 probe and was similar in size and abundance to the band in cells treated with the positive control (5-aza-cytidine (5-aza)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine whether other transcripts that can form dsRNAs appear in cells treated with CBL0137, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis using total RNA from wild-type and <italic>Trp53</italic>-/- MEF treated with CBL0137 in vitro or lungs from mice collected 24 hr after treatment with 60 mg/kg CBL0137 in vivo.

We treated MEF and HeLa-TI cells with TSA or CBL0137 and monitored the activation of IFN signaling by RT-PCR in MEF or ISRE-mCherry reporter in Hela-TI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). In MEF cells, both TSA and CBL0137 induced expression of <italic>Ifit3</italic> and <italic>Irf7</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), while in HeLa-TI cells, the robust induction of ISRE reporter was evident only after CBL0137 treatment. TSA caused only a weak increase in ISRE reporter activity (1.5 folds versus &gt;5 folds for CBL0137) only at the highest concentration (500 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) when evidence of toxicity was present. At the same time, the degree of activation of the silenced GFP in HeLa-TI cells was similar for TSA and CBL0137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, although GFP expression was increased by both agents, the mechanisms of chromatin opening were different for TSA and CBL0137. As expected, TSA treatment caused an increase in acetylated histone H3 levels, while CBL0137 decreased the amount of chromatin-bound histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, as we saw previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>), substantial loss of core histones (i.e. chromatin disassembly) was observed with approximately 5 μM CBL0137, which is much higher than the concentrations at which we observed TRAIN (0.5–1 μM). We proposed that nucleosome ‘opening,’ that is, the state of loose contact between the DNA and histone core without loss of histones from the core (proposed in the review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zlatanova et al., 2009</xref>]), may be enough to create conditions for TRAIN. Namely, no nucleosome disassembly or dissociation of nucleosome parts is needed. Although there is no clear definition of an opened and a closed nucleosome state, the closed nucleosome in cells is additionally ‘locked’ by the linker histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Syed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we investigated how the distribution of H1 is changed upon treatment with CBL0137 using imaging of live cells that express m-Cherry-tagged histone H1.5. CBL0137 treatment led to a redistribution of H1.5 from the chromatin to the nucleoli, similarly to the effect of CBL0137 on core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>) but this phenomenon was observed at a faster and at much lower CBL0137 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). TRAIN in CBL0137-treated cells was observed at the same concentration range as redistribution of histone H1 and before the disassembly of the nucleosome core, suggesting that nucleosome opening is sufficient to allow the transcription of heterochromatic regions in cells. Thus, we observed the presence of TRAIN using different chromatin modifying agents; however, its degree depends on cell type and the mode of chromatin opening.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30842.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>CBL0137 treatment leads to displacement of histone H1.</title><p>Live cell imaging of HT1080 cells expressing mCherry-tagged H1.5 and GFP-tagged SSRP1.

We explained this effect by the fact that CBL0137 inhibited NF-kappaB and activated p53, both well-established mechanisms of cancer prevention (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athar et al., 2011</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2010</xref>]). However, activation of IFN may be an additional mechanism to eliminate transformed cells, because they are more sensitive to IFN-mediated apoptosis than normal cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parker et al., 2016</xref>]).

CBL0137 was identified in a cell-based screen, and some of its effects, such as activation of p53 and inhibition of NF-kappaB, functional inactivation of FACT, and higher toxicity to tumor than normal cells, were already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dermawan et al., 2016</xref>). However, recently, we demonstrated that binding of CBL0137 to DNA destabilizes nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo, leading to histone eviction and chromatin decondensation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). Since CBL0137 does not cause chemical DNA modifications and has no effect on transcription and replication of naked DNA in vitro at the concentrations used in this study, this creates a unique situation to assess how ‘chromatin damage’ influences transcription.</p><p>First, we would like to define here ‘chromatin damage’ as a change in the original chromatin composition that is artificially induced by a drug or other experimental manipulations. In the case of CBL0137, this occurs most probably in a few continuous phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). At lower concentrations of CBL0137 (&lt;1 μM in cells), the nucleosome ‘opens,’ loses the linker histone H1 without dissociation or loss of core histones. At higher CBL0137 concentrations (1–5 μM), dimer detachment occurs with occasional loss of core histones. We clearly saw this stage in vitro as the appearance of hexasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). At CBL0137 concentrations greater than 5 μM, the nucleosome is disassembled, and core histones are evicted from the chromatin. This sequence of events is in line with the reversibility of the toxic effects of CBL0137. Indeed, after a short incubation with &lt;1 μM CBL0137, the drug can be washed from the cells with almost no harm to the cells; cells incubated with 1–3 μM CBL0137 for no more than 1 hr survive with some loss of viability. However, treatment with &gt;5 μM CBL0137 for more than 15 min leads to complete cell death after 48 hr, which is in line with the complete disassembly of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). An important and completely unknown question is what causes cell death upon loss of chromatin integrity.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30842.025</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed scheme of nucleosome states in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of CBL0137 (<bold>A</bold>) and associated biological processes in cells (<bold>B</bold>).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30842-fig10-v3"/></fig><p>Other cellular ‘responses’ to CBL0137 treatment are also aligned with a gradual change in nucleosome organization. The first cellular factor that we found, ‘reacting’ to the problems with chromatin packaging in CBL0137-treated cells, was histone chaperone FACT, which underwent c-trapping in response to nucleosome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). It was shown that human FACT cannot bind and uncoil a ‘closed’ nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsunaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valieva et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, nucleosome opening most probably allows FACT to invade the nucleosome and bind the H3/H4 tetramer via the middle domain of SPT16 and the H2A/H2B dimer via the c-terminal portions of both subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kemble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsunaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winkler and Luger, 2011</xref>). In cells, we see this as SPT16-mediated ‘n (nucleosome)-trapping,’ which is observed at 0.3–1 μM CBL0137. At CBL0137 concentrations greater than 3 μM, significant negative supercoiling, as a result of nucleosome disassembly, caused base-unpairing of DNA and the transition of B-DNA into left-handed Z-form DNA, which is bound by FACT via the c-terminal intrinsically disordered domain of SSRP1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safina et al., 2017</xref>). FACT has a plethora of activities related to transcription (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinberg and Sims, 2006</xref>], [Gurova and Studitsky, 2018; in preparation). Therefore, many CBL0137 effects on transcription might be explained by the functional inactivation of FACT. However, we suspected that opening of chromatin might have consequences independent on FACT.</p><p>The most prominent and uniform change observed in the presence and absence of FACT was activation of the IFN response in all tested organs and cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. The induction of IFN-sensitive genes (ISG) has a bell-shaped curve, with a maximum increase at a CBL0137 concentration of approximately 0.5–1 μM, which corresponds to nucleosome ‘opening’ followed by the inhibition of transcription at concentrations greater than 1 μM, when nucleosome disassembly starts. We believe that IFN is activated in response to the dsRNA formed due to the increased transcription from normally silenced constitutive heterochromatin. There was a report that proposed the role of histone H1 in the silencing of ISGs where knockdown of the H1 chaperone TAF1 in cells resulted in H1 loss from ISG promoters and activation of their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kadota and Nagata, 2014</xref>). However, the set of data in that report does not exclude the role of general chromatin decondensation due to the reduction of H1 deposition in heterochromatin. We showed that in the case of CBL0137, transcription of ISGs is abrogated if the IFN signaling pathway is disabled (e.g. <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-/- cells and mice), suggesting that there is no direct effect of CBL0137 on the promoters of ISGs. If we assume that IFN is activated in response to increased transcription of ‘repeatome’, then the puzzling and intriguing question is why nucleosome ‘opening’ is accompanied by selective activation of transcription of these elements, but not most genes, while nucleosome disassembly leads to the inhibition of transcription genome-wide. We propose that displacement of histone H1 may make heterochromatin accessible for RNA polymerase, while accessibility of genomic regions not locked with H1 does not change. The inhibition may be explained by a direct effect of higher concentrations of CBL0137, bound to DNA, on RNA polymerase activity, but this requires further investigation.</p><p>Importantly, the anticancer effect in mice is seen at concentrations that activate the IFN response, suggesting that chromatin opening without chromatin disassembly is enough to cause an anticancer effect in vivo. Activation of the IFN response by CBL0137 also creates an opportunity to use IFN-responsive factors as pharmacodynamic markers of curaxin activity in the clinic, since many of these factors are secreted and were detected in the plasma of mice.</p><p>Thus, curaxins, compounds with established anticancer activity in multiple preclinical models, may also be used as a tool to affect chromatin organization and folding globally in cells and animals to study the consequences of an abrupt loss of epigenetic regulation in vivo. Potentially, this property of curaxins may be useful for reprogramming and other types of therapeutic epigenetic manipulations.</p><p>One more important aspect of this study was the expansion of the set of situations when the TRAIN response occurs. Previously, we and others observed TRAIN upon loss of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guryanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>), mostly in the case of p53 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we observed that general chromatin decondensation due to nucleosome opening is also accompanied by TRAIN. Based on this data, we propose that TRAIN may be a more general response to the problems associated with chromatin packaging and the danger of the loss of epigenetic integrity. The stability of the cell differentiation status, which can still be easily detected even in HeLa cells after more than 60 years in culture, is a long-standing puzzle. Theoretically, stability can be ensured either by the low rate of error in the replication of chromatin marks or by an auto-regulatory mechanism that eliminates cells with lost epigenetic information, similar to p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. It is tempting to speculate that TRAIN may be such a mechanism, triggered by elevated expression of silenced repetitive genomic elements and executed by the IFN response, which is capable of killing cells. It is likely that this mechanism evolved in response to real viral threats, especially in the form of the expansion of endogenous retroviral elements. This mechanism may serve as an epigenetic lock, which supports the differentiation state and limits cell plasticity and, therefore, the ability to transdifferentiate and regenerate organs and tissues, as well as to undergo epigenetic transitions associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, reagents, and plasmids</title><p>CBL0137 was provided by Incuron, LLC.

MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip array (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for hybridization. The TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Mouse kit (Illumina) was used for library preparation. Sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Gene expression data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX for microarray hybridization and Strand NGS for RNA-sequencing (Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA). GSEA was done using MSigDB (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Defaults statistical methods recommended by the programs were used.</p><p>The GRCm38.p5 (Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Reference 38) assembly was used for all mouse data, and the set of annotated repeat types was taken from the Repbase database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2008</xref>). Sailfish version 0.6.3 aligner was used to quantify the abundance of previously annotated RNA transcripts from RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patro et al., 2014</xref>). Analyses were performed with a modified k-mer size of k = 17 and used 16 concurrent threads (p 16). Sailfish was run with the poly-A option, which discards k-mers consisting of k consecutive A’s or T’s, and bias correction was enabled. Importantly, a read was associated with a particular 'repeat' type if it satisfied the following criteria: (a) The read aligned to a single or multiple locations within the canonical sequence of that repeat type, or annotated instances of that repeat type within the genome, incorporating 13 bp (half of the read length) genomic sequences flanking the annotated instances. (b) No alignment of such or better quality to canonical or instance sequences associated with any other annotated repeat types could be obtained. An optional masking procedure, designed to exclude reads potentially originating from un-annotated repeat types, added a third requirement. (c) No alignment of such or better quality to any portion of the genome assembly that is not associated with the annotated instances of that repeat type could be obtained. Collectively, the combined repeat assembly file contained a single FASTA entry for each repeat type as defined in the Repbase database. The Transcripts per Million quantification number was computed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qian and Huang, 2005</xref>) and is meant as an estimate of the number of transcripts, per million observed transcripts, originating from each target transcript. Its benefit over the F/RPKM measure is that it is independent of the mean expressed transcript length (i.e. if the mean expressed transcript length varies between samples, for example, this alone can affect differential analysis based on the K/RPKM). Finally, we used the variational Bayesian EM algorithm integrated into sailfish, rather than the ‘standard’ EM algorithm, to optimize abundance estimates. p-Values were corrected using an FDR correction using Baggerley test {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baggerly et al. (2003)</xref> #450} for samples with replicates (wild-type MEF and lung) and Kal’s Z-test {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kal et al. (1999)</xref> #449} on samples without replicates (p53-/- MEF).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Unpaired t-test was used for comparison of quantitative data between control and experimental groups. Analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC) and all p-values are two-sided.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>All experiments were reviewed and approved by the Roswell Park IACUC. Mice were maintained in the Laboratory Animal Shared Resource with controlled air, light, and temperature conditions, and fed ad libitum with free access to water. NIH Swiss and C57Bl/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).</p><p>For the analysis of gene expression, groups of two mice (male or female, 6–8 weeks old) were treated intravenously with one dose of CBL0137 dissolved in 5% dextrose using the tail vein. Control mice received an injection of 5% dextrose.</p><p>For the comparison of the efficacy of different doses of CBL0137, SCID mice (male, 6–8 weeks old) were inoculated in both flanks with 10<sup>6</sup> HepG2 cells in PBS. When tumors reach ~50 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized into four groups (n = 5). Sample size was calculated by power analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Festing and Altman, 2002</xref>) using power of 95%, expected difference in control and treated groups of two-folds and standard deviation of 40% of mean value. Treatment was administered intravenously once a week.</p><p>For the comparison of CBL0137 anti-cancer efficacy depending on the presence of IFN response, groups of C57Bl/6 mice with wild type <italic>Ifnar1</italic> or <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-/- were inoculated subcutaneously into one flank with 750,000 p53-/- MEF cells, <italic>Ifnar1</italic> wild type or <italic>Ifnar1</italic>-/- transformed with HRasV12, 10 mice for each combination of mouse and tumor genotypes. Tumors were measured every day. When tumor in any mouse reached 50 mm<sup>3</sup>, this mouse was assigned to treatment group, first for 50 mg/kg CBL0137, second for vehicle (5% dextrose) and so on until five mice were accumulated in each group. Treatment was done via tail vein injection once a week for 3 weeks.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Incuron LLC (KG), and by National Cancer Institute grants R01CA197967 (KG) and P30CA016056 (Roswell Park Cancer Center).

This group and others previously showed that demethylation of DNA results in transcription of repetitive elements that generate dsRNA and an IFN response. The authors now demonstrate that the tumor suppressive activity of curaxin is partially independent of p53 through TRAIN. They also indicate that it is independent of FACT, which had previously been identified as a putative target. Using microarray analysis, Leonova et al. find that curaxin induces the IFN pathway in the liver, lung, and spleen, consistently. They go on to show that several ISGs are upregulated on the order of hours rather than days in mouse tissues as well as mouse and human cell lines. The authors also demonstrate that this induction does not happen in transformed cell lines. The authors next show that increased IFN signaling in response to CBL0137 is associated with increased levels of dsRNA, potentially from transcription of repetitive elements, some of which are induced to similar levels as with HDAC inhibitors. Finally, the authors show that in a Ras-driven model, colony formation is impeded in the absence of p53, but not in the absence of p53 and IFNAR1.</p><p>After discussion, the reviewers assessed that, in its present form, the manuscript did not provide enough new knowledge relative to the previous manuscripts by these teams on CBL0137 and TRAIN, as IFN induction by derepression of heterochromatin, and subsequent production of dsRNAs, has been demonstrated by this group and others in a number of settings. In view of the severity of these concerns, we would welcome a quick response from you as to the feasibility of the essential additional work. Please document your ability to perform the additional animal work within a reasonable length of time in order to persuade the reviewers that recommended &quot;revision&quot; is justified.</p><p>If these experiments will require a substantial effort, it may be best to withdraw your submission to a future date or to another journal.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1) The main concern is that there is little if any proof that TRAIN is actually required for the anti-tumor properties of curaxin. The last figure of the paper hints at this by testing the impact of depletion of the IFNA receptor (in a p53 null background) on RAS-transformed MEF foci. The authors conclude that TRAIN 'impacts on the tumor-preventive activity of curaxin', but there MEF foci formation assays cannot be equated to tumorigenesis. Given that the authors have already involved FACT and p53 as potential mediators of drug action, what is the relative importance of TRAIN in the potential therapeutic action of the drug? The reviewers considered this to be a critical question that would require new experiments in animal models to assess the relative contribution of each of the pathways to the therapeutic action of the drug.</p><p>2) Another major concern is regarding the conclusion that 'TRAIN occurs in response to chromatin opening'. This conclusion if unfounded, as a cause-effect relationship between curaxin, HDAC inhibitors, chromatin opening and TRAIN cannot be established. Curaxin and HDAC inhibitors could be acting by other mechanisms beyond loosening nucleosomes to activate TRAIN. To prove that nucleosome opening is the key intermediate in the 'signaling pathway' seems impossible to demonstrate experimentally. As such, there is a correlation here, but no cause-effect relationship. The manuscript should be carefully rewritten to avoid making cause-effect relationships from these correlative observations.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show that CBL0137 up-regulates ISGs in vivo in a FACT- independent manner; by examining 2 FACT-positive and 2 FACT-negative mouse tissues. Three doses of CBL0137 were used correlating to &quot;weak, intermediate, and strong&quot; anti-cancer activity. However, the lowest dose used, 30mg/kg actually increased tumor growth (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some explanation for this should be stated in the text. The next two highest doses of CBL0137 (60 and 90mg/kg) did reduce tumor growth.</p><p>4) Only one gene (IFIT3) was up-regulated in all four organs (lung, spleen, liver, testis) by the Venn diagram, very few genes were affected in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), yet IFITm3 was also up-regulated in all four organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Some explanation for including IFITm3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> should be provided in the text, while mentioning IFIT3 and IFITm3 are unrelated IFN inducible proteins.</p><p>6) CBL0137 induced an IFN response in normal mouse and human cells, but not in tumor cells. However, using an ISRE-reporter construct, activation of the ISRE could be detected indirectly in both mouse and human tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). It is suggested that failure to detect ISG up-regulation in tumor cells is due to inactivation of the IFN response. However, activation of ISREs should lead to up-regulation of endogenous ISGs, not just of the ISRE-reporter construct. Further explanation should be provided to account for this discrepancy. Is the reporter construct more sensitive to IFN than endogenous ISGs? A comparison of different low doses of exogenous IFN on the ISRE-reporter vs. endogenous ISGs might resolve this issue. This should be done on normal and tumor cells.</p><p>7) CBL0137 treatment greatly up-regulated levels of dsRNA from repetitive elements in the genome, including SINE B1 and LINE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We transformed MEF from <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> and wild-type C57BL/6 mice with mutant Ras (H-RasV12) and the p53 inhibitor, GSE56. The transformed cells were inoculated into either <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> or wild-type animals. Our goal was to treat all four groups with either vehicle control or CBL0137 to determine whether the efficacy of CBL0137 was dependent on the presence of Ifnar either in the tumors or the mice. This experiment demonstrated a significant difference in the growth of the tumors depending on their <italic>Ifnar1</italic> status. The fastest and most consistent tumor growth was observed for <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> tumors growing in <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> mice. The wild-type tumors grew approximately four times slower than the <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> tumors in <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> mice. Although the <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> tumors grew similarly in wild-type mice, only two tumors out of the five grew. Finally, wild-type tumors did not grow beyond 50-100 mm<sup>3</sup> during two months of observation. These data suggest that the IFN response plays an important role as a tumor suppressor. It is likely that this role is independent of its role in the immune system because the difference was observed on an <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> background. Based on the growth of these different tumor lines in mice, we were only able to compare the efficacy of CBL0137 in <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> mice. CBL0137 inhibited the growth of the wild-type tumors but only slowed down the growth of the <italic>Ifnar1-/-</italic> tumors, demonstrating that the IFN response plays a role in the anti-cancer activity of CBL0137. We included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9B and 9C</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another major concern is regarding the conclusion that 'TRAIN occurs in response to chromatin opening'.

Expression of IFIT3 or IRF7 only occurred at higher IFN doses.
