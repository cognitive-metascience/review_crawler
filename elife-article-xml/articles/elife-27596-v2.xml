Expression of mtDNA entails multi-step maturation of precursor RNA. In other systems, the RNA life cycle involves surveillance mechanisms, however, the details of RNA quality control have not been extensively characterised in human mitochondria. Using a mitochondrial ribosome profiling and mitochondrial poly(A)-tail RNA sequencing (MPAT-Seq) assay, we identify the poly(A)-specific exoribonuclease PDE12 as a major factor for the quality control of mitochondrial non-coding RNAs. The lack of PDE12 results in a spurious polyadenylation of the 3’ ends of the mitochondrial (mt-) rRNA and mt-tRNA. While the aberrant adenylation of 16S mt-rRNA did not affect the integrity of the mitoribosome, spurious poly(A) additions to mt-tRNA led to reduced levels of aminoacylated pool of certain mt-tRNAs and mitoribosome stalling at the corresponding codons. Therefore, our data uncover a new, deadenylation-dependent mtRNA maturation pathway in human mitochondria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27596.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27596.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial RNA</kwd><kwd>mitoribosome</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>mtPAP</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105697135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearce</surname><given-names>Sarah F</given-names></name><name><surname>Rorbach</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Haute</surname><given-names>Lindsey Van</given-names></name><name><surname>D’Souza</surname><given-names>Aaron R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rebelo-Guiomar</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name><name><surname>Minczuk</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Portugal, PD/BD/105750/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebelo-Guiomar</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brierley</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><name><surname>Firth</surname><given-names>Andrew E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Removal of spurious poly(A) tails by the PDE12 exoribonuclease is required to maintain the integrity of human mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs and their availability for efficient mitochondrial translation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes a subset of the structural polypeptides required for oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). The mitochondrial (mt-) mRNAs are transcribed and then translated within the mitochondrial matrix by highly specialised machinery. The RNA components of the intra-mitochondrial translation system, two mt-rRNAs and 22 mt-tRNAs, are also expressed from mtDNA. However, all protein components required for mtDNA expression are encoded by the nuclear genome and, upon translation on cytoplasmic ribosomes, are imported into mitochondria. In human mitochondria, mature mt-mRNA species carry a non-templated stretch of poly(A) residues of an average length of 45–55 nucleotides, with the exception of ND6, which does not contain a poly(A) tail. Adenylation of mt-mRNA is performed by mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (mtPAP, also known as PAPD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagaike et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tomecki et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, disruption of RNA polyadenylation in human mitochondria, due to mutations in mtPAP, has been linked to a neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crosby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During eukaryotic gene expression, polyadenylation of mRNAs is required for export of mature mRNAs from the nucleus, transcript stability and the ability of mRNAs to be translated. In contrast, in prokaryotes polyadenylation of RNA species generally serves as a signal for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rorbach et al., 2014</xref>). For 7 of the 13 human mt-mRNAs (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, CytB, COIII, and ATP6) 3’ polyadenylation is essential for completion of stop codons and, therefore, the open-reading frame. However, the requirement for longer poly(A) tails on most mt-mRNAs in human mitochondria is currently not fully understood.</p><p>Previously, ourselves and others have identified phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12) as a mitochondrial protein of the exonuclease/endonuclease/phosphate (EEP) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poulsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>). Recombinant PDE12 exhibited a 3’→5’ exoribonuclease activity on poly(A) homopolymers, and to a lesser extent on poly(U) homopolymers. It also specifically removed poly(A) tails from synthetic ND1 and COII transcripts, stopping 6–8 nt upstream of the polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with the in vitro data, when transgenic PDE12 was overexpressed in cultured cells poly(A) tails on mature mt-mRNAs were shortened. This shortening of poly(A) tails led to changes to steady-state levels of mt-RNAs in a transcript-specific manner, with deadenylation leading to an increase in steady-state levels of some transcripts (e.g. ND1, ND2) and a decrease of others (e.g. COI, COII). This suggested that the status and extent of polyadenylation of mt-mRNAs regulates the steady-state level of some mt-mRNAs. In addition, upon prolonged PDE12 overexpression, and associated loss of mt-mRNA polyadenylation, a general defect in mitochondrial translation was observed. Interestingly, overexpression of mitochondriallytargeted cytosolic deadenylase PARN also caused strong inhibition of intra-mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wydro et al., 2010</xref>). Although this may indicate that polyadenylation is also required for translation of mt-mRNAs (with the exception of ND6), analysis of mt-mRNAs revealed that loss of polyadenylation was accompanied with a loss of stop codons for transcripts lacking 3’ UTRs, as their completion relies on polyadenylation. This removal of the stop codons complicated the assertion that shortening of poly(A) tails led directly to the observed translation defect. Additionally, ablation of a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein LRPPRC in a mouse model resulted in deadenylation of mt-mRNA with no universal effect on translation, suggesting that translation of some mammalian mitochondrial transcripts can be effective even in the absence of a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruzzenente et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In order to further investigate the role of PDE12 and RNA polyadenylation in mitochondrial gene expression, we ablated PDE12 in human cells. Unexpectedly, the absence of the PDE12 poly(A)-specific exoribonuclease did not have any effect on the mitochondrial messenger RNA poly(A) tail length, nor its stability. Instead, we observed that PDE12 was required to remove spurious adenylation of the 3’ end of 16S mt-rRNA and mt-tRNAs. While the aberrant adenylation of 16S did not affect the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), next-generation RNA sequencing-assisted ribosome profiling of PDE12 knock-out cells revealed mitoribosome pausing at specific codons leading to a strong mitochondrial translation defect. Subsequent analysis revealed substantially lower levels of certain aminoacylated mt-tRNAs as a result of spurious adenylation of their 3’ ends. We conclude that a unique deadenylation pathway exists in human mitochondria, which is required for maintaining the proper pool of mt-tRNAs by removing 3’ end poly(A) tails after promiscuous adenylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDE12 is required for efficient mitochondrial gene expression</title><p>In order to investigate the effects of the absence of PDE12, we produced a gene knockout in HEK293 cells using genome editing by a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN). We generated a heterozygous cell line which contained a single indel at the PDE12 gene locus (PDE12+/−) and a PDE12−/− cell line containing two indels, which produced protein-terminating frameshifts. Western blotting confirmed the absence of PDE12 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We observed a reduction in the steady-state levels of marker OxPhos subunits for complexes I, III and IV in PDE12−/− suggesting a combined defect in OxPhos complex synthesis and/or assembly in the absence of PDE12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, the cellular respiration was impaired in cells lacking PDE12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further confirmed the compromised OxPhos performance by culturing cells in media containing galactose as the sole carbon source, forcing them to rely more on mitochondrial ATP production. Under these conditions, the growth rate of PDE12−/− cells was greatly reduced as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also detected a reduction in mitochondrial translation in PDE12−/− as compared to either PDE12+/+ or PDE12+/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Quantification of a subset of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met-labeled translation products indicated that longer mitochondrial translation products were affected to a greater degree than the shorter products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This indicated that either the initiation of longer mt-mRNAs is specifically affected or that the process of translation elongation is perturbed.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27596.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PDE12 is essential for efficient mitochondrial translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting for steady-state levels of OxPhos components in PDE12+/+, PDE12 ± and PDE12−/− cells, and in PDE12−/− expressing either wild-type PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant at increasing expression levels.

Similarly to the initially analysed clonal cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in these independently constructed PDE12 knock-out cell lines we also observed reductions in the steady-state levels of OxPhos components and in the rate of mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we used the Flp-In T-REx system to allow inducible expression of either the wildtype (WT), a catalytically-inactive mutant form of PDE12 (E351A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or mutants lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence (Δ16 and Δ23) that are not imported to mitochondria as confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As strong and prolonged overexpression of PDE12 had previously been shown to cause a defect in mitochondrial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>), we employed a range of doxycycline concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0 ng/ml) in order to titrate levels of PDE12 re-expression. Re-expression of WT PDE12 cDNA, but not the E351A, Δ16 and Δ23 mutants resulted in a rescue of the steady-state levels of OxPhos subunits, growth phenotypes and intra-mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This indicated that catalytically active, mitochondrially localised, PDE12 is required for efficient mitochondrial gene expression. As the negative effects on mitochondrial gene expression in PDE12−/− were not accompanied by a decrease in mtDNA copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it was concluded that a defect of either mitochondrial transcription or a post-transcriptional process was occurring in the absence of PDE12.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Ablation</italic> of PDE12 does not change mitochondrial messenger RNA steady-state level nor poly(A) tail length</title><p>We next sought to determine whether alterations to the mitochondrial transcriptome have led to the mitochondrial translation defect observed in the PDE12−/− cells. As PDE12 had previously been characterised as a poly(A)-specific mitochondrial exoribonuclease and its overexpression led to a decrease of poly(A) tail length and altered steady-state level of mt-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>), we set out to examine the effects of absence of PDE12 on mt-mRNAs. Our previously published data showed that under conditions of PDE12 overexpression, poly(A) tails on the ND1 and COII mt-mRNAs were shortened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>). However, in the absence of PDE12, no significant change to poly(A) tail length of either ND1 or COII was observed, when assayed either via mitochondrial poly(A) tail assay (MPAT) or circularisation RT-PCR (cRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Furthermore, no change in poly(A) length was observed for all further polyadenylated mt-mRNAs, assessed via northern blotting or MPAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

This observation was confirmed by the application of RNAseq to determine differential expression of mt-mRNAs in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). RNAseq also confirmed that anti-sense transcripts were not accumulating in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together these data suggest that neither changes in steady-state level or poly(A) tail length of mt-mRNAs are likely to be the underlying cause of the severe mitochondrial translation defect observed in PDE12−/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27596.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial mRNAs are unaffected by absence of PDE12.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Radioactive MPAT assay for ND1 and COII transcripts for PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/− with densitometric profile of tail length determined via ImageQuant.

Firstly, we performed sucrose-gradient fractionation of PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/− total cell lysates to determine if mt-mRNAs were correctly loaded on mitochondrial monosomes. We monitored migration of the 28S small (mt-SSU) and 39S large (mt-LSU) mitochondrial ribosomal subunits by western blotting for the mS18b and bL12 mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Migration of the mt-SSU and mt-LSU were further confirmed via northern blotting for the 12S and 16S mt-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis indicated that in both PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/−, the 55S monosome was formed correctly, migrating in fractions 12–15 of the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Northern blotting of mt-mRNAs indicated proper loading of ND1, ND2, COI and COII transcripts on the 55S monosome in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), despite severe reduction in their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Combined MRP western blotting and mt-mRNA and mt-rRNA northern blotting suggested accumulation of mitochondrial transcripts in the monosome fractions in PDE12−/− as compared to PDE12+/+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Together with the previous observation that translation of longer transcripts was more severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we next sought to determine whether the observed accumulation of mt-mRNA in the 55S monosome fractions was the result of stalled elongating mitoribosomes. We employed mitochondrial ribosome profiling to determine if elongating mitoribosomes in the PDE12−/− cells were stalling at specific points during translation. This approach detected highly increased incidence of mitochondrial ribosomal protected fragments (mtRPFs) centred on AAA and AAG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly to the universal genetic code, in human mitochondria AAA and AAG encode lysine (Lys). As a control for this analysis, we performed mitochondrial ribosomal profiling using the ΔFLP 143B cybrid cell line containing mtDNA, which carries a homoplasmic deletion between m.7,846 and m.9,748, resulting in the loss of one mt-tRNA, mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, in addition to a number of mt-mRNA genes (COII, ATP8/6 and COIII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gilkerson et al., 2008</xref>). This analysis revealed a comparable profile for accumulation of mtRPFs centred on AAA and AAG Lys codons as observed for PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further corroborate the observation of specific mitoribosome stalling on Lys codons, we analysed the mtRPF profile of the bicistronic ND4L/ND4 mt-mRNA in more detail. Translation of the ND4L/ND4 transcript results in the synthesis of both encoded proteins through separate initiation events. Importantly, the ND4L ORF does not contain any Lys codons, while the ND4 ORF contains 11 Lys codons. While synthesis of the shorter ND4L protein was not significantly altered in PDE12−/− compared to PDE12+/+, translation of the longer ND4 protein was severely reduced in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The mtRPF profile across the ND4L ORF was highly similar between PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/−, consistent with the lack of any Lys codons and no effect on intra-mitochondrial translation rate for ND4L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, distinct mtRPF peaks were present along the ND4 ORF in PDE12−/−, each corresponding to the location of a Lys codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that in the absence of PDE12 the mitoribosome is assembled correctly, with mitochondrial messengers being loaded on the 55S monosome, however, specific mitoribosomal stalling occurs, predominantly on Lys codons.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27596.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Knockout of PDE12 leads to increased stalling events on selected codons on mtDNA-encoded mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sedimentation of mitochondrial ribosomes on 10–30% isokinetic sucrose gradients for PDE12+/− and PDE12−/− cell lines.

Radioactive MPAT revealed that in PDE12−/− mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> harboured 6–9 nt 3’ extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of catalytically active PDE12, but not the E351A mutant, restored normal 3’ ends of mt-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to determine the primary RNA sequence of the 3' additions to mt-tRNAs in PDE12−/−, as well as to determine the transcriptome-wide effect of PDE12 inactivation on all mt-tRNAs, we employed MPAT combined with deep RNA sequencing (MPAT-Seq). This analysis revealed that the extended 3' ends of mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (MT-TK) were the result of spurious adenylation on the 3' ends of mature mt-tRNA molecules following CCA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, MPAT-Seq also revealed other mt-tRNAs were affected by spurious 3' adenylation in PDE12−/−, notable examples being mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> (MT-TS2) and mt-tRNA<sup>His</sup> (MT-TH), while others remained largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We corroborated the results of MPAT-Seq with conventional radioactive MPAT analysis for selected mt-tRNAs (mt-tRNA <sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>, <sup>His</sup>, <sup>-Glu</sup>, <sup>-Met</sup>, <sup>-Val</sup>), revealing a good agreement between the two approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Global analysis of the 3’ end extended proportion of molecules for each mt-tRNA revealed a general increase in the proportion of affected molecules in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The proportion of extended mt-tRNA molecules was reduced upon re-expression of catalytically active PDE12, but not the E351A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). High-resolution northern blotting showed that oligoadenylation of mt-tRNA in PDE12−/− cells leads to a significant reduction of mature mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> available for aminoacylation, presumably due to the large proportion of molecules extended on the 3' end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). The total steady-state levels of mature and oligoadenylated mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As CCA addition is required for aminoacylation of mt-tRNAs, it was expected that 3' extensions to the CCA would result in a reduction in the proportion of mt-tRNAs available for aminoacylation. Indeed, an aminoacylation assay based on the usage of low pH to distinguish between the aminoacyl-tRNA and the uncharged tRNA revealed severe reduction in the overall amount of charged mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). An alternative method for the measurement of tRNA charging based on periodate oxidation confirmed that only the correctly matured mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> could be aminoacylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also detected a reduction in the steady-state levels of mature mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, despite the presence of spurious 3' adenylation of mt-tRNA<sup>His</sup> in PDE12−/−, we did not detect any substantial reduction of the overall level of aminoacylation of this mt-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The amount of charged molecules for other mt-tRNAs remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that PDE12 is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the 3’ ends of mt-tRNAs, protecting them from spurious polyadenylation, with the lack of PDE12 leading to accumulation of dysfunctional mt-tRNAs and as a consequence reduced levels of mature mt-tRNAs available for aminoacylation and mitochondrial translation.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27596.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A subset of mt-tRNAs are affected by spurious 3’ adenylation in the absence of PDE12, leading to reduced aminoacylation of specific mt-tRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mt-tRNA structure depicting 3' extension determined via the radioactive MPAT (<bold>b</bold>) and MPAT-Seq (<bold>c</bold>).

Therefore, in PDE12−/− there could be selection pressure against mt-LSU which contained longer 3' extensions from forming 55S particles. However, 3' extensions profiles of 16S mt-rRNA are identical for the free mt-LSU and monosome fractions, indicating that longer 16S 3' extensions do not impede monosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In conclusion, oligoadenylate extensions to 16S mt-rRNA in PDE12−/− do not seem to negatively impact mitoribosome formation and the stalling of mitoribosome in the absence of PDE12 is likely to be predominantly caused by mt-tRNAs harbouring poly(A) extensions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Increased adenylation activity is detrimental for mitochondrial gene expression</title><p>Mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (mtPAP, PAPD1) is, thus far, the only identified human mitochondrial enzyme with a poly(A) polymerase activity. Therefore, we hypothesised that mtPAP contributes to the spurious adenylation observed on mt-tRNAs and 16S mt-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To determine if an increased expression of mtPAP exaggerates the effect of aberrant 3’ adenylation of non-coding mtRNAs, we generated cell lines inducibly expressing untagged human mtPAP protein in either the PDE12+/+ or PDE12−/− backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Lengthening of poly(A) tails on ND1 and COII was observed in both PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/− upon mtPAP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The extent of this increased polyadenylation was similar in PDE12+/+ and PDE12−/−, further supporting the evidence that PDE12 is not required for controlling the length of poly(A) tails of mt-mRNAs. Further MPAT-Seq analysis revealed that overexpression of mtPAP in control PDE12+/+ cells led to an increase in the proportion of mt-tRNAs which carry 3' extensions, with this increase being comparable to the levels observed in PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). However, induction of mtPAP expression in PDE12−/− led to a greatly increased general proportion of extended mt-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that PDE12 is required to deadenylate the mt-tRNAs erroneously modified by mtPAP. Overexpression of mtPAP also led to further lengthening of 3' extensions of 16S mt-rRNA in PDE12−/−, but not in PDE12+/+, suggesting that 16S mt-rRNA are protected from aberrant adenylation when PDE12 is present at endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). On the other hand, 3' adenylation of 12S mt-rRNA was affected to a similar extent by mtPAP overexpression in either PDE12+/+ or PDE12−/− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), supporting the previous notion of PDE12 not being involved in the maturation of 12S mt-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overexpression of mtPAP in PDE12+/+ led to mild reduction in mitochondrial translation and the steady-state levels of OxPhos subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), However, it is indistinguishable whether this is a result of increased mt-mRNA poly(A) tail length, 3' extension to 12S mt-rRNA, increased global 3’ adenylation to mt-tRNAs, or a combination of these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Nonetheless, upon mtPAP overexpression in PDE12−/− cells the defect in mitochondrial translation and the steady-state levels of the OxPhos components were exaggerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is consistent with further impairment of mt-tRNAs and 16S mt-tRNA 3’ ends by spurious polyadenylation when PDE12 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>), providing an additional support for the essential role of PDE12 in the deadenylation of mitochondrial non-coding RNAs upon incorrect modification of their 3’ ends.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27596.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Increased adenylation activity is detrimental to mitochondrial gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting for steady-state levels of OxPhos components and mtPAP (top).

(<bold>C–D</bold>) In order to test whether PDE12 participates in the biogenesis of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> in living cells, we have analysed the 3’ ends of this tRNA using the radioactive MPAT and MPAT-Seq assays in six conditions: control HEK293 cells, PDE12−/− cells, PDE12−/− cells complemented with wild-type PDE12 cDNA, PDE12−/− cells complemented with the catalytic mutant E351A, control HEK293 cells overexpressing mtPAP and PDE12−/− cells overexpressing mtPAP. Radioactive MPAT revealed that in control HEK293 cells a large proportion of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> molecules resolve at −1 nt compared to the 3’ end processing site, the direct product released from the 5’ cleavage of mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> by RNase P, consistent with the lack of both the DB and CCA in mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> ((<bold>C</bold>) - ‘mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>−1’). This confirms that cleavage of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>- mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> is likely to occur such that it leaves the overlapping nucleotide on mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> in a large proportion of the molecules.</p><p>The ratio of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> lacking DB compared to mature mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> carrying CCA ((<bold>C</bold>) - ‘mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>−1ACCA’) is not changed upon ablation of PDE12 (<bold>C</bold>). The analysis of the MPAT-Seq 3’ data revealed a drop in read count corresponding to DB in each condition tested, further supporting the presence of a substantial pool of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1, which lacks the DB (<bold>D</bold>). However, the proportion of mature mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1ACCA compared to that lacking the DB (mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>−1) appeared to be increased when mtPAP is overexpressed. This is consistent with the notion that mtPAP is involved in the process of adding the DB, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fiedler et al. (2015)</xref>. In all conditions, there is no evidence to suggest accumulation of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> species with just the DB added ((<bold>C</bold>) and (<bold>D</bold>), ‘mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1A’), suggesting that when the single ‘A’ DB is incorporated, the CCA extension is rapidly synthetized.</p><p>The proportion of ‘A’ incorporated at the ‘CC’ positions of the CCA extension in MPAT-Seq would be indicative of the proportion of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1 molecules which carry oligoadenylate extensions (‘mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>−1 A(n)”). However, no increase in the proportion of ‘A’ at these positions in the absence of PDE12 was observed, suggesting that mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1 A(n) is not accumulating in PDE12−/− cells (<bold>D</bold>). In the absence of PDE12, mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is polyadenylated, but only beyond the CCA according to MPAT-Seq (<bold>D</bold>), suggesting that while ablation of PDE12 does not appear to participate in DB incorporation, it does lead to accumulation of spurious adenylation beyond the CCA extensions as seen with other mt-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Together, our findings would support the role of mtPAP in providing the DB to the mt- tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1 repair substrate, as proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>), but that PDE12 is not absolutely required for the trimming of the poly(A) tail to provide the single A residue for the DB. It is possible therefore that either mtPAP only incorporates a single A residue before the CCA adding enzyme acts to add the CCA extension to complete maturation of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, or that other factors, for example ELAC2 proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>), act to remove the poly(A) tail added by mtPAP to the mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-1 precursor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27596.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27596.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27596-fig6-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In mammalian mitochondria, all RNA species are derived from long, polycistronic precursor RNAs following transcription of mtDNA. This implies that the key regulatory mechanisms governing their function must operate post-transcriptionally, yet our knowledge of these mechanisms is far from complete. Here, we discovered a novel role for deadenylation in human mitochondria, which is to remove promiscuous polyadenylaton from mitochondrial non-coding RNAs. Importantly, we show that this process is of significance for the maintenance of a proper pool of aminoacylated mt-tRNA, and in particular mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>. One of the major consequences of the lack of deadenylase activity is the frequent stalling of mitoribosomes, mainly at lysine codons, as revealed by the mitochondrial ribosome profiling approach, with defective intra-mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS occurring as a result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of poly(A) tails of mitochondrial messenger RNA</title><p>Poly(A) tails play a major regulatory role in determining the stability and translational efficiency of eukaryotic nuclear-encoded messenger RNAs. Exonucleolytic removal of poly(A) tails (deadenylation) is the rate-limiting step in mRNA decay in the cytosol, with the majority of deadenylation activity contributed by the Ccr4-Not and Pan2-Pan3 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Passmore and Taatjes, 2016</xref>). However, herein our comprehensive characterisation of mitochondrial messenger RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) did not reveal any appreciable changes in poly(A) tail or stability of mt-mRNAs in the absence of the PDE12 deadenylase, previously shown to localise to human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poulsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>). This strongly suggests that PDE12 is not involved in the maintenance and function of mt-mRNA in normal physiological conditions. It is possible that there are alternative deadenylases regulating the length of poly(A) tails on human mitochondrial protein-coding transcripts. Further studies will be required to elucidate how the length of poly(A) tails is controlled in human mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of deadenylation in the biogenesis of mitochondrial tRNA</title><p>During tRNA biogenesis, the nucleolytic removal of the 5’ leader and the 3’ trailer does not usually produce the complete tRNA and additional maturation steps of their ends are required. Of the most widespread is the post-transcriptional template-independent addition of CCA at the tRNA 3’ end. Furthermore, all tRNAs are subjected to extensive post-transcriptional nucleotide modifications, with mammalian mt-tRNAs harbouring approximately 7% of mt-tRNA chemically modified nucleotides by dedicated, nDNA-encoded enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Powell et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Suzuki and Suzuki, 2014</xref>). The energetic expenditure by the cell to achieve the full maturation of tRNAs, is presumably one of the reasons why their half-life is generally longer as compared to messenger RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deutscher, 2006</xref>). This might also justify the existence of tRNA repair mechanism described for other systems; it is advantageous for the cells to repair a partially damaged mt-tRNA rather than re-synthetize and subject it to multi-step maturation. Enzymes responsible for the basic tRNA maturation processes have also been reported to be involved in tRNA repair after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Phizicky, 2008</xref>). For example, it has been suggested that the 3'−5' reverse RNA polymerase, Thg1, normally involved in the synthesis of G<sub>-1</sub> in tRNA<sup>His</sup>, has a role in repair of truncated RNA 5' ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jackman and Phizicky, 2006</xref>). Also, dedicated enzymes such as RNA ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nandakumar et al., 2008</xref>) or demethylating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ougland et al., 2004</xref>) can directly neutralise the damage to tRNA. Our results herein indicate that mechanisms of maintaining the integrity of tRNA via the deadenylation of matured mt-tRNAs exist in mammalian mitochondria and involve the exoribonuclease PDE12. In this context, the role of PDE12 can be considered not only as a part of the mt-tRNA maturation pathway, but also as a component of mt-tRNA quality control, with a role in the 3’ end repair upon aberrant polyadenylation. It remains to be established whether PDE12-assisted deadenylation of aberrantly polyadenylated mt-tRNAs also plays a regulatory role for mt-tRNA pools. It has been shown that polyadenylation helps to regulate levels of functional tRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mohanty and Kushner, 2013</xref>). Increased expression of the bacterial poly(A) polymerase, PAP I, leads to the rapid polyadenylation of mature tRNAs, reducing the fraction of aminoacylated tRNAs and, therefore, limiting levels of functional tRNAs for protein synthesis. In light of our results, it is possible that mitochondrial polyadenylation by mtPAP may control the levels of functional mt-tRNA by acting on their 3’ ends and that PDE12 might be an important element of such regulatory pathway.</p><p>In the eukaryotic nucleus, the TRAMP complex (Trf4/Air2/Mtr4), has been shown to function in marking nuclear non-coding RNAs with oligoadenylation which acts as a docking site for nuclear exosome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Wang, 2009</xref>). This prokaryote-like approach functions to destabilise unrequired nuclear RNAs, including hypomodified initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), in addition to other non-coding RNAs such as abnormally processed ribosomal RNAs. Hypothetically, PDE12 could function in a similar manner in the complete turnover of aberrantly matured molecules from the mt-tRNA pools in human mitochondria, with the oligoadenylation observed herein functioning as a signal for degradation. However, following PDE12 knockout, we observed no changes in overall steady-state level of total mt-tRNA pools, despite a proportion of some mt-tRNA species carrying oligoadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This would suggest that the purpose of the oligoadenylation is unlikely to be a signal for complete turnover of the molecule in human mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The promiscuous polyadenylation activity in human mitochondria</title><p>Our results suggest that mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, mtPAP, despite being critical for mitochondrial gene expression through maturation of mt-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bratic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crosby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), is a promiscuous enzyme. Although we cannot exclude any other, as yet unidentified, mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase being involved in spurious mtRNA adenylation, here we show that overexpression of mtPAP causes increased levels of aberrantly polyadenylated mtRNA, with the effect being more pronounced in the absence of PDE12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of spurious polyadenylation and its functional effects vary between the different mt-rRNA and mt-tRNA species. While 12S mt-rRNA was not found to be susceptible to promiscuous mtPAP activity in the absence of PDE12, 16S mt-rRNA contained abnormal 3’ end extensions. Nonetheless, the extended 16S mt-rRNA remained functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, selectivity of spurious adenylation towards different mt-tRNAs was observed, with mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, <sup>-Ser(AGY)</sup> and <sup>–His</sup> being the most affected species. Despite comparable levels of aberrant 3’ end polyadenylation of these three mt-tRNAs detected by the radioactive MPAT and MPAT-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), high-resolution northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) revealed that spurious adenylation actually affects mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> to a greater extent. This discrepancy is likely to stem from the intricacies of the MPAT assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). As the MPAT assays require reverse transcriptase to read through post-transcriptionally modified bases, the measurements of mt-tRNA adenylation might not be accurate, specifically by over-representing the extent of 3’ modification of unmodified molecules relative to that of mature mt-tRNAs. Therefore, the result of the MPAT assays may not exactly reflect the proportion of adenylated molecules in the total pool of each mt-tRNA species.</p><p>The steady-state levels of mature mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> were substantially decreased, with the levels of mt-tRNA<sup>His</sup> available for aminoacylation remaining comparable to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Notwithstanding with equally diminished pools of aa-mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and aa-mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>, mitoribosome stalling was predominately detected on Lys codons. The difference in mitoribosomal stalling on Lys and Ser<sup>AGY</sup> codons might be explained by the relative percentages of their occurrence in mtDNA-encoded ORFs. The Ser<sup>AGY</sup> codon is the second least frequently occurring coding triplet and accounts for 1.4% of all mtDNA codons, whereas Lys occurs with a frequency of 2.5%.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Other cellular roles of PDE12</title><p>Recently, PDE12 has been proposed to act in the maturation of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. In human mtDNA, the mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> genes overlap by one nucleotide at their 3’ and 5’ termini, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>). During endonucleolytic processing, therefore, an ‘A’ residue, which is shared between the two mt-tRNAs, is missing from the mature form of one of the mt-tRNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). There have been conflicting reports, based on in vitro study, regarding the exact nature of the endonucleolytic processing of the mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> junction in human mitochondria, where cleavage results either in the loss of the mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr </sup>discriminator base (DB), producing a complete mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reichert et al., 1998</xref>), or in the retention of the DB by mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rossmanith et al., 1995</xref>). It has also been recently proposed that alternative processing at this site may occur, resulting in pools of complete and incomplete species of each mt-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>). According to this model, the 3’ end of a pool of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> would need to be repaired via adenylation to provide the DB, with mtPAP performing the 3’ adenylation of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> that need subsequent trimming. Based on in vitro reconstitution experiments, PDE12 and/or the mitochondrial RNase Z (ELAC2) have been proposed to trim the polyadenylated mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> precursor leaving the ‘A’ at the DB position for the subsequent CCA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, our radioactive MPAT and MPAT-Seq assay in control and PDE12−/− cells revealed no changes in the mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> 3’ end maturation, suggesting that either PDE12 is not involved in this process in living cells or there is substantial redundancy in the mechanisms of mt-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>PDE12 has also been proposed to play a role in the 2-5A system functioning in cellular anti-viral defence. Upon viral infection, the production of interferons (IFNs) is stimulated which act to induce expression of 2’−5’-oligoadenylate synthetases (2’−5’-OASs). 2’−5’-OASs catalyse the synthesis of 5’ triphosphorylated 2’−5’-linked oligoadenylate polyribonucleotides (2-5As) from ATP. Accumulation of these 2-5As leads to the activation of latent RNase L which, when activated, degrades viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wreschner et al., 1981</xref>). PDE12 has been suggested to control the cellular levels of 2-5As by catalysing their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Johnston and Hearl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wood et al., 2015</xref>). However, as yet, the role of the 2-5A system has not been characterised in human mitochondria, being predominantly based in the cytosol and nucleus, implying that a putative extra-mitochondrial PDE12 pool would have to exist. However, our previous study indicated exclusive mitochondrial localisation of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rorbach et al., 2011</xref>), which was confirmed in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, the PDE12 variants without the MTS, which localise in the cytosol, did not rescue the depletion in OxPhos subunits in the PDE12−/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the notion that mitochondrially localised PDE12 is required for its function in mtDNA gene expression. The prior assignment of PDE12 as having a role in the 2-5A system, therefore, would require further research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In summary, we have assigned a novel molecular function for PDE12 in the deadenylation-dependent maturation of mitochondrial non-coding RNAs.

Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293-Flp-In T-REx; HEK293T) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium) supplemented with 10% (v/v) tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco), 1 x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 15 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invivogen) at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The cell line was regularly (3–4 months) tested for mycoplasma using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Merck). Twenty-four hours prior to transfection cells were split to 10-cm plates in culture medium lacking selective antibiotics, grown to 80–90% confluence and transfected with the transgene-specific pcDNA5/FRT/TO construct and pOG44 using Lipofectamine 2000.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the reviewers and the reviewing editor all felt that the work was interesting and in principle appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, several points, some textual and one experimental, need to be addressed via revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors provide evidence to support a model implicating the poly(A)-specific exonuclease PDE12 as a factor responsible for quality control of mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs. The authors show that lack of PDE12 results in reduced translation of mitochondrial mRNAs, without affecting the amounts or the polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs or the amounts of 55S monosomes, and without a reduction in the amounts of mitochondrial mRNAs loaded on the ribosomes. Ribosome profiling indicated that translation was stalled in PDE12−/− cell lines at lysine AAG and to a lesser extent at lysine AAA codons. Analysis of the 3' ends of tRNAs by MPAT (mitochondrial poly(A) tail assay) indicated a preponderence of oligoadenylated tRNAs of certain species in PDE12−/− cell lines including tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Ser2) and tRNA(His), but not several others, and analysis of charging by acid Northerns suggested reduced charging levels of tRNA(Lys) and tRNA(Ser2). Control experiments demonstrate that PDE12−/− cell lines have additional oligoadenylation of 16S rRNA, but not 12S rRNA, and separate experiments provide evidence that LSU's and monosomes have an identical amount of oligoadenylation in their 16S rRNA, suggesting that they form normal mitochondrial ribosomes, leading the authors to conclude that the translation defect in PDE12 −/− cells is due to reduced tRNA function. Finally the authors provide evidence that overexpression of mitochondrial PAP causes reduced mitochondrial translation PDE12 +/+ cells, and an extreme reduction of translation in PDE12−/− cells.</p><p>The authors conclude that PDE12 has a role in deadenylating promiscuous polyadenylation of mitochondrial tRNAs to improve tRNA function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was agreed that the term &quot;repair&quot; was not an appropriate description for the phenomena you have investigated. A more accurate title would be &quot;Maturation of some human mitochondrial tRNAs requires deadenylation&quot;. The term &quot;repair&quot; should be deleted throughout the text.</p><p>2) The method that the authors use to measure oligoadenylation (by the MPAT assay) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, or by MPAT-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) requires readthrough of several modified bases that are very difficult to read through.

We agree that the charging assay as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> is confounded by the presence of olgoadenylated mt-tRNAs co-migrating with the aminoacylated form of mt-tRNA, nonetheless it clearly shows that the levels of aminoacylated mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> is reduced. Following the reviewers’ recommendation we have performed additional northern blot analysis on mt-tRNA, including the analysis of mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> aminoacylation using periodate oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, respectively). The additional data presented show that oligoadenylation of mt-tRNA leads to reduced levels of mature mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> available for aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), while the total steady-state levels (mature and oligoadenylated) of this mt-tRNA remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The periodate-based assay confirmed that only the correctly matured mt-tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> is aminoacylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We have reflected these observations in the revised manuscript text.</p><p><italic>4) The authors have not provided any information about the mutant PDE12 (E351A). Perhaps they should mention that this mutant was characterized in their previous paper (2011).</italic> </p><p>We have added the following information to the Materials and methods section: “The E351A point mutation affects a putative magnesium-binding residue and severely compromises the activity of PDE12, as characterised previously (Rorbach et al., 2011).”</p><p><italic>5) It was noted that pre-tRNAs with structural impairments may be polyadenylated by the TRAMP complex, followed by 3'-digestion by the nuclear exosome.

As we do not observe a reduction in overall steady-state level of mt-tRNAs in the absence of PDE12, determined by combined quantification of mature and oligoadenylated species of mt-tRNAs pools (Figure 4—figure supplement 4C), we do not believe that the oligoadenylation observed functions as a signal for the turnover of mt-tRNA species.</p></body></sub-article></article>
