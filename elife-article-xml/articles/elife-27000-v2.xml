Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SNAREs. Whether Doc2B functions as a calcium sensor akin to synaptotagmins, or in other calcium-independent or calcium-dependent capacities is debated. We here show by mutation and overexpression that Doc2B plays distinct roles in two sequential priming steps in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Mutating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating aspartates in the C2A-domain localizes Doc2B permanently at the plasma membrane, and renders an upstream priming step Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, whereas a separate function in downstream priming depends on SNARE-binding, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the C2B-domain of Doc2B, interaction with ubMunc13-2 and the presence of synaptotagmin-1. Another function of Doc2B – inhibition of release during sustained calcium elevations – depends on an overlapping protein domain (the MID-domain), but is separate from its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming function. We conclude that Doc2B acts as a vesicle priming protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromaffin cell</kwd><kwd>capacitance measurements</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>adrenaline</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houy</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Jakob Balslev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-ADG-322966-DCVfusion</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>Matthijs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Jakob Balslev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Jakob Balslev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016 (KU2016) excellence program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sørensen</surname><given-names>Jakob Balslev</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Doc2B functions in two distinct vesicle priming steps; membrane localization occludes upstream Ca2+-dependent priming, whereas Ca2+-binding and interaction with synaptotagmin-1, SNAREs, and Munc13-2 are involved in downstream priming, which makes vesicles readily releasable.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The calcium signal triggering fast synchronous secretion in chemical synapses and neuroendocrine cells is confined to nanodomains or microdomains around calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher, 2015</xref>); it is of high amplitude, but brief duration, and calcium sensors that trigger synchronous release therefore display fast kinetics, but low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinheiro et al., 2016</xref>). These sensors include synaptotagmin (syt)-1,-2 and -9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Another class of calcium sensors has high affinity and slow kinetics; they are suited to detect increases in the spatially averaged calcium concentration following stimulation. These sensors – including Munc13 proteins – act in preparing vesicles for later release, that is, they promote vesicle priming by stimulating SNARE-complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man et al., 2015</xref>). For some calcium sensors, it remains controversial whether they belong to one or the other class – or to both.</p><p>A high-affinity calcium sensor in the adrenal medulla, pancreatic beta cells and central neurons is Doc2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramalingam et al., 2012</xref>). Doc2 proteins are named after their double C2-domains; they lack a transmembrane domain and calcium-binding therefore leads to the protein cycling on and off the plasma membrane, dictated by the electrical activity of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 2006</xref>). For Doc2B, half-maximal membrane binding occurs at ~0.2 μM calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 2006</xref>). In neurons, Doc2B stimulates spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). This function aligns well with the ability of Doc2B to bind to SNAREs, stimulate membrane stalk formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouwer et al., 2015</xref>) and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>) and would be consistent with a function of Doc2B in triggering fusion, at lower calcium concentrations than syt-1,-2 and -9. This was further supported by the finding that a permanently membrane-bound Doc2B, the DN-mutant, resulted in a high and calcium-independent mini release rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>). However, mutation of all six Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating aspartates created a mutant (denoted ‘6A’), which could not bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but still supported spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). It was instead suggested that Doc2B might perform an upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent function in increasing spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). One group has reported that Doc2A acts as a calcium sensor involved in asynchronous release, which can also be supported by Doc2B following overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). However, other groups reported no change in asynchronous release following elimination of Doc2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>), or all Doc2-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). Yet another proposed function of Doc2B is to serve as a scaffold by recruiting other factors to the release machinery. Munc13-proteins bind to the MID-domain in the N-terminal tail of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orita et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mochida et al., 1998</xref>), providing a mechanism to target Munc13-1 to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedrich et al., 2013</xref>). In insulin releasing β-cells, secretion was impaired in the absence of Doc2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramalingam et al., 2012</xref>), and it was suggested that Doc2B might serve as a scaffold for Munc18-1 and Munc18c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramalingam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Data obtained after knockout of Doc2B in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells showed a dual effect: the size of the Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) of vesicles was decreased – especially during repetitive stimulation – and the sustained component of release was potentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, upon overexpression of Doc2B, the RRP size increased and the sustained component was inhibited. Overall, Doc2B synchronizes release with the onset of the calcium signal. Here, we addressed the question whether those roles of Doc2B represent calcium dependent or independent functions. We further investigated whether the two functions of Doc2B in chromaffin cells require interaction with other proteins. We conclude that Doc2B plays distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent roles in two sequential vesicle priming steps, which support the Slowly Releasable Pool (SRP) and the RRP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner and Holz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Rüden and Neher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>). The effect of Doc2B to move vesicles into the RRP requires interactions with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ubMunc13-2 and SNAREs – and the presence of syt-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Doc2B requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 to stimulate priming</title><p>To demonstrate the role of Doc2B in chromaffin cells we first compared secretion from Doc2B knockout (KO) adrenal chromaffin cells with Doc2B KO cells overexpressing Doc2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Doc2B was expressed from a bicistronic Semliki Forest Virus construct co-expressing EGFP as an expression marker. Doc2A is not expressed in adrenal chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). Secretion was elicited using calcium uncaging and monitored using capacitance measurements. Vesicle priming in chromaffin cells is calcium dependent, such that a higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> before stimulation increases the size of the exocytotic burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>). In the first set of experiments, we stimulated cells from a high basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to maximize priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>insert</italic> in top panel; 828.8 ± 24.3 nM for Doc2B KO cells, 935.7 ± 30.3 nM for KO cells overexpressing Doc2B WT). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> mid panel shows the mean capacitance traces of all recorded cells) showed that expression of Doc2B had a dual effect: it increased the burst of secretion (defined as capacitance increase within 0.5 s of uncaging, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while it decreased sustained release (capacitance increase between 0.5 and 5 s after uncaging, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because sustained release dominates at later times, total release over the course of the experiment (5 s) was reduced by Doc2B expression. Detection of liberated catecholamines was performed by amperometry, in parallel with capacitance measurements from the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel shows mean traces of all recorded cells). Following integration, the amperometric signal mimicked the capacitance trace, confirming those measurements and showing that the vesicles released catecholamines. However, amperometry cannot distinguish between fast and slow burst components due to the diffusional delay. As a control, we also expressed Doc2B in WT chromaffin cells (CD1 mice and – in separate experiments – Black6 mice), which express endogeneous Doc2B, and we found similar changes: an increase in burst release, and a decrease in the sustained component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We conclude that overexpression of Doc2B to boost endogenous levels can be used to assay these two opposing effects of Doc2B in adrenal chromaffin cells. Previous data comparing WT to Doc2B KO cells identified consistent changes: a decrease in burst release (seen most clearly during depolarization protocols), and an increase in sustained release upon elimination of Doc2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, even though overexpression using Semliki vectors boost protein levels far beyond endogenous levels, the effects on secretion are consistent with those seen in the presence of endogenous expression levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27000.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Doc2B requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 to increase the Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of Doc2B in Doc2B knockout (KO) mouse adrenal chromaffin cells.

The time constants of fusion of fast and slow burst fusion were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aiv,Av</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aiv, Av, Biv, Bv</xref>). Thus, Doc2B has opposing effects on RRP size and sustained release, whereas the effect on the SRP differs between the two mouse lines (Black6 and CD1). Note that our KO mice are backcrossed to a Black6 background.</p><p>A promoting effect on RRP size implies that Doc2B stimulates RRP filling (priming) during period of rest (i.e. before stimulation). We next wanted to understand whether Doc2B requires the presence of other exocytotic priming proteins in the cell in order to stimulate priming, or whether it acts independently. Synaptotagmin-1 (syt-1) knockout (KO) chromaffin cells display a smaller-than-normal fast burst (RRP), whereas the slow burst is preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohrmann et al., 2013</xref>); this slow burst depends on synaptotagmin-7 (syt-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>). Overexpression of syt-1 on the wildtype background can increase the size of the RRP further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagy et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that syt-1 abundance controls the step converting SRP to RRP. Both Syt-1 KO and Syt-7 KO express endogenous Doc2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We overexpressed Doc2B in syt-1 KO cells, and found that it did not increase the fast bursts in these cells, but it still led to a significant decrease in the sustained component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,Bi–iii</xref>). There was a non-significant decrease in slow burst in overexpressing cells, which might have been influenced by the reduction of the sustained component, which during kinetic analysis might ‘leak into’ the slow burst component. Changes in fusion time constants were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Biv,Bv</xref>). Thus, Doc2B acts upstream of or in cooperation with syt-1 to increase the RRP size, not in a redundant pathway. In syt-7 KO chromaffin cells all the components of release were depressed compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In syt-7 KO chromaffin cells, expression of Doc2B caused an increase of the fast burst and a decrease of the sustained component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,Ci–Cv</xref>), indicating that Doc2B does not rely on syt-7. Amperometric measurements delivered independent evidence for the increase in burst release and decrease in sustained component upon overexpression of Doc2B in the syt-7 KO.</p><p>Munc13-proteins are the canonical priming proteins in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>) and chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashery et al., 2000</xref>), acting by opening syntaxin-1 within the confines of Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>) to facilitate SNARE-complex assembly. ubMunc13-2 is the dominating Munc13 isoform in adrenal chromaffin cells, and in its absence the fast burst of release was reduced due to a priming defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, expressing Doc2B WT in ubMunc13-2 KO cells not only failed to support the increase in fast burst amplitude, but led to near-abolishment of all secretory phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,Di–Dv</xref>), similar to the defect seen when eliminating SNARE-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sørensen et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref>). This effect was confirmed by amperometry measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, Munc13-2 is required for the promoting functions of Doc2B on priming, and negative functions of Doc2B dominate in its absence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutated Doc2B renders vesicle priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent</title><p>Vesicle priming in chromaffin cells is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, with higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the sub-μM range leading to a larger burst of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner and Holz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Rüden and Neher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>). This mechanism is physiologically important, because it makes it possible for G-protein coupled receptors, which stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release from intracellular stores to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the sub-µM range, to act synergistically with neuronal stimulation to strongly increase adrenaline output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teschemacher and Seward, 2000</xref>). Since Doc2B is a priming protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent trafficking, we next investigated the possibility that it might act as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for vesicle priming. To this end, we mutated Doc2B’s Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. Mutating two of the coordinating aspartate residues in the C2A-domain to asparagine (D218N/D220N, denoted DN-mutation) causes Doc2B to reside permanently at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michaeli et al., 2017</xref>).

Inspecting the stainings, both the WT and the DN mutant appeared to be at or close to the plasma membrane, but chemical fixation can cause Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, which induces trafficking of Doc2B at the sub-μM level; thus, membrane localization cannot be assess from staining of fixed samples. Instead, we used an EGFP fusion protein and live cell confocal imaging to assess localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

When we carried out Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging experiments from a low resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (~200 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) expression of Doc2B WT caused an increase in slow burst release and a decrease in the sustained release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Strikingly, when expressing the Doc2B DN-mutation, the burst was potentiated even more (orange curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The potentiation was seen both in the fast and the slow burst components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In experiments with a high basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), both Doc2B KO cells and KO cells overexpressing Doc2B responded with a larger exocytotic burst (compare secretion within the first 0.5 s after the stimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and G</xref>), showing that calcium-dependent priming was successfully induced. However, under these conditions, the responses of DN-mutant cells were now indistinguishable from the WT, for all secretory phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>).

This indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to WT Doc2B drives priming of new vesicles, or that this reaction is bypassed when Doc2B is permanently localized at the plasma membrane (see Figure 10 and Discussion). Therefore, the DN-mutant is a gain-of-function mutant in chromaffin cells when studied from a low basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Kinetic analysis indicated that the DN-mutant decreased the time constant for fast fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), perhaps indicating a separate property of this protein.

This mutant does not co-translocate to the plasma membrane after phorbol ester stimulation of Munc13, but still translocates after Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of Doc2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groffen et al., 2004</xref>). Expression of the MID_mut in Doc2B KO chromaffin cells (expression level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showed that this mutation did not support an increase in the fast burst (RRP) of release, as seen in parallel experiments after expression of Doc2B WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), indicating that the MID domain is necessary for this function. However, sustained secretion was still suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Biii</xref>), and the fusion kinetics were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Biv–Bv</xref>). Therefore, the mutation shows – like the KE-mutation and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ligand mutations – that the positive and negative functions of Doc2B can be separated by mutation.</p><p>The lack of an effect of the MID_mut on sustained release was puzzling, since so far it had been assumed that Munc13 binding is a prerequisite for the function of Doc2A/B in secretion (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>]). Therefore, we decided to remove the entire MID domain, through the deletion of amino acids 14–41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, Doc2B ΔMID). Importantly, this mutation was expressed at levels similar to WT protein and did not change the staining for the vesicular marker syb-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Using an EGFP-fusion construct we verified that Doc2B ΔMID trafficked reversibly to the membrane indistinguishable from the WT protein when expressing chromaffin cells were exposed to High-K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This further shows that the C2-domains are correctly folded in this mutant. Strikingly, expression of the ΔMID mutant in Doc2B KO cells led to partial recovery of the sustained component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ciii</xref>), which reached 42.7 ± 6.7 fF/s whereas expressing Doc2B WT depressed the sustained component to 13.3 ± 2.2 fF/s. Consistent with the results obtained with the mutated MID, the ΔMID also did not support the fast burst amplitude seen with Doc2B WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ci</xref>). Although a sustained release rate of 42 fF/s is quite typical for WT chromaffin cells, Doc2B KO cells display on average higher rates (60–70 fF/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ciii</xref>), which indicates that other regions outside the MID domain also contribute to the inhibitory effect. Together with the findings above that the negative effects of Doc2B on secretion entirely dominate in the Munc13-2 KO chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), this shows that the negative function of Doc2B on release requires the MID-domain, but not Munc13-2 (see also Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In chromaffin cells, Doc2B has dual effects: it stimulates the size of the RRP from rest by boosting priming, but it inhibits priming/fusion during sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup>-elevations, leading to a shallower sustained release component. Thus, Doc2B joins the ranks of a number of exocytotic proteins – including complexin, syts and Munc18s – that have positive and negative effects on different phases of release. Here, we have dissected the involvement of the different Doc2B effectors in this phenotype. Cross-rescue showed that syt-1 and ubMunc13-2 are required for the overall stimulating effect on priming, whereas syt-7 is dispensable. Even in the absence of syt-1 or syt-7, an inhibitory function of Doc2B was seen, and inhibition dominated in the absence of Munc13-2. Mutagenesis showed that interactions with SNAREs, Munc13, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are involved in the positive effects of Doc2B on priming, whereas they were not required for the inhibitory function. Thus, the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of Doc2B can be separated by mutation. This rules out that the stimulatory effect on RRP size could be a secondary effect of the inhibition of sustained release, which in principle could lead to a larger RRP by preventing loss of vesicles.</p><p>Strikingly, both the DN and 6A mutations rendered the exocytotic burst size independent of basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. With the DN mutation, the primed vesicle pools attained their maximal size irrespective of basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, occluding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner and Holz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>), whereas – with the 6A mutation – the RRP size was intermediate, but calcium-independent. The increase in secretion induced by the DN-mutant was previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedrich et al. (2008)</xref>, who used expression in WT mouse chromaffin cells; here we show by direct comparison to the wildtype protein in a rescue setting that the DN-mutation renders overall priming calcium-independent. Where the RRP was increased, the IRP was not significantly affected by the DN-mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The reason for this is unknown, but the IRP forms a subpool of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voets et al., 1999</xref>), which contains vesicles close to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. Other factors (for instance the number or availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels) might therefore limit the size of the IRP.</p><p>The DN-mutation is situated in the C2A-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the C2B-domain also contributes essentially to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giladi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). The finding that the DN-mutant (and other neutralization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ligands in the C2A-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>]) lead to permanent membrane anchoring can be rationalized from the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the DN-mutant and negatively charged membrane phospholipids (phosphatidylserine and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), in the presence of an affinity for the membrane via the C2B-domain. Indeed, recent data show that membrane binding of both WT Doc2B and DN-mutant requires PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michaeli et al., 2017</xref>). Thus both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Doc2B WT and the DN-mutant localize to similar PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> containing domains on the plasma membrane.</p><p>Whereas mutation of the coordinating aspartates in Doc2B (either DN or 6A mutation) renders vesicle priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, priming is still Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent in the absence of Doc2B (comp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and G</xref>), as noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the mutated Doc2B occludes an endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming factor. To gain further insight into the function of Doc2B in different priming steps, we considered the 3-pool model for exocytosis, where the RRP is refilled reversibly from the SRP, and the SRP in turn is refilled reversibly from a Depot pool (which may or may not be docked, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In this model, the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the burst size is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the transition between Depot and SRP (called <italic>priming 1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walter et al., 2013</xref>), which indirectly affects also the RRP. In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>) we concluded that Doc2B acts primarily on the interconversion between SRP and RRP vesicles (<italic>priming 2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Therefore, in the Doc2B KO, the burst size (SRP + RRP) is still Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>]). By assuming that the steady state has been obtained before we uncage calcium, we are able (from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to calculate the ratios k<sub>1</sub>[Depot]/k<sub>-1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>/k<sub>-2</sub>, which are the overall propensities of <italic>priming 1</italic> and <italic>priming 2</italic> to drive priming forward, and compare them between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>). We considered the effect of having the Doc2B protein present at ~200 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), and the effect of raising pre-stimulation [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> from ~200 nM to ~800 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The conclusion is that Doc2B acts on both priming steps, but in different ways: it acts on <italic>priming 2</italic> at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) to drive vesicles to the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>), but at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] it acts to drive <italic>priming 1</italic> forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This can be appreciated directly from the data by noting the large increase in SRP size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref> when expressing Doc2B or its mutants and probing from low basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The effect on <italic>priming 1</italic> is even larger for the DN mutant than for the WT protein. The result of the upstream action is that <italic>priming 1</italic> loses some or (in the DN mutant) all of its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, and indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of <italic>priming 1</italic> is even higher in the total absence of Doc2B than in the presence of WT Doc2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Most likely there is competition between Doc2B and the upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming sensor for <italic>priming 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), and this is affected by mutation and probably by the relative abundance of the two sensors near the membrane. The physiological relevant function of the Doc2B protein can be appreciated from the fact that in the Doc2B KO, Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses the transition from the SRP into the RRP, whereas in the presence of Doc2B, this transition is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Thus, the upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor, when left to its own devices, would push vesicles effectively into the SRP, but the transition into the RRP would be inhibited. Doc2B, on the other hand, can prime vesicles further into the RRP by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding. Strikingly, another conclusion is that only the WT protein and the DN-mutant can push the vesicles into the RRP at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] – the 6A-mutant is not able to do that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) - which identifies Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the C2B-domain as the decisive event for priming 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). The identity of the upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming sensor acting on <italic>priming 1</italic> cannot be identified from this work, but candidates are synaptotagmin-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and Munc13 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zikich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lipstein et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27000.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Dissecting the effect of Doc2B on two sequential priming steps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chromaffin cells feature two sequential priming steps: <italic>priming 1</italic>, which recruits vesicles to the SRP, and <italic>priming 2</italic>, which recruits them to the RRP.

The first idea is that Doc2 proteins participate in a direct capacity during the fusion process itself, by triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lipid insertion of its C2 domains, leading to membrane buckling/distortion, which assists in SNARE-dependent membrane fusion – that is, a function akin to that often ascribed to syts. This notion has support in the observation that Doc2 proteins can accelerate membrane fusion in vitro between populations of liposomes carrying nothing but reconstituted SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>). The other idea is that Doc2 serves mainly as a recruitment scaffold, which brings other factors to the membrane – or to the SNAREs, since SNARE-binding is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2010</xref>) (and our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) – leading to more indirect, that is, more upstream, effects on fusion. This model has indirect support through the ability of a MID-domain peptide to interfere with synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mochida et al., 1998</xref>), and by the observation of Doc2B-dependent Munc13-1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedrich et al., 2013</xref>). Munc13-1, in turn, might have direct effects on the fusogenicity of vesicles via SNARE-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), or by modulating the size of the fusion barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>). In pancreatic beta cells, a function of Doc2B as a scaffolding platform for Munc18 proteins has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jewell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramalingam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data obtained in adrenal chromaffin cells add several lines of support to a more indirect mode of Doc2B action: first, in cross-rescue experiments, Doc2B cannot stimulate release in the absence of syt-1, the fast calcium sensor for fusion in chromaffin cells. Second, the main promoting effect of WT Doc2B expression is to increase the size of the RRP, which is an effect upstream of fusion. No consistent effect on the rate constant of release, or its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, was observed by the wildtype or mutated Doc2B protein (with the exception of the DN mutation, see below), see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). This is in stark contrast to mutations reducing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity of syt-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sørensen et al., 2003a</xref>), compromising syt-1:SNARE-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohrmann et al., 2013</xref>), deletion of complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhara et al., 2014</xref>), or interference with the C-terminal zippering of the SNARE-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sørensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walter et al., 2010</xref>), which all compromise fusion time constants, reflecting the known function of the syt-1:SNARE:complexin supercomplex in fusion triggering. Third, the main effect of mutating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues of Doc2B was to render overall vesicle priming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Fourth, we find that mutating the MID domain or removing ubMunc13-2 – the major Munc13 isoform in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man et al., 2015</xref>) – abolished the stimulating effect of Doc2B on priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, therefore, we favor the idea that Doc2B acts through the recruitment of other factors, which cause vesicle priming.</p><p>Even as the indirect effects of Doc2B dominate in chromaffin cells, Doc2B appears to have a more direct effect on fusion in other systems, or after mutation. In neurons the DN mutation increases the mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>), but it also increased synchronous release and RRP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffaney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2015</xref>), and when expressed in syt-1 KO neurons it supported a larger increase in asynchronous release than the WT protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). When expressed in adrenal chromaffin cells the DN-mutant was the only tested mutant which decreased the time constant of fast burst fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), suggesting a function in accelerating fusion itself. These observations would be consistent with the idea that the DN mutation – in addition to locating Doc2B at the membrane – potentiates a direct function of Doc2B in fusing membranes. This function might dominate in neurons because the small synaptic vesicles are intrinsically more fusogenic due to their high curvature (or for other reasons), but only become noticeable in chromaffin cells in the context of the DN-mutant.</p><p>The negative effect that Doc2B exerts on sustained release in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is not an artifact of a high expression level, because sustained release is augmented in the Doc2B KO compared to WT cells from littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that the endogenous expression level suffices for the effect. The effect can also be seen when stimulating by depolarization from a low resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~100 nM) through augmentation of ‘delayed release’ between stimulations in Doc2B KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of Doc2B or its mutants did not change staining for syb2, a vesicular marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is an important control, because overexpression of Doc2B increases spontaneous release in chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>). Increased spontaneous release might in principle lead to vesicle depletion and a secondary reduction in sustained release, although this is unlikely as the effect on spontaneous release is modest (a factor of ~2) and did not change RRP size in synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>). Using electron microscopy, we previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>) reported a significant increase in the number of granules upon Doc2B expression. This increase was not reflected in a changed syb2 expression in this manuscript. Electron microscopy and immunostaning are very different methods for assessing vesicle abundance, and further experiments will be required to understand the reason for this apparent discrepancy. The phenotype of increased RRP and inhibited sustained was previously found after overexpression of open syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), which together with our observation that Doc2B recruits syntaxin-1 from plasma membrane clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toft-Bertelsen et al., 2016</xref>) suggest an explanation for the phenotype. However, the KE-mutation, which did not recruit syntaxin-1, still limited sustained release. The inhibitory function was partly relieved after deletion of the entire MID-domain. Inhibition dominated when Doc2B was expressed in Munc13-2 KO cells, but in these cells the fast and slow bursts of release were also reduced, along with the sustained component. This indicates that vesicle priming is fundamentally different in Munc13-2 KO cells. Priming in chromaffin and PC12 cells depends on Munc13 and CAPS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>). Munc13-1 requires CAPS-1 to be able to increase secretion in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The major Munc13 variant in chromaffin cells is ubMunc13-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man et al., 2015</xref>), but the specific interactions between ubMunc13-2 and CAPS-1/2 – and between ubMunc13-2 and Doc2B – remain essentially unexplored. Interestingly, expressing Munc13-1 in chromaffin cells yields a higher value of the ratio between burst/sustained, ~0.7 at 4 s post-flash, whereas ubMunc13-2 supported a relatively larger sustained component, yielding a ratio between burst/sustained of ~0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man et al., 2015</xref>). CAPS-proteins are required for the sustained release component in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and traffic to the membrane on secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kabachinski et al., 2016</xref>); therefore we can hypothesize that ubMunc13-2 displays more efficient coupling to CAPS activity than Munc13-1. It is an attractive possibility that Doc2B might target one Munc13 paralog (Munc13-1) selectively to the release machinery, thus accounting for a larger primed vesicle pool, while sustained release is limited by an additional function of Doc2B to block interactions with CAPS-proteins or the upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for priming (<italic>priming 1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that localization of Doc2B to the plasma membrane occludes the upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner and Holz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Rüden and Neher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voets, 2000</xref>), and that Doc2B acts as a calcium sensor for vesicle priming into the RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). We further demonstrate that this function includes interactions with SNAREs and Munc13-2, and it further requires syt-1 to be present. Another, upstream, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming factor is present in chromaffin cells, as vesicle priming remains Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent even in the Doc2B KO. Another function of Doc2B in adrenal chromaffin cells is to limit sustained release. This function also depends on the MID-domain, and we tentatively suggest that Doc2B might target some priming factors (Munc13, CAPS) selectively to the exocytotic cascade to shape overall release kinetics. Thus, the end result of Doc2A/B function will depend on the priming factors expressed in a particular cell and therefore will vary between systems. This might account for the different functions of Doc2B in beta cells, (increased biphasic insulin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramalingam et al., 2012</xref>]), adrenal chromaffin cells (increase in RRP, but decrease in sustained release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro et al., 2013</xref>]), and neurons (increase in spontaneous and/or asynchronous release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2011</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">CD1</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Doc2a null allele</td><td valign="top">Sakaguchi G, Manabe T, Kobayashi K, <break/>Orita S, Sasaki T, Naito A, Maeda M, <break/>Igarashi H, Katsuura G, Nishioka H, <break/>Mizoguchi A, Itohara S, Takahashi T, <break/>Takai Y.

Doc2A/B double knockout mice were kept homozygous knockout for both alleles. P0-P1 pups of either sex were sacrificed by decapitation, the adrenal glands dissected out, and chromaffin cells isolated and cultured according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sørensen et al., 2003b</xref>). Briefly, dissected adrenal glands were placed in filtered Locke’s solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 0.85 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.15 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.0), and cleaned for connective tissue using tweezers. The glands were digested in 0.3 mL of papain solution (solutions are defined below) at 37°C for 40 min followed by the addition of 0.3 mL of inactivating solution for 5–10 min. This solution was then replaced by 160 µL of enriched DMEM, and the glands triturated through a 200 µL pipette tip. 50 µL of the cell suspension were plated as a drop on glass coverslips in 6-well plates, and the cells were allowed to settle for 20–40 min before adding 2 mL of enriched DMEM. The cells were incubated at 37°C and 8% CO<sub>2</sub> and used within 4 days.

Fusion-constructs between Doc2B WT, DN and 6A mutants and EGFP (fused to the C-terminus of Doc2B) were cloned in a lentiviral vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing.

For the ratiometric determination of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> the excitation light (monochromator IV, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) was alternated between 350 nm and 380 nm. The emitted fluorescence was detected with a photodiode and sampled using Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), which was also used for controlling the voltage in the pipette and performing capacitance measurements. The 350/380 fluorescence signal ratio was calibrated by infusion of cells with eight different solutions of known calcium concentrations. The standard intracellular solution contained (in mM): 100 Cs-glutamate, 8 NaCl, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 32 Cs-HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP, 5 NPE, 0.4 fura-4F, 0.4 furaptra, and 1 Vitamin C (to prevent UV-induced damage to the fura dyes), pH 7.2 (osmolarity adjusted to ~295 mOsm). For depolarization experiments, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NPE were omitted, and EGTA (0.5 mM) was added to the intracellular solution to keep a low basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.

Eight h post infection with Semliki Infective Particles encoding Doc2b-IRES-EGFP, Doc2B mutants –IRES-EGFP or IRES-EGFP alone as a control, the cells were fixed by adding an equal volume of 4% PFA in PBS to the existing culture medium, yielding a final concentration of 2% PFA. The cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min at RT with 0.1% Triton-X100, washed again with PBS, and incubated in PBS containing rabbit polyclonal antiserum 13.2 against Doc2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groffen et al., 2004</xref>) (diluted 1:133) or monoclonal mouse anti-VAMP2 (Synaptic Systems, clone 69.1, diluted 1:2000) for 2 hr at room temperature.

Confocal imaging of A647, A546 and GFP fluorescence was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope using a 63x oil immersion objective.</p><p>For immunostaining against syntaxin-1, cells were first prefixed for 5 min in isosmotic fixative containing 0.9% PFA in 0.05 M 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES)/NaOH (pH 7.4, 310 mOsm) 2.8 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl. This was followed by 8 min of incubation in 3.7% PFA in 0.05 M PIPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). Afterward, the cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by 30 min of blocking in PBS containing 3% BSA.

In case the F-test was significant, we performed a Mann-Whitney test, otherwise we used an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. In case of three conditions measured in parallel, we tested deviations from homoscedasticity using a Bartlett’s test; if the test was significant, we used a Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparison, otherwise we used an ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.

By this, the manuscript lines up as a highly significant study in a row of important contributions over the last years studying the function of this protein in secretion from either neurons or neuroendocrine cells. For example, previous work has implicated Doc2B as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for spontaneous (Groffen et al., 2010) and asynchronous neurotransmitter release (Yao et al., 2011). In addition, Do2B binds to Munc13-proteins and the SNAREs. Most experiments assess exocytosis by capacitance measurements and amperometry. Exocytosis is stimulated in these experiments by uncaging intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the patch clamp whole cell configuration. The experiments are well designed, and the overall quality of the data is excellent.</p><p>The results show that Doc2B increases the exocytotic burst and thus the readily releasable pool but it also inhibits the sustained component, which is generally thought to reflect the recruitment followed by the release of unprimed vesicles. They conclude that the action of Doc2B involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and associated translocation to the plasma membrane and that mutations that do not bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and are permanently associated with the plasma membrane are constitutively active, independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. In contrast, no changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming could be detected in Doc2B null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, see also Pinheiro et al., 2013). The authors interpret these observations with the mutant proteins as evidence for Doc2B being a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for vesicle priming in chromaffin cells. By studying the effect of Doc2B expression in sytI KO and ub-Munc13-2 KO cells and by using specific mutant proteins (Doc2B KE mutant, K237E/K319E) they find that Doc2B action on priming relies on the presence of sytI, Munc13-2 and SNARE binding activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>While the manuscript contains very interesting data leading to novel conclusions some data are less clear and/or not clearly presented, which need to be addressed. Also, the Discussion section is rather confusing. The discussion should specifically address points 2, 4, and 9, listed below.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> an important control needs to be included, the overexpression of Doc2B in WT chromaffin cells that are not devoid of endogenous Doc2B background. This is important for assessment of the data in the Syt-1, Syt-7 and Munc13-2 KO cells, which presumably do express WT level Doc2B.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend states overexpression. How do Doc2B expression levels in Doc2B KO cells compare quantitatively with Doc2B levels in WT chromaffin cells? The authors do not convincingly address the possibility that Doc2B abundance may be responsible for inhibition of the sustained phase and the reported effects seen in Syt-1 KO and Munc13-2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>). Syt-1 KO and Munc13-2 KO cells contain endogenous proteins and the overexpression of Doc2B WT may have introduced significantly more protein above background (this is unknown because this data is not included but pSFV is known to induce very high overexpression levels). In case of higher Doc2B protein expression in Syt1 KO+Doc2B WT versus Syt1 KO, there is a possibility that this difference may explain the observed decrease. The same could be said for the Munc13-2 KO experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>3) Subsection “Doc2B requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 to stimulate priming”, Figure 1Bii: The authors state that in absence of Syt-1, Doc2B has no effect on slow burst. However, the slow burst in syt1 KO is almost 50% larger than that in syt1 KO + Doc2B WT although the error bars are too large to achieve apparently p&lt;0.05 significance. Is this due to the smaller sample size? In Figure 1Ai, similar amount of difference between Doc2B KO and Doc2B KO+Doc2B WT is statistically significant, and the sample size is also larger than that in Figure 1Bii. As it stands, it remains unclear whether Doc2B has no effect on slow burst.</p><p>4) In the Discussion section and elsewhere in the manuscript: The increase in burst amplitude in the presence of Doc2B is interpreted as promotion of a step towards priming upstream of fusion. It is not obvious why this could not as well be a consequence of Doc2B inhibiting release, which could also lead to a larger RRP and could at the same time explain the reduction of the sustained phase. While the data may contain evidence for rejecting such an alternative hypothesis it should at least be explicitly discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>5. The authors state that chromaffin cells do not express Doc2A (Subsection “Doc2B requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 to stimulate priming”). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Shows imaging data from Doc2A/B double knockout cells. How were these cells generated and why (not found in Materials and methods section)? All the other data are apparently from Doc2B single knockouts. Is there endogenous Doc2A in mouse chromaffin cells and if so how does that impact the conclusions?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> needs the quantification of CONTROL. As it stands, given the apparent Doc2B labeling in DKO cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is inconclusive. The intensity values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> include the non-Doc2B-specific fluorescence in Control, which one would need to subtract to assess expression levels of the different constructs. Expression levels of different constructs may actually vary dramatically if that background subtraction is done. Also, for comparison staining intensity of unmodified WT cells would be important to quantify to determine the overexpression factors. This relates to point 2 above.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref> expression of Doc2B-EGFP appears to be much higher than that of Doc2B DN-EGFP, could this affect protein localization? In contrast <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicates that expression of the DN mutant is similar or higher than WT.</p><p>8) What are the Doc2B expression levels for the different KO cells as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – are they similar in WT, syt-1, syt-7, Munc13-2 knockout cells?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,G</xref> indicates that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming as indicated by relative burst amplitude change is even higher in Doc2B KO than in Doc2B overexpressing cells. How does this fit with the author's conclusion that Doc2B is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for priming?</p><p>10) In the long pulse stimulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there seems to be no obvious exhaustion and it is not clear why the cumulative Cm increase is equated to RRP. Are the ratios of Cm responses informative for quantification of pool size? Is there more refilling between pulses than in experiments with WT chromaffin cells? Could the negative control data be included?</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: How do we know the increased labeling is due to syntaxin availability and not due to direct labeling of Doc2B? Has the labeling experiment been performed in Stx-1 KO cells +/- Doc2B? The negative control data (Doc2B KO) should be included in D-H.</p><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> it is not clear what the effect of Doc2B ∆MID is (if any) – the control (Doc2B KO) needs to be included for this data set.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) My major concerns deals with the central conclusion of the manuscript implicating now Doc2B as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for vesicle priming, a notion that is largely based on the observation that the DN mutant and the 6A mutant abolishes any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the vesicle priming reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4M</xref>). In general, this notion seems to be difficult to reconcile with previous conclusions by the authors implicating Doc2B as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for spontaneous release in neurons spontaneous (Groffen et al., 2010) and others suggesting a function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for asynchronous transmitter release (Yao et al., 2011). Furthermore, the authors themselves have previously reported, otherwise (Pinheiro et al., 2013). By analyzing the exocytotic burst size over a wide range of preflash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]I in wild type and Doc2B-KO cells, they could show that Doc2B has no obligatory role in driving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming reaction upstream of the slowly releasable pool. Also in the present manuscript the authors find the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the priming reaction of chromaffin vesicles to be unperturbed in cells of Doc2B null mutants when compared with controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>While the lack of effect with null mutant cells could be readily explained by functionally redundant isoforms, it is similarly possible that mutating Doc2B endows special properties that allow the protein to bypass the classical priming reaction. Previous studies using similar mutations have indeed suggested that mutations in the C2A region of Doc2B (intended to disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding) resulted in an anomalous increase in constitutive membrane binding and thereby provide Doc2B with novel functional properties (Gaffaney et al., 2014). Thus, I'm not convinced that these experiments with the mutant proteins (DN and 6A mutation) provide clear evidence that Doc2B acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor in vesicle priming. The apparent gain-of-function mutation may rather result from anomalous membrane binding activity. The latter is only displayed as exemplary results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>) and should be presented in a quantitative fashion. I also recommend to study the dependence of the burst size on preflash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i over a wider range of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- concentrations, as presented for example by Pinheiro et al., 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>2) Previously, the authors have shown that overexpressing Doc2b increased significantly the total number of vesicles per cell as well as the number of membrane-proximal vesicles (Pinheiro et al., 2013). This raises the question, to what extent apparent changes in priming with the DN and 6A mutation are accompanied by alterations in vesicle number and whether a similar phenotype can be observed with the mutant proteins. In this context, I do not understand the authors' statement in subsection “Doc2B supports vesicle priming as a calcium sensor”: &quot;The DN-mutant was expressed at similar levels as WT Doc2B, and VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2 staining also showed similar levels, consistent with an unperturbed granule density in the presence of Doc2B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref>).&quot; The authors should clarify this point.</p><p>3) The most prominent phenotype in Doc2B KO seems to be the enhanced sustained release under prolonged elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. This action of Doc2B is dependent on its MID-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) but curiously not on its interaction with Munc 13-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The authors hypothesized a secondary function of Doc2B that blocks interactions with CAPS-proteins leading to inhibition of sustained release. While intriguing, the authors provide no evidence for an interaction between Doc2B MID domain and CAPS-protein. Furthermore, functional studies of Doc2B action in CAPS KO are required to draw such conclusions, in absence of which the readers are left with rather incomplete understanding of the inhibitory action of Doc2B. Thus, it might be helpful to study the Doc2B-CAPS interactions to better clarify the mechanism of inhibitory Doc2B function in chromaffin cells.</p><p>4) It remains unclear why specifically the RRP but not the IRP is altered with Doc2B DN mutant expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27000.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> an important control needs to be included, the overexpression of Doc2B in WT chromaffin cells that are not devoid of endogenous Doc2B background.

Due to the already very large <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we could not include it there. The data shows an increase in primed vesicle pools (and a decrease in the sustained component). In contrast to Doc2B over-expression in KO cells, the SRP was also increased by Doc2B expression in WT cells (CD1 mice). We point out and discuss this finding in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend states overexpression. How do Doc2B expression levels in Doc2B KO cells compare quantitatively with Doc2B levels in WT chromaffin cells? The authors do not convincingly address the possibility that Doc2B abundance may be responsible for inhibition of the sustained phase and the reported effects seen in Syt-1 KO and Munc13-2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>).

This has now been corrected by performing new stainings (see also below). As for the rest of the question, we realized that we did not define the rationale for the experiment: it was the purpose of our experiment to induce significantly more protein above background, to push the system to show a clear effect of Doc2B. The question is whether that level of overexpression leads to artefacts. This is not the case, because the overexpression in WT or Doc2B KO cells results in an increase of primed vesicle pools, and a decrease in sustained release. This is entirely consistent with the decrease in primed vesicle pools (seen best during repetitive depolarization stimulations) and the increase in sustained release identified in the Doc2B knockout when compared to WT littermates (Pinheiro et al., 2013). We added this rationale to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Doc2B requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 to stimulate priming”, Figure 1Bii: The authors state that in absence of Syt-1, Doc2B has no effect on slow burst.

However, the slow burst is the hardest phase to quantify, because it is sandwiched between the fast burst and the sustained component. Therefore, it is always a risk that the reduction in the sustained component (as seen with Doc2B overexpression) could leak into the slow burst and appear as a reduction there. Therefore, we feel we cannot make strong statements about the slow burst if the other phases are changed as well. We have now pointed this out in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Discussion section and elsewhere in the manuscript: The increase in burst amplitude in the presence of Doc2B is interpreted as promotion of a step towards priming upstream of fusion.

In our previous work (Pinheiro et al., 2013), we could not make this distinction, but now we can, because we here identify several mutations, where the increase in RRP is absent, but the decrease in sustained release is still detected. So, we have separated those two functions by mutation (see first paragraph of Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Shows imaging data from Doc2A/B double knockout cells. How were these cells generated and why (not found in Materials and methods section)? All the other data are apparently from Doc2B single knockouts. Is there endogenous Doc2A in mouse chromaffin cells and if so how does that impact the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>Doc2A is not expressed in chromaffin cells (Friedrich et al., 2008; Pinheiro et al., 2013), which we mentioned in the manuscript. The staining was done in Doc2A/B double-KO cells, because the Doc2B single KO mouse line was not available in the laboratory when these experiments were performed. This should not have any impact on results, because Doc2A is not expressed. We have now added this explanation and the description of this mouse line to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> needs the quantification of CONTROL. As it stands, given the apparent Doc2B labeling in DKO cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is inconclusive. The intensity values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> include the non-Doc2B-specific fluorescence in Control, which one would need to subtract to assess expression levels of the different constructs. Expression levels of different constructs may actually vary dramatically if that background subtraction is done. Also, for comparison staining intensity of unmodified WT cells would be important to quantify to determine the overexpression factors. This relates to point 2 above.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We have now replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with new data, which includes stainings of controls. Staining of WT cells (cells from Doc2B WT mice) in parallel show that our antibody cannot detect endogenous protein in immunocytochemistry and produces some non-specific staining, probably due the presence of other epitopes in DKO cells. Nevertheless, expression of Doc2B in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells has been clearly shown by in situ hybridisation (Friedrich et al., 2006 – supplementary materials), and confirmed by analysis of the knockout cells, incl. the ability to rescue the phenotype with Doc2B expression (Pinheiro et al., 2013). Thus, the fact that the antibody cannot detect the endogenous protein is most likely an antibody sensitivity problem. This does not affect its ability to detect overexpressed protein, as it is present at higher levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref> expression of Doc2B-EGFP appears to be much higher than that of Doc2B DN-EGFP, could this affect protein localization? In contrast <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicates that expression of the DN mutant is similar or higher than WT.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested this possibility, but observed that the relative expression levels of the Doc2B DN and WT protein cannot be assessed by comparing their EGFP-fluorescence in live cells, because the two constructs do not have the same localization. In our Doc2B WT construct, when stimulating with high-K (so that the protein goes to the membrane), the total fluorescence is decreased – this is reversible. This is probably due to self-quenching of EGFP when accumulating at the membrane, or recruitment to parts of the plasma membrane outside of the confocal slice. At the suggestion of reviewer #2 we have now quantified live cell imaging experiments in a number of cells and include the quantification in a separate figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since absolute intensities are not informative, quantifications are done on ratios (total fluorescence / fluorescence inside the cell). In addition, please note that the fusion constructs are not used for staining or electrophysiological experiments (for those experiments bicistronic constructs were used), therefore they cannot be directly compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What are the Doc2B expression levels for the different KO cells as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – are they similar in WT, syt-1, syt-7, Munc13-2 knockout cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed Western Blot against Doc2B of Syt-1 KO and Syt-7 KO cells and included it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. The endogenous protein is hard to detect with the antibody, but no overt changes were noted. Our Munc13-2 KO mouse colony is currently not running, and we have not obtained any glands. Please note – this is a point related to the point 2 above – that no conclusion in our manuscript requires the Doc2B expression levels to be exactly the same in the KOs. The point of our experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was to use overexpression to push the effect of Doc2B to the maximum, and test which of the other secretory proteins it depends on. We have added this rationale in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,G</xref> indicates that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming as indicated by relative burst amplitude change is even higher in Doc2B KO than in Doc2B overexpressing cells. How does this fit with the author's conclusion that Doc2B is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for priming?</p></disp-quote><p>This is already discussed in the Discussion section: we show here that Doc2B is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for priming, however there must be an overlapping or redundant pathway in chromaffin cells, since priming is still present in the KOs. We do not think this is very surprising. Munc13-2 has several Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites and can probably be activated without Doc2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the long pulse stimulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there seems to be no obvious exhaustion and it is not clear why the cumulative Cm increase is equated to RRP. Are the ratios of Cm responses informative for quantification of pool size? Is there more refilling between pulses than in experiments with WT chromaffin cells? Could the negative control data be included?</p></disp-quote><p>The release until the end was found to be similar to the RRP in flash experiments, therefore we call it “RRP”, but we discuss that it might not be exactly the same pool as the RRP found in flash data. We don’t find the ratios very informative, since the depression is very small (or absent) in many cells and using ratios would therefore lead us to leave out many cells, making the analysis unrepresentative. There are no ‘negative control data’ here (or we don’t understand what the reviewer means): as we describe, expression of Doc2B WT, or Doc2B DN led to strong inhibition of Calcium-currents; therefore, a comparison to uninfected cells is not meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: How do we know the increased labeling is due to syntaxin availability and not due to direct labeling of Doc2B? Has the labeling experiment been performed in Stx-1 KO cells +/- Doc2B? The negative control data (Doc2B KO) should be included in D-H.</p></disp-quote><p>The antibody used is specific for syntaxin-1, as we have shown in another paper using BoNT/C expressing cells (Toft-Bertelsen et al., 2016). We now point this out in the manuscript. In that paper, we also showed that staining is increased within minutes when dispersing syntaxin-clusters directly using cholesterol extraction. In the present manuscript we show that syntaxin-1 staining is not increased when we mutate Doc2B to not bind to SNAREs (KE-mutant), which is another confirmation of the specificity of the effect (and the antibody). We do not have access to syntaxin-1 KO mice. We have included quantification of the KO condition in panels D-H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> it is not clear what the effect of Doc2B ∆MID is (if any) – the control (Doc2B KO) needs to be included for this data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the Doc2B KO condition and discussed the effect of ∆MID clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) My major concerns deals with the central conclusion of the manuscript implicating now Doc2B as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for vesicle priming, a notion that is largely based on the observation that the DN mutant and the 6A mutant abolishes any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the vesicle priming reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4M</xref>). In general, this notion seems to be difficult to reconcile with previous conclusions by the authors implicating Doc2B as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for spontaneous release in neurons spontaneous (Groffen et al., 2010) and others suggesting a function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for asynchronous transmitter release (Yao et al., 2011). Furthermore, the authors themselves have previously reported, otherwise (Pinheiro et al., 2013). By analyzing the exocytotic burst size over a wide range of preflash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]I in wild type and Doc2B-KO cells, they could show that Doc2B has no obligatory role in driving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming reaction upstream of the slowly releasable pool. Also in the present manuscript the authors find the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of the priming reaction of chromaffin vesicles to be unperturbed in cells of Doc2B null mutants when compared with controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>While the lack of effect with null mutant cells could be readily explained by functionally redundant isoforms, it is similarly possible that mutating Doc2B endows special properties that allow the protein to bypass the classical priming reaction. Previous studies using similar mutations have indeed suggested that mutations in the C2A region of Doc2B (intended to disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding) resulted in an anomalous increase in constitutive membrane binding and thereby provide Doc2B with novel functional properties (Gaffaney et al., 2014). Thus, I'm not convinced that these experiments with the mutant proteins (DN and 6A mutation) provide clear evidence that Doc2B acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor in vesicle priming. The apparent gain-of-function mutation may rather result from anomalous membrane binding activity. The latter is only displayed as exemplary results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>) and should be presented in a quantitative fashion. I also recommend to study the dependence of the burst size on preflash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i over a wider range of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- concentrations, as presented for example by Pinheiro et al., 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed new experiments and included a quantification of the membrane binding activity of Doc2B WT, DN, 6A, and ΔMID in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This shows – as we had previously described qualitatively – that WT and ΔMID cycle on and off the plasma membrane upon treatment with High-K<sup>+</sup> solution. Also the DN cycles to a minor degree (as we had mentioned also before), but it also displays a much higher membrane localization at rest than the WT; thus it is only a minor fraction of the DN mutant that cycles, since most resides at the membrane. The 6A-mutation does not cycle on and off the membrane, but remains at the plasma membrane. The reviewer raises the question whether the DN mutation has ‘anomalous increase in constitutive membrane binding and thereby provides Doc2B with novel functional properties’. The decisive experiments that we performed here was to study the effect of expressing Doc2B WT and DN when stimulated from a low and a high basal-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The striking result is that the DN is a gain-of-function mutant when studied from a low basal-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but – when studied from a high basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] – <underline>it is indistinguishable from the WT</underline>. This latter fact indicates that the DN is not special or anomalous, except that it is already abundant at the membrane at very low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The WT protein would not be at the membrane at low basal-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and thus the gain-of-function of the DN-mutant is entirely understandable from the trafficking behavior. The only exception is the fusion time constant of the RRP, which is significantly faster for the DN-mutant when studied from high basal-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (we commented on this also in the first version of the manuscript). In addition, we see basically the same behavior by another mutant – the 6A-mutant – which is unable to bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> at all, but which is also constitutively at the membrane. Also, this mutation is gain-of-function when studied from low basal-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>], although it is slightly inferior to the WT at high basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. This permanent membrane localization of the 6A-mutation sheds new light on this mutation, which was previously used to argue that Doc2B might have Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent effect (Pang et al., 2011); now we see that also this mutation bypasses Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding by being permanently at the plasma membrane. We have not been able to extend the range of preflash [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that we study, because of the huge amount of work that would be involved, in combination with the modest yield of cells from a single Doc2B embryo. As far as we can see, the current data provide very strong evidence for our conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Doc2B drives it to the membrane, which leads to membrane priming.</p><p>Our data here are consistent with our previous data (Pinheiro et al., 2013), since we noted – and discussed carefully in the Discussion that calcium-dependent priming is still present in Doc2B KO cells, probably because of redundant processes/proteins (as the reviewer mentions), which can be overridden by overexpression of Doc2B DN. When comparing to data obtained in synapses, it is worth remembering that the vesicles we study here (large dense-core vesicles) are different from synaptic vesicles, and there is nothing surprising in having different functions of the protein in the two (very) different systems. Also, the groups studying synaptic vesicles cannot agree as to the function of Doc2B in asynchronous release. Nevertheless, we think the data might be reconciled, since priming in chromaffin cells is driven by SNARE-complex assembly, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (due to the trafficking of Doc2B) SNARE-complex formation could very well in other systems lead to spontaneous, or even (if fast enough, which is unclear) asynchronous release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previously, the authors have shown that overexpressing Doc2B increased significantly the total number of vesicles per cell as well as the number of membrane-proximal vesicles (Pinheiro et al., 2013). This raises the question, to what extent apparent changes in priming with the DN and 6A mutation are accompanied by alterations in vesicle number and whether a similar phenotype can be observed with the mutant proteins. In this context, I do not understand the authors' statement in subsection “Doc2B supports vesicle priming as a calcium sensor”: &quot;The DN-mutant was expressed at similar levels as WT Doc2B, and VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2 staining also showed similar levels, consistent with an unperturbed granule density in the presence of Doc2B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref>).&quot; The authors should clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the stainings, as explained above. In the process of doing this, we realized that quantification of Doc2 and Syb2 cannot be done accurately on samples stained for both proteins, because the expression and staining of Doc2 reduces the staining for Syb2, probably because of antibody interference. We have therefore performed separate stainings for Doc2 and syb2, in an attempt to solve this question. However, this didn’t change the conclusion. We can only speculate why there is a difference between the EM and the immunostaining. These are very different measures, and there are plenty of reasons these measures could turn out different. In the EM the levels of proteins were not quantified; In Immunostaining we did not quantify granules, only overall syb2-intensity. Thus, formally one possibility is that the total syb2 content is distributed between more granules after overexpression, although because these measurements were done several years apart by different people, we would not be comfortable making such a conclusion at the present time. We now pointed out this possible discrepancy in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The most prominent phenotype in Doc2B KO seems to be the enhanced sustained release under prolonged elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. This action of Doc2B is dependent on its MID-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) but curiously not on its interaction with Munc 13-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The authors hypothesized a secondary function of Doc2B that blocks interactions with CAPS-proteins leading to inhibition of sustained release. While intriguing, the authors provide no evidence for an interaction between Doc2B MID domain and CAPS-protein. Furthermore, functional studies of Doc2B action in CAPS KO are required to draw such conclusions, in absence of which the readers are left with rather incomplete understanding of the inhibitory action of Doc2B. Thus, it might be helpful to study the Doc2B-CAPS interactions to better clarify the mechanism of inhibitory Doc2B function in chromaffin cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, studying the Doc2B-CAPS interaction directly would certainly be helpful. However, repeating the experiments in CAPS DKO cells has not been possible, because we currently don’t have CAPS DKO mice available in the laboratory. We have tried to make it clearer in our text that we are discussing the possibilities; we are not drawing a conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It remains unclear why specifically the RRP but not the IRP is altered with Doc2B DN mutant expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The IRP is larger on average, but it is far from significant. We now discuss this. The point is that the IRP is a subpool of the RRP, consisting of RRP-vesicles that are close to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels. Therefore, there are more factors involved in making an IRP-vesicle than a RRP-vesicle. Most likely another factor (number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels?) is limiting for the IRP-vesicles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
