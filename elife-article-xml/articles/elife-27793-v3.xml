Its motor domain contains conserved nucleotide binding motifs, but is divergent in sequence (~35% identity) and size (~40% larger) compared to other kinesins. Using cryo-electron microscopy and biophysical assays, we have undertaken a mechanochemical dissection of the microtubule-bound MKLP2 motor domain during its ATPase cycle, and show that many facets of its mechanism are distinct from other kinesins. While the MKLP2 neck-linker is directed towards the microtubule plus-end in an ATP-like state, it does not fully dock along the motor domain. Furthermore, the footprint of the MKLP2 motor domain on the MT surface is altered compared to motile kinesins, and enhanced by kinesin-6-specific sequences. The conformation of the highly extended loop6 insertion characteristic of kinesin-6s is nucleotide-independent and does not contact the MT surface. Our results emphasize the role of family-specific insertions in modulating kinesin motor function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27793.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells constantly replicate to provide new cells for growing tissues, and to replace ageing or defective cells around the body. Each new cell needs a copy of the genetic material, and a cellular structure called the mitotic spindle makes sure that this material is shared correctly when a cell divides in two. The spindle is built from protein filaments called microtubules, and the protein filaments grow and shrink as the mitotic spindle carries out its role. Many of these changes in the spindle are driven by proteins called molecular motors, which break down energy-rich molecules of ATP to power them as they walk along the filaments.</p><p>Kinesins, for example, are molecular motors that can move along microtubules and there are over 40 different kinesins encoded in the human genome. More than half of the human kinesins are involved in cell division including one called MKLP2. Little is known about MKLP2 but some earlier findings had suggested that it would behave very differently compared to other kinesins.</p><p>Understanding how a kinesin motor works requires studying it in complex with its microtubule tracks. Atherton, Yu et al. have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy – which is uniquely suited to looking at large and complicated samples in three dimensions – to observe how the motor in MKLP2 changes shape as it works. This revealed that, while MKLP2 works in a fundamentally similar way to other kinesins, many aspects of its molecular mechanism are highly unusual. These include how it binds to the microtubule, how it interacts with ATP and how it generates force.</p><p>These findings show that there is much greater diversity in the molecular mechanisms of the kinesins involved in cell division than was previously thought. Several anticancer drugs target kinesins to stop cells dividing and so this diversity may make it easier to target only certain kinesins with drugs, which in turn would have fewer side effects. First, though, it will be important to find out how the unusual mechanism of MKLP2 coordinates and influences other components of the spindle to reveal a fuller picture of what happens when cells replicate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The success of mitosis depends on the intricate timing, precise localisation and regulated interactions between multiple spindle components. MKLP2 (Kif20A), a kinesin-6 family motor, is involved at several key stages of cell division, and in particular is essential for cytokinesis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2000</xref>). MKLP2 interacts with and is regulated by a number of mitotic kinases including Cdk1/cyclin B prior to anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hümmer and Mayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitagawa et al., 2014</xref>). MKLP2 is required for localisation of Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC) components, including Aurora B kinase, to the midzone at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruneberg et al., 2004</xref>), which is in turn required for Kif4A and PRC1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nunes Bastos et al., 2013</xref>). MKLP2 also participates in myosin II recruitment for cleavage furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kitagawa et al., 2013</xref>) and interacts with the cell membrane to promote abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, it is a substrate for polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and the co-association at the midzone of MKLP2 and Plk1 is also required for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neef et al., 2003</xref>). In the light of these activities and because MKLP2 is found to be highly expressed in tumour tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gasnereau et al., 2012</xref>), inhibition of MKLP2 by antimitotics has been explored, and small molecule inhibitors of MKLP2 have been shown to perturb mammalian cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tcherniuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Labrière et al., 2016</xref>). While there has been significant focus on dissecting cell cycle dependent function and regulation of MKLP2, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive this function. MKLP2 shares only approximately 35% sequence identity with kinesin-1 (Kin1), which suggests that much of what is known about kinesin molecular function may not necessarily apply to this motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hizlan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the molecular and mechanistic properties of MKLP2. A related kinesin family member, the kinesin-6 MKLP1 - part of the centralspindlin complex that is also essential for cytokinesis - is a plus-end directed motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nislow et al., 1992</xref>), as is Kif20B, another kinesin-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abaza et al., 2003</xref>). The centralspindlin holocomplex has anti-parallel microtubule (MT) bundling capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2015</xref>) consistent with its localisation and function in the spindle midzone. Functional diversification within the kinesin superfamily is derived in part from variation within kinesin motor domain itself. Kinesin-6s are particularly intriguing in this context because they are up to ~40% larger than the canonical Kin1 motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) due to a number of unique loop insertions. Within the mammalian MKLP2 motor domain sequence, these unique features include a ~ 60 residue N-terminal extension, insertions in loop 2 (18 aa), loop 6 (99 aa), loop 8 (5 aa) and loop 12 (6 aa), along with an extended non-canonical neck-linker; there is also a ~ 40 aa insert between this neck linker region and MKLP2’s coiled coil. However, the effects of these modifications on motor structure and function are unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27793.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Atypical biochemistry of MKLP2 motor domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Cryo-EM is an essential structural method for characterising kinesin-MT complexes and has, to date, revealed a mechanistic consensus for plus-end directed kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulet et al., 2014</xref>). To address the deficit in molecular understanding of the MKLP2 mechanism, we have determined cryo-EM reconstructions and calculated atomic models of MT-bound MKLP2 in different nucleotide states. These structures provide a visualisation of the conformations that functional MKLP2 undergoes, and which are blocked by small molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tcherniuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Labrière et al., 2016</xref>). These structures, supported by biochemical and biophysical characterisations, reveal many atypical properties and behaviours of the MKLP2 motor domain. Strikingly, these noncanonical properties are superimposed on more generally conserved ATP-dependent subdomain movements within the motor domain. MKLP2 motor domain binding on the MT surface is shifted compared with other kinesins, and additional contacts between the MT and MKLP2 insertions in loops 2, 8 and 12 are formed. Additionally, while the MKLP2 neck-linker is directed towards the MT plus end in an ATP-like state enabling formation of the cover-neck bundle, the neck-linker does not fully dock against the motor core and exhibits more flexibility than is seen in transport motors such as Kin1 and kinesin-3 (Kin3). Moreover, the characteristic kinesin-6 large insertion in loop6 forms a discrete additional subdomain protruding from the MKLP2 motor core and away from the MT. Our characterisation provides a context in which the functional contribution of this motor in mitosis can be evaluated and offers a mechanistic framework in which other atypical members of the kinesin superfamily can be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The biochemical properties of the MKLP2 motor domain differ from those of other kinesins</title><p>We expressed monomeric mammalian MKLP2 motor domain constructs 1–520 and 25–520 and measured their steady-state MT-stimulated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In each case, the nucleotide binding transients consisted of fast and slow phases. The faster phase varies linearly with [nucleotide], implying that this is a readout of the initial binding of nucleotide to the active site; the slower phase shows little dependence on [nucleotide], implying that it measures a subsequent isomerization step. For 2’dmT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), rates in the presence and absence of MT are nearly identical (including Y intercept), implying that – unlike e.g. Kin-1 or Kin-5 – the kinetics of binding 2’dmT to MKLP2-MD are essentially independent of MTs. Binding of 2’dmD produces similar behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with an approximately two-fold increase in the apparent second order rate constant for 2’dmD binding. Extrapolation of the linear fit to the origin defines an apparent 2’dmD dissociation rate constant, and in other kinesins, such plots typically go through the origin in the absence of MTs, implying tight ADP binding within the error of the measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hackney, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cochran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Taylor, 1995</xref>). However, as is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the corresponding plot for MKLP2-MD intercepts the y axis well above the origin. Although this is an indirect way of calculating the ADP dissociation rate constant, it implies that the interaction of ADP with MKLP2 is unlike that of other kinesins. In order to directly examine the kinetics of ADP release from MKLP2-MD in the absence of MTs, we formed a complex of MKLP2-MD:2’dmD and mixed it in the stopped flow with a large excess of unlabelled ADP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement1</xref> shows that the resulting fluorescence decrease, which reflects 2’dmD dissociation, fits a single exponential process with rate constant of 51.9 ± 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>, i.e. the rate of ADP release from MKLP2-MD in the absence of MTs is unusually high. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a relative uncoupling of allosteric communication between the MT binding and catalytic sites in MKLP2-MD compared to other kinesins that have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cochran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma and Taylor, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The binding affinity of MKLP2-MD to MTs was measured as a function of nucleotide state by a co-sedimentation assay, using a fixed [MKLP2-MD] and a range of [MT].

In marked contrast to other kinesins, however, the ADP state of MKLP2-MD - which usually represents the kinesin weak binding state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenfeld et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crevel et al., 1996</xref>) – demonstrates a relatively high affinity. Thus, the difference in affinity between nucleotide states that in other kinesins are ‘strong’ binding (NN, AMPPNP) and ‘weak’ binding (ADP) is only about 8.5-fold. Overall, MKLP2-MD associates with MTs relatively strongly throughout its ATPase cycle. Together, these results provide additional evidence of the non-canonical properties of the MKLP2-MD mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conserved nucleotide-dependent subdomain rearrangements provides a structural framework for MKLP2 divergence</title><p>To visualise the MKLP2-MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and provide insight into these unusual biochemical properties, we calculated MT-bound MKLP2-MD reconstructions with different nucleotides bound: (1) ADP; (2) no nucleotide (NN) using apyrase treatment; (3, 4) ATP-like analogues (AMPPNP and ADP.AlFx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The properties of MKLP2-MD are such that an MT-bound MKLP2-MD-ADP structure could be captured, in which density corresponding to ADP is coordinated primarily via the P-loop with some connectivity to Switch II/loop11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A portion of loop11 is visible near the P-loop and the N-terminus of helix-α6, while most is not visible.

However, in MT-bound MKLP2-MD-ADP, loop9 as well as the N-terminus of helix-α4 are more flexible compared to these other kinesin-ADP conformations, reflecting distinct properties of MKLP2-MD.</p><p>Highly unusually, in the MKLP2-MD-NN structure, no major conformational differences are seen compared to MKLP2-MD-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, middle), although nucleotide density is clearly lacking from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Local differences due to subtle rotations in both the Switch I/II and the P-loop subdomains are seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, middle), and helix-α4 is longer by ~1 turn compared to MKLP2-MD-ADP, but its N-terminal end along with most of loop11 are flexible. However, unlike in the ADP-bound structure, a region of Switch II density in loop11 now appears connected to helix-α4. The connection to helix-α4 is close to the highly conserved ‘linchpin’ Asn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>) (N430 in mouse MKLP2, N255 in Kin1), is also seen in Kin1/3 NN states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, density corresponding to the P-loop has shifted away from the MT surface, and while density corresponding to loop9 is visible, with part of it contacting the P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, middle), loop9 does not adopt a defined conformation, due to flexibility. The overall disordered nature of the N-terminus of helix-α4, loop 11 and loop 9 is very different from the more ordered conformation of these elements consistently seen in the MT-bound NN state of other plus-end kinesins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goulet et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the well-defined connectivity of loop11 and the MT surface seen in Kin1/3/5 NN states is not well ordered in MKLP2-MD. Thus, the MKLP2-MD-ADP and –NN structures are more similar to each other with respect to flexibility of MT binding elements at the helix-α4 N-terminus and loop11 than is typical for other kinesins.</p><p>Transition to the MKLP2-MD-ADP.AlFx structure causes substantial local rearrangements in the vicinity of the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right), which are in turn linked to large subdomain rearrangements compared to the ADP-to-NN transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These rearrangements can also be described by the configuration of clefts between the subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, see also Discussion). First, density connects the P-loop and loop11 in the presence of bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right). However, in the presence of the ADP.Pi-like analogue, stable conformations for all components around the active site are also observed: density corresponding to the N-terminal end of helix-α4 and loop11 are seen and exhibit connectivity to adjacent regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right), while the N-terminus of loop11 runs past the P-loop, the γ-phosphate mimic, and is connected to helix-α4, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right). The C-terminal end of loop11 forms a helical turn and density in this region connects to the N-terminus of helix-α6. There is also connectivity between the N-terminal end of helix-α4 and loop9, while the proximity of loop9 and loop11 is consistent with a ‘phosphate tube’ structure as seen in other ATP/ADP.Pi-like kinesin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parke et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the compactness of the ATPase site is consistent with adoption of a catalytically competent conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parke et al., 2010</xref>), similar to that seen in other kinesins, highlighting mechanochemical conservation within the superfamily with respect to closure of the active site to enable ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>However, the MKLP2-MD-AMPPNP reconstruction illustrates another interesting divergence of MKLP2-MD mechanochemistry compared to Kin1/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In Kin1 and Kin3, the motor conformation in the presence of AMPPNP and ADP.AlFx are essentially indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). However, in MKLP2-MD, while density corresponding to bound AMPPNP is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), none of the characteristic features in the motor observed for the catalytically competent ADP.AlFx conformation are seen upon AMPPNP binding. Instead, this reconstruction exhibits a similar conformation to the MKLP2-ADP and –NN reconstructions, such that at the nucleotide binding site, helix-α4 shows a partially extended conformation and only some density corresponding to loop9 and loop11 is visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This reconstruction thereby illustrates the large difference in structural response of MKLP2-MD to different ATP-like analogues - AMPPNP compared to ADP.AlFx – and is a further readout of the divergent properties of MKLP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MKLP2 has a non-canonical MT binding interface and footprint on the MT surface</title><p>The divergent properties of MKLP2-MD are further emphasised in its interaction with the MT surface.

In the presence of ADP.AlFx, density for this element extends from the minus end of the MKLP2-MD and connects to α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with the large rotation of the P-loop subdomain in this ADP.AlFx state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Compared to Kin1, not only does the MKLP2-MD contain extra sequences that contact the MT, but the precise position and orientation of MKLP2-MD as a whole is also noticeably shifted and rotated on the MT surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A similar shift and rotation is present in both our MT-bound NN and ADP.AlFx MKLP2-MD reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and is therefore independent of the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes. This shift and rotation particularly alters the MT interface of MKLP2-MD near the nucleotide binding pocket. For example, in MKLP2-MD, loop7 is closer to β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) compared to Kin1, while the ordered single-turn helix in loop11 is closer to H3 than H12 in α-tubulin in the MKLP2-MD-ADP.AlFx state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, both kinesin-conserved and MKLP2-MD-specific elements contribute to the motor’s interaction with the MT, several of which are nucleotide sensitive. The collective effect of MKLP2-specific modifications leads to the shift and rotation of the MKLP2-MD on the MT surface. The differences in MKLP-MD compared to Kin1 also modify its footprint on the MT surface, leading to MKLP2-MD contacting a greater MT surface area in all states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The enhancing effect of the shift and rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) is most clearly seen in the increased footprint of loop7 and α4 (in both NN and ADP.AlFx states), and loop11 in the ADP.AlFx state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transition from NN to ADP.AlFx states and further rotation of the Switch I/II subdomain brings loop7 and loop8 into even more extensive contact with β-tubulin’s H4, while full ordering of helix-α4 and loop11 adjacent to the active site leads to additional contacts with α-tubulin. Moreover, ordering of MKLP2-specfic insertions that are present in the ADP.AlFx reconstruction produce a further enhancement of the MKLP2-MD footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition to the enlarged footprint of MKLP2-MD on the negatively charged MT surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woehlke et al., 1997</xref>), the electrostatic surface of MKLP2-MD shows a more pronounced positive interaction surface compared to kinesin-1, especially around the C-terminal end of helix-α4, a region that is nucleotide invariant.

Helix-α6 of MKLP2-MD extends beneath the core β-sheet, thereby directing the neck-linker towards the MT plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This is consistent with the presence of a conserved cluster of hydrophobic residues in helix-α4, helix-α6 and the N-terminus that form a structural pocket that accommodates the helix-α6 extension and neck-linker reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is also consistent with orientation of the N-terminus towards the MT plus end and formation of the CNB. The density of these N-terminal residues corresponds to S61-V64 and for the neck-linker corresponds to Q505-H508. In support of partial docking and reorientation of the neck-linker, anisotropy decay curves show that the MKLP2-MD neck-linker becomes more ordered in the presence of ADP.AlFx - as shown by the increase in rotational correlation time - compared to the absence of nucleotide, and depends on MT binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, however, density corresponding to C-terminal residues extending from around H508, which would correspond to a docked neck-linker conformation, is not visible in the ADP.AlFx density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Residues of the MKLP2-MD extended N-terminus prior to S61 are also not visible. Consistent with a non-canonical neck-linker conformation, the neck-linker sequence itself differs markedly from other plus-end kinesins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Most plus-end directed kinesins have a conserved sequence in which two Asn residues make hydrogen bonds against the core, stabilizing neck-linker docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In MKLP2, these two Asn residues have been substituted for basic His residues, which would be predicted to preclude neck-linker docking. In addition, conserved core residues contacting this region of the neck-linker in plus-end directed kinesins are not fully conserved in MKLP2; for example Kin1-Y77→MKLP2- Q151 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, although subdomain rearrangement results in reorientation of the MKLP2-MD neck-linker towards the MT plus end – as with other plus end kinesins – the docking of the neck linker that is typically seen does not occur in MKLP2-MD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MKLP2 loop6 forms a distinct subdomain</title><p>Loop6 is the largest MKLP2-specific insertion (99 aa) and density corresponding to it is present in all nucleotide states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The higher resolution of the ADP.AlFx reconstruction facilitates the characterisation of density corresponding to loop6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), which emerges from the side of the motor domain facing the MT plus end. Given its position, connectivity and its apparent movement in the NN/ADP.AlFx transition, it is effectively part of the SwI/II subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Loop6 forms density that spreads across the MT-facing surface of the central β-sheet. This density also connects the MT facing surface of the core β-sheet with β-sheet-5a/b of the tubulin-binding subdomain that connects to the MT surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, loop6 itself does not appear to contact the MT surface. Creating a full model of loop6 was not possible, but secondary structure prediction of loop6 converged on the presence of a 4-turn helical region towards its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Density that corresponds to a helical structure was observed lying close to helix-α3 and we modelled an α-helix within it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

Using cryo-EM to generate structures that guide comparative modelling and flexible fitting, we have been able to visualise sequential states of the MT-bound MKLP2-MD ATPase cycle. Our structural dissection of a mammalian MKLP2-MD allows identification of aspects of its mechanism that appear conserved among kinesins along with many properties that differ substantially from other members of the superfamily.</p><p>Our set of structures allows us to characterise the response of the track-bound MKLP2-MD to nucleotide. Some aspects of its nucleotide-dependent conformational responses appear to be similar to Kin1/3/5, and can be framed in terms of relative movements of subdomains within the motor domain and the clefts that open and close between them (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). The so-called nucleotide cleft (NC) that lies between the Switch I/II and P-loop subdomains is predicted to close in the presence of bound nucleotide and to open in its absence. The polymer cleft (PC) lies between the tubulin-binding and the Switch I/II subdomains; it is closed in the presence of a close interaction between helix-α4 and SwII and open in its absence, and is proposed to change at different points in the MT-bound kinesin ATPase cycle. The docking cleft (DC) lies between the P-loop and tubulin-binding subdomains and when open allows insertion of helix-α6 and reorientation of the neck-linker towards the MT plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, for MKLP2-MD: (i) in the ADP-bound structure, the PC is open, while the NC is closed and the DC for the neck-linker is also closed; (ii) in the NN state, the PC is closed while the NC is open, such that the DC remains closed; (iii) in the ADP.AlFx state in which the active site is closed in a catalytic-competent conformation, both the PC and NC are closed leading to an opening of the DC and reorientation of the neck-linker towards the MT plus end. Our MKLP2-MD structures thus reinforce the logic of cleft opening/closure with respect to kinesin mechanochemistry first described for Kin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>), while demonstrating an elaboration of motor function through family-specific modifications.</p><p>The biochemistry of MKLP2 is highly divergent compared to canonical kinesins. The k<sub>cat</sub> of MKLP2-MD (4.4 s<sup>−1</sup>) is ~10 fold lower than kinesin-1 and -3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and a number of MKLP2-MD substitutions at otherwise highly conserved regions could influence multiple steps in its catalytic cycle. For example, MKLP2-MD has low ADP affinity in solution and this is barely altered on interaction with MTs. Indeed, the ADP release rate in the absence of MTs is only 2–3-fold less than that for Kin1/3 s in the presence of saturating MTs. Thus, while MT binding activates the MKLP2 ATPase, its basal ADP release rate is higher than k<sub>cat</sub>. The small structural changes observed when comparing our ADP and NN structures – in particular, that the N-terminus of helix-α4 and loop11 remain largely disordered in the NN state – is a distinctive property of these MKLP2/MT complexes compared to other plus end kinesins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>]). Substitutions at conserved sites around the nucleotide pocket might be predicted to destabilise the nucleotide binding network that is present in other kinesins. For example, substitution in loop9 at a residue otherwise completely conserved in all kinesins (Kin1-R190→MKLP2-Q365, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) could perturb side chain interactions proposed to be part of the so-called ‘Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabiliser’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, mutagenesis of this network in Kin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>) or Kin3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>) increases ADP release rates in the absence of MTs. Similarly, substitutions in and around the P-loop (Kin1-A83 →MKLP2-T157 and Kin1-Q86 →MKLP2-V160), along with helix-α6 (Kin1-N308→MKLP2-T489) may perturb the stability of loop11/P-loop at the active site through alteration of the so-called ‘anchor’ network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Loop11 itself is one residue shorter than in other N-kinesins, adopts a different conformation compared to Kin1 and contains substitutions in residues that contribute to stabilisation of Kin1’s ordered conformation in the NN and ATP-like states (Kin1-T241→MKLP2-Q417, and Kin1-A243→MKLP2-S419, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We conclude that the collective effect of these substitutions – along with possible effects from the shift of MKLP2-MD binding on the MT surface – is likely to be the reason for lower stabilisation of nucleotide binding to MKLP2-MD.</p><p>Given these properties, it is thus not clear what state our ADP-bound reconstruction corresponds to in terms of intermediates in the MKLP2 ATPase cycle. It could for example be the MKLP2-MD-ADP complex as it binds the MT from solution, or could represent a MT-bound NN structure captured after ADP binding. Given the fast kinetics of ADP release by MKLP2-MD, the latter seems more likely. Therefore, previously proposed mechanisms of MT-stimulated ADP release in Kin1/3 s may not be applicable to MKLP2-MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the position of the P-loop is shifted away from the MT in the MKLP2-NN structure compared to the ADP-bound structure and the PC is closed, conformational changes that were described to coincide with ADP release in Kin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). While apparently redundant in actively driving ADP release in MKLP2, these cleft and subdomain transitions when ADP is absent may still be important for subsequent larger scale rearrangements in the motor domain on ATP-binding and its conversion towards a hydrolysis-competent state.</p><p>The structure of the MKLP2-MD-ADP.AlFx reconstruction suggests that MT binding participates in stabilising helix-α4 and loop11 in this structure, supporting the conserved SwitchI/II and P-loop residues in adopting a catalytically relevant conformation. The MKLP2-ADP.AlFx reconstruction is overall comparable to hydrolysis-competent conformations seen in Kin1/3/4/5 with a so-called phosphate tube formed from loop9 and 11 supporting ATP hydrolysis. However, the reconstruction in the presence of AMPPNP most closely resembles that of ADP – rather than ADP.AlFx as is seen in Kin1/3 – and it may also represent the MKLP2-MD NN conformation after AMPPNP has bound to it. This too could be a reflection of MKLP2-specific substitutions within and around the nucleotide binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that influence the binding kinetics and structural transitions of MT-bound MKLP2-MD in response to different nucleotides, and which also contribute to the overall turnover rate of the motor’s ATPase. Precedents for different responses to different nucleotide analogues have also been observed in other kinesins – for example, small differences in motor conformation between AMPPNP and ADP.AlFx were observed for human Kin5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulet et al., 2014</xref>). Future detailed kinetics will yield further insights into the defining transitions of MKLP2 during its ATPase cycle.</p><p>The MKLP2-MD steady state ATPase activity shows that its K<sub>0.5,MT</sub> is ~1.1 μM. This agrees well with the co-sedimentation analysis, which also shows that, while the affinity is higher in the NN and AMPPNP states, there is less effect of nucleotide on the overall affinity of the MKLP2-MD for MTs compared to Kin1. Our reconstructions do not provide obvious structural explanations for these subtle nucleotide-dependent differences in the MT affinity of MKLP2-MD. Indeed, the additional MKLP2-MD loop contacts with the MT were modelled most easily in the highest resolution reconstruction (ADP.AlFx), which has a slightly lower MT affinity. It is thus possible that the flexible loops formed by the MKLP2-MD specific insertions do not directly contribute to differences in affinity in this motor compared to Kin1; rather this is dominated by the differences in the surface charge of the MT interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further insight concerning the effects on the kinetics of structural transitions induced by different nucleotides will be required to fully dissect these effects.</p><p>MKLP2-MD K<sub>0.5,MT</sub> is ~10 fold lower than the Kin1 motor domain (13 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>). While both motors bind MTs via their conserved tubulin-binding subdomains, strikingly the MKLP2-MD MT interface is overall more positively charged than that of Kin1, which likely contributes to the overall increased affinity of MKLP2 throughout the ATPase cycle. In addition, the MKLP2-specific, nucleotide invariant extension of loop12 is positively charged and may interact with the nearby acidic C-terminal tails (CTTs) of β-tubulin, although there is no visible connection in our reconstructions, likely due to its conformational variability. A similar interaction between the β-tubulin CTT and loop12 of Kin3 has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</xref>), although Kin3 loop12 has a higher net positive charge (+4) than MKLP2 and is longer and conformationally flexible in all nucleotide states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2014</xref>). Sequence insertions within loop2 are more usually associated with depolymerisation activity, for example in Kin13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>), but here MKLP2-MD loop2 appears to simply form a MT contact, with no current evidence of MKLP2 activity influencing MT dynamics. In addition to these loop insertions creating additional MT contacts with the primary tubulin binding site, MKLP2-MD loop8 can reach to contact an adjacent protofilament.</p><p>The collective effects of all the differences between MKLP2-MD and Kin1/3 manifest in the striking observation of bound MKLP2-MD shifted rotationally and translationally relative to the MT surface in all nucleotide states, creating a different footprint on the MT surface. This produces altered interactions across the MT surface including in loop11 adjacent to the active site and, together with the MKLP2-specific modifications around the active site, may have a knock-on effect on the catalytic activity of the motor. Thus, while not sufficient to perturb the fundamentals of nucleotide-sensitive subdomain rearrangement or formation of a hydrolysis competent conformation at the active site, MKLP2-MD altered position on the MT surface may regulate the transition rates between structural states. The altered footprint may also enable MKLP2 to select different populations of MT tracks within the spindle for interaction. Thus, our structural characterisation of MKLP2-MD suggests that the binding site of kinesins on the MT surface has some previously unsuspected plasticity that enables tuning of motor function while still supporting conserved conformational changes.</p><p>In Kin1/3/5, the key conformational change elicited by ATP binding to MT-associated motors is ordering of the neck-linker towards the MT plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). Such neck-linker docking is supported by formation of the CNB between the neck-linker and the motor domain N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). In MKLP2, reorientation of the neck-linker and CNB formation occur in the presence of ADP.AlFx and the neck-linker is less mobile than in other nucleotide states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This is despite the shortness of helix-α6 in the ADP/NN states and substitution of Kin1-K323→MKLP2-S504 at the transition between helix-α6 and neck linker. CNB formation is, however, consistent with conservation across all N-kinesins including MKLP2 of a cluster of hydrophobic residues in this region of the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>]). Formation of the CNB also contributes to stable closure of the nucleotide binding pocket and supports ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, however, the distal region of the putative MKLP2-MD neck-linker does not visibly dock along the plus end portion of the motor domain core, and demonstrates residual flexibility despite CNB formation. This observation is consistent with the divergent MKLP2 sequences both in the neck-linker and along the core β-sheet where the neck-linker might otherwise dock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vale and Fletterick, 1997</xref>]). Furthermore, the MKLP2-MD neck-linker also contains two adjacent proline residues (P510 and P511) that are likely to affect the conformation of the neck-linker. Divergence in the distal neck-linker region is a feature of the MKLP2 sequence in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, our structural findings suggest that analysis of sequences immediately C-terminal of kinesin motor domains could be considered in two segments according to (1) CNB formation by the proximal region and (2) docking of the distal region, when predicting motor function. It is not known if dimers of MKLP2 operate by taking steps in the same way as characterised for transport kinesins, and our structures predict that the molecular properties of full length MKLP2 are likely to be distinct from Kin1. In addition, the MKLP2 neck region – separating the neck-linker and the coiled coil – is substantially longer (~40 residues) than for example Kin1, making it unlikely that conventional models of processive stepping apply to MKLP2.</p><p>An extended loop6 insertion is characteristic of kinesin-6s and was visible in our MKLP2 reconstructions, with its location and its partial conformation visualised both at lower and higher resolutions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In addition, sequence analysis suggests that the N-terminal helical portion of loop6 is also likely to be conserved in MKLP2s in metazoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). During preparation of our manuscript, a structural snapshot of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinesin-6 Zen4 motor domain in the absence of its MT/tubulin track was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guan et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, although the loop6 insertion of this MKLP1 relative is substantially shorter than in MKLP2, a helical segment is also observed in this region of Zen4, consistent with our predictions. However, the connectivity of loop6 in the two kinesin-6s is different, with MKLP2 loop6 forming much more extensive contacts with other regions within the SwI/II subdomain. This leaves open the question as to this loop’s functional contribution to MKLP2. Given its connectivity with more conserved portions of the motor domain such as loop8/beta-5, it could have an overall modulatory role on motor mechanochemistry. It is also possible that it is the binding site for other regulatory components of the central spindle. Sequence comparisons informed by our structural data suggest that the presence of loop6, other extended insertions including loop2, and modifications related to neck-linker docking are highly characteristic of this subfamily of motors. Thus, our structural data shed light on the unusual mechanochemistry of the MKLP2-MD and could be used to predict the properties of other members of the kinesin-6 subfamily, including the two other kinesin-6 family members within vertebrates. Similarly, sequence analysis in the structural context of one highly divergent kinesin subfamily can also be mapped onto other members of the wider superfamily.</p><p>Our structural and biophysical characterisations of the MKLP2 motor domain suggest that this protein and its relatives could act as an organiser or a tension sensor, rather than a classical transport motor, within the MT bundles at the spindle midzone. A non-transport role for kinesin-6s was also implied by recent computational analysis of the kinesin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richard et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, MKLP2 inhibitor studies highlight the importance of the ATPase activity of MKLP2 for its role within the spindle, suggesting that the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes we have described are important for its mitotic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Labrière et al., 2016</xref>). The atypical mechanochemistry of MKLP2 could also facilitate the motor’s response to signalling cues throughout cell division, especially as mitosis proceeds towards cytokinesis. In combination with the capacity of its C-terminal region also to bind MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Echard et al., 1998</xref>), teams of MKLP2 motors in the spindle midzone could contribute to collective sliding and organisation of the dense collection of MTs found there. The altered footprint of MKLP2-MD binding on the MT surface may influence MT bundle organisation in this context. The activity of MKLP2 is also subject to numerous points of post-translational modification and regulation by mitotic kinases, including within or near the motor domain. For example, a Cdk1 site (T197) is located within loop6 in the connecting region between the body of the motor domain and the α-helix visualised in our reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kitagawa et al., 2014</xref>), while a Plk1 site/binding site is in the neck region beyond the neck linker (S527) where other binding partners are known to interact. Such modifications could also fine tune the mechanochemistry of MKLP2 and regulate its precise function. Our characterisation of MT-bound mammalian MKLP2 by cryo-EM sets the structural stage for future studies to further dissect the mechanism, function and regulation of this divergent mitotic kinesin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression, purification, and labelling</title><p>The MKLP2 constructs were cloned into a pET28 vector with C-terminal 6His tag and expressed in BL21 Gold (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by induction with 0.2 mM IPTG at 20°C overnight.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.

The authors present structures of 4 states of the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, which allow development of several novel insights about the relation of this type of kinesin, kinesin-6, to other, better studied variants. With the 4 reconstructions and a substantial number of insertions in the kinesin-6 sequence, the paper is uncommonly rich in results and discussion of specific parts of the structure. The resolution, in the range of 6 Å for the kinesin, is sufficient to discern much of the secondary structure. However, it still leaves much to be desired in terms of giving confidence to understanding loop regions, as well as several parts of the molecule that retain substantial flexibility even while docked to the MT. Nonetheless, the authors have been able to derive atomic models for most of the protein in each of the states. They have used a series of steps that give reasonable confidence in these models, which are used to gain insight on the mechanics of the nucleotide cycle. While this interpretation in some places seems rather bold, the authors are in fact straightforward about the limitations of their models and interpretations. The models are about as good as can be generated from the current data and overall, the interpretation is quite well founded. The EM results support identification of quite a number of differences in the MKLP2 structure, its changes through the nucleotide cycle, and its interactions with MTs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The ADP binding kinetics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (and ATP kinetics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) are very interesting, but very difficult to reconcile with more traditional kinesins (as the authors state). The finding that the ADP off-rate is actually faster in the absence of microtubules runs opposite to the kinesin 1/3/5 paradigm. However, because it requires an extrapolation to zero nucleotide, binding of mant ADP to apo motor doesn't seem like the ideal experiment to nail this point. There are a number or predictions of this fast and microtubule-independent ADP binding that can be tested. For instance, in the absence of microtubules, mixing increasing concentrations of mant ADP with motors and measuring the steady state fluorescence should give a predictable curve with a high K<sub>d</sub> (estimated to be around 50 μm from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Alternatively, flushing motors incubated with mant ADP against mM unlabeled ADP should give a more direct measurement of k<sub>off</sub> for ADP. These ADP binding kinetics are part of the uniqueness of this motor, and it is worth nailing these kinetics down more firmly.</p><p>2) For the motor binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the use of the quadratic form of the binding isotherm is reasonable, but there is concern about the relatively high motor concentration of 2.5 μm used in the experiments. When the K<sub>d</sub> is &lt;10-fold smaller than the motor concentration, it is very difficult to discern between different K<sub>d</sub> values because the curves all look similar to a ramp up to the motor concentration and then a plateau. Hence, the NN and AMPPNP K<sub>d</sub>, which are reported to be 0.04 μM, should be considered upper limits only. Accordingly, points about a smaller difference in affinities between strong and weak binding states as compared to kinesin 1 should be dropped. The most important point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is really the relatively high affinity in the ADP state, and this point still stands because if affinity were significantly weaker than this it would be obvious in the plots. Because there are FLASH labeled motors, using fluorescence rather than gels in microtubule pelleting would allow much lower motor concentrations to be used, allowing a better estimate of K<sub>d</sub> for NN and AMPPNP.</p><p>3) The contrast between the 1 μm KmMt in the ATPase and the tighter K<sub>d</sub> from the pelleting experiments is puzzling. The ADP and ADP-AlFx K<sub>d</sub> are about 3-fold lower than the Km from the ATPase, so one answer is that the cycle is dominated by the ADP or ADPPi states and the difference is just from experimental uncertainties. However, the fast ADP off-rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> argues against this model of the hydrolysis cycle – with the reported nucleotide binding kinetics, the motor should be in NN or ATP states most of the time it would seem, which would predict a much lower KmMt from the ATPase experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27793.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The ADP binding kinetics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (and ATP kinetics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) are very interesting, but very difficult to reconcile with more traditional kinesins (as the authors state).

The first experimental approach suggested for additional characterization of the ADP off-rate of this motor, however, is not a practical solution to getting an accurate binding constant for mant ADP: even when we excite the mant fluorophore through FRET by exciting at 292 nm, there is some direct excitation of the mant. Since mant ADP for these experiments needs to be in large molar excess over the MKLP2 motor domain, background fluorescence contribution from the unbound mant nucleotide would be a major limitation. We do, however, wish to thank the reviewers for suggesting the more direct measure of mant ADP dissociation kinetics. As per our revised manuscript, we note (in the Results, Discussion and Materials and methods sections) that mant ADP dissociation in the absence of MTs—at 51.9 ± 0.1 s<sup>-1</sup> is three orders of magnitude faster than that for other kinesins. These data are shown in a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. These data indeed round out our kinetic study of this unusual kinesin more firmly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the motor binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the use of the quadratic form of the binding isotherm is reasonable, but there is concern about the relatively high motor concentration of 2.5 μm used in the experiments.

It would be a considerable amount of work beyond the scope of the current study to undertake the experiments described with the FLASH labeled motors. We have however altered the text on p6 to reflect the reviewers’ comments about these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The contrast between the 1 μm KmMt in the ATPase and the tighter K<sub>d</sub> from the pelleting experiments is puzzling.

The dissection of the origin of the differences of K<sub>d</sub> vs Km in these disparate experimental setups would be a substantial effort beyond the scope of the current work. The purpose of the currently included data is to a) in the case of the steady ATPase assay establish the comparative activity of different MKLP2 constructs, thereby establishing the validity the structural characterization of the 25-520 construct and b) in the case of the co-sedimentation assay, compare the ADP and ATP-like states. Both data sets thereby support the conclusion that MKLP2 is a highly unusual motor and are thus appropriate for the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
