considerable impact of researcher degrees of freedom with respect to exclusion of participants in paradigms with a learning element. We illustrate this empirically through case examples from human fear conditioning research, in which the exclusion of ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’ is common – despite a lack of consensus on how to define these groups. We illustrate the substantial heterogeneity in exclusion criteria identified in a systematic literature search and highlight the potential problems and pitfalls of different definitions through case examples based on re-analyses of existing data sets. On the basis of these studies, we propose a consensus on evidence-based rather than idiosyncratic criteria, including clear guidelines on reporting details. Taken together, we illustrate how flexibility in data collection and analysis can be avoided, which will benefit the robustness and replicability of research findings and can be expected to be applicable to other fields of research that involve a learning element.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>exclusion</kwd><kwd>outlier</kwd><kwd>bias</kwd><kwd>non-learner</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 1980/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Christian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 1980/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project B07 44541416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lonsdorf</surname><given-names>Tina B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316803389 - SFB1280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Christian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 5873/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wendt</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 5873/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wendt</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exclusion of participants in tasks with a learning element can introduce substantial bias and needs to be carefully considered and transparently reported and justified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the past decade, efforts to understand the impact of undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis on research findings have gained momentum – for instance in defining and excluding ‘outliers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>). This flexibility has been referred to as ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>) or ‘the garden of forking paths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gelman and Loken, 2013</xref>) to reflect the fact that each decision during data processing and/or analysis will take the researcher down a different ‘path’. Importantly and concerningly, these different paths can lead to fundamentally different end-points (i.e., results and associated conclusions) despite an identical starting point (i.e., raw data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silberzahn et al., 2018</xref>). Often, researchers take a certain path without malicious intent to obtain favorable results (e.g., ‘p-hacking’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Head et al., 2015</xref>): the decision to follow a certain path may be based on unawareness of alternative paths (due to lack of specific background knowledge) or the researcher following the most obvious path from an individual perspective. The latter is influenced by the scientific environment, the research question at stake or practices previously published by researchers in the field.</p><p>Admittedly, there is substantial ambiguity in what constitutes ‘the best decision’ for data analysis, and none of the available options may be necessarily incorrect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silberzahn et al., 2018</xref>). More precisely, different paths in the garden of forking paths may be more or less appropriate for different research questions, experimental designs, outcome measures or samples. Consequently, it is notoriously difficult for researchers, particularly those new to a field, to make informed and hence appropriate decisions. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to anticipate the number of different paths available and the consequences of choosing one over the other, or to come up with facts that truly justify choosing one path over the other – even for experts in a field. However, simply choosing a particular path because others chose it before (i.e., adopting published exclusion criteria) can also be highly problematic, as decisions often hinge on study-specific characteristics that do not invariantly apply to other studies.</p><p>We argue that it is important to raise awareness to this issue. Specifically, we think that it is critical to discuss both the rationale behind and the consequences associated with taking different analytical paths in general and in specific sub-fields of research. Here, we exemplarily take up this discussion for human fear conditioning research as a case example for tasks with a learning element grounded in recent discussions in science in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flake and Fried, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">John et al., 2012</xref>) and in fear conditioning research specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lonsdorf et al., 2019</xref>). Fear conditioning is a typical paradigm employed to study (emotional) learning and memory processes with a particularly strong translational perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>). Questions addressed in the field of human fear conditioning are often concerned with consolidation, retrieval, generalization or modification of conditioned responses. Hence, it has often been claimed that the study of these processes requires the acquisition of a robust conditioned response as a precondition. Therefore, participants are often (routinely) excluded from analyses if they appear to not have learned (‘non-learners’) or not have been responsive to the experimental stimuli (‘non-responders’) during fear acquisition training, in which one conditional stimulus (CS+) predicts an upcoming aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and another conditional stimulus does not (CS–) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlov, 1927</xref>).</p><p>Critically, ‘non-learning’ is most often defined as a failure to show discrimination between the CS+ and CS– in skin conductance responses (SCRs) – the most common outcome measure in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>). This practice may seem trivial at first glance and has been referred to as exclusion of ‘non-learners’, ‘performance-based exclusion’ or even ‘exclusion of outliers'. Yet, defining a set of characteristics to identify individuals who ‘did not learn’ is operationalized in very heterogeneous ways across studies. The same applies to the criteria that determine what constitutes a’ non-responder’ during fear acquisition training.</p><p>In addition to the heterogeneity in operationalization, other problems of performance-based exclusion of participants are worth noting: definitions of ‘non-learners’ are typically based on SCRs only (for exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Lovibond, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oyarzún et al., 2019</xref>) and ‘non-learners’ are typically excluded from <italic>all</italic> analyses, that is, all experimental phases and outcome measures of a study. As SCRs are not a pure measure of either learning or fear, but rather reflect arousal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamm et al., 1993</xref>) that serve as proxies for fear learning, classification into ‘learners’ and ‘non-learners’ on the basis of this single outcome measure may induce substantial sample bias. First, defining 'non-learning' on one single outcome measure, such as SCRs, ignores the fact that successful CS+/CS– differentiation may be present in other outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamm et al., 1993</xref>) such as fear potentiated startle (FPS) or ratings of fear and contingencies (i.e., cognitive awareness of the CS+/US contingencies). As such, ‘non-learning’ as defined on a single outcome measure such as SCRs cannot comprehensively capture ‘non-learning’. Second, the level of responding in SCRs and CS+/CS– discrimination has been shown to be associated with a vast number of individual difference factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucsein et al., 2012</xref>) such as age and sex (for a discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucsein et al., 2012</xref>), ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandra Kredlow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucsein et al., 2012</xref>), genetic make-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garpenstrand et al., 2001</xref>), use of oral contraceptives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merz et al., 2018b</xref>) or personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naveteur and Freixa I Baque, 1987</xref>). Consequently, excluding participants from an experiment as 'non-learners' may pre-select specific sub-samples and thus may thus severely hamper the generalizability and interpretation of the findings. Importantly, this practice may be a threat to and a limitation of the clinical translation of findings because it potentially leads to the selective exclusion of specific and highly relevant sub-groups. In fact, a recent meta-analysis suggests that patients suffering from anxiety disorders show overgeneralization of fear responding, which is enhanced when responding to the CS– (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duits et al., 2015</xref>), which may lead to reduced CS+/CS– discrimination if the response to the CS+ is comparable.</p><p>The concerns discussed above are merely based on theoretical considerations. Below, we aim to address the important and controversial topic of exclusion of ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’ in human fear conditioning research empirically. We set out to provide an overview and inventory of the exclusion criteria that are currently employed in the field by means of a systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moher et al., 2009</xref>), covering a publication period of six months. Importantly, we distinguish between ‘non-learners’ (based on task performance, that is, CS+/CS– discrimination) and ‘non-responders’ (based on a lack of responsiveness) as assessed using SCRs. We expect the identified criteria for ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’ to be characterized by noticeable heterogeneity (thus allowing for considerable researcher degrees of freedom) across studies. We thus aim to (1) raise awareness and (2) illustrate the impact of applying different exclusion criteria features (i.e., forking paths) on results and interpretation through case examples exemplified by the re-analyses of existing data sets. Finally, we aim to (3) provide methodologically informed, evidence-based recommendations for future studies with respect to defining and handling ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Definition of performance-based exclusion of participants (‘non-learners’) and number of participants excluded across studies</title><p>Slightly fewer than one fourth of the records (i.e., 22%; 11 out of 50 records comprising 14 individual studies as three records reported two studies each) included in the systematic literature search employed performance-based exclusion of participants (i.e., SCR ‘non-learners’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow chart illustrating the selection of records according to PRISMA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moher et al., 2009</xref>).</title><p>Note that seven records (14%) employed the definition and exclusion of both ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’.

Importantly, ‘fear learning’ cannot be reliably inferred by means of SCRs, because SCRs capture arousal-related processes and can only be used as a proxy to infer ‘fear learning’ as fear is closely linked to arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamm and Weike, 2005</xref>). Relatedly, the fact that physiological proxies of ‘fear’ do not map onto ‘fear’ itself has been discussed extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LeDoux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDoux, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Second, but related, individuals that fail to show CS+/CS– discrimination in SCRs may show substantial discrimination, as an indicator of successful learning, in other outcome measures such as ratings of fear, US expectancy or fear potentiated startle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamm and Weike, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marin et al., 2019</xref>), as illustrated here for fear ratings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>).</p><p>Third, a common justification for excluding ‘non-learners’ is that it is not possible to investigate extinction- or return-of-fear-related phenomena in individuals who ‘did not learn’. To our knowledge, there is some evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craske et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plendl and Wotjak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prenoveau et al., 2013</xref>) that this theoretical assumption does not necessarily hold true, (i.e., CS+/CS– discrimination during fear acquisition training does not necessarily predict CS+/CS– discrimination during other experimental phases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerlicher et al., 2019</xref>). An empirical investigation of this, however, would go beyond this manuscript’s scope.</p><p>Fourth, we provided empirical evidence that those classified as a group of ‘non-learners’ in SCRs in the literature (sometimes referred to as ‘outliers’) on the basis of the identified definitions in fact displayed significant CS+/CS– discrimination when applied to our own data. An exception to this was using cut offs in differential responding of &lt;0.05 µS (note, however, that a non-significant CS+/CS– discrimination effect in the group of ‘non-learners’ as a whole cannot be taken as evidence that all individuals in this group do not in fact display meaningful or statistically significant CS+/CS– discrimination). Hence, in addition to the many conceptual problems we raised here, the operationalization of ‘non-learning’ in the field failed its critical manipulation check given that those classified as ‘non-learners’ show clear evidence of learning as a group (i.e., CS+/CS– discrimination, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>).</p><p>Fifth, we illustrate a concerning sample bias that is introduced by performance-based participant exclusion. CS+/CS– discrimination in SCRs during fear acquisition training has been linked to a number of individual difference factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lonsdorf and Merz, 2017</xref>) and, naturally, selecting participants on the basis of SCR CS+/CS– discrimination will also select them on the basis of these individual differences (illustrated by our case example on trait anxiety, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In our case example, we illustrate that excluding ‘non-learners’ biases the sample towards low anxiety scores, which hampers the generalizability and replicability of findings: i) the effect may only exist in low-anxiety individuals but not in the general population, and ii) as fear acquisition is a clinically relevant paradigm, pre-selection in favor of low-anxiety individuals might represent a threat to the clinical translation of the findings. Many studies in the field of fear conditioning research aim to develop behavioral or pharmacological manipulations to enhance treatment effects or aim to study mechanisms that are relevant for clinical fear and anxiety. Hence, it is highly problematic that these studies may exclude individuals who show response patterns that mimic responses typically observed in anxiety patients when excluding ‘non-learners’. In fact, patients suffering from anxiety disorders have been shown to be characterized by generalization of fear from the CS+ to the CS– (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duits et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sixth, as illustrated by our case example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), high CS+/CS– discrimination cutoffs generally favor individuals with high SCR amplitudes despite potentially identical ratios between CS+ and CS– amplitudes, which may introduce a sampling bias for individuals characterized by high arousal levels that probably have biological underpinnings. Relatedly, future studies need to empirically address which criteria for SCR transformation and exclusions are more or less sensitive to baseline differences (for an example from startle responding see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grillon and Baas, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in light of the many (potential) problems associated with performance-based exclusion of participants, we forcefully echo Marin et al.’s conclusion that one needs &quot;to be cautious when excluding SCR non-learners and to consider the potential implications of such exclusion when interpreting the findings from studies of conditioned fear&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marin et al., 2019</xref>, abstract). Routinely, excluding participants who are intentionally or unintentionally characterized by specific individual differences represents a major threat to generalizability, replicability and potentially clinical translation of findings, as results might be contingent on a specific sub-sample and specific sample characteristics. This is also true when researchers are interested in the study of general processes. Furthermore, by excluding these individuals from further analyses, we may miss the opportunity to understand why some individuals do not show discrimination between the CS+ and the CS– in SCRs (or other outcome measures) or whether this lack of discrimination is maintained across subsequent experimental phases. It can be speculated that this lack of discrimination may carry meaningful information – at least for a subsample.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>‘Non-responders’: conclusions, caveats and considerations</title><p>In addition to ‘non-learners’, ‘non-responders’ are also often excluded during fear conditioning research. We showed that the definition of ‘non-responders’, like that of ‘non-learners’, varies widely across studies. Heterogeneity in definitions manifests in different cutoff criteria for what is considered a valid response, the number of trials and the stimulus type(s) considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Surprisingly, most definitions are based on CS responses (i.e., SCRs to the CS+ and/or CS–) and only few are based on US responses. This highlights a potentially problematic overlap between ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’: ‘non-responding’ to the CS (i.e., CS+ and CS– or CS+ only) is not necessarily indicative of physiological ‘non-responding’ – especially if high cutoffs are used. In fact, ‘non-responding’ to the CS may, or at least in some cases, reflect the absence of learning-based patterns in physiological responding – which may carry important information. Having observed the striking differences in percentages of ‘non-responses’ to the US (10%) and CS (48%) observed in our data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref>), we suggest that physiological ‘non-responding’ cannot and should not be determined on the basis of the absence of responding to the CS.</p><p>More globally, the group of ‘non-responders’, as defined by the criteria identified here, probably lumps together several sub-groups: individuals (1) for whom technical problems resulted in no valid SCRs, (2) who fell asleep or did not pay attention, (3) who cognitively learned the CS+/US contingencies but did not express the expected corresponding responses in SCRs, and (4) who were attentive to the experiment but did not learn the contingencies (i.e., unaware participants) and hence did not show the expected SCR patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tabbert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, although excluding physiological ‘non-responders’ makes sense (in terms of a manipulation check and independent of the hypothesis), we consider defining ‘non-responders’ on the basis of the absence of SCRs to the CS as problematic (dependent on the hypothesis). We suggest that physiological SCR ‘non-responders’ should be defined on the basis of US responses during fear acquisition training or to strong stimuli during pre-conditioning phases such as US calibration, startle habituation or forced breathing (reliably eliciting strong SCRs). If ‘non-responding’ to the US (during fear acquisition training) is used, it is difficult to suggest a universally valid cutoff with respect to the number or percentage of required valid US responses, because this critically depends on a number of variables such as hardware and sampling rate used. It remains an open question for future work whether data quality of novel mobile devices (e.g., smartwatches) for the acquisition of SCRs differs from traditional, robust lab-based recordings and how this would impact on the frequency of exclusions based on SCRs. Appendix 4 suggests that the cutoff may typically range between 1/3 and 2/3 of valid responses but may be data-set specific. US-based criteria are of course not trivial in multiple-day experiments, in which certain experimental days do not involve the presentation of US or involve few temporally clustered US presentations (i.e., reinstatement), or in paradigms not involving direct exposure to the US (i.e., observational or instructional learning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haaker et al., 2017</xref>). In these cases, the other options listed above are strongly preferred to CS based criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Where do we go from here?</title><p>In this work, we have comprehensively illustrated and argued that most of the current definitions employed to define ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’ have to be considered as theoretically and empirically problematic. It is not sufficient, however, to raise awareness to these problems and the practical question of ‘Where do we go from here?’ remains to be addressed. What can we do to avoid getting lost in the garden of forking paths of exclusion criteria? Here, we would like to offer several solutions to improve practices in the field, which we expect to foster robustness, replicability and potentially clinical translation of findings: (1) transparency in reporting, (2) adopting open science practices, (3) increasing the level and quality of reporting and (4) graphical data presentation, (5) manipulation checks, and (6) fostering critical evaluation. We refer to see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for specific recommendations.</p><p>More precisely, <bold>transparency</bold> can be enhanced ‘if observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the statistical results are if those observations are included’, as suggested by Simmons and colleagues, nearly a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>, Table 2). Here, we echo this call that this recommendation should be implemented routinely in data reporting pipelines when employing performance-based participant exclusions (‘non-learners’) in fear conditioning research. We also call for a transparent and adequate reporting in the results (in brief) and discussion section rather than providing this information exclusively in the appendix. This being said, it is important to point out that should a finding turn out to be contingent on the exclusion of ‘non-learners’, this does not necessarily invalidate this finding. On the contrary, it may further specify the finding or hint to possible mechanisms and/or boundary conditions – yet inferences on boundary conditions should be made carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardwicke and Shanks, 2016</xref>). Relatedly, adopting an <bold>open science culture</bold> will facilitate transparent reporting of exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nosek et al., 2015</xref>) and will minimize the risk of exploiting heterogeneous definitions in the field. Registered reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardwicke and Ioannidis, 2018</xref>), publicly available data including those from excluded participants and pre-registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munafò et al., 2017</xref>) of definitions and analysis pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ioannidis, 2014</xref>), as well as openly accessible lab-specific standard operational protocols (SOPs), may also be helpful.</p><p>We acknowledge, however, that transparent reporting and particularly pre-registration of exclusion criteria is not trivial in light of the unsatisfactory <bold>quality and level of detail in reporting</bold> in the field of fear conditioning research. It was striking that the compilation of exclusion criteria (‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">2</xref>) employed in the records included in our systematic literature search required extensive personal exchange with the authors because the definitions provided were often insufficient, ambiguous or incorrect. It is our responsibility as authors, reviewers and editors to improve these reporting standards to an acceptable level. As a guidance, <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> provides a compilation of reporting details that we consider important to include in both pre-registered protocols and publications (an editable online version of <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> is available to allow for further development, see Box caption).</p><p>Our recommendations to improve the level of reporting details and transparency extends to the <bold>graphical illustration of results</bold>, which should optimally allow for a complete presentation of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weissgerber et al., 2015</xref>) without risking obscuring important patterns, providing detailed distributional information rather than merely presenting summary statistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weissgerber et al., 2015</xref> for a discussion). Such visualization options include, for instance, scatterplots, box plots, histograms, violin plots as well as their combination (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in so called ‘rain cloud plots’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2018</xref> for a tutorial in R, Matlab and Phyton) and utilizing colors or color gradients to visualize different groups of individuals (for instance ‘learners’ and ‘non-learners’) or discrimination scores. This will provide readers with the opportunity to evaluate the presented results and conclusions independently and comprehensively.</p><p>Finally, if criteria for ‘non-learners’ or ‘non-responders’ are employed to exclude participants from data analyses (or continuation of the experiment), we recommend that a <bold>sanity or manipulation check</bold> should be performed to determine whether – for instance - ‘non-learners’ really did not learn (i.e., really do not show significant CS+/CS– discrimination). We have empirically illustrated that most definitions of ‘non-learners’ fail this manipulation check (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). Yet, it may not be feasible in all cases to determine such statistics, as these may not be appropriate for small samples and correspondingly small sub-groups of ‘non-learners’. Relatedly, we urge authors to justify adequately all details of the exclusion criteria (if applied) – both theoretically and practically. Furthermore, we encourage authors, reviewers and editors alike to <bold>critically evaluate</bold> whether exclusions and applied criteria are warranted in the first place and appropriate in the specific context (vs. mere adopting published or previously employed criteria) and whether these exclusion criteria are transparently reported and discussed if results hinge on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steegen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, future work should empirically address the question of how to best define ‘non-learning’ in particular in light of different outcome measures in fear conditioning studies, which capture different aspects of defensive responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jentsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Final remarks</title><p>In closing, the field of fear conditioning has been plagued with a lack of consensus on how to define and treat ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’, which not seldomly impacts review processes and generates unnecessary lengthy discussions for editors, reviewers and authors. We argue that it is neither ethical (due to an excessive waste of tax money and human resources) nor scientifically meaningful to exclude up to two thirds of a sample. If only one third of the population performs ‘as expected’ in the experiment, experimental designs, data recording and processing techniques as well as definitions need to be reconsidered. We have shown that findings derived from such highly selective sub-samples may not generalize to other samples or to the general population, and as a consequence might be a threat to clinical translation. Most problematically, however, findings derived from such highly selective samples have been routinely and invariantly generalized to reflect ‘general principles’ and ‘processes’ in the past. Not surprisingly, such findings have also suffered replication failures. As such, exclusions of ‘non-learners’ can in fact be dangerous if not handled transparently (as suggested above), because they may bias and confuse a whole research field and may push research along a misleading path. Thus, we suggest recommendations and consensus suggestions, and recommend that common practices should be critically evaluated before we adopt them in future work, so that the field follows a path towards more robust and replicable research findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This project has been pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lonsdorf et al., 2019</xref>, March 22; retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/vjse4">https://osf.io/vjse4</ext-link>).</p><p>A <bold>systematic literature search</bold> was performed according to PRISMA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moher et al., 2009</xref>) covering all publications (including e-pubs ahead of print) in PubMed during the six months prior to the 22<sup>nd</sup> March 2019, using the following search terms: threat conditioning OR fear conditioning OR threat acquisition OR fear acquisition OR threat learning OR fear learning OR threat memory OR fear memory OR return of fear OR threat extinction OR fear extinction.

To achieve this aim, we initially planned to re-analyze existing data sets and to exclude participants on the basis of the identified definitions, which was expected to demonstrate that results are not robust across the various definitions of ‘non-learners’ and ‘non-responders’ employed. More precisely, we planned to calculate CS+/CS– discrimination across different data sets for all definitions identified by the systematic literature search and to generate corresponding correlation matrices as well as the percentages of zero and non-responses (see pre-registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/vjse4">https://osf.io/vjse4</ext-link>). Because the exclusion criteria identified through the systematic literature search were even more heterogeneous than expected, and as it was difficult to agree on a key outcome to quantify the impact of exclusion criteria, we eventually concluded that such extensive re-analyses would not add much to the tabular and graphical illustration of this heterogeneity. Instead, we provide illustrative case examples for: (i) the proportion of individuals excluded on the basis of the identified exclusion criteria for ‘non-learners’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and (ii) the potential sample bias with respect to individual differences (exploratory aim) induced by employing different exclusion criteria features (i.e., discrimination cutoff; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Furthermore, we aimed to test exploratively whether even in groups defined as ‘non-learners’ a significant CS+/CS– discrimination on SCR and fear ratings can be detected (all results presented in the Appendix are based on Data set 1).</p><sec id="s4-3-1-1"><title>Paradigm and stimuli</title><p>The two-day paradigm consisted of habituation and acquisition training (day 1) and extinction training and recall testing (day 2) without any contingency instructions provided. Here, only data from the acquisition training phase (100% reinforcement rate) were used. CS were two light grey fractals, presented 14 times each in a pseudo-randomized order for 6–8 s (mean: 7 s). Visual stimuli were identical for all participants, but allocation to CS+ and CS– was counterbalanced between participants. During inter-trial intervals (ITIs), a white fixation cross was shown for 10–16 s (mean: 13 s). All stimuli were presented on a light gray background and controlled by Presentation software (Version 14.8, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc, Albany California, USA).</p><p>The electrotactile stimulus, serving as US, consisted of three 10 ms electrotactile rectangular pulses with an interpulse interval of 50 ms (onset: 200 ms before CS+ offset) and was administered to the back of the right hand of the participants. It was generated by a Digitimer DS7A constant current stimulator (Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK) and delivered through a 1 cm diameter platinum pin surface electrode (Speciality Developments, Bexley, UK). The electrode was attached between the metacarpal bones of the index and middle finger. US intensity was individually calibrated in a standardized step-wise procedure aiming at an unpleasant, but still tolerable level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-1-2"><title>SCRs</title><p>SCRs were semi-manually scored by using a custom-made computer program (EDA View) as the first response from trough to peak 0.9–3.5 s after CS onset (0.9–2.5 s after US onset) as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucsein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sjouwerman and Lonsdorf, 2019</xref>). The maximum rise time was set to 5 s. Data were down-sampled to 10 Hz. Each scored SCR was checked visually, and the scoring suggested by EDA View was corrected if necessary (e.g., the foot or trough was misclassified by the algorithm). Data with recording artifacts or excessive baseline activity (i.e., more than half of the response amplitudes) were treated as missing data points and excluded from the analyses. SCRs below 0.01 μS or the absence of any SCR within the defined time window were classified as non-responses and set to 0. The threshold of 0.01 μS for this data set was determined empirically by visually inspecting response specifically above and below this cutoff, which suggested that in this data set, responses &gt; 0.01 μS can be reliably identified. ‘Non-responders’ (N = 3) were defined as individuals who showed more than two thirds of non-responses to the US (10 or more non-responses out of 14 US trials, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref>). Three individuals were classified as ‘non-responders’ and these individuals did not show any responses to the CS either. The three participants classified as ‘non-responders’ (see above) were only excluded for the analyses of ‘non-learners’. Raw SCR amplitudes were normalized by taking the natural logarithm and range-corrected by dividing each logarithmized SCR by the maximum amplitude (maximum SCR to a CS or a US) per participant and day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-1-3"><title>Fear ratings</title><p>Fear ratings were provided by participants through ratings on a visual analog scale (VAS) on the screen asking ‘how much stress, fear, and tension’ they experienced when they last saw the CS+ and CS–. The fear ratings used for the purpose of this manuscript are those obtained after fear acquisition training (no ratings were acquired during this phase). Answers were given within 5 s on the VAS, which ranged from 0 (answer = none) to 25 (answer = maximum) by using a button box. Pressing the buttons moved a bar on the VAS to the aimed value and answers were logged in by pressing another button. Non-registered ratings were considered as missing values (8.4%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-1-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To test whether exclusion groups differ in CS+/CS– discrimination, a mixed ANOVA with CS+/CS– discrimination in SCR or fear ratings as the dependent variable and the between-subjects factor ‘Exclusion group’ and the within-subject factor ‘CS-type’ was performed. Note that it is circular to test for differences in SCR CS+/CS– discrimination between groups that were selected on the basis of different SCR CS+/CS– discrimination cutoffs in the first place. Still, it is relevant to test whether all groups classified as ‘non-learners’ in the literature do indeed fail to show evidence of learning, which would be indicated by a lack of significant CS+/CS– discrimination in SCRs in this case. In essence, this is a test to evaluate whether the exclusion criteria used in the literature do indeed achieve what they purport to do, that is, classify a group of participants that do not show evidence of learning. To test whether these exclusion groups discriminated in SCRs and fear ratings, exclusion groups were cumulated, and <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed for each cumulative group (see Appendices 2 and 3, respectively). We acknowledge, however, that the absence of a statistically significant CS+/CS– discrimination effect in a group on average cannot be taken to imply that all individuals in this group do not show meaningful CS+/CS– discrimination. As such, this is a rather conservative test. To correct for multiple testing, all <italic>p</italic>-values deriving from <italic>t</italic>-tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni procedure. As effect size, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was reported for <italic>t</italic>-tests and partial eta-squared for ANOVAs. To illustrate the association between the non-responses to the US and the non-responses to the CS, a Spearman rank correlation test was computed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Data set 2</title><p>For the purpose of this manuscript, a final sample of 268 individuals (195 female, mean ± SD age of 25 ± 4 years) was re-analyzed. This sample is reported in a recent pre-print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sjouwerman et al., 2018</xref>) in which we observed an association between trait anxiety and CS+/CS– discrimination in SCRs. Here, the re-analysis and graphical illustration of these data serve the purpose of a case example to illustrate the potential sample bias that may be induced by employing performance-based exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-3-2-1"><title>Paradigm and stimuli</title><p>A detailed experimental description is included in the preprint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sjouwerman et al. (2018)</xref>. In brief, participants underwent a 100% reinforcement fear acquisition training phase in a behavioral laboratory setting, including 9 CS+ and 9 CS– trials, presented for 6 s each. Consequently, 9 US presentations were included that coincided 100 ms prior to CS+ offset. Trials were interleaved by 10–13 s ITIs with a white fixation cross presented on a black background. Black geometrical shapes served as CS, and electrical stimulation delivered by a DS7A electrical stimulator (Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK) onto the outer surface of the right hand served as US. The intensity of the US was individually calibrated with a stair-case procedure in order to reach an unpleasant but tolerable level. Not of interest to the current case example were the acoustic startle probes (95 dB(A) burst of white noise) presented to elicit a startle response in two thirds of all acquisition trials, as well as three fear-rating blocks probed intermittently during fear acquisition training. Startle probes were presented 4 or 5 s post‐CS onset, and 5 or 7 s post‐ITI onset. No contingency instructions were given.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-2"><title>SCRs</title><p>SCRs were quantified as the first SCR within 0.9–4.0 s after stimulus onset (CS or US) and were scored semi-manually from trough-to-peak using a custom-made program. Signal increases smaller than 0.02 µS were treated as non-responses, that is set to 0. (Please note that this cut-off was not empirically determined as in Data set 1 but adopted from the previous publication of Data set 2. As we present re-analyses here, we decided not to change the cut-off to maintain comparability.) Responses confounded by recording artifacts, such as responses moving beyond the sampling window, excessive baseline activity, or electrode detachment were treated as missing values. Raw response amplitudes per trial were log-transformed and range-corrected for the maximum CS or US response per participant. Individuals not showing any valid SCR (i.e., missing or zero responses) in more or equal than two thirds (≥6 out of 9, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table2">Appendix 4—table 2</xref>) of US trials were treated as physiological ‘non-responders’ (<italic>n</italic> = 19) and were consequently excluded from graphical illustration and the statistical analysis. In addition, 31 participants were excluded prior to physiological processing, either because of abortion of the experiment or due to technical failures during data acquisition (e.g. errors during saving, overwritten logfile, or missing markers), leaving 307 out of 357 individuals with valid SCR data for fear acquisition training. Of these 307 participants, 39 had incomplete STAI-T data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spielberger et al., 1983</xref>) resulting in a final sample size for this case example of 268 individuals (195 female, mean ± SD age of 25 ± 4 years).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To test whether different exclusion groups differ in their mean trait anxiety levels, a univariate ANOVA with STAI-T score as the dependent variable and exclusion group as the independent variable was carried out. Post hoc pairwise <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to compare trait anxiety scores between the different exclusion group levels. The post hoc tests were corrected for multiple testing, using the Bonferroni correction method. 95% family wise confidence levels were determined using TukeyHSD tests.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project is part of a European wide network (EIFEL-ROF network) of researchers working on meta-research topics in the field of fear conditioning research, which is funded by the German Research foundation (DFG; Grant ID LO1980/2-1) to TBL and CJM.

The personal communication clarified that the statement included in the results section that defines ‘non-learners’ as individuals that “did not demonstrate a discriminatory SCR during acquisition, defined as greater SCR to the CS+ relative to the CS– during either the first or last half of threat-acquisition on average’ was intended to refer to the same procedure (i.e., the full acquisition phase).</p><p><sup>b</sup>Refers to unreinforced CS+ trials (CS+ trials not followed by the US) only.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>c</sup>For each CS+1 and CS+2.</p><p><sup>d</sup>Personal communication with D.

Note that this is somewhat circular as exclusion groups are defined by different SCR CS+/CS– cutoffs, which then are used in an analysis in which differential SCRs are the dependent measure. However, that this is exactly what is sometimes done in the literature (see main manuscript).</p><p>Still, this is an important manipulation check to test empirically whether those classified in a group of ‘non-learners’ in the literature do indeed show no evidence of learning, which would be indicated by comparable SCRs to the CS+ and the CS– (i.e., no significant discrimination). Here, we test this for cumulative exclusion groups. Note that this is only a rough manipulation check, as a non-significant CS+/CS– discrimination effect in the whole group (e.g., those showing a CS+/CS– discrimination &lt;0.05 µS based on raw scores) cannot be taken as evidence that all individuals in this group do not display meaningful or statistically significant CS+/CS– discrimination. More precisely, half of this group who did not meet the cut-off of 0.05µS in CS+/CS– discrimination do show a negative or zero discrimination score, which may bias the group average score towards non-discrimination. Yet, statistically testing for discrimination within each exclusion group (e.g. specifically in the group showing a discrimination between &gt;0 and &lt; 0.05 µS) is not unproblematic.</p><table-wrap id="app2table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—table 1.</label><caption><title>Results of two-tailed t-tests for differences in SCR CS+/CS– discrimination in Data set 1 for the different cumulative exclusion groups (indicated by the + in the table) based on the criteria identified in the literature with respect to CS+/CS– discrimination cutoffs (in µS).</title><p>For completeness sake and as it is not always clear whether CS+/CS– discrimination is based on raw or transformed values, we report results based on analyses of both raw (A) and transformed values (B).

childhood temperament and adult personality. When extreme, fear contributes to the development a spectrum of prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders. Mechanistic studies in mice and rats have begun to illuminate the specific molecules, cells, and circuits that control the expression of fear-relevant behaviors, but the relevance of these tantalizing discoveries to the complexities of the human brain and human suffering remain unclear. Human fear conditioning studies represent a crucial means of the addressing this question, yet as Lonsdorf and colleagues make clear in this report, the impact of such studies is limited by several crucial (but seemingly mundane) methodological issues. In particular, they highlight substantial heterogeneity in exclusion criteria for such studies-who does and who does not adequately learn the association between cues and consequences. Based on this, they propose evidence-based clear guidelines for conducting and reporting fear conditioning studies. This report is likely to be of keen interest to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including the producers, consumers, and funders of human fear research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lessons from fear conditioning on exclusions in learning tasks on how to not get lost in the garden of forking paths&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dr. Shackman as the Reviewing Editor and Dr. de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Bradford (Reviewer #1); Christine Larson (Reviewer #2); Nick Balderston (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the affective neuroscientist Kay Tye recently noted, &quot;Fear resembles a dictator that makes all other brain processes (from cognition to breathing) its slave… Given its critical importance in survival and its authoritarian command over the rest of the brain, fear should be one of the most extensively studied topics in neuroscience&quot; (Mobbs et al. Nature Neurosci 2019). In that same wide-ranging paper, psychiatrist Kerry Ressler reminds us that, &quot;Disorders of fear processing…are among the most common of psychiatric maladies, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Combined, they are also among the highest in terms of morbidity, loss of work, comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders, and mortality from suicide.&quot; Yet the neural systems that control the expression and regulation of fear remain incompletely understood. Considerable progress has been made using animal models, but the relevance of these tantalizing discoveries to the complexities of the human brain and human suffering remain unclear. Human fear conditioning studies represent a crucial means of the addressing this question, yet as Lonsdorf and colleagues make clear in this submission, the inferential impact of such studies is limited by important (but seemingly mundane) methodological issues. In particular, they highlight substantial heterogeneity in exclusion criteria for such studies-who does and who does not adequately learn the association between cues (CS+) and consequences (shocks; UCS). Based on this, they propose evidence-based clear guidelines for conducting and reporting fear conditioning studies.</p><p>All 3 reviewers were very enthusiastic about this submission.</p><p>• The manuscript has multiple strengths, in my opinion, including the clear writing; the focus on an obvious (to many but not all) problem in a commonly used and published paradigm; the authors' preregistration of analysis; careful and clear presentation of data; and potentially useful suggestions for improvement for the issue at hand. I believe that papers such as this one are long overdue for many subfields. Given the recently increased focus on the credibility of psychological science, this minor is especially timely.</p><p>• This is an important and consequential piece of work. The authors provide an extremely important service by surveying the current state of the literature and using an empirical approach to identify potential pitfalls with the current lack of standards and transparency. Fear conditioning is a very commonly used technique. Thus, core decisions, such as which participants to include or not include has the potential to have substantial impact on this literature, and thus for theories of learning and memory, their application to clinical problems such as anxiety and PTSD, and potentially development and improvement of interventions based on conditioning models. The topic of this paper is of clear significance to the field. In addition to significance I also found the approach used by the authors to be rigorous. The sample of papers included was sizeable and systematic. The criteria used in each paper were clearly detailed. The datasets they used to demonstrate the impact of these different exclusion criteria included large samples, minimizing spurious effects. These analyses included many useful contributions, including the dramatic loss of sample with some of the exclusion criteria, how some learning criteria are particularly impactful with respect to individual variation in magnitude of SCR response and trait anxiety (as examples), and the lack of convergence with other measures of learning (e.g., ratings). The data demonstrating the particular utility of identifying non-responders based on the US, but not the CSs, were clearly presented and compelling. The table of recommendations (Box 1) is for the most part extremely comprehensive and useful guidance for scientists in designing studies and analyzing and reporting data and methods. The suggestions for transparency in reporting and not basing identification of non-response on CSs are notably important.</p><p>• This is clearly an important topic in a field with little consensus regarding best practices around inclusion/exclusion criteria, experimental design, analysis strategies, etc. They did a good job of identifying and operationally defining the problem under study, and summarizing the literature around the problem. This combined with the thorough re-analysis of their existing data make for a compelling read and convincing case for reform.</p><p>The reviewers also outlined some important suggestions for strengthening the report, all of which can be addressed in a revision with a reasonable amount of effort by the authors.</p><p>0) The authors should strongly consider editing the title to something shorter and more direct. At present, it reads like 2-3 ideas &quot;mashed&quot; together.</p><p>1) The analysis of SCR discrimination as a function of &quot;non-learning&quot; criteria (subsection “Statistical analysis”, subsection “Applying the identified performance-based exclusion criteria to existing data: a case example”, last paragraph, Supplementary Table 3). As I understand it, the authors stratify subjects based on their CS+&gt;CS- difference score, with lower or negative difference scores signifying non-learners. They then calculate for each group in this stratification whether or not the individuals show evidence of learning by looking at differential SCRs and fear ratings. From this, they conclude &quot;Fourth, we provided empirical evidence that those classified as 'non-learners' (sometimes referred to as 'outliers') in SCRs based on the identified definitions ironically displayed significant CS+/CS- discrimination.&quot; In the case of differential SCRs, this argument is circular, meaning that the group definitions are dependent upon the outcome measure. Accordingly, exclusion groups will by definition differ from one another in terms of differential SCRs. In addition, exclusion groups with a lower bound &gt; 0 will by definition show significant differential conditioning using SCRs as an outcome. This is problematic, and should be removed from the manuscript entirely. In addition, any conclusions based on this analysis should be rewritten to focus specifically on the data from the fear ratings.</p><p>2) In terms of significance for the field, I would specifically like to highlight the author's focus on characterizing the non-learners. While a small group (ideally) these individuals are usually removed from analyses and thus are not well-understood. Thus, as a field we have little understanding of the nature of non-learners. It is very possible that we are missing out on an important opportunity to understand why some individuals don't learn and what the impact of that is, for better or for worse. As an example, what does it mean of fear extinction and generalization of conditioned fear is evident in those who &quot;didn't learn?&quot; This may be a methodological issue, but potentially also has meaningful conceptual implications.</p><p>3) In Box 1, Section B, under &quot;Recommendations on how to proceed&quot; for &quot;if 'non-learning' is determined by responding during fear acquisition training, which trial types and number of trials per trial type were considered?&quot; the authors state &quot;classification in SCR 'non-learners' should be based on differential scores (CS+ vs. CS-).&quot; This leaves a lot of wiggle room. Is it possible to be more specific? This still leaves a lot of room for decisions that may result in a biased sample (such as those anxious individuals who also show pretty large responses to the CS-). And what about the number of trials? It seems that at minimal a justification of these choices should be included.</p><p>4) The authors remark in a few places that SCR is not, and should not be, the only marker of learning. This begs the question of which dependent variables should be used, how they should be treated, and how they should (or could) be combined. I realize the paper is already long, however, this could benefit from some additional brief commentary. How might researchers choose amongst dependent variables and what might they be optimal for. Would they be weighted equally? For example, some variables may be more relevant for assessing implicit vs. explicit learning. Other variables may introduce new wrinkles – for example fear potentiated startle relies on introducing another aversive stimulus (e.g., noise burst, air puff) in addition to the US. How might this impact learning? Especially fear learning?</p><p>5) I am concerned that the many important messages in this manuscript may get lost to many less careful readers due to the wealth of information presented. On one hand, I applaud the authors for being transparent and forthcoming, but I wonder if there are ways to further focus the manuscript. I believe reduction in the overall length (perhaps partly through another careful round of editing to avoid any unnecessary redundancy) would strengthen the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>6) One relevant issue not addressed in the manuscript is the rampant inconsistency of exclusionary criteria WITHIN a given lab or set of researchers. If the authors encountered this in their search, it may be worth adding a note about it. If not, I wonder if it would be worth speculating about the meaning of a given researcher repeatedly uses the same paradigm with similar samples multiple times while changing the exclusionary criteria with no justification. This could at least be addressed in the suggestions for improvements in common practices.</p><p>7) Given the proliferation of &quot;turn key&quot; systems and rapid adoption of affordable, (e.g., mobile) devices for measuring of psychophysiological signals, many of which have not been sufficiently vetted for their reliability, I believe a slightly greater emphasis (not necessarily much more words but perhaps stronger language)on the potential differences in exclusion of participants based on specific amplifier systems used is warranted. I would predict that some modern systems with their decreased sampling rates and other features might do a poorer job of registering smaller responses and thus might lead to more exclusions if using criteria adopted when using more robust systems. Perhaps this is worth its own study and such could be suggested as a future direction of this work?</p><p>8) Given research on differences in skin conductance responses based on sensory domain (e.g., visual versus tactile) I am not sure I agree with the authors' recommendation of using responses to the US as exclusionary criteria in these paradigms. In other words, a given participant may reliability respond to tactile stimuli but not visual stimuli.</p><p>9) Regarding recommendations and future directions: there have been calls by some researchers (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12481758">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12481758</ext-link>) and answers by others (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715694/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715694/</ext-link> ) to use manipulations and tests specifically designed to empirically demonstrate proper quantification of measures such as startle. I wonder if something similar would be helpful to determine the proper exclusionary criteria for SCR responses. For example, a manipulation designed vary potential fear conditioning learning (e.g., lesser or greater reinforcement) could be covaried with a manipulation designed to increase or decrease general skin conductance response (e.g., pharmacological or temperature variations). If the authors believe such a discussion of this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, I would differ to their judgment.</p><p>10) I believe it would be helpful for the authors to briefly define &quot;non-responder&quot; on its first use in the paper (Introduction) as this term may be confused with the aforementioned &quot;non-learners&quot; in the same paragraph.</p><p>11) Over 400 papers were excluded for having an &quot;irrelevant topic&quot;. I may have missed it, but I did not see any examples given of what an &quot;irrelevant topic&quot; was. Knowing this may help readers understand the exclusions.</p><p>12) Some spots in the supplementary materials would benefit from just a bit of text to explain the figures, rather than referring back to the main paper (for example Appendix 4—table 2).</p><p>13) It's worth considering moving Supplementary Figure 3 to the main text. While this figure is depicting just one of many decisions that may impact subject exclusion, it's a commonly used method, and the graphic depiction of the impact of the heterogeneity of these choices is quite powerful.</p><p>14) Because of their import I think it would be helpful to (briefly) more thoroughly describe the ways in which the criteria for non-learners and non-responders (Results) varied across studies. For example, it would be easier to follow if the authors explained a bit more what was meant by &quot;Definitions differed in 1) the experimental (sub-)phases…&quot; and so on.</p><p>15) The authors state that this work contributes to &quot;raising awareness to the problems of performance-based exclusion of participants ('non-learners').&quot; This seems a bit too general. The problem isn't necessarily the use of performance-based exclusion, but how that exclusion is done.</p><p>16) The authors state, &quot;We have empirically illustrated that most definitions of 'non-learners' fail this manipulation check.&quot; Given the large number of findings and points in the manuscript, it would be helpful in the Discussion if statements like this included more detail and context to remind the reader of the finding.</p><p>17) In Box 1, General Reporting, under &quot;recommendations for how to proceed&quot; for &quot;minimal response criterion (μS) to define a valid SCR,&quot; it would help to have more detail about the means by which an empirical cutoff can be determined.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Navigating the garden of forking paths for data exclusions in fear conditioning research&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor and Alex Shackman as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>I am very happy to accept your paper for revision pending receipt of a revision that addresses, however you see fit, one residual suggestion from the reviewers:</p><p>&quot;My main concern in the initial version of the manuscript was the differential SCRs to stratify the sample into exclusion groups, which then are used in an analysis where differential SCRs are the dependent measure (See point 1 in revision), and the conclusion that the authors &quot;provided empirical evidence that those classified as 'non-learners' in SCRs in the literature (sometimes referred to as 'outliers') in SCRs based on the identified definitions ironically displayed significant CS+/CS- discrimination.&quot; Although the authors added a caveat to the methods, I find that the conclusions drawn in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “‘Non-learners’: conclusions, caveats and considerations” should be based on a stronger statistical framework. My major point is that it is statistically impossible to not find statistically significant SCR differentiation in an exclusion group who's CS+ &gt; CS- lower bound is &gt; 0. That being said, I understand that the field has used arbitrarily defined cutoffs that could lead to some learners misclassified. I just wonder if there is a statistically stronger approach to make this point. To be clear, I think this is an important piece of work with an impactful message that I would sincerely like to endorse for publication. However, I also understand that this message could be controversial to some, and I would like the authors to present this work in such a way that it can stand up to scrutiny from those that may disagree with the message.</p><p>My recommendation would be for the authors to dramatically soften the conclusions in the aforementioned subsection and acknowledge this limitation of their approach in the Discussion section.</p><p>Alternatively, if the authors had another method for estimating the number of subjects that each cutoff criteria likely misclassifies (e.g. perhaps by using the error variance of the entire sample as a stand-in for single-subject confidence intervals), these data could be used to support the conclusions mentioned above.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52465.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also outlined some important suggestions for strengthening the report, all of which can be addressed in a revision with a reasonable amount of effort by the authors.</p><p>0) The authors should strongly consider editing the title to something shorter and more direct.

We grouped subjects based on <italic>all</italic> the different cutoffs in SCR CS+/CS- discrimination (listed in Appendix 2—table 1, section A in the revised version) as identified from the literature search. More precisely, we did <italic>not</italic> classify individuals with a discrimination score of &lt; 0 µS or = 0 µS as ‘non-learners’. What we did is to classify individuals based on the cutoff criteria identified from the literature and then test if these resulting ‘exclusion groups’ showed evidence of learning (i.e., significant discrimination) or non-learning (non-significant discrimination) in our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They then calculate for each group in this stratification whether or not the individuals show evidence of learning by looking at differential SCRs and fear ratings.

We have thus removed part A and B of the table (results of the ANOVAs testing for differences in SCR CS+/CS- discrimination between the exclusion groups). Yet, the fact that some or even most of these “exclusion groups” did show significant CS+/CS- discrimination in SCRs is a major problem in our opinion, as these individuals are excluded from analyses as ‘non-learners’ in the literature. Hence, we think it is an important message that there is in fact strong evidence for learning in SCRs in these groups that are referred to as ‘non-learners’. ‘Non-learners’ should not demonstrate significant discrimination per definition. The exclusion groups, except for those with cutoffs &lt; 0 µS and = 0 µS, all showed significant SCR discrimination in our data as shown in Appendix 2—table 1. Consequentially, they showed evidence of learning in SCRs. We have made this point clearer in the Materials and methods section, the caption to Appendix 2—table 1 and revised the wording of our conclusions.</p><p>“To test whether exclusion groups differ in CS+/CS- discrimination, a mixed ANOVA with CS+/CS- discrimination in SCR or fear ratings as dependent variable and the between-subjects factor ‘Exclusion group’ and the within-subject factor ‘CS-type’ was performed. Note that it is circular to test for differences in SCR CS+/CS- discrimination between groups that were selected based on different SCR CS+/CS- discrimination cutoffs in the first place. Still, it is relevant to test whether all groups classified as ‘non-learners’ in the literature indeed fail to show evidence of learning, which would be indicated by a lack of significant CS+/CS- discrimination in SCRs in this case. In essence, this is a test to evaluate whether exclusion criteria used in the literature indeed achieve what they purport to do, that is, classify a group of participants that do not show evidence of learning.”</p><p>Appendix 2—table 1: “In this case example based on data set 1 (see main manuscript), we tested whether CS+/CS- discrimination in SCRs indeed differs between the different exclusion groups as defined by the cutoffs retrieved from the literature (see Figure 2B). […] Still, this is an important manipulation check to empirically test whether those classified as ‘non-learners’ in the literature indeed do not show evidence of learning, which would be indicated by comparable SCRs to the CS+ and the CS- (i.e., no significant discrimination).”</p><p>Results: “Unsurprisingly, the exclusion group defined by a CS+/CS- discrimination cutoff &lt; 0 µS showed inverse discrimination (CS- &gt; CS+, not significant in raw SCRs: p = 0.117; significant in log, rc SCRs: p = 0.021). Strikingly and more importantly, with the exception of the group formed by defining ‘non-learning’ as a discrimination score of 0 µS (light green), all other exclusion groups, <underline>which have been</underline> established by defining classified as ‘non-learners’ by the different cutoffs in the literature, showed significantly larger CS+ than CS- SCR amplitudes (i.e., significant CS+/CS- discrimination; raw: all p’s &lt; 0.0009; log, rc: all p’s &lt; 0.0002; see Appendix 2 –Table 1 for details).”</p><p>Discussion: “Fourth, we provided empirical evidence that those classified as ‘non-learners’ in the literature (sometimes referred to as ‘outliers’) in SCRs based on the identified definitions ironically displayed significant CS+/CS- discrimination – with the exception of non-learners defined by a cut-off in differential responding of &lt; 0 and = 0 µS. Hence, in addition to the many conceptual problems we raised here, the operationalization of ‘non-learning’ in the field failed the its critical manipulation check, given that those classified as ‘non-learners’ show clear evidence of learning as a group (i.e., CS+/CS- discrimination, see Appendix 2—table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In terms of significance for the field, I would specifically like to highlight the author's focus on characterizing the non-learners.

Yet, we would like to highlight that non-discrimination based on a single read-out measure (such as SCRs) cannot be taken as evidence for non-learning. We, however, agree that characterizing individuals that do not discriminate may be highly relevant.</p><p>Discussion: “Furthermore, by excluding these individuals from further analyses, we may miss the opportunity to understand why some individuals do not show discrimination between the CS+ and the CS- in SCRs (or other outcome measures) or whether this lack of discrimination is maintained across subsequent experimental phases.

We have included these thoughts in the Discussion of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Discussion: “Furthermore, future work should empirically address the question of how to best define ‘non-learning’ in particular in light of different outcome measures in fear conditioning studies, which capture different aspects of defensive responding (Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Spielberger, Gorsuch and Lushene, 1983)”</p><p>With respect to the potential impact of startle on the fear learning process, in the revised manuscript, we now refer to our previous publication (Sjouwerman et al., 2016) that addressed this question empirically. Indeed, the reviewer is correct in assuming that inclusion of startle as an outcome measure (which involves the presentation of an aversive stimulus to trigger the startle response) slows down fear learning.</p><p>Discussion: “Procedural differences, in particular the inclusion of outcome measures that require certain triggers to elicit a response (such as startle responses or ratings), have also been shown to impact on the learning process itself (Sjouwerman et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I am concerned that the many important messages in this manuscript may get lost to many less careful readers due to the wealth of information presented. On one hand, I applaud the authors for being transparent and forthcoming, but I wonder if there are ways to further focus the manuscript. I believe reduction in the overall length (perhaps partly through another careful round of editing to avoid any unnecessary redundancy) would strengthen the impact of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing forward this concern and have re-read our work carefully. We have shortened and focused the content wherever we saw fit. In addition, we inserted sub-headings to the Discussion to facilitate comprehensibility and guide the readers to the points most relevant to their interests:</p><p>“‘Non-learners’: conclusions, caveats and considerations”;</p><p>“‘Non-responders’: conclusions, caveats and considerations”;</p><p>“Where do we go from here?”;</p><p>“Final remarks”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One relevant issue not addressed in the manuscript is the rampant inconsistency of exclusionary criteria within a given lab or set of researchers. If the authors encountered this in their search, it may be worth adding a note about it. If not, I wonder if it would be worth speculating about the meaning of a given researcher repeatedly uses the same paradigm with similar samples multiple times while changing the exclusionary criteria with no justification. This could at least be addressed in the suggestions for improvements in common practices.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are absolutely correct to note that there is inconsistent use of criteria not only <italic>between</italic> but also <italic>within</italic> research groups and that typically no explicit justification for this is provided. While we are well aware of this, we have deliberately refrained from pointing this out explicitly in our manuscript. We see the major contribution of our work by providing a <italic>constructive</italic> and <italic>evidence-based</italic> discussion. Identifying specific individuals or groups for using inconsistent criteria across different publications (and speculating about the underlying reasons) would, in our view, not add anything to the message we want to be heard. We have, however, followed the reviewer’s recommendation to include a note about this in our suggestions. (See Box 1, section B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the proliferation of &quot;turn key&quot; systems and rapid adoption of affordable, (e.g., mobile) devices for measuring of psychophysiological signals, many of which have not been sufficiently vetted for their reliability, I believe a slightly greater emphasis (not necessarily much more words but perhaps stronger language)on the potential differences in exclusion of participants based on specific amplifier systems used is warranted. I would predict that some modern systems with their decreased sampling rates and other features might do a poorer job of registering smaller responses and thus might lead to more exclusions if using criteria adopted when using more robust systems. Perhaps this is worth its own study and such could be suggested as a future direction of this work?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a relevant implication for our work and included this in our revised Discussion.</p><p>“This being said, we do acknowledge that certain research questions or the use of different recording equipment (robust lab equipment vs. novel mobile devices such as smartwatches) may potentially require distinct data processing pipelines and potentially also exclusion of certain observations (Simmons, Nelson and Simonsohn, 2011; Silberzahn et al., 2018), hence it is not desirable to propose rigid and fixed rules for generic adoption.”</p><p>“It is difficult to suggest a universally valid cutoff with respect to the number or percentage of required valid US responses as this critically depends on a number of variables such as hardware and sampling rate used. It remains an open question for future work if data quality of novel mobile devices (e.g., smartwatches) for the acquisition of SCRs differs from traditional, robust, lab-based recordings and how this would impact on the frequency of exclusions based on SCRs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Given research on differences in skin conductance responses based on sensory domain (e.g., visual versus tactile) I am not sure I agree with the authors' recommendation of using responses to the US as exclusionary criteria in these paradigms. In other words, a given participant may reliability respond to tactile stimuli but not visual stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that different sensory domains may induce SCRs of different amplitudes (e.g., Etzi and Gallace, 2016; ). In the latter study, tactile stimuli indeed induced larger SCRs with larger amplitudes compared to visual stimuli. Yet, we are not aware of empirical work showing that individuals that reliably respond to tactile stimuli do not reliably respond to visual stimuli or vice versa and hence, this would need to be tested empirically as it seems to be a hypothetical assumption as it stands now.</p><p>In our manuscript, we argue that individuals cannot be classified as ‘non-responders’ if they show SCRs to any stimulus – irrespective of stimulus modality or sensory domain. In fear conditioning experiments, the tactile US is the strongest stimulus used. We argue that individuals can be classified as ‘non-responders’ if they do not reliably respond to this strongest stimulus – which reliably elicits SCRs with much larger amplitudes and higher response frequencies than the visual CSs. As there is no empirical work on this topic, we have included Appendix 4—table 1 and 2 which illustrate non-responding rates across different stimuli (CS+, CS-, US) across twenty different experiments. These data illustrate that we can rather reliably infer ‘non-responding’ to the CSs from ‘non-responding’ to the US but not vice versa. We believe that given the above outlined arguments, our recommendation is empirically based. We added further explanations to the Discussion:</p><p>“In sum, while excluding physiological ‘non-responders’ makes sense (in terms of a manipulation check and independent of the hypothesis), we consider defining ‘non-responders’ based on the absence of SCRs to the CS as problematic (dependent on the hypothesis).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Regarding recommendations and future directions: there have been calls by some researchers (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12481758">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12481758</ext-link>) and answers by others (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715694/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715694/</ext-link> ) to use manipulations and tests specifically designed to empirically demonstrate proper quantification of measures such as startle. I wonder if something similar would be helpful to determine the proper exclusionary criteria for SCR responses. For example, a manipulation designed vary potential fear conditioning learning (e.g., lesser or greater reinforcement) could be covaried with a manipulation designed to increase or decrease general skin conductance response (e.g., pharmacological or temperature variations). If the authors believe such a discussion of this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, I would differ to their judgment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this work to our attention. We have included a discussion on this in our revised manuscript as a suggestion for future studies.</p><p>Discussion: “Sixth, as illustrated by our case example (Figure 3), high CS+/CS- discrimination cutoffs generally favor individuals with high SCR amplitudes despite potentially identical ratios between CS+ and CS- amplitudes, which may introduce a sampling bias for individuals characterized by high arousal levels likely linked to biological underpinnings. Relatedly, future studies need to empirically address which criteria for SCR transformation and exclusions are more or less sensitive to baseline differences (for an example from startle responding see Bradford et al., 2015; Grillon et al., 2002).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) I believe it would be helpful for the authors to briefly define &quot;non-responder&quot; on its first use in the paper (Introduction) as this term may be confused with the aforementioned &quot;non-learners&quot; in the same paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it might be helpful to define ‘non-responders’ in the beginning of the manuscript – yet it is quite difficult, since the definitions differ across studies as outlined in our manuscript. Thus, we have included a definition in our revised manuscript that is somewhat vague but can be used as an umbrella term for the definitions found in the literature.</p><p>“Therefore, participants are often (routinely) excluded from analyses if they appear to not have not learned (‘non-learners’) or not have responded been responsive to the experimental stimuli (‘non-responders’) during fear acquisition training”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Over 400 papers were excluded for having an &quot;irrelevant topic&quot;.

[…] Of note, the number of trials included in the same ‘phase’ category is contingent on the experimental design and hence does not represent a homogeneous category (‘last half’ may include 5 trials for one study (i.e., 10 trials in total) but 10 trials for a different study employing 20 trials in total).”</p><p>Results: “The definitions differed in i) the stimulus type(s) used to define ‘non-responding’ (CS+ reinforced, CS+ unreinforced, all CS+s, CS-, US), ii) the SCR minimum amplitude criterion to define a responder (varying between 0.01 µS and 0.05 µS, or mere visual inspection), and iii) the percentage of trials for which these criteria have to be met (see Figure 6B and Appendix 1—figure 1) as well as a combination thereof.</p><p>‘Non-responding’ was most commonly defined as not showing a sufficient number of responses to the conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-), less frequently by the absence of responses to the US, or any stimulus (CS+, CS- or US) and in two cases by the absence of responses to the CS+ or context (CXT+) specifically (see Figure 6B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The authors state that this work contributes to &quot;raising awareness to the problems of performance-based exclusion of participants ('non-learners').&quot; This seems a bit too general.

My major point is that it is statistically impossible to not find statistically significant SCR differentiation in an exclusion group who's CS+ &gt; CS- lower bound is &gt; 0. That being said, I understand that the field has used arbitrarily defined cutoffs that could lead to some learners misclassified. I just wonder if there is a statistically stronger approach to make this point. To be clear, I think this is an important piece of work with an impactful message that I would sincerely like to endorse for publication. However, I also understand that this message could be controversial to some, and I would like the authors to present this work in such a way that it can stand up to scrutiny from those that may disagree with the message.</p><p>My recommendation would be for the authors to dramatically soften the conclusions in the aforementioned subsection and acknowledge this limitation of their approach in the Discussion section.</p><p>Alternatively, if the authors had another method for estimating the number of subjects that each cutoff criteria likely misclassifies (e.g. perhaps by using the error variance of the entire sample as a stand-in for single-subject confidence intervals), these data could be used to support the conclusions mentioned above.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this clearer for us and proving this feedback in a very constructive way. We agree that it is statistically very unlikely to not find a significant effect in these artificial groups – yet not impossible. We have now replaced these analyses by more conservative analyses using cumulative groups rather than within-exclusion group analyses (see Appendix 2). It is important to note that our previous conclusions still stand, as most of the cumulative exclusion groups still show significant discrimination despite of consisting of a number of individuals with negative and zero discrimination as well (in other words despite of the lower bound not being &gt;0). With respect to the alternative suggestion of the reviewer, we consider this rather difficult as the ground truth is unknown (what is a meaningful discrimination) and hence it is unclear how to define a misclassification. We hope the reviewer and editor agree on this approach.</p><p>We have also revised the parts of the manuscript that discussed the methods of our approach or its results.</p><p>Appendix 2:Results for 1.1 Applying the identified performance-based exclusion criteria to existing data: a case example</p><p>“In this case example based on data set 1 (see main manuscript), we tested whether CS+/CS- discrimination in SCRs indeed differs between the different exclusion groups as defined by the cutoffs retrieved from the literature (see Figure 2B). Note that this is somewhat circular as exclusion groups are defined by different SCR CS+/CS- cutoffs which then are used in an analysis where differential SCRs are the dependent measure. However, that this is exactly what is sometimes done in the literature (see main manuscript).</p><p>Still, this is an important manipulation check to empirically test whether those classified as a group of ‘non-learners’ in the literature indeed do not show evidence of learning, which would be indicated by comparable SCRs to the CS+ and the CS- (i.e., no significant discrimination). Here, we test this for cumulative exclusion groups. Note that this is only a rough manipulation check as a non-significant CS+/CS- discrimination effect in the whole group (e.g., those showing a CS+/CS- discrimination &lt;0.05µS based on raw scores) cannot be taken as evidence that all individuals in this group do not display meaningful or statistically significant CS+/CS- discrimination. More precisely, half of this group not meeting the cut-off of 0.05µS in CS+/CS- discrimination do show a negative or zero discrimination score which may bias the group average score towards non-discrimination. Yet, statistically testing for discrimination within each exclusion group (e.g. specifically in the group showing a discrimination between &gt; 0 and &lt; 0.05 µS) is statistically not unproblematic.”</p><p>“Strikingly and more importantly, most cumulative exclusion groups, as established by defining ‘non-learners’ by the different CS+/CS- discrimination cutoffs in SCRs in the literature, in fact show statistically significant CS+/CS- discrimination (see Appendix 2 for details and a brief discussion).”</p><p>Furthermore, we provide case-examples illustrating i) the futility of some definitions of ‘non-learners’ (i.e., when those classified as ‘non-learners’ in fact show significant discrimination on both ratings and SCRs as illustrated in Appendix 3 and Appendix 2 respectively) when applied to our data”.</p><p>“Fourth, we provided empirical evidence that those classified as a group of ‘non-learners’ in SCRs in the literature (sometimes referred to as ‘outliers’) based on the identified definitions in fact displayed significant CS+/CS- discrimination when applied to our own data.

We however acknowledge that the absence of a statistically significant CS+/CS- discrimination effect in a group on average cannot be taken to imply that all individuals in this group do not show meaningful CS+/CS- discrimination. As such, this is a rather conservative test.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
