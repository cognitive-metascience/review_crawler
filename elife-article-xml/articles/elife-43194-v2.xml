Without continued practice the level of skill performance quickly degrades, posing a problem for the timely utilization of skilled motor behaviors. Here we quantified the recurring development of vocal motor skills and the accompanying changes in synaptic connectivity in the brain of a songbird, while manipulating skill performance by consecutively administrating and withdrawing testosterone. We demonstrate that a songbird with prior singing experience can significantly accelerate the re-acquisition of vocal performance. We further demonstrate that an increase in vocal performance is accompanied by a pronounced synaptic pruning in the forebrain vocal motor area HVC, a reduction that is not reversed when birds stop singing. These results provide evidence that lasting synaptic changes in the motor circuitry are associated with the savings of motor skills, enabling a rapid recovery of motor performance under environmental time constraints.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43194.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Developing a complex skill, for example learning how to play the violin, takes considerable time and effort. If you then abandon the violin for months or years, your ability to play will deteriorate over time. However, when you do pick up the violin again you will be able to recover your proficiency much faster than you did when learning for the first time.</p><p>It therefore seems that while first learning a complex motor skill, some sort of memory is formed and stored. Learning and memory in general rely on the patterns of connections, called synapses, among neurons in the brain. Early in development, neurons make too many of these connections. This network is then refined over time as unneeded connections are discarded. However, the structural changes to the network that make it easier to re-acquire a skill were not well understood.</p><p>Canaries are a useful example of this sort of learning. Young males learn complex songs that are critical for their ability to attract a mate, and can quickly re-acquire their songs at the beginning of each mating season. Female canaries do not normally sing but will develop songs if they are implanted with a testosterone-releasing device. When the implant is removed, they stop singing.</p><p>To investigate how songbirds re-acquire songs, Vellema et al. gave female canaries a testosterone implant, and the birds gradually developed songs. The implant was then removed, and for two and a half months the birds did not sing. Vellema et al. then gave the canaries a second testosterone treatment. The canaries rapidly began to sing songs that were strikingly similar to the ones they sang during the initial learning period.</p><p>Examining the brains of these canaries revealed that major structural changes in brain connections occurred while the canaries first developed their songs. After the initial period of testosterone exposure, the female canaries had fewer synapses in a brain region that is associated with learning and producing motor tasks. Importantly, this reorganization of the brain circuitry was irreversible.</p><p>These findings provide fundamental insights into how we learn and maintain new motor skills. Similar rapid re-learning phenomena are observed in other areas of neuroscience, and future research can explore whether the mechanism described here extends to these areas. Possibly, this mechanism could also illuminate how we can regain skills lost after trauma or injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skill re-acquisition</kwd><kwd>birdsong</kwd><kwd>savings</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd><kwd>canary</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>701660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vellema</surname><given-names>Michiel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Office Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K-115970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zsebők</surname><given-names>Sándor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interuniversity Attraction Poles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IUAP-NIMI-P6/38</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van der Linden</surname><given-names>Annemie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gahr</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Office Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K-129215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zsebők</surname><given-names>Sándor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Office Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD-115730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zsebők</surname><given-names>Sándor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability to quickly re-acquire a previously lost motor skill is associated with lasting synaptic changes in the brain circuit that controls that motor skill.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex motor skills, such as singing or playing an instrument, are not inherently determined but need to be acquired through repetitive practice. Many specialized skills are used only incidentally however, and skill performance degrades during intermittent periods of non-use. This means that skills need to be re-acquired each time the need arises. For example, trained human surgeons need to re-acquire their surgical proficiency after a period of absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Crewther et al., 2016</xref>), Capuchin monkeys need to acquire manipulative foraging skills to retrieve difficult-to-access, seasonally available food items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eadie, 2015</xref>), and songbirds need to re-develop high-quality songs to attract a mate after wintering or long-distance migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Slagsvold, 1976</xref>). Whereas learning novel motor skills is generally a lengthy process, the short-term availability of suitable mates and food items imposes a considerable time pressure on the re-acquisition of such specialized skills.</p><p>Birdsong, an established model system for vocal motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brainard and Doupe, 2013</xref>), is characterized by a high degree of complex and rapid acoustic modulations. The fine motor skills that are necessary to produce such complex, high quality vocalizations are thought to advertise an individual’s quality through performance-related characteristics such as song complexity and/or production rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Podos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drăgănoiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Holveck and Riebel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Byers et al., 2010</xref>). When juvenile songbirds are one to two months old they start singing noisy, unstructured ‘subsongs’ akin to human babbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>), which gradually develop into variable, but recognizable species-specific ‘plastic songs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Marler and Peters, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nottebohm et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Tchernichovski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mori et al., 2018</xref>). With extensive vocal rehearsal the songs slowly consolidate into high performance ‘crystallized songs’, a process that can take up more than five months in some songbird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nottebohm et al., 1986</xref>). For adult songbirds that annually need to re-acquire their songs this process of juvenile song development greatly exceeds the time that is available to attract a mate during the early breeding season. Thus, adult songbirds must considerably speed-up song re-acquisition to quickly produce songs of adequate quality to impress conspecifics. It is currently unclear how songbirds cope with the seasonally imposed time pressure on song development, and what mechanisms may be involved to ensure reproductive success under such time constraints in nature.</p><p>The seasonal development and degradation in vocal performance are highly correlated with changes in testosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nottebohm et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Smith et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tramontin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Voigt and Leitner, 2008</xref>), and are often accompanied by gross anatomical and cytoarchitectural restructuring of the brain areas involved in song production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nottebohm, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gahr, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kirn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kafitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Thompson and Brenowitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balthazart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Vellema et al., 2014</xref>). Thus testosterone-regulated adaptations of the songbird brain may play an important role in optimizing song performance. In this study we used adult female canaries (<italic>Serinus canaria</italic>) to investigate how a periodically acquired motor behavior attains a high performance level under developmental time pressure. Although female canaries rarely sing spontaneously, and never produce high quality songs under natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Pesch and Guttinger, 1985</xref>), the systemic application of testosterone leads to the development of high-performance song with male-typical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Leonard, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Shoemaker, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Vallet et al., 1996</xref>). This trait provides us with a well-defined behavioral baseline, and allows us to manipulate in detail the onset and offset of song development through repeated testosterone treatments.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that during a protracted testosterone treatment, adult female canaries gradually develop stable, species-typical songs through a process of song crystallization similar to what is known for naturally-raised juvenile male canaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mori et al., 2018</xref>). Re-treatment with testosterone several months after birds have stopped singing, leads to a rapid recurrence of song performance with song features that strongly resemble those after the first treatment. We propose that once developed, vocal motor memories are retained for an extended period of time, enabling adult animals to recover song performance quickly at a later time, a process termed ‘savings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ebbinghaus, 2013</xref>). We further demonstrate that neurons in the songbird’s premotor nucleus HVC (proper name), a central nucleus in the brain circuitry that controls song production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>), irreversibly loses a significant number of dendritic spines during the initial testosterone-induced development of vocal skills. This state of reduced spine density is subsequently maintained over long periods in which testosterone levels are low and vocal skills are not used. The observed lasting synaptic pruning could play an important role in the formation of vocal skill savings, enabling birds to rapidly re-acquire song performance within a restricted time period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Testosterone-induced song development in female canaries</title><p>To study the development of vocal skills in adult female canaries we recorded and analyzed the entire song ontogeny in acoustically separated animals (5.6 ± 0.6 million song syllables per bird), while manipulating song output by consecutively implanting, removing, and re-implanting birds with testosterone implants.</p><p>Whereas no songs were observed prior to treatment, the systemic application of testosterone (T<sub>1</sub>+) stimulated birds to start singing their first songs after three days (3.22 ± 0.46 days).

Whereas learning new skills requires time and effort, the survival of many species relies on their capacity to utilize specialized skills in a timely fashion, capitalizing on the short-term availability of foods, mates, and other environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Prendergast et al., 2002</xref>). Such a capacity is biologically relevant for numerous skills in a multitude of species, ranging from periodic foraging skills in dolphins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Patterson et al., 2016</xref>), bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clarin et al., 2013</xref>), and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boinski and Fragaszy, 1989</xref>) to courtship displays in crabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mowles et al., 2017</xref>) and songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ota et al., 2015</xref>). As the use of these specialized skills is interrupted over longer periods, for example during long-distance migration or hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Slagsvold, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Prendergast et al., 2002</xref>), such skills need to be re-acquired quickly to maximize survival and reproductive success. In this study we establish the repeated, hormone-driven acquisition of vocal motor performance in female canaries as a model system for studying motor savings. Using this model, we show that while the initial development of specialized motor skills can be a lengthy process, motor performance can quickly be re-acquired at a later time, even after extended periods of non-use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 and 3</xref>). The accelerated song re-acquisition observed in this study indicates that acquiring a motor skill for the first time follows a different developmental trajectory than re-acquiring the same skill at a later time. This is both evident from the accelerated consolidation of song performance during song re-development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 and 3</xref>), and the observation that birds skip the subsong phase of song development when re-acquiring their songs. Our data further suggest that songbirds have the ability to retain previously developed singing skills through a process of selective pruning of the neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), enabling them to rapidly recover songs of adequate quality to attract a mate before breeding opportunities disappear.</p><p>Several song parameters were maintained across a period in which birds did not sing, while other song features demonstrated clear deterioration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G &amp; H</xref>). Birds were able to recover those deteriorated song features with renewed vocal practice. At the peripheral level, song performance depends on the accurate control of the respiratory system, the sound producing organ (the syrinx), and the upper vocal tract. Interestingly, those song features that required a phase of re-development to be optimized seem primarily associated with motor constraints in syrinx function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Podos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Geberzahn and Aubin, 2014</xref>). Online modulation of frequency and amplitude requires active contractile modulation of syringeal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Goller and Suthers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Elemans et al., 2008</xref>). Syllable repetition and the inter-syllabic interval also depend on how rapidly syringeal abductor and adductor muscles can open and close the syringeal aperture. The upper vocal tract may act as a tunable acoustic filter of the sounds produced by the syrinx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nowicki, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beckers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Riede et al., 2006</xref>) and play a more important role in establishing the bandwidth, entropy and mean frequency of song syllables. Thus song parameters linked to vocal tract modulation may be preserved after birds stopped singing, while song parameters linked to contraction speed of syringeal muscles appear to deteriorate.</p><p>Whereas male canaries are known to annually re-organize their songs, even when deafened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mori et al., 2018</xref>), no such modifications were observed in our study. It is not clear to what extent annual changes in male canary song structure are due to relearning or are driven by a selection process from a previously learned collection of syllable types during juvenile development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nottebohm et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Belzner et al., 2009</xref>). Considering that the female canaries in our study were acoustically separated during the testosterone-induced development of song suggests that the emerging song patterns are either for a large part innate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>), or are limited to a memorized collection of syllable types that they heard earlier in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Belzner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Marler and Peters, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Marler and Peters, 1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Prather et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kiefer et al., 2014</xref>). The initial song acquisition may thus rely on an innate or memorized auditory template, while the accelerated song re-acquisition may be driven by a motor memory trace of what the birds learned to produce during the first song acquisition phase. The syllable repertoires of our female canaries were much lower than what is common for males. Such a small vocabulary would limit the possibilities to re-arrange or replace syllables without compromising song complexity, and thus few modifications to female songs can be expected.</p><p>During juvenile brain development in humans, mammals, and birds, synaptic connections are initially overproduced, followed by protracted, activity-dependent synapse elimination during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Huttenlocher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rakic et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nixdorf-Bergweiler et al., 1995</xref>). By selectively stabilizing functional synapses while pruning away inactive synapses, brain circuits are thought to reduce neuronal plasticity, consolidating newly learned information and reducing unnecessary redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Changeux and Danchin, 1976</xref>). The lasting spine pruning observed in the forebrain song control area HVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) could reflect such a structural modification facilitating the long-term memorization of vocal patterns. Optical imaging studies have demonstrated a rapid accumulation and stabilization of neuronal dendritic spines in HVC during developmental song learning in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). In the mouse cortex, morphological modifications to dendritic spines have been observed that lasted well beyond the learning experience that caused the spine modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hofer et al., 2009</xref>), strongly suggesting that long-term memory retention of previously acquired skills is facilitated by stably maintained synaptic connections. Despite such learning-related circuit modifications, the large majority of dendritic spines in the mammalian brain are stably maintained in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rakic et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Grutzendler et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast we observed a strong spine reduction in fully adult birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the observed synaptic pruning in the adult canary HVC during song acquisition may reflect a developmentally delayed, activity-dependent consolidation of the neural motor circuitry.</p><p>A recent study in zebra finches has shown that singing prevention during juvenile development can also avert developmental spine pruning in the robust motor nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hayase et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, auditory input during sensorimotor learning may play an important role in circuit consolidation, and auditory deprivation has been shown to delay the natural juvenile maturation of HVC in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). It is not known how long such developmental processes can be postponed, but we did not observe delayed synaptic pruning in RA upon song acquisition in adult female canaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the time-window for large-scale spine pruning in RA may be more limited than in HVC. The developmentally delayed maturation of HVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) is consistent with our observation that the delayed, testosterone-induced development of song performance in adult female canaries follows a juvenile male-like developmental trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, in the absence of singing behavior, parts of the vocal motor circuit may remain plastic in adult female canaries, only consolidating once neural activity within the circuitry increases to drive testosterone-induced song output.</p><p>Testosterone-induced song development in adult female canaries has previously been associated with changes in other neural attributes in HVC as well, including an increase in volume, neuron numbers (but not densities), increased vascularization, and changes in cellular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Vellema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hartog et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gahr and Garcia-Segura, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nottebohm, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rasika et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Louissaint et al., 2002</xref>). Many of the observed modifications to the song system follow an annually changing pattern in seasonally breeding male songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nottebohm et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Smith et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nottebohm, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kirn et al., 1994</xref>), indicating that in males these modifications are not maintained outside the breeding season when birds no longer sing high performance song. In addition, withdrawing testosterone from male Gambel’s white-crowned sparrows, another well-studied seasonal singer, resulted in a rapid regression in HVC size, neuron number, and neuron size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that these neural modifications are reversible and unlikely to reflect long-term memorization of vocal patterns. The lasting synaptic pruning that we observed in HVC is to our knowledge the first report of a song-related modification to the adult songbird brain that persists after the behavior itself is no longer expressed.</p><p>HVC is at a central position between the motor circuitry that controls song output and a forebrain-basal ganglia circuit, analogous to the mammalian cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuit, which feeds back on the motor circuitry for song production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brainard and Doupe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>). Firing patterns in HVC neurons that project to RA are closely associated with millisecond precision of syllable timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Yu and Margoliash, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hahnloser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amador et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that HVC is directly involved in maintaining time-related features of song performance. Burst patterns in RA neurons on the other hand are more closely associated with intrasyllabic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Yu and Margoliash, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chi and Margoliash, 2001</xref>). However, slowing down brain processes by local cooling of HVC has also been shown to change the intrasyllabic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Long and Fee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that both HVC and RA activity play a role in maintaining the fine temporal structure within syllables. The acquisition of song syllables in zebra finches is accompanied by increased timing accuracy of inhibitory neural firing within the HVC microcircuitry, suggesting that precisely-timed inhibition may play an important role in shaping song-related premotor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kosche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vallentin et al., 2016</xref>). The lasting synaptic reorganization in HVC during song acquisition may be guided by such inhibitory activity and provide a neural scaffold for both intra and intersyllabic timing. RA-projecting HVC neurons are continuously replaced in the adult songbird brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez-Buylla et al., 1990</xref>), providing a base for ongoing variability in syringeal muscle control. A permanently maintained HVC network may guide dynamically changing circuits in HVC and RA during subsequent periods of singing, quickly driving song features towards previously acquired patterns.</p><p>Neurons from HVC that project to the avian basal ganglia Area X are not replaced in adulthood, providing a permanent subpopulation of HVC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gahr, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Buylla et al., 1988</xref>). Although we could not specifically distinguish between neuron types in our study, we observed the strongest reduction of 50% in the number of densely-spined dendrites in HVC after birds developed song. Previous studies have shown that those HVC neurons that project to Area X predominantly consist of neurons with densely-spined dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kornfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nixdorf et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kubota and Taniguchi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mooney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mooney and Prather, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fortune and Margoliash, 1995</xref>). Thus our observed synaptic pruning may be related to a major reorganization within the HVC to Area X connection, a reorganization that could reflect the long-term memorization of vocal skills. CBG-like circuits have been strongly implicated in the learning and long-term retention of motor skills in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albouy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Debas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lehéricy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Poldrack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coynel et al., 2010</xref>), mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yin et al., 2009</xref>), and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bottjer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Olveczky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aronov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sober and Brainard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ölveczky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>). Vocal exploration is driven by activity in the avian CBG circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kao et al., 2005</xref>), which may guide synaptic modifications in plastic motor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mehaffey and Doupe, 2015</xref>), even in adulthood. Although selective elimination of X-projecting HVC neurons did not appear to alter the song structure of adult zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Scharff et al., 2000</xref>), altered expression of FoxP2 in Area X of adult male zebra finches has been associated with changes in vocal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Murugan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>). In addition neurotoxic lesions in Area X lead to changes in singing tempo and syllable sequencing in adult zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kubikova et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the HVC to Area X connection continues to play a role in the long-term maintenance of vocal sequences.</p><p>The mechanisms behind learning-related, selective stabilization and elimination of dendritic spines remain largely unknown. Sex hormones may play an important role in the stabilization of such synaptic connections during the development of motor skills. Many of the brain areas that are involved in song learning and production express high numbers of androgen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arnold et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balthazart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Metzdorf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nastiuk and Clayton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gahr and Metzdorf, 1997</xref>), and X-projecting HVC neurons express estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gahr, 1990</xref>) that can be activated after conversion of testosterone into estradiol. Furthermore, changes in neuronal dendritic growth and synaptic morphology in the songbird RA have been observed to accompany testosterone-induced song development in female canaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">DeVoogd and Nottebohm, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Devoogd et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Canady et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, Frankl-Vilches et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frankl-Vilches et al., 2015</xref>) recently observed that 85% of the seasonally and testosterone upregulated genes in the canary HVC are related to neuron differentiation, axon, dendrite and synapse organization. In the brain of birds and mammals, sex hormones are known to upregulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dittrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Rasika et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Sohrabji et al., 1995</xref>), which in its turn contributes to the stabilization of synapses through the interaction with tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Koleske, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, BDNF has been shown to be essential during testosterone-induced song development in female canaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hartog et al., 2009</xref>), providing a likely pathway by which sex hormones can consolidate motor skills by stabilizing synapses.</p><p>Testosterone levels and song consolidation are tightly linked, and it is difficult to determine if brain anatomical changes in our and other studies are caused by testosterone, singing activity or both. Interestingly, local intracerebral testosterone implants close to nucleus RA did not cause anatomical changes in this androgen receptor-rich brain area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brenowitz and Lent, 2002</xref>), suggesting that modifications in RA are driven by singing-related, activity-dependent input from HVC. Whether or not testosterone, vocal practice, or both play a role in the observed synaptic pruning in HVC, the vocal circuitry demonstrated synaptic changes that persisted through several months in which testosterone levels were low and birds did not sing, potentially enabling the birds to quickly re-acquire their previously developed song patterns.</p><p>Sex hormones can be regulated by both environmental and social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Goymann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Oliveira, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wingfield et al., 1990</xref>), thereby providing a timed cue for the consolidation of behavioral output and the underlying brain circuitry. Such a cue could facilitate the timely formation and recall of long-term memories of relevant sensory and motor information. Our study suggests that lasting, hormone-driven synaptic pruning of related brain circuitries could form a basis for such long-term memories, enabling a quick recovery of previously acquired skills. The ability to respond quickly to environmental and social cues through such primed hormone-sensitive control mechanisms would constitute an important adaptation to ensure competitive proficiency and maximize reproductive success under environmental restrictions. The results obtained from this study may have implications not only across different animal groups, but may generally apply to different motor, sensory, and motivational systems that rely on a rapid recall of previously learned information.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>For this study adult domesticated canaries (<italic>Serinus canaria</italic>) were either purchased from a local breeder in Antwerp or taken from the breeding colony of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Seewiesen.

During the hormone treatments a light cycle of 11 hr light, and 13 hr darkness was maintained to exclude photoperiodic effects on song production.

To determine the SRs that were most commonly used at the onset and crystallization of song development a non-linear exponential curve (1) was fitted through the peak values of each SR histogram.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Further developmental correlation plots for all temporal and spectral song features were produced by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (CC) between a 7 day average of the histogram pattern at the time of song stabilization and all other recorded days. This calculation resulted in a value between −1 and 1 for each recorded day, and was used as a measure of similarity where one describes an absolute copy of the stable song pattern, and −1 describes the absolute inverse of the stable song pattern. A non-linear exponential curve (1) was fitted through the CC values and song parameters were considered stable as soon as the daily increase in similarity dropped below 0.001. For each song feature we used the fit curve to determine the duration between testosterone implantation and feature stabilization, and to determine the maximum daily increase in similarity (d<sub>max</sub>). D<sub>max</sub> could only be calculated for birds and song features that demonstrated a developmental increase in similarity, and was only used for statistical purposes if three or more birds demonstrated such an increase. Mean CC plots combining all analyzed birds were calculated by averaging the raw (non-fitted) CC values that were calculated for each bird and for each day. We aligned song development in the different birds based on the first day where we detected song.</p><p>Spectrograms of the original sound files were visually inspected on syllable-like sound structures to determine the syllable repertoire of each bird and the first occurrence of song after testosterone treatments. To assess syllable similarity during consecutive testosterone treatments we calculated the Euclidean distance between each of 100 randomly selected syllables for each syllable type from stable songs during both the T<sub>1</sub>+ and T<sub>2</sub>+ periods. The Euclidean distance between two syllables ‘<italic>a’ and ‘b’</italic> with coordinates <italic>c</italic> = <italic>SR, d, i, FM, AM, BW, MF, E</italic> was defined as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To give all analyzed temporal and spectral features equal weight in the analysis, each feature was normalized by dividing its value by its global median value from all syllables produced by all birds recorded in this study.</p><p>First, for each syllable type the mean Euclidean distance between 100 syllables of the same type during T<sub>1</sub>+ (<italic>T<sub>1</sub><sup>x</sup>T<sub>1</sub></italic>) was calculated to determine how much baseline variation existed between syllables of the same type. Lower values indicate a higher similarity between syllables. Secondly, we calculated the mean Euclidean distance between 100 syllables of the same type from the T<sub>1</sub>+ and T<sub>2</sub>+ (<italic>T<sub>1</sub><sup>x</sup>T<sub>2</sub></italic>) periods to determine if syllables produced during the 2<sup>nd</sup> testosterone treatment were similar to those produced during the 1<sup>st</sup> testosterone treatment. Finally, we calculated the mean Euclidean distance between 100 syllables of the same type from the T<sub>1</sub> +period with each of 100 syllables from all other types of syllables that a bird produced (<italic>T<sub>1</sub><sup>x</sup>T<sub>2</sub></italic><sup>ext</sup>) to provide a measure of dissimilarity between syllables of different types. All observed syllable types were included in this analysis with the exception of single transitional syllables connecting two song phrases.</p><p>To assess similarity of song syntax between subsequent testosterone treatments we determined the probability of song phrase transitions during the T<sub>1</sub>+ and T<sub>2</sub>+ periods for each bird. On average 794.3 phrase transitions per bird were used for the analysis. From the resulting transition probability distributions we calculated the sequence linearity, consistency and entropy as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Daou et al., 2012</xref>). In short, sequence linearity is expressed as the number of syllable types divided by the number of transition types and addresses the way phrases are ordered in a song. Sequence consistency is expressed as the sum of common phrase transitions divided by the sum of total transitions and addresses how often the same sequences are produced. Common phrase transitions were defined as transitions that make up at least 5% of all phrase transitions. The entropy (S) of the transition probability distribution with transition type <italic>T<sub>i</sub></italic> is a measure of the spread of that distribution and was calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub> <mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>To estimate spine densities and dendrite densities in motor nucleus HVC and RA, brains were collected from a control group of adult female canaries that did not receive any testosterone treatment (C: n = 6), a group of birds that was sacrificed five months after testosterone treatment (T<sub>1</sub>+: n = 8), and a group of birds that was sacrificed at least 2.5 months after testosterone withdrawal (T<sub>1</sub>-: n = 6). All experimental birds were raised and kept in group aviaries together with other male and female canaries throughout the experiment to assure similar social and auditory conditions. Birds were transferred to sound attenuating chambers for two weeks after testosterone treatment to assure that birds were singing, and prior to sacrifice. Individuals were randomly allocated to the different treatment groups. All birds were maintained on a light cycle of 11 hr light, and 13 hr darkness and were between 2.5 and 3 years old at the time of sacrifice. Brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining using the FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Columbia, MD).</p><p>After overnight fixation in a 4% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM; pH 7.4), brains were stored in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide at 4°C until further processing.</p><p>Brain hemispheres were separated with a razor blade and left hemispheres were immersed for two weeks in an impregnation solution consisting of equal amounts of FD solutions A and B in total darkness at room temperature. Following three days of incubation in FD solution C, brains were cut into 30 µm sagittal sections using a sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), which were stored in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide at 4°C.</p><p>Sections with a regular interval of 180 µm were mounted on SuperFrost glass slides (Menzel GmbH, Brauschweig, Germany), developed in a solution of two parts distilled water, one part FD solutions D, and one part FD solution E for ten minutes, and rinsed in distilled water before embedding in CC/Mount tissue mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were incubated at 70°C until the mounting medium had hardened, cleared in xylene, and further embedded in Roti-Histokitt II (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) before coverslipping.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Spine and Dendrite quantification</title><p>For each bird, z-stacks were obtained from three brain sections of nucleus HVC and two sections of nucleus RA with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a 60x oil immersion lens (CFI Plan Apo VC 60x Oil). The outline of HVC and RA in each section was delineated in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>), and 100 µm<sup>2</sup> non-overlapping regions of interests (ROIs) were randomly placed within the boundaries of the target nucleus prior to the quantifications. Considering the relatively uniform distribution of X-projecting HVC neurons and RA-projecting HVC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fortune and Margoliash, 1995</xref>), this approach should result in a homogenous sampling across treatment groups.</p><p>Neuronal dendritic spine densities were estimated for each brain section by checking ROIs in random order until five ROIs were located that contained spinous dendrite segments (15 ROIs per animal for HVC and 10 ROIs for RA). The individual dendrite segments within the ROIs were traced in ImageJ to measure the length, and the number of visible spines that originated from the traced segment was manually counted. Spine densities were calculated as the number of visible spines per µm of dendrite. All visible spine types were included in the quantifications, including filopodia, long, thin, stubby, mushroom and branched spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Risher et al., 2014</xref>). For branched spines, each spine head was counted separately.</p><p>To further obtain a density measure of spinous dendrites we counted the total number of spinous dendrite segments in all ROIs examined, and divided the number of observed dendrite segments with the number of ROIs, giving an estimation of the number of spinous dendrites per ROI. Neuronal dendrites were further binned into categories containing 0–0.2, 0.2–0.4, 0.4–0.6, 0.6–0.8, 0.8–1.0, 1.0–1.2, 1.2–1.4, 1.4–1.6, 1.6–1.8 spines per µm. The probability distribution of neuronal dendrite segments was then obtained by dividing the observed number of spinous dendrites per ROI in each bin with the total number of spinous dendrites per ROI.</p><p>To obtain a density measure of aspinous neurites in HVC, the number of visible spine-less neurite segments were counted in ten new non-overlapping ROIs that were randomly placed within the boundaries of HVC. We refer to these projections as neurites, because we were unable to distinguish between aspinous dendrites and axons in our tissues.</p><p>All quantifications were conducted by an experimenter that was blind to the experimental condition of the animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). No sample sizes were calculated prior to the experiments. A technical replication was defined as a repeated measurement of the same individual, and biological replications constitute the number of sampled individuals (n). Differences in spine and dendrite densities between treatment groups were tested with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons against one control value (untreated birds). Changes in hormone levels were determined using a repeated one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction. Differences in syllable similarity and syllable rates of individual syllable types were tested with one-way ANOVAs, and when significant, Tukey's HSD test was used to analyze differences between time points. Song pattern similarities between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> hormone treatment were established by comparing the average CC from seven consecutive days of stable song during the 1<sup>st</sup> treatment with the average CC from seven consecutive days of stable song production during the 2<sup>nd</sup> treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare CC’s, sequence parameters, and developmental time parameters between subsequent hormone treatments. To determine song feature deterioration we calculated the difference between the average CC from the last 7 days of stable song production during the 1<sup>st</sup> testosterone treatment and the average CC from the first 2 days of song production during the 2<sup>nd</sup> treatment. Feature recovery was determined by subtracting the average CC from the first 2 days of song production from the average CC from the last 7 days of stable song production during the 2<sup>nd</sup> testosterone treatment. One-sample t-tests were used to determine if feature deterioration and recovery significantly exceeded zero. Measurement values in the text are given as means ± SEM, unless stated otherwise. No outliers or data were excluded from analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ingrid Schwabl, Monika Trappschuh and Wolfgang Goymann for performing and analyzing the hormone radioimmunoassays.

The authors use this artificially-induced fast song acquisition process to study the fast re-acquisition of a previously learned skill. The authors quantified the behavioral changes during the first acquisition of a fine motor behavior, singing, to the behavioral progresses observed upon re-acquisition of the same skill after a period of absence of practice. In parallel, they investigated the changes in synaptic dendritic spine density in HVC that accompany these different phases of recurring motor development. Building on the female canaries' sensitivity to testosterone, the approach allows the experimenters to elicit on command (by adding/removing testosterone implants) the first acquisition of a song, impose a period of no practice (implant removal) and finally trigger re-acquisition of singing (new testosterone implant).</p><p>The results make a strong case that the song, upon reacquisition is similar to that acquired during the first phase, and that the behavioral course for first song acquisition is different than for re-acquisition, where only acoustic parameters linked to time (syllable rate, FM, AM, inter-syllable intervals) need to be reacquired. The stability of the song following reacquisition is particularly interesting in multiple regards: a) Unlike in male canaries (where song changes across seasons) the female song remains the same and b) The re-acquisition process of the same motor skill can be studied. The spine density results show that after the first acquisition of the song, the spine density diminished by 30% and this persisted after removal of the testosterone implant and during the absence of singing behavior. This finding is in line with the idea that synaptic pruning is responsible for improving and consolidating complex skilled movements. Although, the relationship between performance changes (from a slow first time learning process to fast relearning of a motor skill) and structural changes (pruning of spines in HVC) is purely correlational, the study represents a very creative approach to study the neuronal underpinnings of fast re-learning of already learned skilled motor behaviors.</p><p>Primary Issues for revision:</p><p>1) Since the song similarity claim is essential for the impact of this study (Figure 4), it is important to make this comparison as rigorously as possible, analyzing the similarity between the songs produced at the end phase of treatment 1 and the songs 2 produced during treatment 2. For example, it would be good to develop some sort of similarity score. Some ideas here include looking at the occurrence of same syllable sequences for a given bird compared to when comparing the productions of two birds. Or looking at the cross correlation between two conspecific testosterone treated female canaries. One important analysis is the quantification of syllable duration across treatment periods. Syllable duration did not deteriorate which strongly hints towards the re-acquisition of the same song. This finding might provide some evidence that single syllables are consolidated as one unit.</p><p>2) One interesting aspect of song, especially in the canary (as compared to the zebra finch), is that the transitions from one syllable to another obey certain probabilistic rules that are most likely dictated by HVC. While this is the case in male natural singing behavior, are females treated with testosterone singing a variable song with some transition rules or a very stereotyped song with strict rules? Were the transition rules affected by the testosterone treatment?</p><p>3) When looking at spine density only, can you differentiate dendritic pruning from apoptosis of part of the cell population? If the total number of cells is not stable, then the number of synapses should also change? Can the authors control for the cell density in HVC (or use the constant total number of neurites as a proxy)?</p><p>4) Need for more quantification of the synaptic changes undergone by the network (both HVC and RA) in all of the groups (including the +T2 group) will increase significantly the interest of this study for a broad readership. As it is, the timing coincidence between synaptic pruning in HVC and behavioral changes is an interesting piece of evidence for circuit reorganization but its link to behavior is relatively week. The extension of the quantification (what is happening in RA, analysis of the T<sub>2</sub>+ birds) would help make the case that synaptic changes may be linked to the behavior shown here. While we're probably not expecting a second pruning event, if the hypothesis is that the first pruning would be some sort of a motor memory trace of the song acquired under T+1, it could be worth checking that the re-acquisition of the song does not engage a second event of pruning.</p><p>5) With the experimental design, the decrease in spine number could also be explained by the application of testosterone alone and, thus, being independent of motor skill consolidation. How can the authors disentangle the effect of the treatment versus relearning?</p><p>6) The link between synaptic pruning in HVC and the fast re-learning process is a bit loose. Structural changes in HVC are linked to vocal learning in songbirds, but the specific pruning in HVC following song acquisition shown here has not been described previously. It is however difficult to parse out a possible effect of the different auditory experience (due to auditory feedback during singing) and the specific contribution of sensorimotor learning. Moreover, changes in HVC happening during the initial acquisition period may not be linked to the capacity of birds to reacquire the task rapidly. Indeed, some song parameters that are rapidly re-acquired are thought to depend more on the neural activity of nucleus RA (frequency and amplitude modulation) as they do not correlate with HVC activity in finches. These issues should be considered in revision.</p><p>7) Please provide more information about the auditory experience of the birds used for histology.</p><p>Secondary comments:</p><p>Some ideas for future work that came up in the discussion and you may wish to comment on:</p><p>1) This model could be used to investigate the difference between the motor memory trace of the song and the auditory memory trace, if the females were to match a template they heard before. Did the author control for the songs that the females might have heard from birth until Testosterone treatment? Are there any indications of song copying behavior?</p><p>2) Could it be possible to manipulate the dendritic growth during the resting period (implant removal) and see whether the re-acquisition of the song follows, after a second implant, a first-time learning trajectory or, even, the same first-time learning trajectory?</p><p>In males songbirds, it is known that with seasonal testosterone increases, there is an increase in the number of HVC cells (for instance Brenowitz and Larson, 2015). Is there anything known for females treated with testosterone?</p><p>Figure 2F: example spectrographs -&gt; spectrograms</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1: &quot;could not be calculated for T<sub>2</sub>+ in F, I, as we observed no developmental increase of this song feature&quot; -&gt; &quot;of these song features&quot;.</p><p>Figure 5: Dendrite ratio is unclear here. Do you mean probability or percentage?</p><p>Even looking at the method in the third paragraph of the subsection “Spine and dendrite quantification”, I don't quite get this ratio. By likelihood I assume you mean probability. Are these probabilities calculated per ROI over the total number of segments in a given ROI and then averaged over ROIs? Are you effectively calculating the probability of a density of spine given the probability of observing a spinous dendrite in an ROI?</p><p>Subsection “Song analysis”, fourth paragraph: Time = duration or delay to stabilization?</p><p>Subsection “Song analysis”, last paragraph: spectrographs -&gt; spectrograms.</p><p>The title should be shorter and more concise.</p><p>Abstract: Skilled motor behaviors are not necessarily a response to another action but can be executed independent of prior inputs.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: What is meant by 'manipulative skills'? Retrieving the memory of food cashes is not a motor skill.</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: Is it re-acquisition of the same song or learning new songs? Can the correlation of structural changes within HVC be explained if the birds learn a new song? Why should existing structures facilitate learning a new motor skill? What is the impact of the development of physical characteristics, constraints due to external factors e.g. muscle constraints or internal factors e.g. genetic background? This topic is discussed at the end but it might be useful to mention it during the Introduction.</p><p>Discussion, first paragraph: Overview of motor savings should be mentioned before own findings.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph: This statement is out of context because the question was not addressed within this study. The authors should discuss the known difference of acquisition periods between fine versus gross motor skills.</p><p>Discussion, sixth paragraph: The authors argue that vocal maintenance can be explained by 'structural consolidation of […] X-projecting HVC neurons'. In zebra finches it has been shown that the deletion of X-projecting HVC neurons does not lead to an impairment of stable song production. How does this finding fit in?</p><p>Figure 1A It should be indicated that the depicted spectrogram is the spectral derivative or a regular spectrogram presentation can be used.</p><p>Figure 1B Recording of the same bird or different birds?</p><p>Figure 1D When were the songs recorded? Days post treatment? Is it true that testosterone treated females sing faster (more syllables per sec) compared to male canaries? Can the authors correlate singing behavior (amount of singing/ quality of song) with testosterone levels?</p><p>Supplementary Figure 1 is missing?</p><p>Figure 2: Can the authors compare the song learning of male canaries with the testosterone treated females in respect to syllable production rate? In the second testosterone treatment phase the three syllable speeds reemerge instantaneously. How do the authors explain that the birds in T<sub>2</sub>+ sing the slow and the medium syllables reliably more often than during phase T1? Doesn't this argue against the idea that the animals have to re-acquire the motor skill but remain proficient without practice?</p><p>Figure 2B: What is the indication of a negative cross correlation of syllable rate during the first 40 days post treatment? Is this example bird an outlier? As far as I understand the data analysis the cross-correlation was calculated based on the histogram pattern. How can a negative correlation value occur? General request: For reproducibility and the understanding of the study it is crucial that the reader can retrace whether the effect depends on single individuals or if it is an effect that is reflected in the entire group. Mean value presentations should be substituted by individual data points.</p><p>Figure 5A: When where the example photomicrographs taken (time point in relation to testosterone implant)? Figure 5B: What is the meaning of 'a' and 'b'?</p><p>Are the behavioral results displayed as mean over subjects or mean over all song syllable analyzed? This is important to make this point explicit since one bird may contribute disproportionally to the entire data set in term of number of syllables produced.</p><p>Subsection “Singing-related pruning of neuronal dendritic spines”, first paragraph: this sentence summarizing the current knowledge of neuronal processes linked to song learning is a bit minimal. It would be important to highlight the known contributions of HVC and RA to song control and the evidence for plasticity at various sites of the song control network.</p><p>In Figure 4C, it is unclear whether the correlation coefficients for the T<sub>2</sub>+ columns are computed among syllables produced in the T<sub>2</sub>+ condition or between syllables from the T<sub>1</sub>+ and T<sub>2</sub>+ conditions. As written, I understand that it's among T<sub>2</sub>+ syllables. If true, this measures the similarity of syllables within a condition, while the sentence 'both temporal and spectral features demonstrated a strong similarity in their distribution patterns between subsequent testosterone treatments' rather suggests that the authors want to point to the similarity between T<sub>1</sub>+ and T<sub>2</sub>+. Either the analysis or the phrasing should be changed.</p><p>Figure 5C-E: I do not understand the statement made concerning this figure: 'Instead of an equal reduction in spines across all neurite types, we observed a shift in the dendrite ratio from densely packed dendrites towards less dense dendrites in the testosterone treatment and removal groups (Figure 5C-E)&quot;. The distribution of spine density across neurites appears shifted to the left, reflecting a global decrease in spine density in my opinion. If not, the authors should explain why.</p><p>Statistical comments/presentation of data:</p><p>It would be nice if the authors could show the distribution of raw data along with mean and SEM in their graphs instead of bar plots of mean and SEM.</p><p>More information should be given as of how the acoustic parameters were measured. Did the authors used Sound Analysis Pro for instance for these as well? Does the FM correspond to the CV of the fundamental frequency? etc.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Accelerated redevelopment of vocal skills is preceded by lasting reorganization of the song motor circuitry&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior and Reviewing Editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>We are quite pleased with the revision. There are some issues that we would like you to address, but as you will see, these are really suggestions about how to improve the presentation of the material and conceptual issues you may wish to raise in the Discussion. I do not see any of these as really &quot;major&quot;.</p><p>Conceptual/clarification issues for revision:</p><p>1) Clarify how FM can be lost but bandwidth maintained at the beginning of T2. Seems that these two parameters should go hand in hand given the pure tone types of syllables. Adding supplementary figures that show the distributions for every parameter akin to Figure 2A and along with some spectrograms examples of these deteriorations or preservations would help better picture the phenomenon.</p><p>2) What is mean by declarative features? Declarative memory? Is the idea that this is about the auditory template/memory of (a) tutor song(s).</p><p>3) You responded that the spine density was calculated '….of randomly selected spinous dendrite segments [of excitatory neurons in HVC…'. The study by Kornfeld et al., 2017, demonstrates that spine density of HVC-X projecting neurons is significantly larger than HVC-RA projecting neurons. How did you achieve a random selection of spinous segments in order to ensure that HVC-X and HVC-RA projecting neurons were sampled uniformly? Would it be possible to only sample HVC-X or HVC-RA projecting neurons?</p><p>4) Since this study is focused on the changes of spines of excitatory neurons, you may wish to address the importance of testosterone and/or vocal practice on changes in inhibition in the Discussion. It has been shown that inhibition, especially in HVC, is one of the crucial factors that is guiding the song learning process in zebra finches. Could a robust inhibitory network be the mechanism that allows seasonal birds (or in this case testosterone treated females) to re-learn their song more efficiently?</p><p>5) The second paragraph of the Discussion section is unclear. As defined (difference between max and min peak frequency) and given the sound produced by this species and papers by Beckers, Suthers and ten Cate, 2003, and Riede et al., 2006 that showed that several bird species filter out harmonics with their vocal tract to only leave the fundamental, bandwidth likely corresponds to the range of fundamental frequencies the bird is engaging for each syllable type. So bandwidth would be determined by the contraction frequency of the syrinx. Mean frequency and entropy, however, could be determined by the shape of the vocal tract more than by the syrinx contraction frequency. Could there be a statement here about aspects of the songs that are linked to the vocal tract modulation and that are preserved vs parameters linked to the speed of contraction of certain syrinx muscles that need to be reacquired? And/or add references and discussion about vocal production mechanisms to push such an argument.</p><p>6) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, does &quot;learned&quot; mean &quot;memorized&quot; here or did females produce these type of syllables (even rarely) before the first testosterone treatment? This may be an important distinction between the two mechanisms of song acquisitions. If females never sung such song syllables before the first treatment, females can potentially only rely on an auditory memory template of songs they heard (not demonstrated here but that could be another future investigation) or driven by some internal auditory template of what a male canary song should sound like (the implication/necessity of the auditory feedback for song production in females under T should by the way be tested by deafening or something similar) while during the second treatment, females can rely on a motor memory/trace of what they learned to produce during the first phase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43194.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Primary Issues for revision:</p><p>1) Since the song similarity claim is essential for the impact of this study (Figure 4), it is important to make this comparison as rigorously as possible, analyzing the similarity between the songs produced at the end phase of treatment 1 and the songs 2 produced during treatment 2.

The data shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 all include correlations between the songs produced at the end phase of treatment 1 and the songs produced during treatment 2, providing a measure of song similarity between the two treatments. To support this data we have included two additional song analyses: (1) For each bird we calculated the Euclidean distance between pairs of syllables of the same type from the consecutive treatment periods, providing us with a measure of similarity between groups of syllables. This analysis shows that syllables from the second treatment phase are structurally not different from syllables from the first treatment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1; subsection “Song similarity during subsequent testosterone treatments”, second paragraph of the Results and subsection “Song analysis”, sixth paragraph of the Materials and methods). (2) We calculated the probability distribution of syllable phrase transitions, which provides information on how syllable phrases are ordered in the song. This analysis shows that song sequence parameters are highly similar between the two treatment periods (Figure 4—figure supplement 2; subsection “Song similarity during subsequent testosterone treatments”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One interesting aspect of song, especially in the canary (as compared to the zebra finch), is that the transitions from one syllable to another obey certain probabilistic rules that are most likely dictated by HVC.

Not surprisingly, birds with larger syllable repertoires tended to have more variation in how syllable phrases were sequenced than birds with smaller repertoires. The number and probability of phrase transitions in the songs did not differ between treatment 1 and treatment 2, and we did not observe significant changes in song sequence parameters, suggesting that the rules governing these phrase transitions did not change between the two treatment periods. This data has been included in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, subsection “Song similarity during subsequent testosterone treatments, third paragraph,” of the Results and subsection “Song similarity during subsequent testosterone treatments”, last paragraph, of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When looking at spine density only, can you differentiate dendritic pruning from apoptosis of part of the cell population? If the total number of cells is not stable, then the number of synapses should also change? Can the authors control for the cell density in HVC (or use the constant total number of neurites as a proxy)?</p></disp-quote><p>A distinction has to be made here between how we calculated spine densities and how we calculated dendrite densities. (1) Spine densities (Figure 5B and C) were calculated as the number of spines per µm of dendrite for a number of randomly selected spinous dendrite segments, and not per volume unit of HVC and RA. By itself this analysis is independent of how many neurons or dendrites were present in the target brain region, and apoptosis or other changes in cell density therefore do not affect this calculation. (2) Dendrite densities are represented as the probability to detect a spinous dendrite within the volume of HVC (Figure 5D-F), and are therefore susceptible to changes in cell density. We did not observe a significant difference in the density of the total number of spiny dendrites in HVC between treatments however, indicating that the shift in the probability distribution shown in Figure 5D-F is not likely to be caused by a reduction in neuronal dendrites. Taking both pieces of evidence into account, these findings suggest a reduction of synapses in HVC through selective pruning of dendritic spines, without reducing the total number of dendrites in HVC. This point has been clarified in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Singing-related pruning of neuronal dendritic spines”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Need for more quantification of the synaptic changes undergone by the network (both HVC and RA) in all of the groups (including the +T2 group) will increase significantly the interest of this study for a broad readership. As it is, the timing coincidence between synaptic pruning in HVC and behavioral changes is an interesting piece of evidence for circuit reorganization but its link to behavior is relatively week. The extension of the quantification (what is happening in RA, analysis of the T<sub>2</sub>+ birds) would help make the case that synaptic changes may be linked to the behavior shown here. While we're probably not expecting a second pruning event, if the hypothesis is that the first pruning would be some sort of a motor memory trace of the song acquired under T+1, it could be worth checking that the re-acquisition of the song does not engage a second event of pruning.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional analysis of spine densities in nucleus RA demonstrating that this area does not undergo specific spine pruning during the acquisition and loss of song in adult female canaries, and suggests that the delayed maturation of the motor circuitry may be specific for HVC. This data has been included in Figure 5C and subsection “Singing-related pruning of neuronal dendritic spines”, second paragraph. Unfortunately we have no brain material available to test if a second pruning event would take place during a second testosterone treatment. The experiment was specifically designed to test if we could find an anatomical ‘memory’ trace that would last through a period in which the birds did not sing and could explain the rapid re-acquisition of a previously learned song pattern. Considering the extent of pruning that took place in HVC during song acquisition it seems highly unlikely that a pruning event of such magnitude would repeat itself during a second testosterone treatment in females, or occur on an annual basis in male canaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With the experimental design, the decrease in spine number could also be explained by the application of testosterone alone and, thus, being independent of motor skill consolidation. How can the authors disentangle the effect of the treatment versus relearning?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important question on the mechanisms behind selective stabilization and elimination of dendritic spines, mechanisms that are largely unknown. In songbirds testosterone levels are inseparably linked to the development and consolidation of vocal performance, both in our study as well as in nature. From our study we cannot determine if vocal practice, testosterone levels, or a combination of both cause the observed spine pruning in HVC. Singing prevention in zebra finches delays the developmental pruning of dendritic spines in RA at least to some extent (Hayase S, et al., 2018), suggesting that vocal practice induces spine pruning in this brain region. The authors did not control for testosterone levels however, and mechanisms of spine pruning in RA may differ from those in HVC (Figure 5B and C). Independent of the role that testosterone and vocal practice play in consolidating the song system, the reduction in dendritic spines was not reversed during a long period in which both testosterone levels were low and vocal practice was absent, providing a possible anatomical basis for the rapid recurrence of song patterns. We discuss this issue in detail in the ninth and tenth paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The link between synaptic pruning in HVC and the fast re-learning process is a bit loose. Structural changes in HVC are linked to vocal learning in songbirds, but the specific pruning in HVC following song acquisition shown here has not been described previously. It is however difficult to parse out a possible effect of the different auditory experience (due to auditory feedback during singing) and the specific contribution of sensorimotor learning. Moreover, changes in HVC happening during the initial acquisition period may not be linked to the capacity of birds to reacquire the task rapidly. Indeed, some song parameters that are rapidly re-acquired are thought to depend more on the neural activity of nucleus RA (frequency and amplitude modulation) as they do not correlate with HVC activity in finches. These issues should be considered in revision.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study we associate lasting structural changes in HVC with the development and re-acquisition of vocal motor performance. Our study does not directly address sensorimotor integration, and it is currently unclear if adult canaries can learn song from an external song template. Auditory deprivation during juvenile development leads to aberrant songs in canaries (e.g. Lehongre, C. et al., 2006 Anim. Behav. 72: 1319-1327) indicating the importance of audition for vocal learning. Testosterone-treated adult female canaries on the other hand develop species-typical songs even when acoustically isolated during the time they start singing for the first time, suggesting that adult song development does not necessarily depend on the same processes as juvenile song learning. In our study we cannot directly distinguish between the effects of vocal motor practice and auditory feedback on motor circuit consolidation. We consider these issues together with the potential roles that HVC and RA may play in the formation of motor memories in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please provide more information about the auditory experience of the birds used for histology.</p></disp-quote><p>All birds used for histology were raised and kept in group aviaries together with other male and female canaries throughout the experiment to assure similar social and auditory conditions.

Did the author control for the songs that the females might have heard from birth until Testosterone treatment? Are there any indications of song copying behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>Therefore we did not control for the auditory background of the birds during the first year of their lives prior to the experiment. We agree that our model would be well suited to investigate differences between procedural and declarative memory formation. We would speculate that declarative song memory, or the so called song template, would primarily be formed during juvenile development and is dependent on auditory input during that time, since our birds were able to develop species-typical songs in adulthood without being exposed to external auditory input. Unpublished song playback trials have not revealed clear song copying in adult female canaries, but it is currently unknown if adult female canary songs are composed of song patterns that the birds have memorized during juvenile development. This is partly discussed in the third and fifth paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could it be possible to manipulate the dendritic growth during the resting period (implant removal) and see whether the re-acquisition of the song follows, after a second implant, a first-time learning trajectory or, even, the same first-time learning trajectory?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be a very interesting approach to demonstrate causality between dendritic spine pruning and the observed rapid re-acquisition of previously learned song patterns. The mechanisms behind spine pruning or their possible regrowth are not clear, and to our knowledge no molecular techniques currently exist to induce specific regrowth of previously-pruned dendritic spines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In males songbirds, it is known that with seasonal testosterone increases, there is an increase in the number of HVC cells (for instance Brenowitz and Larson, 2015).

Seems that these two parameters should go hand in hand given the pure tone types of syllables. Adding supplementary figures that show the distributions for every parameter akin to Figure 2A and along with some spectrograms examples of these deteriorations or preservations would help better picture the phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>Bandwidth (defined here as the difference between the max and min peak frequency) describes the range of peak frequencies of a syllable while FM is calculated in Sound Analysis Pro as the mean angular component of all frequency contours within a syllable (and not only of the peak frequency). The mean FM of a syllable thus increases with an increased up and down modulation within the duration of the syllable, but bandwidth does not necessarily change as long as these increased modulations in frequency occur within the original range of peak frequencies.</p><p>To further illustrate the detailed song changes, we have included 2 supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2) with example histograms of each song feature and included several spectrogram examples of song syllables from the end of T<sub>1</sub>+, beginning of T<sub>2</sub>+, and end of T<sub>2</sub>+.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is mean by declarative features?

The study by Kornfeld et al., 2017, demonstrates that spine density of HVC-X projecting neurons is significantly larger than HVC-RA projecting neurons. How did you achieve a random selection of spinous segments in order to ensure that HVC-X and HVC-RA projecting neurons were sampled uniformly? Would it be possible to only sample HVC-X or HVC-RA projecting neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The sampling areas that we used for quantifications were spatially randomly distributed across HVC. Considering that HVC<sub>X</sub> and HVC<sub>RA</sub> neurons are relatively uniformly distributed throughout HVC (see e.g. Fortune and Margoliash, 1995) our sampling method likely captures equal ratios of both neuron types between the different treatment groups. This has been clarified in the third paragraph of the subsection “Spine and dendrite quantification”. The actual spine density of each segment does not influence the sampling frequency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since this study is focused on the changes of spines of excitatory neurons, you may wish to address the importance of testosterone and/or vocal practice on changes in inhibition in the Discussion. It has been shown that inhibition, especially in HVC, is one of the crucial factors that is guiding the song learning process in zebra finches. Could a robust inhibitory network be the mechanism that allows seasonal birds (or in this case testosterone treated females) to re-learn their song more efficiently?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a discussion on the potential role of inhibitory activity during song acquisition and re-acquisition in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The second paragraph of the Discussion section is unclear. As defined (difference between max and min peak frequency) and given the sound produced by this species and papers by Beckers, Suthers and ten Cate, 2003, and Riede et al., 2006, that showed that several bird species filter out harmonics with their vocal tract to only leave the fundamental, bandwidth likely corresponds to the range of fundamental frequencies the bird is engaging for each syllable type. So bandwidth would be determined by the contraction frequency of the syrinx. Mean frequency and entropy, however, could be determined by the shape of the vocal tract more than by the syrinx contraction frequency. Could there be a statement here about aspects of the songs that are linked to the vocal tract modulation and that are preserved vs parameters linked to the speed of contraction of certain syrinx muscles that need to be reacquired? And/or add references and discussion about vocal production mechanisms to push such an argument.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the focus of this section to discuss the potential role of the syrinx and vocal tract during song acquisition and re-acquisition, and included a statement on how they may relate to the preservation and/or deterioration of song features (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, does &quot;learned&quot; mean &quot;memorized&quot; here or did females produce these type of syllables (even rarely) before the first testosterone treatment? This may be an important distinction between the two mechanisms of song acquisitions. If females never sung such song syllables before the first treatment, females can potentially only rely on an auditory memory template of songs they heard (not demonstrated here but that could be another future investigation) or driven by some internal auditory template of what a male canary song should sound like (the implication/necessity of the auditory feedback for song production in females under T should by the way be tested by deafening or something similar) while during the second treatment, females can rely on a motor memory/trace of what they learned to produce during the first phase.</p></disp-quote><p>The female canaries in this study were not observed to produce any song syllables prior to the first testosterone treatment (subsection “Testosterone-induced song development in female canaries”). ‘Memorized’ may be a better description here and we have changed the term accordingly in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that the observed differences in song acquisition during the first and second treatments may depend on the absence (first treatment) and presence (secondtreatment) of a motor memory trace of the song. This idea is consistent with our view that large-scale synaptic pruning occurred in motor area HVC during the first testosterone treatment, a modification that may reflect the formation of such a motor memory trace. We have emphasized this idea in the aforementioned paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
