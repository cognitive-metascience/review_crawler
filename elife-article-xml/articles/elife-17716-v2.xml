pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17716.001</object-id><p>The role of mammalian skin in harbouring and transmitting arthropod-borne protozoan parasites has been overlooked for decades as these pathogens have been regarded primarily as blood-dwelling organisms. Intriguingly, infections with low or undetected blood parasites are common, particularly in the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic>. We hypothesise, therefore, the skin represents an anatomic reservoir of infection. Here we definitively show that substantial quantities of trypanosomes exist within the skin following experimental infection, which can be transmitted to the tsetse vector, even in the absence of detectable parasitaemia. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of extravascular parasites in human skin biopsies from undiagnosed individuals. The identification of this novel reservoir requires a re-evaluation of current diagnostic methods and control policies. More broadly, our results indicate that transmission is a key evolutionary force driving parasite extravasation that could further result in tissue invasion-dependent pathology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17716.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17716.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Human African Trypanosomiasis</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>reservoir</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>trypanosomes</kwd><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Fellowship (Annette Macleod) -

In a number of vector-borne diseases, it is becoming evident that asymptomatic individuals, be they humans or animals, can represent a significant proportion of the infected population and therefore an important reservoir of disease that requires targeting by control measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindblade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fakhar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koffi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthier et al., 2016</xref>). The recent identification in West Africa of asymptomatic individuals with human trypanosomiasis (long-term seropositives) but undetected parasitaemia, raises the question of what role these individuals play in disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koffi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jamonneau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bucheton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanmogne et al., 1996</xref>). Therapy is currently only directed towards microscopy-positive individuals and thus a proportion of the infected population remain untreated.</p><p>There is convincing evidence that seropositive individuals with low or undetected parasitaemia contain transmissible trypanosomes. Xenodiagnosis experiments, in which tsetse flies are fed on microscopy-negative infected humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frezil, 1971</xref>) or, more recently, experimentally-infected pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wombou Toukam et al., 2011</xref>), have shown that these apparently aparasitaemic hosts contain the parasite since the tsetse flies became infected. It is uncertain where the trypanosomes reside in the host but, given the telmophagus (slash and suck) feeding habit of the tsetse fly, they could be skin-dwelling parasites ingested with the blood meal. Our findings suggest that parasites may be sufficiently abundant in the skin to allow transmission and therefore the skin may represent an anatomical reservoir of infection.</p><p>Detection of trypanosomes in the skin is not well documented, although there are descriptions of cutaneous symptoms associated with African trypanosomiasis and distinct ‘trypanid’ skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGovern et al., 1995</xref>). Imaging data from mouse models of infection suggest that trypanosomes sequester to major organs such as the spleen, liver and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kennedy, 2004</xref>) and recent evidence has demonstrated trypanosomes in extravascular adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>). These adipose-associated trypanosomes appear to be a new life-cycle stage with a distinct transcriptional profile and, while tsetse bite-site associated transmission has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caljon et al., 2016</xref>), and a historical study made a passing observation of localised deposition of trypanosomes in the skin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodwin, 1971</xref>), the broader role of skin-dwelling trypanosomes in transmission remains unclear. In this paper we report the investigation of a possible anatomical reservoir in the skin of the mammalian host. We provide conclusive evidence of <italic>T.b. brucei,</italic> (a causative agent of animal trypanosomiasis) and the human-infective trypanosome, <italic>T.b. gambiense,</italic> invading the extravascular tissue of the skin (including but not restricted to the adipose tissue) and undergoing onward transmission despite undetected vascular parasitaemia. We also provide evidence of localisation of trypanosomes within the skin of undiagnosed humans. The presence of a significant transmissible population of <italic>T. brucei</italic> in this anatomical compartment is likely to impact future control and elimination strategies for both animal and human trypanosomiases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to investigate the potential for extravascular skin invasion by <italic>T. brucei,</italic> BALB/c mice were inoculated via IP injection with the low virulence STIB247 strain of <italic>T. brucei</italic> and skin sections were assessed over a 36-day time-course. The presence and relative quantities of extravascular parasites were evaluated by semi-quantitative scoring of the histological samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and compared to blood parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Extravascular parasites were first observed in the skin 12 days post-infection and remained throughout the experiment. Skin parasite numbers fluctuated to a lesser extent than blood parasitaemia and the apparent periodicity in the skin may be due to one particularly high data point on day 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Parasites were found in the dermis, subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and in fascia beneath the panniculus carnosus muscle. We did not detect any particular clustering around dermal adipocytes.

Mice were infected by a single infective bite of an individual <italic>G.m. morsitans</italic>. After 4 to 11 days and up to the end of the experiment, parasites were observed in the skin with a dynamic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a variable density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Parasites were first detected in the blood between 5 and 19 days after natural transmission and parasitaemia remained lower than 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanmogne et al., 1996</xref>) parasites/ml. Observed bioluminescence directly reflects the total number of living parasites in the entire organism, including blood and viscera, but the intensity of the signal decreases with tissue depth. Therefore, at the end of each experiment, mice were sacrificed and their organs were checked for bioluminescence. The presence of extravascular parasites in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues was first demonstrated by bioluminescence imaging in entire dissected skins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and was not necessarily localised to the bite site. In addition to the skin, only the spleen, some lymph nodes and adipose tissue were observed to be positive for bioluminescence in several individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the observed bioluminescence is likely to originate predominantly, but not solely, from parasites in the skin.

It is likely that once injected the parasites disseminate via the lymph and blood to the skin where they are ingested during tsetse fly pool-feeding and readily initiate cyclical development in the vector. Given the relative volume of the skin organ compared to the vasculature, it is possible, depending on the density of skin invasion, that more parasites exist in the skin than in the blood. The skin, therefore, represents an unappreciated reservoir of infection. The extravasation of trypanosomes was described previously in major organs such as liver, spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kennedy, 2004</xref>) and visceral adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>), but the importance of these parasites in transmission was not investigated. Here we show that these skin-dwelling trypanosomes contribute to transmission and could explain the maintenance of disease foci, despite active screening and treatment. Skin invasion for enhanced transmission is likely a powerful evolutionary force driving extravasation, suggesting that the generalised tissue penetration underlying pathogenesis (i.e. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, CNS invasion) is a secondary epiphenomenon. A skin reservoir also presents a novel target for diagnostics (e.g. skin biopsies), allowing the prevalence of infection to be accurately determined and the identification of any previously undetected animal reservoirs of human disease.</p><p>The skin as an anatomical reservoir of parasites is a recurring theme in arthropod-borne human diseases such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sacks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schlein, 1993</xref>) and <italic>Onchocerca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Symptomatology, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalmat, 1955</xref>). Here we present evidence of trypanosomes in the skin of hitherto undiagnosed individuals. This anatomical reservoir may serve to explain how HAT foci re-emerge and persist despite low numbers of reported cases even in the absence of an animal reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagbadouno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordon-Obras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balyeidhusa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>HAT was once widespread across much of sub-Saharan Africa but concerted control efforts brought it close to elimination during the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Health Organization 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2013</xref>). However, disease foci persisted, with a resurgence in the number of reported cases to over 300,000 in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Health Organization 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Steverding, 2008</xref>). Currently, HAT is approaching elimination in many areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">World Health Organization 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simarro et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how HAT evaded elimination in the latter half of the 20th century and how it continues to persist is vital to efforts to eliminate the disease. For example, our results indicate that it may be necessary to develop novel therapeutics capable of accessing extravascular compartments. The current policy in most endemic countries is not to treat serologically positive individuals unless they demonstrate active infection, due to the long duration and high toxicity of treatment and the low predictive value of the serological tests. We suggest that this policy should be reconsidered in light of our compelling evidence that they represent a carrier population which may maintain HAT foci and explain previously thwarted efforts to eliminate this major pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Trypanosome strains and cultures</title><p>All strains used in this study are pleomorphic.

Values representing the mean velocity, displacement and meandering index were calculated for each object. Mice were anaesthetised IP using medetomidine (Domitor 0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (50 mg/kg) and placed on a heated stage. Following removal of hair with a depilatory cream, dorsal skin was imaged. An intravenous injection of non-targeted quantum dots (Qdot705) (Life Technologies, UK) prior to imaging allowed visualisation of blood vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Spinning-disk confocal microscopy</title><p>AnTat1.1E AMLuc/tdTomato parasites were monitored in the ear of <italic>Kdr (Flk1</italic>) C57BL/6J Rj mice by spinning-disk confocal microscopy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rotureau et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, mice were first anaesthetised by IP injection of ketamine (Imalgene 1000 at 125 mg/kg) and xylazine (Rompun 2% at 12.5 mg/kg). Mice were wrapped in a heating blanket and placed on an aluminium platform with a central round opening of 21 mm in diameter. A coverslip was taped on the central hole and the mouse was positioned so that the ear was lying on this oiled coverslip. Imaging was performed using an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal system (Perkin Elmer) with a x40 oil objective (1.3 numerical aperture). Movies were acquired by an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu) controlled by the Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) with an exposure time of 500 ms for a total of 30 to 120 s.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The skin is a significant but overlooked anatomical reservoir for vector-borne African trypanosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Photini Sinnis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Álvaro Acosta Serrano (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the findings in this manuscript are novel and important. In has been known for some time that <italic>T. brucei</italic> is not restricted to the vasculature and can concentrate in various tissues. However, the experiments here show that a significant number of trypanosomes are present in skin and that these parasites can infect tsetse flies. These findings have important implications in terms of our understanding of the epidemiology of sleeping sickness and highlight the importance of determining the contribution that asymptomatic carriers may have in outbreak cycles.</p><p>Though overall the study is well-done there are some issues that must be addressed prior to our accepting the paper for publication. Major points are listed below but we would like to draw attention to two of the major points:</p><p>The quantification of trypanosomes based on luminescence should be given more prominence – do the tryps concentrate in the skin or are they more or less evenly distributed around the mouse?</p><p>Further, the data from human skin biopsies needs to be more convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A recent publication by the Figueiredo group (Trindade S. et al., Cell Host Microbe) also showed that the skin of an infected mammal is a niche for <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites. Although the Trindade paper was cited in the manuscript, it deserves more credit and discussion.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supported by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The experiment compares the trypanosome density in blood with a relative number in skin over a time course of infection. The authors conclude that the periodicity of infection is different. The clearest difference is on d24, it appears that this peak is due to one mouse d24I1, perhaps the authors should comment on this.</p><p>Also, it would help to have the blood trypanosome density for each timepoint (mouse) included in the supplementary data table.</p><p>Would it be better to plot blood parasitaemia against density in skin sections?</p><p>It is not clear how the leap is made from the bin-type scoring of low, moderate and large parasite numbers to the y-axis scale used? Can they further clarify – perhaps a different scale should be used?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The <italic>T. gambiense</italic> slide does not look like a skin section – it looks more like subcutaneous tissue – can the authors clarify? Is the enormous number of parasites seen in this section an outlier?

Do the trypanosomes concentrate in the skin or are they distributed around the mouse?</p><p>In panel 3B – Data from all mice should be shown in the graph- not just one representative mouse.</p><p>In Figure Supplement 3 it looks like different sections are shown with PAD1 and CRD staining but you state that you looked at both at the same time, i.e. co-staining. The figure legend should be more explicit and it would be better to show the same sections co-stained with PAD1 and CRD, if possible.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> supported by figure supplements and supplementary files</p><p>The important data are shown in supplementary files and not in the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Thus, these data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 4</xref> and 5, should be brought into the main text, possibly as a table.

Unfortunately, the samples were too fragile to survive the immunohistological procedure but we were able to <italic>Giemsa</italic> stain the slides. This allowed us to provide several convincing examples of trypanosomes in the skin of undiagnosed individuals at the higher magnification requested, including a transmission stumpy stage trypanosome in one individual. These are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The reviewers also raised several essential revision points that we address in turn below:</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>A recent publication by the Figueiredo group (Trindade S. et al., Cell Host Microbe) also showed that the skin of an infected mammal is a niche for T. brucei parasites. Although the Trindade paper was cited in the manuscript, it deserves more credit and discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the text to include further details of the conclusions of this publication but we stress that this paper did not show an association with trypanosome ‘adipose tissue forms’ and the skin as they were limited by the histological sections they examined.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supported by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

We have adjusted our conclusions to state that there is little periodicity in the skin and trypanosomes, once present, remain in this extravascular compartment.</p><p><italic>Also, it would help to have the blood trypanosome density for each timepoint (mouse) included in the supplementary data table.</italic> </p><p>The requested data has been included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Would it be better to plot blood parasitaemia against density in skin sections?</italic> </p><p><italic>It is not clear how the leap is made from the bin-type scoring of low, moderate and large parasite numbers to the y-axis scale used?

This has now been adjusted to include a second scale with parasite skin density as an average of the semi-quantitative score over five high-powered fields.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The T. gambiense slide does not look like a skin section – it looks more like subcutaneous tissue – can the authors clarify? Is the enormous number of parasites seen in this section an outlier? How were the tissue sections for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> chosen?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct in stating that the presented image was not superficial skin but of the fascia directly beneath. This figure has now been adjusted to correctly show histological sections of the dermis. The high number of skin dwelling <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> parasites relative to a typical <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> infection was observed in two of four mice and this is mentioned in the text and data presented.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> supported figure supplements and supplementary files</italic> </p><p><italic>The results show that the localisation of the concentrations of trypanosomes in the skin varies over time in an individual mouse (3A). The detection of luminescence may correlate with density of trypanosomes in blood (how were parasitaemias below 5 x 104 / ml measured accurately?).</italic></p><p>The bioluminescence can originate from trypanosomes in the blood, but at low parasitaemia (&lt;10<sup>4</sup> parasites/ml) the bioluminescence from BSF is negligible and therefore hidden by the bioluminescence emitted by trypanosomes in the skin. Parasitaemia was estimated automatically with a cytometer (Muse, detection limit 5.10<sup>2</sup> parasites/ml) and / or manually with a haemocytometer (Kova slides, detection limit 10<sup>4</sup> parasites/ml) and these details have been highlighted in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>Are the following data available, if so it would help the reader to know:</italic> </p><p><italic>Is the signal stronger if the trypanosomes are nearer the surface of the skin?</italic> </p><p><italic>Would trypanosomes in the viscera be detected?</italic> </p><p><italic>It would be important to know what fraction is the skin of the total mass of the mouse and what fraction of the bioluminescence is in the dissected skin? Do the trypanosomes concentrate in the skin or are they distributed around the mouse?</italic> </p><p>The bioluminescence signal directly reflects the total number of living parasites in the entire organism, including blood and viscera, but the intensity of the signal decreases with tissue depth and light absorption varies according to the nature of the tissues. Therefore, at the end of all bioluminescence imaging experiments, mice were sacrificed and their organs dissected to individually check their bioluminescence: in addition to the skin, only the spleen, some lymph nodes and adipose tissues were seen positive in several mice, suggesting that viscera were not privileged sites for parasite development in our conditions. The bioluminescent profile of mouse 3A dissected organs was added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In total, the bioluminescence detected in this experiment is likely to originate mostly, yet not only, from parasites in the skin. Estimating the total mass of the skin is not easy and may not be so informative as skin parasite density varies greatly in time and space over the course of infection. Moreover, because bioluminescence decreases with the depth of the source, it is not directly cumulative: i.e. the sum of bioluminescence intensities from dissected organs does not correspond to that of the entire living organism.</p><p><italic>In panel 3B – Data from all mice should be shown in the graph- not just one representative mouse.</italic> </p><p>This figure has been revised to include data from multiple experiments rather than one representative mouse.</p><p><italic>In Figure Supplement 3 it looks like different sections are shown with PAD1 and CRD staining but you state that you looked at both at the same time, i.e. co-staining. The figure legend should be more explicit and it would be better to show the same sections co-stained with PAD1 and CRD, if possible.</italic> </p><p>Co-staining was not possible because the two available antibodies are polyclonal rabbit antibodies and can therefore not be used at the same time.

This table presents all the xenodiagnoses performed after 48h.
