Similarly, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) undergo spatially organized fate specification on micropatterned surfaces. Since in vivo validation is not possible for the human, we developed a mouse PSC micropattern system and, with direct comparisons to mouse embryos, reveal the robust specification of distinct regional identities. BMP, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF directed mouse epiblast-like cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and radially pattern posterior mesoderm fates. Conversely, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF patterned anterior identities, including definitive endoderm. By contrast, epiblast stem cells, a developmentally advanced state, only specified anterior identities, but without patterning. The mouse micropattern system offers a robust scalable method to generate regionalized cell types present in vivo, resolve how signals promote distinct identities and generate patterns, and compare mechanisms operating in vivo and in vitro and across species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mammalian Embryo</kwd><kwd>epiblast</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>micropatterns</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgani</surname><given-names>Sophie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD080699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siggia</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY1502151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siggia</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK084391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NYSTEM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C029568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Micropatterned differentiation of mouse pluripotent stem cells gives rise to regionally distinct cell types arising in embryos at gastrulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gastrulation is the process of coordinated cell fate specification, spatial patterning and morphogenesis that establishes the blueprint of the adult organism. During gastrulation, the pluripotent epiblast (Epi) differentiates into the three definitive germ layers of the embryo; the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In the mouse, these events are initiated at approximately embryonic day (E) 6.25 by a convergence of signals, emanating from both extraembryonic and embryonic tissues, acting at the proximal, posterior of the embryo. The resulting BMP/Wnt/Nodal/FGF signaling hub drives posterior Epi cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hashimoto and Nakatsuji, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>), establishing a dynamic territory referred to as the primitive streak (PS). The PS elongates and extends distally as gastrulation proceeds. Distinct cell types are specified depending on the time and position at which they undergo EMT and exit the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lawson, 1999</xref>). Emerging mesenchymal cells either move proximally and laterally, forming the extraembryonic mesoderm, or bilaterally in an anterior direction circumnavigating the space between the Epi and outer visceral endoderm (VE) layers, giving rise to the embryonic mesoderm and definitive endoderm (DE). Epi cells that maintain an epithelial state and do not ingress through the PS form the ectoderm.</p><p>Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are the in vitro counterpart of the pluripotent Epi of the embryo. They can be expanded indefinitely and differentiated into derivatives of all germ layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keller, 2005</xref>). Standard differentiation protocols generate cell fates in a spatially disorganized manner that is incomparable with in vivo gastrulation. However, it was recently it was shown that, when human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated within geometrically uniform, circular micropatterns, they reproducibly patterned cell fates with radial symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tewary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). Based on a limited number of markers, hESC micropatterned colonies were suggested to give rise to a central ectoderm population followed by concentric circular territories of mesoderm, endoderm, and an outer trophectoderm layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). These findings revealed the capacity of the BMP, Wnt and Nodal signaling pathways to collectively organize cell fates. The scalability and reproducibility of this assay coupled with the ease of genetically modifying PSCs, the ability to manipulate culture conditions and the simplicity of imaging make this a robust and attractive system to disentangle the cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that pattern mammalian embryos. Even so, this human organotypic system raised many questions, largely due to the absence of a human in vivo standard for direct comparison and assignment of cell identities.</p><p>Here we adapted the micropattern-based system to defined medium conditions to precisely dissect signaling requirements, and to mouse PSCs for which in vivo reference points are accessible to assign cell fates. We first converted mouse ESCs to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), the in vitro counterpart of the Epi of the early pre-gastrulation embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). Mouse EpiLCs seeded onto circular micropatterned surfaces formed a simple epithelial morphology in a flat-disc geometry. By all markers examined, these cells were identical to the Epi of the E5.5-E6.0 embryo. When exposed to gastrulation-promoting factors, micropatterned EpiLCs underwent an EMT and recapitulated organized germ layer differentiation of specific regions of the mouse gastrula. This demonstrated that the cup-shaped geometry of the rodent embryo is not requisite for the spatial patterning of mouse pluripotent cells. Furthermore, the capacity to undergo spatially organized germ layer differentiation under these conditions was specific to EpiLCs. Under the same conditions neither ESCs, corresponding the pre-implantation Epi, nor epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), corresponding to the gastrulating Epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), demonstrated robust cell fate patterning. Hence, the mouse micropattern system offers a defined and quantitative tool to functionally assess the spectrum of described mouse pluripotent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morgani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32839.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EpiLCs represent a pluripotent state correlating to the pre-streak epiblast of the embryo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Development of the mouse pluripotent epiblast (Epi) from embryonic day (E) 4.5 to 7.5 and correlating in vitro pluripotent states.

We hypothesized that by modulating the signals provided to mouse PSCs we could recapitulate the proximal-distal environments operative in vivo and generate distinct regional identities in vitro. Exposure of micropatterned EpiLCs to posterior signals, BMP, FGF, ACTIVIN (NODAL) and WNT, promoted an EMT and acquisition of posterior Epi, PS, embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm identities. When BMP was removed, emulating the anterior PS environment (in which FGF, ACTIVIN and WNT are acting), anterior Epi, anterior PS and/or AxM and DE cell types were formed.</p><p>Hence, we demonstrated for the first time that in vitro micropattern differentiation parallels events occurring during gastrulation in vivo in mammalian embryos, and that mouse PSCs residing in a flat-disc geometry can pattern cohorts of neighboring regional identities correlating with those established in the embryo. Utilizing the micropattern system to manipulate the BMP pathway in isolation allowed us to extend findings made in mouse mutants by addressing the anterior versus posterior requirements for this signaling pathway within the PS. We established a direct requirement for BMP4 in posterior mesoderm formation, and demonstrated that BMP signaling is not required for DE and anterior PS/AxM specification. Further quantitative analysis of the signaling dynamics, the role of secreted inhibitors and cell-cell interactions should reveal how pathways operate in a flat-disc-shaped geometry, resembling the majority of mammalian embryos (including human), that can now be directly correlated to mouse, the most developed mammalian genetic model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Micropatterned EpiLCs correspond to the pre-gastrulation epiblast</title><p>The pluripotent state is a continuum spanning from Epi cell specification in the pre-implantation blastocyst (at approximately E3.5) to differentiation at gastrulation which initiates at E6.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morgani et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We sought to determine whether this correlation held when EpiLCs were grown on micropatterned surfaces.

For the mouse micropattern differentiation we utilized pluripotent EpiLCs, corresponding to the Epi cells of the embryo, and thus the system likely lacked the neighboring extraembryonic cell types and the signals that they provide. We therefore asked whether supplying these signals exogenously could mirror the in vivo signaling environment and initiate gastrulation-like events in vitro.</p><p>EpiLCs were plated overnight onto micropatterns in defined serum-free medium containing 12 ng/ml FGF2 and 20 ng/ml ACTIVIN A, supplemented the following day with 50 ng/ml BMP4 and 200 ng/ml WNT3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To identify these cell states in vitro in the absence of the spatial and temporal context of the embryo, we sought to establish marker signatures of the cell types present in gastrula stage embryos.

Three colony domains (central, mid and outer concentric circles) were evident based on marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>) and the populations within these domains were largely conserved between time points.</p><p>At both 48 and 72 hr, the colony center continued to express NANOG and low levels of POU5F1 and SOX2 as in the posterior Epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).

While OTX2 and SOX2 are also highly expressed within the in vivo anterior Epi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), the additional expression of the posterior-restricted marker NANOG, as well as FOXA2, within the colony center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>) suggested that these cells were more similar to posterior than anterior Epi.

Therefore, based on the expression of FOXA2 but not CDX2, the central population likely correlated to the posterior Epi later than E7.0, but prior to E7.75.</p><p>At 24 hr, BRACHYURY marked a PS-like population at the colony periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>). However, at 48 and 72 hr BRACHYURY-positive cells were observed more centrally, within the mid micropattern domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>). This inwards shift of BRACHYURY suggested either a wave of gene expression propagating throughout the colony or an inward movement of BRACHYURY-expressing cells. In vivo, BRACHYURY is expressed by cells within the PS, but is additionally present in the first cells emanating from the PS â where it is coexpressed with GATA6, and in the extraembryonic mesoderm ACD â where it is coexpressed with CDX2 and SOX17. While we observed cells that coexpressed BRACHYURY and GATA6 or CDX2/SOX17 (discussed later), the majority of BRACHYURY-positive cells did not express these markers, and hence likely corresponded to PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1H,I</xref>).</p><p>The outermost micropattern domain comprised several distinct cell populations with expression signatures reminiscent of embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm. A small fraction of cells coexpressed GATA6 and BRACHYURY, as in the first cells leaving the PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C,J,K</xref>). Additionally, we observed cells that coexpressed GATA6 and OTX2, as in Mesoderm 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B,G</xref>). While in vivo we could also discern a second population of embryonic mesoderm (Mesoderm 2) that expressed FOXF1 and BRACHYURY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>), within the micropatterned colonies FOXF1 was restricted to the colony periphery in a spatially distinct domain from BRACHYURY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>). Hence Mesoderm 2 was likely not generated under these in vitro differentiation conditions.</p><p>Within the same outer colony domain, we identified populations resembling extraembryonic mesoderm cell types. CDX2 was expressed within the outer domain from 48 hr of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2FâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). At this time, almost all CDX2-positive cells coexpressed BRACHYURY and SOX17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In vivo, coexpression of BRACHYURY, SOX17 and CDX2 is first observed within extraembryonic mesoderm cells of the ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). While BRACHYURY, SOX17 and CDX2 are also all expressed within cells of the hindgut at later stages of development (E8.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lewis and Tam, 2006</xref>), this micropattern population did not express additional hindgut markers such as FOXA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monaghan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence BRACHYURY/SOX17/CDX2-positive cells correlated most strongly to the extraembryonic mesoderm ACD.</p><p>At 72 hr, the BRACHYURY/SOX17/CDX2 population was no longer observed. CDX2 and SOX17 continued to be coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>) but these cells now lacked BRACHYURY expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). At 72 hr, CDX2-positive cells also expressed FOXF1, another marker found within the extraembryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Hence, SOX17/CDX2/FOXF1-positive cells likely corresponded to the AOM, suggesting a temporal progression of ACD cells to an AOM state, as in vivo. We also observed a rarer population of cells that coexpressed FOXF1 and GATA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, yellow arrowhead) as in the YSM or embryonic mesoderm positioned between Mesoderm 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). While both embryonic (GATA6) and extraembryonic (SOX17/CDX2/FOXF1) mesoderm-like populations were present within the outer micropattern domain, they tended to exist within discrete clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>During the micropattern differentiation, multiple DE-associated markers were expressed, namely FOXA2, SOX17, GATA6 and OTX2. In vivo these markers are coexpressed within DE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) while in the micropattern differentiation FOXA2, SOX17 and GATA6 were expressed in a mostly mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), hence they marked separate non-DE populations. Furthermore, BRACHYURY and FOXA2 were expressed within distinct micropattern domains (mid and central respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>) suggesting that AxM cells were not present.

In response to FGF, ACTIVIN (NODAL), BMP and WNT, the critical gastrulation-inducing signals acting in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>), EpiLCs grown on circular micropatterns underwent reproducible spatially coordinated cell fate specification comparable to in vivo gastrulation. Detailed marker analysis of gastrulating mouse embryos (which allow the mapping not only of marker expression but also of cell position) and micropatterns allowed us to link the in vitro differentiation to in vivo developmental time and space. In the absence of the spatial and temporal information of the embryo, we defined a cohort of 15 markers (SOX2, POU5F1, NANOG, SOX1, OTX2, BRACHYURY, CDX2, GATA6, SOX17, FOXA2, FOXF1, CDH1, CDH2, SNAIL, pSMAD1/5/8) that allowed us to distinguish between cell fates such as anterior versus posterior Epi, or extraembryonic mesoderm versus trophectoderm and DE, as these cell types express many common factors. This emphasizes the necessity of expression signatures, rather than individual markers, to accurately assign cell fates in vitro.</p><p>During 72 hr of differentiation, micropatterned colonies advanced from an E5.5 pluripotent Epi-like state to comprising an array of populations present in the embryo just prior to E7.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Hence, under these culture conditions, in vitro cellular differentiation was slower than in vivo development. Conceivably, further manipulation of the timing, levels and combination of signaling factors provided to EpiLCs, as well as the extracellular matrix composition and stiffness of the substrate on which cells are maintained to more closely mimic that of the embryo, could alter the rate of differentiation and support the specification of cell fates emerging at later gastrulation stages.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32839.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Micropattern differentiation of mouse pluripotent stem cells recapitulates cell fate specification in the posterior or anterior primitive streak.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Summary of embryo gastrulation (upper) and correlation with in vitro micropattern differentiation (lower).

Cells within the colony center showed minimal BMP signaling and expressed posterior Epi markers. PS markers were initially expressed at the periphery, but over time were observed more centrally. This was accompanied by an EMT and the emergence of outer mesenchymal cells, plausibly emanating from the PS-like region. The outer domain displayed elevated BMP activity and contained multiple populations including allantois and yolk sac extraembryonic mesoderm and early embryonic mesoderm.</p><p>In contrast to most gastrulating viviparous mammalian embryos, which exhibit a flat-disc geometry, rodents including the mouse are cup-shaped. A conceptual flattening of the cell fate arrangement within the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behringer et al., 2000</xref>), could not fully recapitulate the organization of cell types observed within the flat-disc micropatterns. Therefore the most evident correspondence between embryonic and micropattern cell fates was signaling history. However, while all cells within the outer micropattern domain experienced high levels of BMP signaling, both embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm fates were specified. It is therefore unclear whether additional morphogens distinguish embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm, or if factors such as three dimensional growth, migration and extracellular matrix composition or substratum stiffness dictate fate. Extension of the micropattern system to different geometries, morphogens and inhibitors should resolve these questions.</p><p>Spatial organization of cell identities within the micropatterns emerged even though signals were provided uniformly. Thus, epithelial cell cultures can self-organize and the signaling history of a cell depends on its local environment, as well as the external medium. When WNT3 was replaced with CHIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wray et al., 2011</xref>) a small molecule that activates the WNT signaling pathway intracellularly, bypassing the receptors and secreted inhibitors acting at the cell surface, the PS region expanded into the colony center. Hence, as with human micropattern differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>), endogenously produced inhibitors likely exclude signals from the colony center to define the inner domains. The identity of these inhibitors represents an open question to be elucidated in future studies.</p><p>In vivo, localized signaling from the extraembryonic tissues, notably the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), induces molecular asymmetries within the bilaterally symmetrical Epi leading to anterior-posterior axis establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stower and Srinivas, 2014</xref>). As the described micropattern system does not contain extraembryonic VE or ExE cells, and the disc-shaped colonies are also morphologically symmetrical, there is no apparent chemical or physical source of symmetry-breaking. Therefore, micropattern-differentiated PSCs might generate radially symmetric cell fate domains and be reminiscent of mutant embryos with defects in AVE specification or positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nowotschin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Migeotte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kimura-Yoshida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 1998</xref>), that lack the endogenous source of symmetry breaking. Interestingly, a mouse PSC-based three-dimensional differentiation system involving embryoid body-like aggregates, demonstrated asymmetric lineage marker expression in the absence of extraembryonic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van den Brink et al., 2014</xref>). However, as these structures are not geometrically uniform, the polarized marker expression likely stems from initial morphological asymmetries and there is still no evidence of spontaneous symmetry breaking within geometrically uniform structures.</p><p>The cohort of signaling factors and secreted inhibitors expressed by adjacent tissues within the embryo make development robust yet difficult to quantify. For example, the extraembryonic VE is a source of inhibitors including CERBERUS and LEFTY1 on the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stower and Srinivas, 2014</xref>), and WNT3 on the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rivera-PÃ©rez and Magnuson, 2005</xref>) side of the embryo, whereas the Epi and its derivatives express WNT3, LEFTY2 and DKK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meno et al., 1999</xref>). As our in vitro system patterns in the absence of extraembryonic cell types, it allows us to decipher Epi-intrinsic patterning mechanisms.</p><p>The micropattern system can be used to extend findings in animal models to a defined, serum-free environment where signaling modulation can be unambiguously interpreted to reveal how timing and levels of signaling influence cell fate. As a first step in this direction, we analyzed the effect of manipulating the BMP pathway. Embryos with disrupted BMP signaling do not form a morphological PS and predominantly arrest at early gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mishina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mishina et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>), obscuring the assessment of a role for BMP in later mesoderm and endoderm specification. When we applied FGF, ACTIVIN and WNT alone (in the absence of BMP) to micropatterned colonies, anterior rather than posterior cell fates were specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data revealed that BMP is not significantly induced by WNT and its absence does not perturb anterior cell fate specification. In the future, the micropattern assay could be used as a robust, efficient and scalable way to survey signaling conditions and systematically screen interactions between individual genes and pathways.</p><p>While a spectrum of mouse PSC states have been captured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morgani et al., 2017</xref>), their comparative functional capacities and relation to the embryo is largely unknown. The micropattern system represents a quantifiable means to test the differentiation potential of PSC states and cell lines under defined conditions. Here we observed that EpiLCs patterned either posterior or anterior cell fates in the presence or absence of BMP respectively. Conversely, although EpiSCs can contribute to all germ layers in chimaera assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), within the micropattern system they predominantly generated DE cells and exhibited minimal self-organization. The limited capacity of EpiSCs to pattern in isolation may stem from their elevated expression of signaling inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, exogenous FGF, ACTIVIN, BMP and WNT may not be sufficient to induce the expression of secondary factors required for patterning and posterior cell fate specification of EpiSCs. Further manipulation of the micropattern differentiation conditions may give novel insights into the unique requirements of these different pluripotent cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for organized cell fate specification.</p><p>Due to a paucity of data on gastrulating human embryos, cell fates arising during hESC micropattern differentiation can only been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). The mouse micropattern differentiation provides the essential missing link between in vitro gastrulation models in mouse and human, and in vivo mouse development. The identification of an extraembryonic mesoderm population within mouse, but not human micropatterns prompts an analysis of the human system with equivalent marker combinations under comparable serum-free medium conditions containing both BMP4 and WNT3A to determine whether populations such as extraembryonic mesoderm can be generated, or whether in human, extraembryonic mesoderm, as has been shown for the amnion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobreva et al., 2010</xref>), does not arise from the Epi at gastrulation. Human and mouse embryos are of a similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), their corresponding in vitro PSCs undergo micropattern differentiation within equivalent diameter colonies and specify cell fates as a function of distance from the colony edge, suggesting that these species use common mechanisms to regulate cell fate specification and tissue patterning. The further correlation of mouse and human in vitro micropattern data, in the context of different pluripotent starting states, and corroborated with in vivo data from mouse embryos should yield insights into the conserved and divergent mechanisms regulating fundamental aspects of early mammalian development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Micropatterned chips (Arena A, CYTOO, France) were washed once with PBS-/- and then inverted on top of the drops followed by incubation at 37Â°C for 2 hr. Micropatterns were then washed 5 times with 5 ml of PBS-/-. EpiLCs were collected by trypsinization and a single cell suspension generated. Cells were counted and 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> EpiLCs were evenly plated onto micropatterns within 6-well plates (Falcon) in EpiLC medium. Medium was supplemented with a small molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase (ROCKi, 10 Î¼M Y-27632, Tocris Bioscience, UK) for the first 2 hr after plating, to reduce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohgushi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe et al., 2007</xref>). Plates were maintained in the tissue culture hood for 30 min after plating to allow time for cells to evenly adhere to the micropatterns before moving to the incubator. After 2 hr, medium containing ROCKi was exchanged for N2B27 medium containing 12 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml ACTIVIN A, 50 ng/ml BMP4 (Peprotech) and 200 ng/ml WNT3A (R and D, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were maintained for up to 72 hr in this state, after which time cells were highly confluent and cell death was observed. To determine the effect of BMP signaling on the differentiation, cells were differentiated as described above for 72 hr with FGF, ACTIVIN, BMP and WNT (+BMP) or with FGF2, ACTIVIN A and WNT3A without BMP4 (-BMP) or FGF, ACTIVIN and WNT with the addition of 2 Î¼M DMH1 (Sigma) (BMPi).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunostaining, imaging and quantification of cells</title><p>Prior to immunostaining, cells were either grown on micropatterns or in 1 Î¼-slide eight well IbiTreat plates (Ibidi, Germany). Cells were washed twice with PBS before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then washed a further two times with PBS followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma) (PBS-T) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked in PBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) and 3% donkey serum (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added overnight at 4Â°C, diluted to the appropriate concentration in PBS-T with 1% BSA. Details of primary antibodies are supplied in Key Resources Table. The following day, cells were washed three times for 15 min with PBS followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluors, Life Technologies, Dylight, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS-T with 1% BSA for 2 hr at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times for 15 min with PBS with the final wash containing 5 Î¼g/ml Hoechst (Life Technologies). Cells grown on micropatterns were then mounted onto glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Cells were imaged using a LSM880 confocal (Zeiss). Brightfield-only images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Vert.A1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative analysis of micropattern differentiation</title><p>For micropattern image analysis and quantification, tiled Z-stack images of individual colonies were collected using a LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss) at 512 Ã 512 format using a 20x objective. The background signal was subtracted using ImageJ software and each channel saved as a separate tiff file. Tiff files containing the Hoechst nuclear staining of each colony were classified into regions containing nuclei and those that did not using Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sommer, 2011</xref>), an interactive image classification software. Using this information, a 3D probability mask was generated and analysis carried out using custom software written in Python. All analysis was carried out on entire Z-stacks of multiple colonies and an average of results across colonies displayed.</p><p>Segmentation of individual cells within images of colonies proved problematic due to the large number and high density of cells. For these reasons, manual correction of segmentation, as routinely used in smaller systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saiz et al., 2016</xref>), was not feasible. Therefore quantification of immunostaining fluorescence intensity across the radii of colonies as well as coexpression analysis was completed on a voxel basis to eliminate segmentation artifacts. To generate plots of radial immunostaining fluorescence intensity, each voxel within a colony was assigned a distance from the colony center. The fluorescence intensity for each marker was measured per voxel and then the average fluorescence intensity of voxels at a particular radial position (binned into discrete radial bands) was calculated for each colony. The average radial fluorescence intensity across multiple colonies was then calculated. To display the expression of multiple different markers across the radii of colonies on the same scale, the relative level of each marker was quantified by normalizing to the highest level of expression (shown as 100) either across a time-course or within an individual time-point. Spatial patterning across multiple colonies was also demonstrated by generating average colony images for individual markers where each segmented cell was represented as a dot whose color indicates its fluorescence in the specified channel.</p><p>Coexpression analysis was carried out on a voxel level, thatÂ is the fluorescence level of each marker within a single voxel was calculated and plotted. For genes that were not expressed, or only expressed at low levels, at the start of the differentiation, gates could be drawn based on the fluorescence at 0 hr and used to quantify the percentage of total voxels expressing a particular marker at later time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Nuclear density measurements in micropatterns and embryos</title><p>The number of nuclei per 100 Î¼m was quantified for 0 hr and 24 hr of micropattern differentiation utilizing the colony side view (z-axis) from confocal images acquired using a 40x objective at 0.5 Î¼m interval steps. The number of nuclei was quantified across the entire width of the colony at 10 distinct positions and the average number of nuclei per 100 Î¼m distance were calculated. For E5.5 embryos, the number of nuclei per 100 Î¼m was quantified on sagittal confocal optical sections based on the number of nuclei within a sagittal optical section of the epiblast and the distance around the epiblast within the same section, manually measured using ImageJ software. For E6.5 the same was done using confocal images of transverse cryosections. Only cells within the epiblast were counted. Five embryos at E5.5 and five at E6.5 were analyzed in this manner.</p><p>Inter-nuclear distance was manually measured using ImageJ software. A line was drawn from the center of one nuclei to the center of the adjacent nuclei. For micropattern differentiation, 150 measurements were made per time point (0 hr and 24 hr). For in vivo data, five different embryos were measured at each time point (E5.5 and E6.5). At E5.5, 125 measurements were made and at E6.5, 189 measurements were made.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice used in this study were of a wild-type CD1 background. Mice were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were housed under a 12 hr light/dark cycle in a specific pathogen free room in the designated facilities of MSKCC. Natural matings of CD1 males and 4â6 weeks old virgin CD1 females were set up in the evening and mice checked for copulation plugs the next morning. The date of vaginal plug was considered as E0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunostaining and imaging of embryos</title><p>To analyze the expression of markers within post-implantation embryos, the uterus of pregnant mice was dissected and deciduae removed. Embryos were dissected from the deciduae and the parietal endoderm removed. Embryos were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. Embryos were permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% Triton-X for 30 min followed by blocking overnight in PBS-T with 5% horse serum (Sigma). Primary antibodies were added the following day, diluted in blocking buffer at the appropriate concentration (details can be found in Key Resources Table) and incubated overnight at 4Â°C. The next day, embryos were washed 3 times for 15 min in PBS-T and then blocked for a minimum of 2 hr. Embryos were then incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4Â°C. Alexa Fluor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500. The following day, embryos were washed 3 times for 15 min in PBS-T with the last wash containing 5 Î¼g/ml Hoechst. Embryos were imaged in PBS-T in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) using an LSM880 confocal (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cryosectioning and quantitative embryo measurements</title><p>For cryosectioning, embryos were incubated in a 30% sucrose solution until they sank to the bottom of the vial. Embryos were then transferred to optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek<bold><underline>Â®</underline></bold>Â OCT, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) overnight. The following day, embryos were transferred to mounting molds (Fisher Scientific) containing OCT and appropriately oriented to give sagittal or transverse sections. Embryo-containing molds were carefully transferred to dry ice until frozen and then temporarily to â80Â°C until cryosectioning. Cryosections of 10 Î¼m were cut using a Leica CM3050S and imaged using a confocal microscope as described above.</p><p>To quantify immunostaining within gastrulating mouse embryos, transverse cryosections were imaged by confocal microscopy. For quantification of the relative levels of SOX2 and NANOG within different regions of the Epi, the anterior and posterior regions were manually selected using ImageJ software and immunostaining fluorescence levels in arbitrary units. Five cryosections were quantified per embryo and the levels normalized to the fluorescence levels of the Hoechst nuclear stain. At E6.5, three embryos were quantified, while as E7.5, two embryos were quantified. For quantification of the levels of pSMAD1/5/8 within different cell types within the gastrulating mouse embryo, transverse cryosections through the PS of E6.5 embryos were selected. Individual cells within the Epi, PS and mesodermal wings were manually selected using ImageJ software and fluorescence levels in arbitrary units. Data was normalized to the fluorescence level of the Hoechst nuclear stain. The PS was defined as BRACHYURY-expressing cells within the posterior Epi while the mesodermal wings were identified as cells that had left the Epi epithelial layer and were migrating between the Epi and VE. Three cryosections were quantified per embryo and three embryos were analyzed.</p><p>The diameter of embryos at different developmental stages was measured on acquired images using ImageJ software. Measurements were made along the anterior-posterior axis of transverse cryosections of embryos. Multiple cryosections at the widest region of the embryo were utilized and multiple embryos per developmental stage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Paul Tesar for EpiSC lines; Josh Brickman for <italic>Gsc<sup>GFP/+</sup>; Hhex<sup>RedStar/+</sup></italic> and Austin Smith for <italic>Sox1<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mESCs; Kathryn Anderson, Ali Brivanlou and members of the Hadjantonakis and Brivanlou-Siggia labs for critical discussions and comments on the manuscript.

To note, some cells of the PS coexpressed BRACHYURY, SOX2 and NANOG, likely a transition state between Epi and PS before SOX2 and NANOG are downregulated. It was unclear whether GATA6 was absent or expressed only at low levels in the ACD and early AOM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ronald McKay (Reviewer #2); Valerie Wilson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study Morgani et al. describe a micropatterned mouse pluripotent stem cell culture system that models many aspects of early post-implantation embryo development. Beginning with Epiblast like cells (EpiLC), which approximate the stage of formative pluripotency, the authors show that the system can recapitulate primitive streak formation, as well as anterior mesendoderm and definitive endoderm patterning, based on expression of combinations of cell type specific markers within the cultures. The authors validate the system by showing that treatment with appropriate morphogens can bias in vitro patterning in a fashion consistent with the actions of BMP, WNT, FGF and ACTIVIN signaling in the embryo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers are enthusiastic about the value of this experimental system and agree that these findings will be of interest to the field. Reviewer 2 raises some questions concerning the interpretation of the data on EpiSC that should be addressed, as does reviewer 3. Please comment on these points.</p><p>&quot;When grown on a specific substrate the EpiLCs generated a series of intermediate states found in the embryonic and extra-embryonic posterior regions of the gastrulating mouse embryo. ES and EpiSCs do not show the same the same responses to the growth conditions used here. This difference is interpreted as suggesting the EpiLC is the common pluripotent state shared by mouse and human embryos. While this manuscript reports important data, is it not possible that the in vitro conditions used here do not adequately support all the cell fates adopted by either mouse EpiSCs or human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells?</p><p>More specifically, the formation of anterior neural fates was not extensively explored in this analysis. The conclusion of this study that EpiLCs are biased towards posterior embryonic and extra-embryonic mesodermal fates suggests that EpiSCs may be biased towards more anterior fates. This raises the possibility that EpiSCs may express functions normally found in the anterior extra-embryonic visceral endoderm. This possibility was not definitively excluded by the analysis presented here that is based on a restricted number of antibodies and did not employ genome wide analytical tools limiting the number of cellular states that might be detected. &quot;</p><p>&quot;One of the conclusions is that EpiSCs are 'functionally restricted in developmental potential' (Results). However, EpiSCs can differentiate to a lot of cell types (see Huang et al., 2012): is there an argument that this micropattern culture has not fully revealed the spectrum of EpiSC differentiation?&quot;</p><p>Reviewer 2 requests some clarification regarding the unique outcomes of micropatterned cultures described here compared to other previous results.</p><p>&quot;Results: 'Micropatterned cultures do not contain extraembryonic cell types (namely primitive endoderm or trophectoderm derivatives), they instead formed radially symmetric cell fate'. However, other 3d culture systems (e.g. van den Brink et al., 2014) generate asymmetry without extraembryonic cell types. Can the authors comment on how these differences could arise?&quot;</p><p>All reviewers note some concerns about the identification of specific cell types. Reviewers 1 and 2 suggest that citation of current literature might help support the identification of particular cell types. Reviewer 3 raises a number of specific queries concerning particular markers; like reviewer 2 this individual is concerned to know whether particular markers were assessed at specific stages. It might be helpful to present the information on the markers in a somewhat more organized form. Figure S8 could be revised (for some reason I could not find the legend to this figure) to indicate which markers were tested at what stage, to indicate what figures show expression in the micropatterned cultures as well as the embryos, to include callouts to those data which are not identified with a particular figure in the manuscript, to show what the levels in the heatmap mean, and to include references from the literature where applicable. Excel might be the appropriate format for presenting this information.</p><p>&quot;Since there was no attempt to characterise the cultured cells further, either through molecular techniques (e.g. single cell gene expression analysis using QRT-PCR or RNA-seq) or through studies of their further differentiation into appropriate lineages, the validation of these markers is particularly important. It is not easy to assess the fidelity with which the in vitro system replicates cells in the embryo on this basis of a few markers; it is possible that global examination of gene expression patterns might not support the identification of cell types, or that the cells in vitro might not have the developmental potential implied by the labels the authors assign to them. These limitations are shared by almost all studies of in vitro patterning to date, and at some stage, the field will have to progress beyond this level. At least, the basis for claiming that 2 or 3 markers can uniquely identify the cell types of interest (as tabulated in Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>) should be clearly specified: is it the immunostaining in the manuscript, or can the unique identifiers be further supported by gene expression data from the literature. Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> is quite critical, linking the data to assignment of cellular identities. Perhaps the supplemental material could group together the embryo images with staining identifying particular cell types through various stages. I found it awkward to keep flipping back and forth to check this information.&quot;</p><p>See also these specific comments on markers for cell identification:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>1) Subsection âEpiLCs recapitulate differentiation and spatial organization of posterior cell fatesâ. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> what are the <italic>Sox2</italic> positive cells in the extraembryonic region?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>.

For example, the differences in the expression patterns of Nanog and Brachyury in the gastrulating mouse embryo that are central to the current report have been previously reported raising the important possibility that Nanog may have distinct functions in the inner cell mass and the primitive streak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic> </p><p>1) It would be good to re-check all the specifics in the rubric. Some queries that arose from using this as the overview to all the data, including:a) Was Nanog immunostaining done at all stages? It is listed as posterior epiblast throughout but I don't see the immunostains this refers to.</p><p>b) Sox1-GFP should be added to the rubric to identify anterior epiblast.</p><p>c) The rubric lists '<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>' as a source of information â I couldn't find panel 5I.</p><p>d) Definitive endoderm at E7.5-8.0 should list <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref> as a source.</p><p>e) Was OTX2 stain done in E7.0-7.25 embryos?</p><p>2) Some of the conclusions may need qualifying. For example check 'cells that coexpressed GATA6 and OTX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), corresponding to Mesoderm 1': GATA6 and OTX2 are also expressed in endoderm. Is the argument that this is not endoderm because the endoderm only later expresses OTX2? Timings of individual markers may be a bit different in vitro. However, focusing on the most likely cell type is correct; just try and avoid overstating the certainty of a conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32839.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers are enthusiastic about the value of this experimental system and agree that these findings will be of interest to the field.

However, EpiSCs can differentiate to a lot of cell types (see Huang et al., 2012): is there an argument that this micropattern culture has not fully revealed the spectrum of EpiSC differentiation?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We agree that chimaera data has shown that EpiSCs are not inherently restricted in their developmental potential. We now removed that statement and clearly reference the chimaera data within the Discussion (ninth paragraph).</p><p>As discussed above, further protocol modifications might permit EpiSC differentiation towards a wider spectrum of cell fates as observed in vivo (see above comments). For example, as EpiSCs can be maintained in a variety of culture conditions [1] and, individual EpiSC lines display distinct functional biases [2], different EpiSC lines, EpiSC culture conditions or micropattern differentiation conditions could result in the specification of distinct cell fates. We believe that we have established the micropattern assay as a quantitative read out of cellular state, complementary to single cell or population assays since it focuses on cell communication and pattern formation, that could be used to address these questions. While it would be beneficial to investigate the effect of these variables on cell fate specification, it is beyond the current scope of this paper.</p><p>Furthermore, while EpiSCs did not exhibit obvious spatial patterning of cell fates when differentiated in isolation, it may be possible that they can efficiently pattern cell fates when mixed with other cell types on the micropatterns, such as EpiLCs, in a situation that more closely resembles in vivo chimaera assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>âMore specifically, the formation of anterior neural fates was not extensively explored in this analysis. The conclusion of this study that EpiLCs are biased towards posterior embryonic and extra-embryonic mesodermal fates suggests that EpiSCs may be biased towards more anterior fates. This raises the possibility that EpiSCs may express functions normally found in the anterior extra-embryonic visceral endoderm. This possibility was not definitively excluded by the analysis presented here that is based on a restricted number of antibodies and did not employ genome wide analytical tools limiting the number of cellular states that might be detected. &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusion of the study is not that EpiLCs are biased towards posterior cell fates but that the conditions that they are exposed to (+BMP or âBMP) promote distinct cell fates. EpiLCs can form posterior cell fates in the presence of BMP and anterior PS cell fates in the absence of BMP. Conversely, the EpiSCs in this study form anterior cell fates in the presence or absence of BMP.</p><p>As EpiLCs and EpiSCs are derived from or represent the post-implantation embryonic epiblast, which does not give rise to extraembryonic trophectoderm or endoderm, it is unlikely that the micropattern system contains extraembryonic endoderm or trophectoderm cell types. We have added this to the text in order to clarify the reasoning:</p><p>âFor the mouse micropattern differentiation we utilized pluripotent EpiLCs, corresponding to the Epi cells of the embryo, and thus the system likely lacked the neighboring extraembryonic cell types and the signals that they provide.â</p><p>While we have carried out a thorough coexpression analysis of a panel of markers within individual cell populations present in the micropatterns and catalogued the cell populations that are present, the reviewers are correct that it is not possible to definitively assign an in vivo correlate to all cell populations present within the micropatterns. For example, it is problematic to distinguish between anterior primitive streak and axial mesoderm states that have a similar transcriptional signature. We will develop tools and protocols to facilitate the sorting of the cell populations identified in this current study for global transcriptional analysis and mapping to available embryonic data in future studies. We have now added a sentence to this affect:</p><p>âFOXA2/BRACHYURY-coexpressing cells observed in the absence of BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref>) may correspond to a subpopulation of anterior PS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or alternatively AxM cells that have downregulated Gsc and Hhex. Global transcriptional analysis may be required to resolve these possibilities.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 requests some clarification regarding the unique outcomes of micropatterned cultures described here compared to other previous results.</p><p>&quot;Results: 'Micropatterned cultures do not contain extraembryonic cell types (namely primitive endoderm or trophectoderm derivatives), they instead formed radially symmetric cell fate'. However, other 3d culture systems (e.g. van den Brink et al., 2014) generate asymmetry without extraembryonic cell types. Can the authors comment on how these differences could arise?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In vivo, the asymmetry of marker expression within the epiblast is initiated by signals from the extraembryonic trophectoderm and endoderm. It has previously been shown that, in the absence of these asymmetric extraembryonic signals, the epiblast no longer initiates asymmetric marker expression [3-6]. Although in vivo the source of asymmetry is the extraembryonic lineages, this does not mean that this is the only possible source of asymmetry in other contexts, for example in in vitro assays.</p><p>The reviewers draw attention to other studies where asymmetric marker expression has been demonstrated in vitro in the absence of extraembryonic cell types. However, those studies have fundamental differences in their methodology compared to the micropattern system. Pluripotent stem cell colonies differentiated on the disc-shaped micropatterns are confined in size and shape and begin as an epithelial monolayer exposed to a homogeneous medium. As such, there is no morphological or presumably signaling asymmetry. In contrast, the study by van den Brink et al. [7], referenced by the reviewers, involves three-dimensional embryoid body-like aggregates, assembled without size or morphological constraints and without constraints on growth/expansion during further differentiation. It is therefore likely that the aggregates are not morphologically symmetrical and, as a result, that individual cells may be exposed to distinct signaling environments and consequently initiate asymmetric signaling and marker expression.</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, when EpiLCs were differentiated on smaller diameter micropatterns, the width to height ratio of the colony was affected so that three-dimensional embryoid-body-like structures were formed. During the differentiation, these structures show morphological asymmetry that also correlated with a loss of marker radial symmetry. We have now added these results to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and discuss this within the text:</p><p>âIt should be noted that, on smaller diameter micropatterns, the width to height ratio of colonies was altered such that 80-140 Î¼m diameter colonies generated taller, embryoid body-like aggregates. Over time, these three-dimensional structures exhibited morphological asymmetries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which may explain the loss of radial symmetry in marker expression.â</p><p>We have also now reworded the Discussion to further clarify this point:</p><p>âIn vivo, localized signaling from the extraembryonic tissues, notably the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), induces molecular asymmetries within the bilaterally symmetrical Epi leading to anterior-posterior axis establishment [Stower and Srinivas, 2014]. [â¦] However, as these structures are not geometrically uniform, the polarized marker expression likely stems from initial morphological asymmetries and there is still no evidence of spontaneous symmetry breaking within geometrically uniform structures.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers note some concerns about the identification of specific cell types. Reviewers 1 and 2 suggest that citation of current literature might help support the identification of particular cell types. Reviewer 3 raises a number of specific queries concerning particular markers; like reviewer 2 this individual is concerned to know whether particular markers were assessed at specific stages. It might be helpful to present the information on the markers in a somewhat more organized form. Figure S8 could be revised (for some reason I could not find the legend to this figure) to indicate which markers were tested at what stage, to indicate what figures show expression in the micropatterned cultures as well as the embryos, to include callouts to those data which are not identified with a particular figure in the manuscript, to show what the levels in the heatmap mean, and to include references from the literature where applicable. Excel might be the appropriate format for presenting this information.</p><p>&quot;Since there was no attempt to characterise the cultured cells further, either through molecular techniques (e.g. single cell gene expression analysis using QRT-PCR or RNA-seq) or through studies of their further differentiation into appropriate lineages, the validation of these markers is particularly important. It is not easy to assess the fidelity with which the in vitro system replicates cells in the embryo on this basis of a few markers; it is possible that global examination of gene expression patterns might not support the identification of cell types, or that the cells in vitro might not have the developmental potential implied by the labels the authors assign to them. These limitations are shared by almost all studies of in vitro patterning to date, and at some stage, the field will have to progress beyond this level. At least, the basis for claiming that 2 or 3 markers can uniquely identify the cell types of interest (as tabulated in Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>) should be clearly specified: is it the immunostaining in the manuscript, or can the unique identifiers be further supported by gene expression data from the literature. Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> is quite critical, linking the data to assignment of cellular identities. Perhaps the supplemental material could group together the embryo images with staining identifying particular cell types through various stages. I found it awkward to keep flipping back and forth to check this information.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewersâ concerns, we have supplied <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> comprising all embryo data used in this study including wholemount confocal images, confocal optical sections and cryosections of the markers utilized.

For example check 'cells that coexpressed GATA6 and OTX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), corresponding to Mesoderm 1': GATA6 and OTX2 are also expressed in endoderm. Is the argument that this is not endoderm because the endoderm only later expresses OTX2? Timings of individual markers may be a bit different in vitro. However, focusing on the most likely cell type is correct; just try and avoid overstating the certainty of a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have reworded the text throughout to indicate that these are the most likely, rather than definitive, cell fate assignments based on marker combinations.</p><p>As the reviewer states, GATA6 and OTX2 are coexpressed in both mesoderm and in definitive endoderm (DE) cells. However, the GATA6-expression domain is devoid of the DE marker FOXA2 (found only in the center of micropatterns in the presence of BMP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also added a new figure panel to show that, furthermore, SOX17 (also a DE marker as well as being expressed in the extraembryonic mesoderm) is expressed in an almost entirely mutually exclusive fashion with GATA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). SOX17 and FOXA2 are also expressed within distinct colony domains (outer and central domains respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, while GATA6, OTX2, FOXA2 and SOX17 are all DE markers and are all expressed within the micropatterns, other than GATA6 and OTX2, their expression does not overlap. Based on these observations we had assigned GATA6/OTX2 cells as mesoderm rather than DE. We have modified the text to explain this reasoning in more detail:</p><p>âDuring the micropattern differentiation, multiple DE-associated markers were expressed, namely FOXA2, SOX17, GATA6 and OTX2. In vivo these markers are coexpressed within DE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) while in the micropattern differentiation FOXA2, SOX17 and GATA6 were expressed in a mostly mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), hence they marked separate non-DE populations.â</p><p>We have also now added additional data to strengthen this assignment. We utilized a double reporter cell line for <italic>Goosecoid</italic> and <italic>Hhex</italic> [12], which are markers coexpressed within DE and axial mesoderm. In the presence of BMP, <italic>Goosecoid</italic> was not expressed. This confirms our initial observations, suggesting an absence of DE and axial mesoderm anterior cell fates. In the presence of BMP, we did observe <italic>Hhex</italic> expression although <italic>Hhex</italic> also marks haematopoetic cells arising in the allantois. This data has now been added within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref> (see subsection âFGF/ACTIVIN/WNT/BMP triggers spatially organized posterior fate specificationâ seventh paragraph).</p><p>Alternatively, when we remove BMP, we observed coexpression of <italic>Goosecoid</italic> and <italic>Hhex</italic> indicating the presence of DE or axial mesoderm or both. We have also added this data to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A-G</xref>) (see subsection âThe absence of BMP allows DE and AxM specificationâ, second paragraph).</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Morgani, S., J.
