This signal activation occurs only when pathogenic RNA is identified, despite the ability of RIG-I to bind endogenous RNA while surveying the cytoplasm. Here we show that ATP binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I play a key role in the identification of viral targets and the activation of signaling. Using biochemical and cell-based assays together with mutagenesis, we show that ATP binding, and not hydrolysis, is required for RIG-I signaling on viral RNA. However, we show that ATP hydrolysis does provide an important function by recycling RIG-I and promoting its dissociation from non-pathogenic RNA. This activity provides a valuable proof-reading mechanism that enhances specificity and prevents an antiviral response upon encounter with host RNA molecules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09391.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09391.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09391.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a virus invades a cell, it commandeers the cell's replication machinery to make copies of the virus' genetic material. Some viruses, such as those that cause influenza or measles, store their genetic information in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules.</p><p>When a virus is first detected inside an animal, specialized cells are activated and sent to destroy the invader. This is known as the innate immune response. Animal cells contain a sensor known as RIG-I, and when RIG-I detects and binds to viral RNA, it starts a signaling process that activates the innate immune system. RIG-I can also bind to RNA molecules made by the host cell, but this binding does not cause RIG-I to activate the immune response.</p><p>Although there have been many studies into how RIG-I tells the difference between cell and virus RNA (this process is also known as ‘proofreading’), many of these have overlooked the role of a molecule called ATP. ATP stores energy for the cell, which is released in a process called hydrolysis. Binding to RNA causes the shape of RIG-I to change so that it can also bind to ATP, and RIG-I cannot signal to trigger an immune response unless it is bound to ATP.</p><p>Now, Rawling, Fitzgerald and Pyle have investigated ATP's role in immune signaling in more detail, and have found that ATP plays two distinct roles. Binding to ATP is necessary for RIG-I to start signaling in response to viral RNA, as it activates or ‘springs open’ the signaling regions formed when RIG-I binds to RNA. ATP hydrolysis is not involved in signaling; instead, it helps to remove RIG-I from the cell's RNA molecules. This recycles RIG-I and prevents it from becoming activated at the wrong time.</p><p>With a clear mechanistic description of RIG-I proofreading in place, it will now be possible to investigate how certain viruses take advantage of this system to evade detection. Further investigations could also look at how the dysregulation of RIG-I proofreading may be related to autoimmune disorders and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09391.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09391.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RIG-I like receptor</kwd><kwd>RNA helicase</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>antiviral signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fitzgerald</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name><name><surname>Pyle</surname><given-names>Anna Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The immune sensor RIG-I uses ATP-mediated compaction as a signaling trigger and a proofreading mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cellular innate immune receptor that recognizes viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the cytoplasm and consequently initiates a host defense response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablasser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>). The RIG-I protein is comprised of three major domain groups, including tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) that mediate signaling, a modified DExD/H-box ATPase core, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that provides RNA ligand specificity through high-affinity interaction with blunt-ended, triphosphorylated duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rawling et al., 2015</xref>). RIG-I surveys the cytoplasm in an autorepressed conformation, with the CARDs stacked against the helicase core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Upon RNA ligand recognition, the protein adopts a conformation that can bind and hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>).

RIG-I is normally present in cells in an autorepressed conformation with the CARDs stacked against the HEL2i domain. Upon infection by a subset of RNA and DNA viruses, RIG-I binds 5′ triphosphorylated duplex termini of viral RNA (black helix with three white circles) deposited or transcribed in the cytoplasm. RNA binding stimulates ATP (yellow star) binding and hydrolysis by RIG-I to ADP (yellow triangle). At some point in this process, RIG-I becomes competent to engage an immune signaling response through an interaction with the adaptor protein MAVS (red), however the determinant step for signaling has not been conclusively demonstrated. Thus, the transition of RIG-I from autorepressed to signaling competent may occur at the stage of RNA binding, ATP binding, or ATP hydrolysis, and this is denoted here with aroows bearing question markes leading from each stage in RNA-stimulated ATPase activity to the immune signaling interaction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09391.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09391.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09391-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>RIG-I requires both RNA and ATP ligands in order to become activated and initiate signaling. The precise molecular determinants for functional RNA recognition by RIG-I have been well characterized through structural, biochemical and cell-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goubau et al., 2014</xref>). However, the specific roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in activating RIG-I for immune signaling have not been defined or differentiated. Mutational studies have underscored the key role of conserved amino acids within the ATPase active-site of RIG-I. For example, residues that are required for ATP hydrolysis, such as the conserved lysine within helicase motif I (the Walker A motif), or the conserved glutamate and aspartate residues within motif II, exhibit dramatically reduced signaling capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rawling et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, RIG-I signaling is not impaired by motif III mutations that significantly perturb ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</xref>), thereby making it difficult to establish a direct relationship between hydrolysis and signaling. Alternative roles proposed for ATP hydrolysis include translocation and filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peisley et al., 2013</xref>), however these functions have not been shown to be absolutely necessary for signaling by RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Louber et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the function of ATPase activity in RIG-I signaling remains unclear.</p><p>To fully understand the determinants for RIG-I signal activation, the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis must be established. While robust signaling is often associated with ATP hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peisley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rawling et al., 2015</xref>), the ability of an RNA ligand to stimulate RIG-I ATPase activity does not necessarily ensure immune-stimulatory activity. It has been demonstrated that duplex RNAs containing a 5′ hydroxyl can bind RIG-I and stimulate robust ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rawling et al., 2015</xref>), yet these RNAs do not induce immune signaling by RIG-I, even at saturating concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goubau et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, RIG-I ATPase activity can be stimulated by short RNAs bearing a 3′ overhang, as seen in miRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson and Doudna, 2013</xref>). There are many other cellular RNAs that might be expected to bind RIG-I, such as lncRNAs, which contain abundant stem-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Somarowthu et al., 2015</xref>) and 5′ monophosphorylated products of mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>). Therefore, a mechanism to discriminate between endogenous and pathogenic RNA must be utilized. The ability to differentiate between host and viral RNA is essential, as aberrant activation of RIG-I would result in unregulated signaling that could lead to auto-inflammation and other innate immune disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanism for RNA ligand discrimination and understanding its linkage with ATP utilization are central to understanding the induction and regulation of RIG-I signaling.</p><p>In this work, we use a series of biophysical and cell-based approaches, together with mutational analysis, to distinguish between the roles of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in RIG-I function. We show that RNA-stimulated ATP binding can activate RIG-I for immune signaling in the absence of hydrolysis, thus explaining the lack of a correlation between ATP hydrolysis and signaling. Using a novel RNA ligand lacking free ends, we establish that ATP-mediated signal activation requires RNA end capping by the CTD. We demonstrate that in the absence of end capping, ATP binding and hydrolysis promote RIG-I dissociation from RNA rather than signaling, thereby contributing to proofreading and rejection of sub-optimal RNA ligands, such as endogenous RNA. Additionally, we show that ATP-stimulated RNA dissociation is dependent on the CARD domains of RIG-I. We therefore propose a model in which ATP binding by RIG-I leads to conformational changes that can result in either the liberation of the CARDs for signaling or RIG-I dissociation from RNA, depending on the affinity of RIG-I for the bound RNA ligand. ATP binding and hydrolysis thus play important roles in RIG-I function by activating signaling and ensuring RNA target specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A dsRNA 10-mer stimulates signaling in ATPase-deficient RIG-I</title><p>To investigate the relationship between ATPase activity and immune signaling in RIG-I, we evaluated the catalytic and signaling capabilities of RIG-I ATPase site mutants. Lysine 270, a conserved residue in the Walker A motif that coordinates ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walker et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordin et al., 2006</xref>), was mutated to either an alanine or arginine. Mutation of this lysine residue typically abolishes both ATP binding and hydrolysis in related DEAD-box proteins, making mutants at this conserved residue useful for studying the role of ATPase activity. Using a coupled ATPase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>), we determined the steady state ATP hydrolysis activity of RIG-I and the lysine mutants (K270A and K270R) when activated by a 5′ triphosphorylated, 10 bp hairpin (5′ppp10L). In agreement with previous studies on this and similar DExD/H-box proteins, we found that the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of both mutations was eliminated, while wild type RIG-I activity was robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordin et al., 2006</xref>). Next, we measured the RNA binding affinity of K270A and K270R mutants for a FAM-labeled 10-mer RNA hairpin using fluorescence polarization, and found that both mutants bind RNA with affinities similar to the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the observed ATP hydrolysis deficiencies are not a result of impaired RNA binding by these mutants.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09391.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Walker A mutant RIG-I can induce IFN-β production in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steady state ATP hydrolysis by wild type, K270A and K270R RIG-I proteins stimulated with varying concentrations of the RNA hairpin 5′ppp10L.

To evaluate ATP binding, we monitored the association of WT and mutant RIG-I with a fluorescent ATP analog, MANT-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), in the presence of the 5′ppp10L ligand using stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Using the observed rate constants, we extrapolated apparent dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for MANT-ATP for each RIG-I construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that Walker A mutants bind MANT-ATP with only a twofold weaker affinity than wild type RIG-I when stimulated by the 5′ppp10L RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, mutations in the ATPase active site specifically disrupt the chemical mechanism of hydrolysis, but they do not significantly perturb ATP binding by RIG-I when bound to 5′ppp10L.</p><p>We next evaluated the ability of K270A and K270R to stimulate IFN-β promoter activation using a cell-based assay system described previously (see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, HEK 293T cells are transfected with RIG-I or RIG-I mutant and an IFN-β/firefly luciferase reporter construct, challenged with RNA ligands, and then analyzed for luciferase expression (i.e., IFN-β promoter activation) using a luminescence assay. Several concentrations of each protein expression plasmid were transfected prior to dsRNA challenge in order to compare signaling efficiencies across wild type and mutant constructs. Intriguingly, wild type and Walker A mutant RIG-I proteins elicited similar levels of IFN-β promotor response at each of three concentrations tested when challenged by the 5′ppp10L hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We performed Western blot analysis on cell lysates from IFN-β activation experiments and confirmed that wild type signaling levels for each mutant protein are not due to variable protein expression across the three constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also evaluated IFN-β promotor activation when cells were challenged by a vehicle control, and observed no response. We thus determined that the observed IFN-β activation requires RNA transfection, and is not the result of high cellular concentrations of RIG-I. Therefore, signaling by the Walker A mutants represents a <italic>bona fide</italic> response to exogenous RNA, and we conclude that ATP hydrolysis is not required for signaling by RIG-I on a high-affinity RNA ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ATP binding, not hydrolysis, is required for immune signaling</title><p>Previous studies have shown that RIG-I constructs containing mutations at lysine 270 will not induce a signaling response in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamming and Horvath, 2009</xref>), in direct contrast to the results shown above. As the previous studies used longer dsRNAs to challenge RIG-I, we next investigated whether the ATP binding and signaling activities of RIG-I are RNA length dependent. We performed the cell based analysis described above with wild-type RIG-I and the Walker A mutants using RNA ligands of increasing length, including 14-, 30-, and 50-mer duplex hairpins (5′ppp14L, 5′ppp30L, and 5′ppp50L respectively).</p><p>Wild type RIG-I exhibits robust signaling behavior when challenged by any of the RNA ligands tested.

Wild type RIG-I exhibits RNA-stimulated ATPase activity on all RNA ligands, although the rates of catalysis (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) vary considerably with duplex length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). For example, while 5′ppp14L stimulates ATP hydrolysis with a rate constant of ∼15 s<sup>−1</sup>, the analogous 30-mer displays a rate constant of only 8 s<sup>−1</sup>. But, both RNA hairpins elicit nearly identical levels of IFN-β promoter induction, underscoring the lack of a direct apparent correlation between ATP hydrolysis and immune signaling. For the K270A and K270R mutants, all RNAs failed to stimulate measurable ATPase catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We subsequently measured the ATP binding affinities of WT RIG-I and mutant proteins when bound to 5′ppp30L.

These experiments show that the only difference between Walker A mutants that are bound to 5′ppp10L and 5′ppp30L is their ability to bind ATP, and this ATP binding ability is directly correlated with immune signaling. We therefore conclude that RNA-stimulated ATP binding is required to induce signaling by RIG-I.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RIG-I cannot signal when bound to internal duplex sites</title><p>Walker A mutants can bind ATP and induce immune signaling only when interacting with 5′ppp10L and not the longer 5′ppp30L, suggesting that RNAs containing off-target, internal duplexes are detrimental to RIG-I activity. To directly investigate the importance of RIG-I binding at internal duplex sites, we assessed the enzymatic and signaling capabilities of RIG-I bound to RNA with no free ends. This RNA was created from two partially complementary strands that contain 5′ and 3′ regions incapable of base pairing. The two strands were annealed and ligated, creating a dumbbell-like structure that is characterized by a 14-bp duplex region flanked on each end by an 8 base, ssRNA loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09391.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RIG-I cannot signal from internal sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of RNA dumbbell synthesis.

Longer dumbbells (up to 50 bp) also fail to induce signaling, indicating that this effect is not dependent on duplex length (data not shown).</p><p>We next determined the affinity of RIG-I for a fluorescently-labeled, 14-bp RNA dumbbell using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (see ‘Materials and methods’). RIG-I exhibits weak affinity for the dumbbell, with a dissociation constant of 2.1 ± 0.22 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By comparison, RIG-I binds blunt-ended RNA termini orders of magnitude more tightly, with dissociation constants ranging from about 200 pM to around 20 nM for 5′ triphosphorylated and 5′ hydroxyl ligands, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vela et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while it is unable to signal from an internal duplex, RIG-I is still capable of binding such sites at very high concentrations.</p><p>We then evaluated the ATP binding and hydrolysis activity of RIG-I bound to the 14-bp dumbbell. We found that ATP binding by RIG-I on the dumbbell is qualitatively the same as that observed when bound to duplex RNA termini, and that the dumbbell is capable of stimulating ATP hydrolysis at a rate constant that is comparable to 5′ppp10L at saturating RNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These data show that ATP binding and hydrolysis is not impaired when wild-type RIG-I is bound to internal duplexes. Taken together with the inability of RIG-I to signal on the dumbbell, we conclude that ATP binding and hydrolysis does not always lead to signaling. Because ATP binding and hydrolysis do not induce signaling by RIG-I on an internal duplex, we wondered if these activities might serve a second functional role.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nucleotide binding stimulates RNA dissociation by RIG-I</title><p>A number of DExD/H-box helicases, including the RLR MDA5, have been shown to use ATP binding and hydrolysis to promote dissociation from a bound ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berke and Modis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berke et al., 2012</xref>). Given the inability of RIG-I to signal on internal RNA duplexes, we hypothesized that this protein might also use ATPase activity to induce RNA dissociation in order to discriminate between optimal and non-productive RNA binding sites. A mechanism for differentiating target viral RNAs from diverse host RNAs would prevent undesirable induction of antiviral signaling and inflammation by endogenous RNA molecules. To investigate how ATP binding and hydrolysis affect RNA binding, we used fluorescence anisotropy to monitor RIG-I binding to a FAM-labeled 10-mer RNA hairpin alone or when bound to various nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined in the presence of ADP, as well as the analogs ATPγS and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>, which act as mimetics of ATP and the transition state of catalytic hydrolysis respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that ATPγS recapitulates interactions formed between RIG-I and ATP, we also determined RNA binding constants for Walker A mutants in the presence of ATP.

We therefore conclude that one role of ATP binding is to challenge the RIG-I interaction with RNA and to promote dissociation. This activity may suppress RIG-I signaling from low affinity RNA binding sites, such as internal duplexes or non-triphosphorylated ends, liberating RIG-I to search for appropriate viral RNA targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nucleotide-induced RNA dissociation is linked to the CARDs</title><p>As a first step in establishing a physical mechanism for nucleotide-induced RNA dissociation, we examined whether the CARDs are important for this behavior.

We therefore hypothesized that nucleotide binding and subsequent dissociation from RNA may be related to the antagonism between the CARDs and the HEL/CTD domains.

We show that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, represents the minimal requirement for RIG-I signaling. Further, we demonstrate that RIG-I cannot signal from a purely internal binding site, and that when RIG-I is bound to an internal duplex, ATP binding and hydrolysis promote dissociation from the RNA. Based on these results, we present a unified mechanism for ATP- dependent signaling and proof-reading by RIG-I.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ATP binding, not hydrolysis, is required for signaling</title><p>To investigate the requirement for ATPase activity in RIG-I signaling, we produced RIG-I constructs with mutations at the key lysine residue of the highly conserved helicase motif I (Walker A motif). In RIG-I, this residue (K270) forms hydrogen bonds with the β and γ phosphates of ATP, and helps coordinate the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion required for chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2012b</xref>). Hence, mutation of this residue is expected to significantly weaken ATP binding and abrogate hydrolysis. As expected, RIG-I K270 mutants exhibit no ATP hydrolysis activity. Yet surprisingly, the K270 mutants retain the ability to bind ATP and to engage immune signaling when challenged by an optimized RNA ligand, 5′ppp10L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>). Just as strikingly, the K270 mutants fail to bind ATP and they fail to induce signaling when bound to longer, suboptimal RNA ligands. Taken together, these data establish that ATP binding plays a critical role in the induction of signaling, and that ATP binding is controlled through simultaneous interactions between RIG-I and its RNA ligands, thereby providing a two-tier system for highly specific response to viral RNA.</p><p>Although the activity of RIG-I K270R/5′ppp10L complexes provided a useful tool for showing that ATP binding, rather than hydrolysis, is strictly required for signaling, it raises the question of why 5′ppp10L is so special. Why does this short, high-affinity triphosphorylated RNA ligand uniquely activate the RIG-I protein, and what is the significance of this observation? To answer this question, it is instructive to refer to the published literature on crystal structures of RIG-I complexes with RNA and ATP ligands. It has been reported that ATPase activity of wild type RIG-I is optimally activated by short RNA ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that these RNAs help ‘prime’ the protein for interactions with ATP. Many important ATP binding interfaces, such as the Q motif and motif VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordin et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2012a</xref>), are not perturbed by the K270 mutation, and therefore a strong ATP binding cleft can still be formed if it is reinforced by additional interactions with short RNA ligands. It is likely that the optimized 5′ppp10L ligand compensates for the deficiencies caused by removing lysine 270, pre-organizing the active site for binding to ATP. Intriguingly, many viral genomes are predicted to form short duplex panhandle structures with mismatches, bulges, and loops near the duplex terminus, thereby mimicking the conformational constraints imposed by 5′ppp10L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Structural data on human and duck RIG-I support a model in which interactions between RNA-bound RIG-I and an ATP molecule can lead to CARDs expulsion and subsequent signaling.

It is clear that both of these features allow RIG-I to distinguish between pathogenic RNAs and potential host targets, such as capped RNA, single stranded RNAs, miRNA, or other processed RNAs in which the 5′ triphosphate moiety has been removed. However, the biophysical basis for this discrimination is not clearly understood. Analysis of our functional data and available crystallographic information also explain why RIG-I requires a blunt RNA duplex terminus for signaling. A RIG-I signaling model that involves ATP-mediated domain compaction depends upon a steric collision between the CARDs and the RNA-bound CTD in order to promote CARD expulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Left). Disrupting the CTD:RNA interface is expected to disrupt signaling by preventing this steric clash, and preventing CARD release. The tight binding affinity between the CTD and optimized RNA ligands derives from a complex network of specific interactions with the 5′ triphosphate moiety and stacking interactions with the terminal base pair of an RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2012b</xref>). By contrast, the CTD of RIG-I molecules bound at internal sites is effectively disengaged, and it is likely that all interactions between RIG-I and internal sites occur exclusively through contacts involving the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vela et al., 2012</xref>). In such cases, the CTD will not provide a hard barrier for colliding with the CARDS, and these will fail to disengage upon ATP binding and domain compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Right). We tested this model by creating the dumbbell ligand as a model for internal binding by RIG-I, and we observed that wild type RIG-I binds internal duplexes much more weakly than duplex termini. Importantly, RIG-I binds the dumbbell RNA with similar affinity as the isolated helicase domain binds to optimal, terminal duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vela et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with the fact that the CTD is disengaged when RIG-I binds internal sites. Nonetheless, the dumbbell ligand stimulates robust ATPase activity by wild-type RIG-I, indicating that the protein is capable of both binding and hydrolyzing ATP at internal duplexes, but it is incapable of signaling. While the ATP hydrolysis activity is likely to serve an important function (vide infra), the failure of this ligand to induce signaling is consistent with a compaction and collision model that requires a tightly anchored CTD. We therefore conclude that at internal sites, RIG-I binds and hydrolyzes ATP, but the signaling domains remain in their auto-repressed conformation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09391.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>RIG-I uses ATP-mediated compaction as signaling trigger and a proofreading mechanism.</title><p>RIG-I surveys the cytoplasm in an auto-repressed conformation, with the signaling CARDs (black) sequestered through an interaction with the HEL2i domain (cyan).

ATP binding causes the domains of RIG-I to compact, bringing the CARDs into a steric collision with the CTD (orange). If the CTD is engaged in a high-affinity interaction with a triphosphorylated duplex terminus (as in viral RNA), this collision disengages the CARDS from the HEL2i domain, making them available for immune signaling (left).

Such a scenario could conceivably occur at very high concentrations of RIG-I. The proposed ‘priming’ behavior observed for the 5′ppp10L hairpin could potentially be recapitulated by tightly stacking additional copies of the protein against one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby mimicking conformational constraints imposed by the short RNA and enhancing the signaling efficiency of the end-bound RIG-I. For example, we observe a significant and reproducible jump in RIG-I signaling activity when challenged by a 5′ppp50L hairpin compared to the 5′ppp30L hairpin. Even in this case, the requirement for CTD end-capping and the extremely weak affinity for internal duplex sites underscore the importance of an available duplex terminus for activating RIG-I signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RIG-I uses ATP to recycle from non-productive RNAs</title><p>Experiments performed using the dumbbell RNA demonstrate the importance of end binding in RIG-I activation, but they also show that RIG-I is capable of binding to sub-optimal duplexes, and that these RNA molecules stimulate non-productive ATPase activity. To deal with this issue, RIG-I has evolved a strategy for ‘rejecting’ non-pathogenic ligands by dissociating rapidly from these RNAs. RIG-I bound to ATP exhibits reduced equilibrium binding affinity for RNA, and rapid RNA dissociation. Furthermore, the observed enhancement in RNA dissociation kinetics is dependent on the CARDs of RIG-I, which suggests that a collision between the CARDs and the CTD further destabilizes RNA binding by RIG-I. Intriguingly, enhanced dissociation kinetics are observed for all RNAs tested, including those containing a 5′ triphosphorylated duplex terminus. Therefore, ATP-mediated turnover is not specific for a particular RNA ligand. Rather, it challenges and tests the RIG-I:RNA interaction for all ligands, and results in CARDs expulsion only when the CTD is rigidly constrained by high-affinity binding to the terminus of triphosphorylated viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Using the energy from ATP hydrolysis as a recycling and proof-reading mechanism has been previously demonstrated for RNA helicases belonging to the DEAD-box family of proteins, which is the helicase subgroup that is phylogenetically most closely related to RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jankowsky and Fairman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jankowsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2012a</xref>).

The model presented here mirrors these findings; in both RIG-I and DEAD-box proteins, ATP binding is required for a particular mechanical activity, while ATP hydrolysis is only required to ‘reset’ the protein, enabling it to search for another target or to engage in another round of activation. Thus, ATP binding represents the deterministic step in RIG-I activation, while hydrolysis helps the protein to efficiently sample potential RNA ligands, and reject those that cannot activate immune signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>RIG-I integrates RNA and ATP binding to function as an advanced biosensor</title><p>RIG-I integrates the input of ATP and RNA binding to select viral RNA over endogenous RNA, and subsequently initiate signaling.

The high cellular concentrations of these RNAs means RIG-I will bind at these sites despite its relatively weak affinity for RNA that is not triphosphorylated. Importantly, RIG-I can bind these RNAs without activating signaling, due to the proofreading mechanism imparted by ATP hydrolysis. Thus, RIG-I is thus able to differentiate between non-pathogenic RNAs and viral RNAs using a finely tuned proofreading mechanism that is essential for preventing aberrant immune responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA hairpin preparation</title><p>Oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on an automated MerMade synthesizer (BioAutomation, Irving, TX, United States) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry.

Major questions remain in relation to how RIG-I distinguishes endogenous RNA from viral RNA. In this manuscript, Rawling et al. investigated the importance of ATP binding step in RIG-I activation, using biochemical and cell-based approaches. They examine RNA binding, ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and IFN-β activation by RIG-I and the ATPase deficient mutant (K270A/R) upon stimulation by several RNA substrates under different ATP and ATP analog conditions. The authors have found that ATP binding is sufficient to initiate a signaling response in the presence of an optimal RNA ligand. They provide a biochemical mechanism whereby RIG-I can distinguish between self and non-self RNA, and utilize ATP hydrolysis to rapidly recycle itself, thereby enabling RIG-I to sample the RNA milieu rapidly. By using a variety of substrates and ATP analogs the authors determined that RIG-I utilizes ATP hydrolysis to further distinguish between innate RNA and pathogenic RNA. ATP hydrolysis assists in turning over RIG-I when bound to endogenous RNA by stimulating RNA dissociation. This manuscript contains interesting and important observations in the detailed mechanism of RIG-I activation especially ATP binding and exposure of CARDs.</p><p>Overall, the data presentation and writing are extremely clear and logical. The paper presents a detailed biochemical view that nicely complements previous structural work and their cell-based assay provides an excellent platform to test and confirm the biochemical findings. In general, the manuscript is well-written and the data are presented clearly. However, several concerns and points of clarification are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Points of clarification (most do not require further experimentation, and it may be that the authors already have the data that address these questions and comments):</p><p>1) Given the important focus of this work on ATP binding vs. ATP hydrolysis, it is surprising that the normal ligand, ATP, was not tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>/<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Consequently, to understand and verify the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis on the release of RNA ligand from RIG-I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, authentic ATP needs be examined in addition to ATP analogues.</p><p>2) Many previous studies have revealed the importance of ATPase activity for RIG-I signaling. The authors explain how 5'ppp10L acts as an exceptional RNA ligand, acting in an ATP hydrolysis-independent manner. Then, an important question is whether virus-induced RIG-I activation in general, requires hydrolysis or just ATP binding. 5'ppp50L induced a much higher IFN production compared to 5'ppp10L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), showing that the internal duplex RNA is important for signaling. The authors need to further address and explain this issue, especially given that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the affinity of WT protein for ATP paradoxically decreases with RNA length.</p><p>3) The authors use ATPγS and ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> as analogs for ATP. However, it is never established in the manuscript that these are indeed acting as ATP analogs and not, as can often be the case, ADP analogs. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> (“Equilibrium RNA Binding”), the behavior of ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub> is identical to that of ADP, and the behavior of ATPγS is less than 2-fold different. The analogs are used to make many of the conclusions regarding the regulatory mechanism, yet they seem to behave like ATP. The authors need to establish that these analog indeed mimic ATP and not ADP. Perhaps this has already been established in the literature. If not, then this could be addressed by competition experiments (e.g., ATPase activity), by the stopped-flow experiments (e.g., as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> or 4), or by RNA affinity measurements using the ATPase-dead mutant protein and 5'ppp10L.</p><p>4) The experiments establishing ATP binding use MANT-ATP and MANT-ADP. These results with these fluorescent analogs are not adequately documented. Is MANT-ATP a normal substrate for ATP hydrolysis? The <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for at least one RNA activator should be measured and reported.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that RNA ligands with 5'ppp induce a conformational change resulting in CARD exposure, while host cell RNA or internal duplex regions of RNA dissociate RIG-I without exposure of CARD even inducing ATPase activity. The manuscript would be improved if the authors showed the published structure of RIG-I in an additional figure with one or more panels. The structure could be used to point out sites of steric clash between the CARD domain and the CTD domain upon binding to RNA, and help guide the reader through the detailed structural descriptions in the Discussion.</p><p>In addition to these essential points, the editors feel that the manuscript could be made more accessible to the general reader by doing the following:</p><p>1) Provide an introductory schematic diagram and brief explanation showing the RIG1 cycle. As written, the logic of the paper is difficult for a general reader to follow without first reading a review.</p><p>2) In the beginning of the Discussion, provide a brief summary of the expected chemical differences between pathogenic RNA and normal cellular RNA.</p><p>Other points to address in preparing the revised manuscript:</p><p>A) Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, none of the stopped flow data are shown. Also, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> report relative affinities that have been normalized, but the values to which they have been normalized are not provided (relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>?). Consequently, the authors need to show an example of the stopped-flow data, the (linear), concentration dependence of MANT-ATP biding, and the results of the fits (values for <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for each of the bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) – this could go into supplementary information. Finally, MANT-ADP is mentioned in the Methods, but it does not appear to have been used in the manuscript; if not, then delete or clarify.</p><p>B) The number of significant figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Table 1 and 2</xref> are unjustifiably too high. In typical biochemical experiments, precision is unlikely to exceed 3 significant figures. For example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, the first entry for <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is reported as 14.08 +/- 0.37, when it is unlikely to be so precise (and not supported by the S.D.), and a value of 14.1 +/- 0.4 is a more realistic representation of the precision. The comment applies to all of the values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Table 1 and 2</xref> (a particularly egregious example is the binding constant reported as 41.68 +/- 11.16; this number is no better than 41.7 +/- 11, and perhaps 42 +/- 11 is a more realistic value): unless the authors can demonstrate a higher precision, all of the reported values should be reduced to no more than 3 significant figures. Also, the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for the CARDs lacks SDs, and need to be added.</p><p>C) The quality of the RNAs, especially dumbbell RNA, used in this study should be shown.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Establishing the role of ATP for the function of the RIG-I innate immune sensor” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

But all nonetheless felt it was critically important to include such experiments with authentic ATP where feasible. Old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (now 5) shows equilibrium binding data for two ATP-hydrolysis defective mutants in panels A and C (K270A and K270R); equilibrium data with ATP can unquestionably be obtained for these two mutant proteins, and the interpretation of those binding data will not be encumbered with the complexities of steady-state ATP hydrolysis. In addition, the kinetic experiments in panels B and D can be performed with both WT and mutant protein. The detailed kinetic analysis of the rates and amplitudes for WT protein can be deferred to another paper, but the observed behavior is important to report, relative to the analogs. Again, however, the interpretation of the kinetic behavior of the ATP-hydrolysis defective mutants should be straightforward, given the model and the nil turnover relative to the dissociation time; consequently these results also need to be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09391.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Points of clarification (most do not require further experimentation, and it may be that the authors already have the data that address these questions and comments):</italic></p><p><italic>1) Given the important focus of this work on ATP binding vs. ATP hydrolysis, it is surprising that the normal ligand, ATP, was not tested in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>/</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>. Consequently, to understand and verify the roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis on the release of RNA ligand from RIG-I in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, authentic ATP needs be examined in addition to ATP analogues.</italic></p><p>We agree that it would be ideal to monitor RNA dissociation rate and equilibrium constants in the presence of ATP, however the lability of ATP makes such measurements impossible. A significant amount of ATP would be hydrolyzed over the time scale of the experiment (up to 10 minutes in the kinetic assays, and longer in the case of equilibrium measurements), meaning that any measured dissociation would reflect RIG-I in ATP, ADP+Pi, and ADP bound states. As we cannot accurately determine the proportions of these states, we cannot quantitate a rate constant for ATP-bound RIG-I, and instead would be reporting on rate and equilibrium constants for a heterogeneous mixture of nucleotide-bound RIG-I molecules.</p><p><italic>2) Many previous studies have revealed the importance of ATPase activity for RIG-I signaling. The authors explain how 5'ppp10L acts as an exceptional RNA ligand, acting in an ATP hydrolysis-independent manner. Then, an important question is whether virus-induced RIG-I activation in general, requires hydrolysis or just ATP binding. 5'ppp50L induced a much higher IFN production compared to 5'ppp10L (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>), showing that the internal duplex RNA is important for signaling. The authors need to further address and explain this issue, especially given that in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>, the affinity of WT protein for ATP paradoxically decreases with RNA length.</italic></p><p>Thank you for your comment. It is important to note that, irrespective of any findings involving 5’ppp50L, our manuscript provides sufficient mutational evidence that ATP binding rather than hydrolysis is required for signaling in the biological context. Using the K270A mutant, we show that hydrolysis is dispensable for RIG-I activation, meaning that the physical transition from an autorepressed state to an activated, signaling competent state does not depend on the ability of the protein to hydrolyze ATP.</p><p>Regarding the signaling activity of 5’ppp50L, we would respectfully disagree that 5’ppp50L supports “much higher IFN production” than 5’ppp10L. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, it is only two-fold higher (46 vs. 23 units), and with another long ligand (5’ppp30L) IFN production is actually lower (16 units) than 5’ppp10L. Thus we are not consistently seeing better signaling from longer ligands, and while the effect of 5’ppp50L is significant and reproducible, it would not be considered a major effect. However, to address the basis for the higher observed signaling on 5’ppp50L, we would reference previous reports from the Hur and Garcia-Sastre labs, which have shown that the RIG-I protein is capable of forming multimers on longer RNA ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peisley et al., 2013</xref>). Given the small effect we are reporting here, we attribute the higher levels of IFN production induced by a sufficiently long RNA (in this case 5’ppp50L) to local concentration effects that are caused by multimerization of RIG-I on a single RNA ligand (new data shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, it has been claimed that 4 copies of the RIG-I CARDs protein must form specific intermolecular tetramers in order to nucleate immune signaling through the MAVS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peisley et al., 2014</xref>), however we only observe a 3:1 complex between RIG-I and 5’ppp50L, suggesting that enhanced signaling induced by this ligand cannot be attributed to a tetrameric complex formation on a single RNA. We also show that an individual RIG-I molecule bound at an internal site is incapable of inducing an immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, while we appreciate your point, we respectfully disagree that internal duplex RNA is important for signaling. Instead, we would argue that internal sites may facilitate <italic>enhanced</italic> signaling by RIG-I under conditions of high protein concentration, and it is unlikely that these sites are required or important for signaling in a biological context.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use ATPγS and ADP-AlF</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> <italic>as analogs for ATP. However, it is never established in the manuscript that these are indeed acting as ATP analogs and not, as can often be the case, ADP analogs. In</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>(“Equilibrium RNA Binding”), the behavior of ADP-AlF</italic><sub><italic>4</italic></sub> <italic>is identical to that of ADP, and the behavior of ATPγS is less than 2-fold different. The analogs are used to make many of the conclusions regarding the regulatory mechanism, yet they seem to behave like ATP. The authors need to establish that these analog indeed mimic ATP and not ADP. Perhaps this has already been established in the literature. If not, then this could be addressed by competition experiments (e.g., ATPase activity), by the stopped-flow experiments (e.g., as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>or 4), or by RNA affinity measurements using the ATPase-dead mutant protein and 5'ppp10L.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this point and for the suggested experiments. There is existing data indicating that the ATP analogs differ in several key ways from ADP, but the competition experiment remains a good idea (see below). For example, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) demonstrate that ATPγS behaves reproducibly differently than ADP and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>. In addition, we would draw the reviewer’s attention to the published structural data from Stephen Cusack’s group in which RIG-I was crystallized bound to RNA and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub> in a conformation distinct from that observed in structures where the protein was crystallized with RNA and ADP, as published by both of our labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; Luo et al., 2012).</p><p>To compare the binding of the ATP analogs with ADP, we performed competition experiments in which the ATP hydrolysis activity of RIG-I was evaluated in the presence of ATP and each of the nucleotide analogs that were used in this study (new data shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, ADP, ATPγS, ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>, and AMPPNP all compete effectively with ATP for binding the RIG-I active site, resulting in diminished rate constants of ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, we observe that ADP most strongly inhibits RIG-I ATPase activity, while ATPγS and AMPPNP inhibit activity more weakly and to similar levels, and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub> exhibits the weakest degree of inhibition. This is once again consistent with a scenario in which all analogs bind at the RIG-I active site, and behave distinctly from ADP. The behavior of ADP in this system is inherently interesting, and experiments on that topic are the subject of another paper that we are presently working on.</p><p><italic>4) The experiments establishing ATP binding use MANT-ATP and MANT-ADP. These results with these fluorescent analogs are not adequately documented. Is MANT-ATP a normal substrate for ATP hydrolysis? The</italic> K<sub><italic>M</italic></sub> <italic>and</italic> k<sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> <italic>for at least one RNA activator should be measured and reported.</italic></p><p>To demonstrate that MANT-ATP acts as a functional substrate for RIG-I, we measured the ability of RIG-I bound to 5’ppp10L to stimulate hydrolysis of MANT-ATP as a function of MANT-ATP concentration (new data shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1G</xref>). We observed MANT-ATP hydrolysis with a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 3.9 ± 0.2 s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m,MANT-ATP</sub> =115 ± 25 μM. Importantly, RIG-I exhibits a similar Michaelis constant for MANT-ATP and ATP, indicating that the protein binds both substrates with similar affinity, making MANT-ATP a good mimetic of ATP binding. However, the lower <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> determined for MANT-ATP suggests that addition of the fluorescent moiety impedes hydrolysis. This phenomenon works in our favor, as it means that vanishingly little MANT-ATP will be hydrolyzed over the time-scale of our experiments, ensuring that we are measuring binding of an ATP and not an ADP mimetic.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>shows that RNA ligands with 5'ppp induce a conformational change resulting in CARD exposure, while host cell RNA or internal duplex regions of RNA dissociate RIG-I without exposure of CARD even inducing ATPase activity. The manuscript would be improved if the authors showed the published structure of RIG-I in an additional figure with one or more panels. The structure could be used to point out sites of steric clash between the CARD domain and the CTD domain upon binding to RNA, and help guide the reader through the detailed structural descriptions in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>We have added a structure-based diagram as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to help clarify the process of RIG-I compaction and CARDs/CTD collision that we propose promotes signal activation or dissociation.</p><p><italic>In addition to these essential points, the editors feel that the manuscript could be made more accessible to the general reader by doing the following:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Provide an introductory schematic diagram and brief explanation showing the RIG1 cycle.

Consequently, the authors need to show an example of the stopped-flow data, the (linear), concentration dependence of MANT-ATP biding, and the results of the fits (values for</italic> k<sub><italic>on</italic></sub><italic>,</italic> k<sub><italic>off</italic></sub><italic>, and</italic> K<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> <italic>for each of the bars in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref><italic>) – this could go into supplementary information.

We have also produced a supplemental figure showing representative traces of MANT-ATP association for each construct where binding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).

In typical biochemical experiments, precision is unlikely to exceed 3 significant figures. For example in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>, the first entry for kcat is reported as 14.08 +/- 0.37, when it is unlikely to be so precise (and not supported by the S.D.), and a value of 14.1 +/- 0.4 is a more realistic representation of the precision. The comment applies to all of the values in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2"><italic>Table 1 and 2</italic></xref> <italic>(a particularly egregious example is the binding constant reported as 41.68 +/- 11.16; this number is no better than 41.7 +/- 11, and perhaps 42 +/- 11 is a more realistic value): unless the authors can demonstrate a higher precision, all of the reported values should be reduced to no more than 3 significant figures. Also, the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref> <italic>for the ΔCARDs lacks SDs, and need to be added.</italic></p><p>Thank you for noticing this issue and bringing it to our attention.
