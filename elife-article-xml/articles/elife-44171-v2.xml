This antiviral mechanism is conserved in virtually all cell types, except for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and oocytes which are intrinsically incapable of producing IFNs. Despite the importance of the IFN response to fight viral infections, the mechanisms regulating this pathway during pluripotency are still unknown. Here we show that, in the absence of miRNAs, ESCs acquire an active IFN response. Proteomic analysis identified MAVS, a central component of the IFN pathway, to be actively silenced by miRNAs and responsible for suppressing IFN expression in ESCs. Furthermore, we show that knocking out a single miRNA, miR-673, restores the antiviral response in ESCs through MAVS regulation. Our findings suggest that the interaction between miR-673 and MAVS acts as a switch to suppress the antiviral IFN during pluripotency and present genetic approaches to enhance their antiviral immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44171.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells are under constant attack from disease-causing agents, such as viruses and bacteria. As a result, they have evolved various protective mechanisms to fight off these agents. One of the most important ways that an animal cell protects itself from infection is through the interferon response, which warns the cell of approaching viruses, prompting it to prepare to defend itself. Virtually all healthy cells have an active interferon response, except for stem cells, which have switched off this defensive mechanism, for unknown reasons. This makes stem cells more susceptible to infections.</p><p>Stem cells are specialized cells that play an essential role in developing the early embryo. The two defining characteristics of these cells – their ability to divide indefinitely, and develop into all cell types – offers great therapeutic potential, as they can be used to ‘replace’ damaged cells and tissues. However, without an interferon response, stem cells are likely to become infected when moved into a new environment, counteracting their therapeutic benefits. Now, Witteveldt et al. investigate how stem cells turn off this viral defence mechanism, and whether turning it back on will affect their ability to divide and form new tissues.</p><p>Using stem cells taken from the embryos of mice, Witteveldt et al. found that the interferon response is turned off by specific small molecules of RNA. These small RNA molecules block a protein in the pathway that recognizes viruses and activates a defence. Genetically engineering stem cells to be deficient in these small RNA molecules led to an increased resistance to viral infections. Importantly, modifying stem cells in this manner had no obvious impact on the characteristic traits that give stem cells their therapeutic potential.</p><p>Temporarily increasing the interferon response of stem cells as they are moved into a new environment could potentially make stem cell treatments more effective. However, more work is needed to investigate whether the same approach can be applied to human cells, and determine what negative effects may be associated with turning on the interferon response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>microprocessor</kwd><kwd>dicer</kwd><kwd>mavs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107665/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macias</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MiRNA-mediated suppression of MAVS expression in embryonic stem cells is necessary to inactivate the type I interferon response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type I interferons (IFN) are crucial cytokines of the innate antiviral response. Although showing great variation, most mammalian cell types are capable of synthesizing type I IFNs in response to invading viruses and other pathogens. Once type I IFNs are secreted, they activate the JAK-STAT pathway and production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both the infected and neighbouring cells to induce an antiviral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2015</xref>). Two major signalling pathways are involved in IFN production in the context of viral infections. The dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 initiate a signalling cascade that signals through the central mitochondrial-associated factor MAVS, ultimately activating <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcription. The cGAS/STING pathway is activated upon detection of viral or other foreign DNA molecules and uses a distinct signalling pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum associated STING protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and Gack, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite its crucial function in fighting pathogens, pluripotent mammalian cells do not exhibit an IFN response. Both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) as well as embryonic carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 1978</xref>) fail to produce IFNs, suggesting that this function is acquired during differentiation. The rationale for silencing this response is not fully understood but it has been proposed that in their natural setting, ESCs are protected from viral infections by the trophoblast, which forms the outer layer of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delorme-Axford et al., 2014</xref>). ESCs exhibit a mild response to exogenous IFNs, suggesting that during embryonic development, maternal IFN could have protective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong and Carmichael, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In mouse ESCs, a Dicer-dependent RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism, reminiscent to that of plants and insects, is suggested to function as an alternative antiviral mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). And in humans, ESCs intrinsically express high levels of a subgroup of ISGs in the absence of infection, bypassing the need for an antiviral IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). All these suggest that different antiviral pathways are employed depending on the differentiation status of the cell. Silencing of the IFN response during pluripotency may also be essential to avoid aberrant IFN production in response to retrotransposons and endogenous retroviral derived dsRNA, which are highly expressed during the early stages of embryonic development and oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peaston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, exposing cells to exogenous IFN induces differentiation and an anti-proliferative state, which would have catastrophic consequences during very early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertzog et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>All these observations support a model in which cells gain the ability to produce IFNs during differentiation. One particular class of regulatory factors that are essential for the successful differentiation of ESCs are miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greve et al., 2013</xref>). These type of small RNAs originate from long precursor RNA molecules, which undergo two consecutive processing steps, one in the nucleus by the Microprocessor complex, followed by a DICER-mediated processing in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Treiber et al., 2018</xref>). The Microprocessor complex is composed of the dsRNA binding protein DGCR8 and the RNase III DROSHA which are both essential for mature miRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregory et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, mammalian DICER is also essential for production of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2001</xref>). The genetic ablation of <italic>Dgcr8</italic> or <italic>Dicer</italic> in mice blocks ESCs differentiation suggesting that miRNAs are an essential factor for this, as these are the common substrates for the two RNA processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanellopoulou et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that miRNAs are responsible for suppressing the IFN response during pluripotency, specifically to immunostimulatory RNAs. We found that miRNA-deficient ESCs acquire an IFN-proficient state, are able to synthesize IFN-β and mount a functional antiviral response. Our results show that miRNAs specifically downregulate MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein), an essential and central protein in the IFN response pathway. In agreement, ESCs with increased MAVS expression or knock-out of the MAVS-regulating miRNA miR-673, resulted in an increased IFN production and antiviral response. Our results support a model where the MAVS-miR-673 interaction acts as a switch to suppress the IFN response and consequently virus susceptibility during pluripotency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ESCs fail to express IFN-β in response to viral DNA/RNA</title><p>There are two major pathways for sensing intracellular viral infections and consequent activation of the IFN response in cells. One senses dsRNA, usually originating from RNA viruses, with MAVS as a central factor, and the second senses dsDNA, from DNA- and retroviruses signalling through STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McFadden et al., 2017</xref>). It has been shown that mouse ESCs do not produce type I IFNs in response to poly(I:C) transfection, a synthetic analogue of dsRNA classically used to mimic viral RNA replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, it is still unknown how mouse ESCs respond to immunostimulatory DNA. To study this, two different mouse ESC cell lines (ESC1 and ESC2) were transfected with poly(I:C) and G<sub>3</sub>-YSD, an HIV-derived DNA that stimulates the cGAS/STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herzner et al., 2015</xref>). As controls, NIH3T3 fibroblasts and BV-2 microglial cells were included. As expected, the transfection of poly(I:C) did not result in <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression in both ESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ESCs also failed to activate <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression upon G<sub>3</sub>-YSD transfection, suggesting that the cGAS/STING pathway was also inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, NIH3T3 cells, which have also been previously shown to have a defect in this specific pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), did not express <italic>Ifnb1</italic> in response to G<sub>3</sub>-YSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To further establish the involvement of IFN expression in these observations, we blocked IFN signalling using the JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib before infecting cells with TMEV. As a result we observed no, or a very mild increase in TMEV viral replication in wild-type ESCs, but a significant increase in viral replication in miRNA-deficient ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). ESCs were also stimulated with exogenous IFN-β and confirmed that mouse ESCs retain the ability to respond to external IFNs, and, importantly, that miRNA deficiency did not alter ISG expression levels, supporting the hypothesis that the miRNA-mediated silencing of the IFN pathway in ESCs occurs upstream of IFN production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To verify that the observed results are solely due to the absence of miRNAs, we rescued the knock-out cell lines by reintroducing Dgcr8 and Dicer and observed that these reverted to wild-type viral replication and susceptibility levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

Both mouse and human stem cells fail to synthesize IFNs in response to dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), implying that this characteristic is acquired during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Angelo et al., 2016</xref>). Embryonic carcinoma cells, which are still pluripotent, also fail to produce IFNs in response to viral RNA mimics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 1978</xref>). In agreement, reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) leads to a loss of IFN response, suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms able to switch this antiviral pathway on or off between the differentiated and pluripotent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Another feature of pluripotent cells is their attenuated response to exogenous type I IFNs. Mammalian pluripotent stem cells, iPSCs and embryonic carcinoma cells exhibit an attenuated production of ISGs upon type I IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong and Carmichael, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irudayam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 1978</xref>). Why these activities are supressed is still not understood, but it has been hypothesized that type I IFN stimulation could impair their self-renewal capacity, since these compounds are well-known antiproliferative agents and inducers of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekisz et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, type I IFNs are capable of inhibiting tumour cell division <italic>in vitro</italic> and are currently employed as an adjuvant to treat several types of cancers, acting as stimulants of the innate immune cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mouse ESCs express low levels of the RNA sensors TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I, which could explain their inability to respond to dsRNA although no functional studies support this model so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Our data shows an alternative scenario in which MAVS is the key factor for controlling the IFN response. The overexpression of a miRNA-resistant form of MAVS in wild-type ESCs is enough to enable dsRNA-mediated IFN activation, suggesting that dsRNA sensing is not a limiting step in the IFN pathway in ESCs. Regulation of MAVS alone proves to be an efficient mechanism to block dsRNA induced IFN expression compared to suppressing individual dsRNA sensors.</p><p>The observation that miRNAs only suppress RNA-mediated IFN activation, but not the DNA-mediated pathway, leads us to speculate about the reasons for silencing this specific response during pluripotency. Embryonic stem cells, and also earlier stages of embryonic development are characterized by high expression levels of specific retrotransposons (non-LTR) and endogenous retroviruses (LTR), which are a hallmark of their pluripotent state. This is in contrast to most somatic cell types that silence their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). These repetitive elements produce cytoplasmic RNA molecules as an intermediate for mobilisation, which can be accidentally recognised as immunogenic or non-self RNAs, as it has been previously shown for the human non-LTR retroelement Alu in the context of Aicardi-Goutires syndrome or for endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, silencing the RNA-mediated IFN response during pluripotency would act as a protective mechanism for aberrant IFN activation by transposon-derived transcripts.</p><p>Cells that are incapable of activating the RNA-mediated IFN response have developed alternative antiviral defence pathways. The endonuclease DICER can act as an antiviral factor in mouse ESCs by generating antiviral siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). Detection of antiviral DICER activity is facilitated in the absence of a competent IFN response, such as in the case of pluripotent cells, but also in somatic cells where the type I IFN response has been genetically impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maillard et al., 2016</xref>). These findings are supported by the observation that in IFN-competent cells, the RNA sensor LGP2 acts as an inhibitor of DICER cleavage activity on dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Veen et al., 2018</xref>). However, DICER activity has also been reported in other cell lines, independently of their IFN-proficiency capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, when we disrupt <italic>Dicer</italic> in ESCs, which inherently lack an IFN response and would theoretically render these cells highly sensitive to viral infections, they become more resistant by acquiring an active IFN response. All these results support the presence of extensive cross-talk between the different antiviral strategies, and suggests that cells have developed mechanisms to compensate for the loss of a specific antiviral pathway.</p><p>Our model shows that MAVS and miR-673 levels are the key factors regulating the IFN response to dsRNAs during pluripotency. Accordingly, overexpressing MAVS or knocking-out this single miRNA in ESCs is enough to enhance their antiviral response. Interestingly, this miRNA is only conserved in rodents, despite human ESCs also suppressing type I IFNs expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong and Carmichael, 2013</xref>). This suggests that either other miRNAs regulate MAVS expression in human ESCs, or alternative mechanisms operate to silence IFN. Interestingly, human and mouse ESCs have been suggested to constitutively express a subset of ISGs to protect them from viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Our proteomics data suggest that, from all the ISGs detected, miRNAs did not significantly affect production of these antiviral factors, such as IFITM1, IFTIM2, IFITM3 amongst others. We have shown that engineering ESCs to acquire a functional IFN response significantly increases their antiviral immunity, highlighting the powerful antiviral effects of IFNs even during pluripotency.</p><p>Previous findings also support a general role for DICER and miRNAs acting as negative regulators of the IFN response in human and mouse models outside pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papadopoulou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Witteveldt et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement, an indirect approach to deplete cellular miRNAs, by overexpressing the viral protein VP55 from Vaccinia virus, showed that miRNAs are also relevant to control the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines during viral chronic infections, but not in the acute antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguado et al., 2015</xref>). However, the concept of miRNAs acting as direct antiviral factors is still controversial. It is relevant to mention that some of the results leading to this conclusion have been primarily generated in <italic>DICER1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HEK293T human cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogerd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>), which has an attenuated IFN response due to low PRRs expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Witteveldt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that overexpression of MAVS or silencing specific miRNAs in a transient or stable manner improves the antiviral response of ESCs. These findings are the basis to further study the conservation of the miRNA-mediated regulation of the IFN response in somatic cells and in the context of human pluripotency. All these investigations will provide a deeper understanding and tool set on how to enhance the innate immunity of ESCs and their differentiated progeny, an especially relevant aspect in clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p><italic>Dgcr8</italic> knockout (<italic>Dgcr8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse ESCs were purchased from Novus Biologicals (NBA1-19349) and the parental strain, v6.5 (<italic>Dgcr8<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, also named in the text ESC1) from ThermoFisher (MES1402). <italic>Dicer <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (<italic>Dicer<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, also named ESC2) and <italic>Dicer</italic> knockout (<italic>Dicer<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse ESCs were provided by R.

However, our experiments clearly demonstrate that manipulating a single miRNA, using multiple approaches (miR-673 mimics, antagomirs or miR-673 KO cell lines) (Figure 5) or, directly the MAVS expression levels (Figure 4) is enough to recapitulate the phenotype observed in the absence of all miRNAs. Furthermore, Mass spectrometry and Western blot data show that MAVS is the only significantly upregulated factor in the absence of miRNAs, out of all proteins involved in sensing and activating IFN expression upon dsRNA stimulation, and including all detected ISGs.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44171.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44171-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Factors marked with a red asterisk are those that do not display differential expression in the absence of miRNAs, as shown by Western blot analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).

Which transcript factors caused this epigenetic change (Oct4? nanog? etc.)? and through ESC differentiation, whether miR-673 expression was suppressed?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, miR-673 is expressed during pluripotency and it becomes silenced during differentiation (see new Figure 5G). Both ESCs lines used in this study were differentiated using retinoic acid, and miR-673 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR after 2 or 10 days of the differentiation protocol. Data shown in Figure 5G represents the average expression of miR-673-5p normalized to U6snRNA in both ESC lines. The mouse IFN-proficient cell line, NIH3T3, also silences miR-673 expression (Figure 5D). All these suggest that miR-673 expression and IFN-proficiency are incompatible.</p><p>We feel that studying the epigenetic regulation of miR-673 expression is beyond the scope of this manuscript, even though it is a very interesting aspect to follow-up. So far, there is no annotation for the promoter that drives expression of this miRNA, which challenges any approach to assess its epigenetic regulation. The miR-673 expression data during differentiation is included in new Figure 5G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) ESCs acquire IFN responses during differentiation. Does miR-673 have any activities on ESC colony formation, proliferation and differentiation, as miR-673 may regulated IFN response by regulating ESC differentiation indirectly, instead of directly on MAVS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this possibility. This is an aspect of miR-673 biology that we have already addressed. Transient reintroduction of miR-673 in miRNA-deficient ECSs does not significantly affect the relative expression of pluripotency markers <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Oct4</italic> (see left graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). More importantly, miR-673 knock-out cell lines also express similar levels of the pluripotency markers <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Oct-4</italic> in comparison to wild-type ESCs, whereas in mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) they are absent as expected (see right graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). These data suggest that differences in antiviral resistance upon miR-673 manipulation are not due to a spontaneous loss of pluripotency. We are currently measuring the proliferation capacity of the CRISPR cell lines (see point 5), in addition to providing pictures of these cultures to demonstrate their ability to form colonies and phenotypical similarities to the wild-type counterparts.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44171.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44171-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Genetic ablation of Dgcr8 or Dicer would influence many biological activities of ESCs, e.g. their differentiation.
