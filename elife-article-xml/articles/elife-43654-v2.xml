the promoter. In vitro, some GTFs are essential for transcription, whereas others are not required under certain conditions. PICs are stable in the absence of nucleotide triphosphates, and subsets of GTFs can form partial PICs. By depleting individual GTFs in yeast cells, we show that all GTFs are essential for TBP binding and transcription, suggesting that partial PICs do not exist at appreciable levels in vivo. Depletion of FACT, a histone chaperone that travels with elongating Pol II, strongly reduces PIC formation and transcription. In contrast, TBP-associated factors (TAFs) contribute to transcription of most genes, but TAF-independent transcription occurs at substantial levels, preferentially at promoters containing TATA elements. PICs are absent in cells deprived of uracil, and presumably UTP, suggesting that transcriptionally inactive PICs are removed from promoters in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>general transcription factors</kwd><kwd>preinitiation complex</kwd><kwd>TBP-associated factors (TAFs)</kwd><kwd>TATA-binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 30186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrenko</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004733</institution-id><institution>Universidade de Macau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MYRG2015-00186 FHS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Liguo</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004733</institution-id><institution>University of Macau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MYRG2016-00211-FHS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Liguo</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Koon Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The requirements for preinitiation complex formation/stability and transcription by RNA polymerase II in yeast cells are different from those in vitro, thereby altering the current view of basal transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) II requires assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC) composed of general transcription factors (GTFs) bound at the core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conaway and Conaway, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buratowski, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orphanides et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roeder, 1996</xref>). However, despite considerable work over the past three decades, it remains unclear which GTFs are absolutely required for PIC formation and Pol II transcription.</p><p>GTFs were defined originally as factors necessary and sufficient for ‘basal’ transcription from core promoters in vitro. However, such in vitro reactions varied with respect to the promoter used, the concentration and purity of GTFs, and the concentration and nature (e.g. supercoiled, circular, or linear) of the DNA template. Aside from Pol II itself, GTFs include the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Under some conditions, removal (to the extent possible) of any one factor from the complete reaction causes a drastic reduction in transcriptional activity. However, TFIIA is dispensable or only mildly stimulatory under other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokomori et al., 1994</xref>). TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH can be dispensable or only stimulatory for transcription from negatively-supercoiled templates, depending on the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodrich and Tjian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parvin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmers, 1994</xref>). TBP-independent transcription that requires only YY1, TFIIB, and Pol II has been observed on supercoiled templates with the YYI initiation element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Usheva and Shenk, 1994</xref>). In addition to the classically defined GTFs, TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in the TFIID complex and the Mediator complex are important or required for Pol II transcription in vitro, depending on the promoter and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tjian and Maniatis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takagi and Kornberg, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In vitro, the PIC is a stable entity that initiates transcription upon addition of nucleotide triphosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conaway and Conaway, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buratowski, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orphanides et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roeder, 1996</xref>). PIC assembly is initiated with the binding of TBP (or the TFIID complex) to the promoter, as none of the other factors can stably bind DNA on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>). GTFs can be sequentially added to give a series of stable, ‘partial PICs’ prior to assembly of a transcriptionally active PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>). Such partial PICs are highly informative on the nature of the interactions between GTFs and the promoter, and structures of functional PICs have now been determined at the atomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sainsbury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hantsche and Cramer, 2017</xref>). Functional PICs can vary with respect to the presence or absence of TAFs, Mediator, and TFIIA.</p><p>In vivo studies of the role of GTFs for PIC formation and transcription are incomplete. In addition, the requirement for every GTF to permit cell growth makes it impossible to completely eliminate GTF function/activity and to exclude the possibility of indirect effects. Depletion studies indicate that TBP, TFIIB, and Pol II are essential for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moqtaderi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2014</xref>), whereas TFIIA is important but not essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stargell et al., 2000</xref>). The kinase subunit of TFIIH (Kin28) is important for promoter escape and Mediator dissociation, but considerable transcription occurs upon its depletion or inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Depletion of the entire Mediator complex abolishes Pol II transcription, but Mediator sub-modules can support transcription, albeit at lower levels than the wild-type strain, and can inhibit promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>). Depletion of Taf1 has led to conflicting results. Most studies indicate a selective role at TATA-less promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moqtaderi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2002</xref>), whereas others suggest a general requirement for Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The relative occupancies of GTFs at promoters are consistent across all promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pokholok et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>), strongly suggesting that a structurally similar PIC mediates a given level of transcription. Mediator occupancy at core promoters is transient, due to Kin28-dependent dissociation, but it is strongly correlated with GTF occupancies upon Kin28 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, while Mediator stimulates PIC formation, it is not an obligate component of the PIC in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>TAF occupancy does not strictly correlate with GTF occupancy, providing strong evidence that transcription can be mediated by TAF-containing (i.e. TFIID) and TAF-lacking forms of transcriptionally active TBP, with the relative usage of these two forms depending on the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Depending on which TBP form predominates, promoters can be classified roughly as either 1) constitutive, TATA-lacking, and TFIID-dependent or 2) inducible, TATA-containing, TFIID-independent, and SAGA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Struhl, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Struhl, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Struhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iyer and Struhl, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moqtaderi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basehoar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huisinga and Pugh, 2004</xref>). A variety of other experiments strongly support the idea of functionally distinct forms of TBP. First, the TFIID form is specifically recruited by the Rap1-containing activator and associated NuA4 histone acetylase complex to promoters of ribosomal protein genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mencía et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uprety et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uprety et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, many other activators do not directly recruit TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>) but rather recruit the SAGA histone acetylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhaumik and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaumik et al., 2004</xref>). Second, TBP is preferentially retained at the TAF-containing vs TAF-lacking promoters upon thermal inactivation of TFIIB or Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Third, the relative use of TFIID- vs. SAGA-dependent mechanisms at a given promoter can differ depending on the environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferdoush et al., 2018</xref>). However, this view has been challenged by experiments claiming that the two classes of promoters behave similarly upon TFIID depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of GTF function in vivo by using the anchor-away technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) to individually deplete each GTF from the nucleus. We demonstrate that all classically defined GTFs are required for PIC formation/stability and Pol II transcription in vivo, suggesting that PICs contain all GTFs. In apparent contrast to some previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zanton and Pugh, 2006</xref>), our results suggest that partial PICs are unlikely to be stable in vivo. In contrast, while TAFs contribute to Pol II transcriptional activity at most (and perhaps all) genes, we provide direct evidence that TAF-independent transcription occurs at a substantial level. Lastly, we discover that PICs are not observed in cells depleted for uracil, suggesting a mechanism that removes transcriptionally inactive PICs from promoters. Our findings lead to a revised view of the preinitiation complex in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient and rapid depletion of GTFs in vivo</title><p>To systematically study the role of GTFs and Pol II on transcription, we constructed anchor-away strains for subunits of TBP (Spt15), TFIIA (Toa1 and Toa2), TFIIB (Sua7), TFIIE (Tfa1 and Tfa2), TFIIF (Tfg1), TFIIH (Ssl1 and Ssl2), and Pol II (Rpb1). In the absence of rapamycin, growth of these strains is comparable to that of an untagged parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that the fusion of the FRB domain to the targeted factors does not significantly affect their function.

In contrast, as will be discussed later, depletion of Taf1 results in a modest decrease in transcription.

To address whether PIC instability is due to metabolic limitation per se, we performed a similar experiment depleting cells of leucine (the strain is also a <italic>leu2</italic> auxotroph). Leucine-depleted cells show a similar growth pattern as uracil-depleted cells with growth cessation at 4 hr.

Importantly, when Taf1 is depleted and no longer detected, TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB strongly associate with promoters, but the effects depend on whether the promoter is ‘SAGA- or TFIID-dependent’. At ‘SAGA-dependent’ promoters (<italic>PMA1</italic>, <italic>CCW12</italic>), Taf1 levels are low, and Taf1 depletion has marginal effects on GTF occupancy. As a consequence, the TBP:Taf1 occupancy ratio at these promoters are far above those occurring in non-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, at ‘TFIID-dependent’ promoters with relatively high levels of Taf1 occupancy (<italic>RPL28</italic> and <italic>RPS14B</italic>), GTF occupancy decreases upon Taf1 depletion, and the TBP:Taf1 occupancy ratio is only slightly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Thus, TAF1 behaves differently than all GTFs and hence is selectively important but not required for Pol II transcription.</p><p>Our results are in apparent contrast to those of a recent study that claimed that Taf-depletion (via auxin-induced degradation) resulted in ‘similar transcription decreases for genes in the Taf-depleted, Taf-enriched, TATA-containing, and TATA-less gene classes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>). However, the conclusion of this other study was based on analysis of all ~5000 yeast genes, most of which are transcribed at low or even background levels that prevent accurate measurements. We performed a similar analysis of all ~5000 genes using the Taf1-depletion data presented here and confirmed a very modest difference between SAGA and TFIID-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; see ‘all SAGA’ and ‘all TFIID’). Our analysis involves Pol II occupancy between +200 to+400 from the transcription start site, which avoids complications between transcriptional initiation and elongation. Although (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>) analyzed the region between 0 and +100, analysis of our Taf1-depletion data in this region also shows that the distinction between ‘all SAGA’ and ‘all TFIID’ genes is virtually non-existent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>When we restrict the analysis to more actively transcribed genes, for which Pol II occupancy levels are well above the background (i.e. the top 453 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), the distinction between ‘active’ SAGA and TFIID genes is clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

In vivo, only some GTFs have been examined for their requirement for Pol II transcription, and few of these studies were performed on a whole-genome scale. Here, we show that every GTF is essential for Pol II transcription of essentially all genes. The limited amount of Pol II transcription observed upon GTF depletion is due to incomplete depletion, not GTF-independent transcription. While the basic observation is perhaps to be expected, the discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo results are noteworthy. For example, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH are not required for in vitro transcription on negatively supercoiled templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodrich and Tjian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parvin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmers, 1994</xref>). While mechanistically interesting for understanding the transcription process, this observation is not relevant under physiological conditions, and it suggests that the DNA template is not negatively supercoiled in vivo.</p><p>The general requirement for TFIIA is unexpected. Under many in vitro conditions that involve normal DNA templates, TFIIA is stimulatory but not absolutely required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokomori et al., 1994</xref>). In apparent agreement, multiple studies in vivo concluded that depletion of TFIIA generally reduces, but does not eliminate, transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stargell et al., 2000</xref>). However, these in vivo experiments had two problems that could not be addressed at the time, because the method of chromatin immunoprecipitation had just started being applied to transcription factors. First, these experiments involved mRNA measurements, which are not a direct assay of transcription, especially given the then unknown fact that transcription and mRNA decay are coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>). Second, there was no way to assess whether the modest transcriptional effects of TFIIA depletion reflected incomplete depletion. By directly analyzing transcription and determining the TFIIA:TBP:Pol II occupancy ratios under TFIIA-depletion conditions, we demonstrate that TFIIA behaves indistinguishably from other GTFs in vivo. This indicates that the ability of TFIIA to stabilize TBP binding to promoters is essential under physiological conditions.</p><p>Results presented here (see below) and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>) indicate that although TAFs and Mediator contribute to PIC levels at most (and probably all) promoters, they are not essential for PIC formation and hence are not GTFs. In contrast, related studies using auxin-induced degradation to deplete these factors claimed that these factors are essential and hence comparable to GTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>). However, our analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al. (2017)</xref> data yield PIC and transcription levels that are comparable to our results using the anchor-away method for depletion of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While we suspect that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al. (2017)</xref> interpreted the reduced PIC and transcription levels as a consequence of incomplete depletion, our direct analyses of factor occupancy here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>) clearly indicate that transcriptionally active PICs can exist in the absence of TAFs or Mediator but not GTFs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Partial and transcriptionally inactive PICs are extremely unstable in vivo</title><p>In vitro, the full complement of GTFs forms a PIC that is very stable in the absence of nucleotide precursors. Moreover, stepwise addition of GTFs results in a series of stable, partial PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast, TBP occupancy is drastically reduced upon depletion of any individual GTF, indicating that partial PICs exist at very low levels in vivo. In addition, PICs are virtually non-detectable when cells are depleted of uracil, presumably due to a transcriptionally inactive PIC. Consistent with this, the relative ratios of GTF occupancies are similar on a genome-wide level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>), indicating that PICs are compositionally identical under the condition tested. As such, cells have a mechanism(s) to prevent stable, transcriptionally inactive PICs despite the intrinsic ability of the GTFs to form them.</p><p>Our conclusion about the instability of partial PICs is in apparent conflict with two previous observations. First, it has been claimed that partial PICs exist at some promoters during a mild heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zanton and Pugh, 2006</xref>). However, our re-analysis of the underlying data as well as direct experimental evidence questions the validity of the claim. Second, TBP can remain at TAF-dependent promoters upon thermal inactivation of TFIIB or the Med17 subunit of Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>). There are several possible explanations, not mutually exclusive, for this apparent discrepancy. The ts mutants used in these earlier experiments may not (and are unlikely to) completely inactivate TFIIB or Mediator, and promoter occupancy of these factors upon thermal inactivation was not assessed. In addition, as transcription measurements relied on mRNA levels only 45 min after the ts shift, considerable mRNA remained from before the shift (i.e. wasn’t degraded), thereby making it impossible to measure modest levels of transcription. Indeed, more recent experiments using Pol II occupancy as an assay indicate that substantial transcription occurs in the Med17 ts (and anchor-away) strains, and transcription and TBP occupancy is more efficient at TAF-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>). However, as the Pol II occupancy measurements here are made 1 hr after GTF depletion, we cannot exclude the possibility that metastable partial PICs might exist at earlier time points.</p><p>In wild-type cells, Mediator is part of the PIC, but it dissociates from the PIC upon TFIIH-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of Pol II, thereby permitting rapid promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Mediator dissociation from the PIC is rapid (estimated life-time 1/8 s), and it leaves behind a post-escape complex containing GTFs that is capable of re-initiation with a new Pol II molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). A Mediator-lacking PIC is competent for transcription in vivo, albeit at a lower level than a wild-type PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the PIC is extremely dynamic, both with respect to Mediator and to the instability of partial PICs.</p><p>The lack of PICs in uracil-depleted cells does not simply reflect cessation of cell growth or metabolic mayhem, because considerable PIC levels are observed upon depletion of Kin28, TAF1, or leucine, conditions in which cell growth is blocked. The observation that general PIC loss is observed specifically during uracil depletion suggests that the effect is due to the elimination of UTP precursors. In support of this conclusion, the Pol II:TBP occupancy ratio increases at intermediate levels of uracil depletion (intermediate time points), presumably reflecting poor elongation under UTP-limiting conditions. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that, unlike the situation in vitro, a transcriptionally inactive PIC is unstable in vivo.</p><p>In principle, UTP limitation could affect PIC formation by leading to degradation, nuclear export, or an inactivating modification of a GTF. Alternatively, it could induce/activate a general inhibitory factor that blocks PIC formation or clears PICs from the promoter. The fact that uracil depletion results in loss of Pol II and Pol III PICs suggests that the ultimate target of the signal might be something in common between these different transcription machineries, such as TBP or the common subunits of the RNA polymerases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TFIID generally contributes to and is differentially important for Pol II transcription, but it is not a required component of the PIC</title><p>Genetic and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments over the past two decades indicate that the TAF subunits of TFIID are not generally required for transcription in yeast cells, but are selectively important at certain classes of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Struhl, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Struhl, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Struhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iyer and Struhl, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moqtaderi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basehoar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huisinga and Pugh, 2004</xref>). However, these conclusions were questioned by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>). As discussed below, we believe that the results here support the original conclusions about the role of TFIID in yeast cells.</p><p>As correctly noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>), early studies of Taf function involved measurements of mRNA levels, which do not necessarily reflect transcriptional activity, especially given the mechanistic connection between mRNA synthesis and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>). Upon analysis of newly synthesized mRNA, Taf1 depletion (via auxin-mediated proteolysis) in YPD medium caused a general 5-fold reduction in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>). However, Taf1 depletion in SC medium caused only a general 2-fold defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with our results using anchor-away-mediated depletion in SC medium. This difference in Taf1 function in YPD vs. SC medium is reminiscent of the difference in Mediator recruitment by activator proteins under these two conditions. As activator function typically increases in sub-optimal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan and Struhl, 2009</xref>), we suggest that the reduced activator function in YPD medium makes transcription more dependent on TFIID than SAGA. Importantly, in contrast to the dramatic decrease in transcription upon depletion of any individual GTF, the modest decrease in transcription in Taf1-depleted cells strongly argues against a general, GTF-like requirement for TFIID.</p><p>The long-standing belief that TFIID is selectively important at different classes of promoters was based on two complementary findings. First, unlike the constant GTF:GTF occupancy ratios at all promoters, the Taf1:GTF ratio is variable, strongly suggesting that there are TAF-containing and TAF-independent forms of transcriptionally active TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Formally, the different Taf1:GTF ratio could reflect differential crosslinking of TFIID at various promoters. However, our observation that substantial transcription and TBP occupancy occurs when Tafs are virtually absent from the promoter (i.e. a Taf1:TBP occupancy ratio of near zero) directly demonstrates the existence of a functional PIC lacking TAFs. Importantly, in wild-type cells, the Taf1:TBP occupancy ratios vary between 0.2 and 1.0, indicating that TAFs (and hence TFIID) contribute to transcription at all promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, the recent whole-genome analysis showing Taf occupancy at all promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>) is consistent with previous results and does not indicate that TFIID is generally required for transcription.</p><p>Second, genes showing higher relative levels of Tafs (and hence TFIID) show stronger reductions in transcription upon Taf depletion, thereby linking TFIID occupancy with TFIID-transcription. Our whole-genome analysis extends this observation and clearly demonstrates that depletion of TAF1 affects ‘TFIID-dependent’ genes more strongly than ‘SAGA-dependent’ genes. In contrast, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>) reported that Taf depletion does not differentially affect TFIID vs. SAGA genes. In resolving this apparent discrepancy, we note that our analysis was performed on 453 active genes, because Pol II occupancy at less expressed genes is at the detection limit. In contrast, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>) performed their analysis on all genes, and we suspect that the poor signal:noise of the vast majority of genes masked the TFIID vs. SAGA distinction.</p><p>From all these considerations, we reiterate our long-standing view of TFIID function in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>). There are TAF-containing (TFIID) and Taf-lacking forms of transcriptionally active TBP. TFIID associates with promoters and contributes to transcription of all genes, but substantial transcription can occur in the absence of Tafs. The relative usage of the two TBP forms depends on the promoter, and occurs in a continuum. The TFIID form is particularly important at TATA-lacking promoters, reflecting the importance of TAF:DNA contacts in the absence of a canonical TATA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verrijzer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verrijzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oelgeschläger, et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke and Kadonaga, 1997</xref>). The Taf-independent form typically requires a canonical TATA element for a stable interaction with TBP. Lastly, it appears that the relative usage of the two forms depends on the growth conditions, possible due to different levels of activator function which is linked to SAGA recruitment.</p><p>The key feature of this view involves the two different forms of TBP (Taf-containing and Taf-lacking) at the promoter. As both forms typically contribute (to various extents) to transcriptional activity of a given gene, the frequently used terms ‘TFIID-dependent’ and ‘TFIID-independent’ (typically also called ‘SAGA-dependent’) genes are misleading. Furthermore, while TATA elements are less common in ‘TFIID-dependent’ genes as compared to ‘TFIID-independent’ genes, TATA elements are not the sole determinant of the relative usage of the two forms of transcriptional active TBP. In this regard, TFIID is specifically recruited to ribosomal promoters by the RAP1-containing activator associated with the NuA4 histone acetylase co-activator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mencía et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uprety et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uprety et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the mechanistic distinction refers to the differences in the basic transcriptional machinery, not the promoters or genes. The multiple yeast Pol II machineries active at individual promoters are conceptually analogous to the multiple bacterial RNA polymerases that differ by the σ factor bound to the core enzyme and that can act at many individual promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wade et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript with compelling rationale for this study. Experiments are nicely designed with appropriate controls. Data are of high quality with statistical analysis, using biological and technical replicates. Based on their data, the authors conclude here that all GTFs (general transcription factors) are required for PIC (pre-initiation complex) formation in vivo, and suggest that partial PIC is not stable in vivo, in contrast to previous in vitro studies. Further, they conclude that PIC is not stable when transcription elongation does not occur. They also conclude in this manuscript that TAFs (TBP-associated factors) contribute to transcription of most genes. These are important observations, and will have significant impact in the field of transcription.</p><p>Please address all of the reviewers' comments below to the best of your ability.</p><p>Major substantive comments:</p><p>1) TAFs contribute to transcription of most genes.</p><p>This conclusion is solely based on deletion (anchor-away) of only TAF1, a specific component of TFIID. Inclusion of two other TFIID-specific TAFs would have significant impact on this conclusion.</p><p>2) PIC is not stable when transcription elongation does not occur.</p><p>This conclusion is primarily based on the analyses of TBP and RNA polymerase II occupancies at the promoter following uracil depletion that impairs transcription elongation. Performing similar ChIP experiments following genetic inhibition of a transcription elongation factor and/or pharmacological inhibition of transcriptional elongation would have significant impact on this conclusion.</p><p>3) Partial PIC is not stable in vivo.</p><p>This conclusion/suggestion is based on only TBP occupancy at the promoter in deletion backgrounds (anchor-away) of GTFs. Other components of the PIC are not analyzed here. Although TBP nucleates the PIC formation and other GTFs are not likely to be present at the promoter in the absence of TBP, it would be good to show that other components of PIC are not present at the promoter in the deletion backgrounds of various GTFs, thus supporting that partial PIC is not detectable by the ChIP assay. Alternatively and/or in addition, the authors may consider to pull down minimal core promoter following in vivo crosslinking and analyze what are the PIC components bound to the minimal core promoter with or without deletion of GTFs (or some cytological experiments using fluorescence microscopy may also help), though these experiments could be technically challenging.</p><p>Comments related to the text:</p><p>1) Previous in vivo studies from the Green laboratory have demonstrated that TFIIB and Mediator are dispensable for TBP recruitment at the TAF-dependent promoter, but are essential for TBP recruitment at the TAF-independent promoter (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). Mediator and TFIIB are required for transcription of both classes of genes (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). These studies indicate the existence of partial PIC at the promoter in vivo, as TBP remains bound to the TAF-dependent, but not TAF-independent, promoter in the TFIIB and Mediator mutants (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). In contrast, authors in this manuscript find that TFIIB depletion impairs TBP recruitment at all genes, and thus concludes that partial PIC is not stable in vivo. The authors need to take into consideration of these previous studies/facts (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004) in their Results and Discussion in this manuscript.</p><p>2) Previous in vivo studies from the Struhl and Green laboratories (Mencía et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002) demonstrated that UAS or co-activator specificity of the activator predominantly contributes to the TAF-dependency or -independency, but not TATA-containing or lacking sequence. This was not apparent in this manuscript. The authors need to discuss this fact in the manuscript, especially in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The authors have written last but one paragraph in the Introduction section to make their case compelling for this study without discussing/mentioning several important facts (or publications) which are relevant here. For example, TAF-dependency or independency was published back to back in the same issue of Science by the Struhl and Green laboratories in 2000. Struhl publication is cited, but Green publication is not cited in the first sentence in this paragraph and several other places in this manuscript. In the second sentence of this paragraph, several important references from the Green and Struhl laboratories regarding TAF or SAGA dependency/independency are missing. These are: Mencía et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002; Bhaumik and Green 2001; and Bhaumik and Green 2002. The last sentence in this paragraph mentions that &quot;However, this view has been challenged by experiments claiming that the two classes of promoters behave similarly upon TFIID depletion (Warfield et al., 2017)&quot;. However, the authors have not considered some important facts in line with this sentence. For example, previous studies demonstrated that NuA4 is required for TFIID recruitment at the ribosomal protein gene promoters (e.g., Reid et al., Molecular Cell, 2000; Uprety et al., 2012), and the absence of NuA4 impairs recruitment of TFIID to the ribosomal protein gene promoters (Uprety et al., 2015). Intriguingly, TBP (TAF-independent form of TBP) is recruited to the ribosomal protein gene promoters in the absence of NuA4 or TFIID, and such recruitment of TBP is mediated via SAGA (Uprety et al., 2015). Further, another recent study (Ferdoush et al., 2018) shows that SAGA is recruited to the PHO84 promoter for TFIID-independent transcription initiation in the YPD medium (or plus Pi). This gene can become TFIID-dependent in absence of Pi in the growth medium (Ferdoush et al., 2018). These studies indicate that the absence of TFIID can make a gene SAGA dependent and vice versa. These relevant studies may be mentioned here in this paragraph (or may be discussed later).</p><p>4) In the last paragraph of the Results section, the authors mention that &quot;We also note that our analysis involves Pol II occupancy measurements at the region between +200 to +400 from the transcription start site, which avoids complications between transcriptional initiation and elongation, whereas the other study utilized the region between 0 and +100 (Warfield et al., 2017). Indeed, the distinction between &quot;all TATA&quot; and &quot;all TFIID&quot; genes is virtually eliminated when our Taf1-depletion data is analyzed between 0 and +100 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).&quot;. How does the change in position of Pol II analysis by about ~200 bp alter the conclusion? This needs to be appropriately discussed. How is the complication avoided between transcriptional initiation and elongation at the region between +200 and +400 from transcription start site? RNA polymerase II pausing could be an issue in this region.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43654.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major substantive comments:</p><p>1) TAFs contribute to transcription of most genes.</p><p>This conclusion is solely based on deletion (anchor-away) of only TAF1, a specific component of TFIID.

Many TAF-inactivation experiments indicating that TFIID-specific TAFs selectively affect transcription. Regarding TAFs, the major point of our paper is to invalidate the opposite claim of Warfield et al., 2017. We do this by measuring TAF:GTF occupancies upon depletion of TAF1 (not done previously for any TAF-depletion experiment) and by re-analyzing the Warfield et al. genome-wide experiment (i.e. by restricting the analysis to genes whose expression is above the background). We also emphasize and discuss an interesting difference (discovered but largely ignored by Warfield et al.) with respect to the importance of TFIID in YPD vs. SC medium. Nevertheless, while not doing any new experiments ourselves, we did address this comment by analyzing Warfield et al. data on two other TFIID-specific TAFs (TAF11 and TAF13). The results (Figure 7—figure supplement 2) clearly demonstrate that 3 different TFIID-specific TAFs behave selectively and similarly with respect to the TFIID-SAGA distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PIC is not stable when transcription elongation does not occur.</p><p>This conclusion is primarily based on the analyses of TBP and RNA polymerase II occupancies at the promoter following uracil depletion that impairs transcription elongation. Performing similar ChIP experiments following genetic inhibition of a transcription elongation factor and/or pharmacological inhibition of transcriptional elongation would have significant impact on this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion of inhibiting elongation sounds good, but there is no known factor or drug that specifically inhibits elongation in yeast cells. More importantly, the point of the uracil experiment is to recreate the classic biochemical definition of the PIC (i.e. absence of NTPs) in vivoand assess its stability in vivo. There is no criticism of the experiment or the conclusions that arise. However, to address this suggestion, we now include an experiment done long ago in which we analyzed PIC and transcription levels in FACT-depleted cells. FACT is a histone chaperone that travels with elongating Pol II, is important for elongation through chromatin templates in vitro, and does not associate with promoters. Interestingly, as shown in new Figure 6, FACT depletion strongly reduces Pol II transcription genome-wide (already published by Pathak et al., 2018), and TFIIB occupancy at promoters. We recognize that the molecular basis of this observation is unknown, but we do think it is an interesting connection between elongation and PIC formation/stability worth reporting. We are not willing to do more experiments on FACT, so if our current Figure 6 is not acceptable to the reviewers, we will simply remove it. As mentioned above, the FACT experiment is not directly relevant for the uracil-depletion experiment, which is a key conclusion of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Partial PIC is not stable in vivo.</p><p>This conclusion/suggestion is based on only TBP occupancy at the promoter in deletion backgrounds (anchor-away) of GTFs. Other components of the PIC are not analyzed here. Although TBP nucleates the PIC formation and other GTFs are not likely to be present at the promoter in the absence of TBP, it would be good to show that other components of PIC are not present at the promoter in the deletion backgrounds of various GTFs, thus supporting that partial PIC is not detectable by the ChIP assay. Alternatively and/or in addition, the authors may consider to pull down minimal core promoter following in vivo crosslinking and analyze what are the PIC components bound to the minimal core promoter with or without deletion of GTFs (or some cytological experiments using fluorescence microscopy may also help), though these experiments could be technically challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion to look at other GTFs upon depletion of an individual GTF is unnecessary and would take a vast amount of work. First of all, our experiments already involve 2 GTFs, TBP and Pol II. Second, numerous biochemical experiments and high-resolution structural knowledge make it virtually impossible that any GTF or combination of GTFs can stably interact with the promoter in the absence of TBP. Moreover, to do this suggestion properly, we would have to do a vast number of genome-wide experiments in which we look at every GTF for every individual GTF depletion. Otherwise, one could always say that upon depletion of factor X, factor Y remains associated with a subset of promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments related to the text:</p><p>1) Previous in vivo studies from the Green laboratory have demonstrated that TFIIB and Mediator are dispensable for TBP recruitment at the TAF-dependent promoter, but are essential for TBP recruitment at the TAF-independent promoter (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). Mediator and TFIIB are required for transcription of both classes of genes (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). These studies indicate the existence of partial PIC at the promoter in vivo, as TBP remains bound to the TAF-dependent, but not TAF-independent, promoter in the TFIIB and Mediator mutants (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004). In contrast, authors in this manuscript find that TFIIB depletion impairs TBP recruitment at all genes, and thus concludes that partial PIC is not stable in vivo. The authors need to take into consideration of these previous studies/facts (Li et al., 2000; Bhaumik et al., 2004) in their Results and Discussion in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly notes that previous results that TBP can remain at TAF-dependent promoters upon thermal inactivation of TFIIB or Mediator (Med17 subunit) are in apparent conflict with our conclusion that partial PICs do not exist at appreciable levels in vivo. There are several possible explanations, not mutually exclusive, for this apparent discrepancy. First, the ts mutants used in the earlier experiments may not (and are unlikely to) completely inactivate TFIIB or Mediator. Because these experiments were done so long ago, ChIP was not done to assess the promoter occupancy of these factors upon thermal inactivation, and the transcriptional results relied on mRNA levels that are subject to mRNA stability issues. Furthermore, as these mRNA measurements were made only 45 minutes after the ts shift, considerable mRNA remained from before the shift (i.e. wasn’t degraded), thereby making it impossible to measure low/modest levels of transcription. In this regard, our more recent experiments using Pol II occupancy as an assay indicate that substantial transcription does occur in the Med17 ts mutant (and anchor-away allele), and transcription and TBP occupancy is more efficient at TAF-dependent promoters (Petrenko et al., 2017). Second, as the measurements in our current paper are made 1 hr after GTF depletion, it is possible that partial PICs might be metastable and exist at earlier time points (not so easy to distinguish true partial PICs from incomplete depletion). Thus, our conclusion that partial PICs do not exist at appreciable levels is correct. However, we now discuss these issues in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous in vivo studies from the Struhl and Green laboratories (Mencía et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002) demonstrated that UAS or co-activator specificity of the activator predominantly contributes to the TAF-dependency or -independency, but not TATA-containing or lacking sequence. This was not apparent in this manuscript. The authors need to discuss this fact in the manuscript, especially in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention the activator-specificity of TFIID recruitment to ribosomal protein promoters and cite the relevant papers. We note that this fact is largely irrelevant to the conclusions of our paper, which are concerned with whether TAFs are generally required or selectively important for transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have written last but one paragraph in the Introduction section to make their case compelling for this study without discussing/mentioning several important facts (or publications) which are relevant here. For example, TAF-dependency or independency was published back to back in the same issue of Science by the Struhl and Green laboratories in 2000. Struhl publication is cited, but Green publication is not cited in the first sentence in this paragraph and several other places in this manuscript. In the second sentence of this paragraph, several important references from the Green and Struhl laboratories regarding TAF or SAGA dependency/independency are missing. These are: Mencía et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002; Bhaumik and Green 2001; and Bhaumik and Green 2002. The last sentence in this paragraph mentions that &quot;However, this view has been challenged by experiments claiming that the two classes of promoters behave similarly upon TFIID depletion (Warfield et al., 2017)&quot;. However, the authors have not considered some important facts in line with this sentence. For example, previous studies demonstrated that NuA4 is required for TFIID recruitment at the ribosomal protein gene promoters (e.g., Reid et al., Molecular Cell, 2000; Uprety et al., 2012), and the absence of NuA4 impairs recruitment of TFIID to the ribosomal protein gene promoters (Uprety et al., 2015). Intriguingly, TBP (TAF-independent form of TBP) is recruited to the ribosomal protein gene promoters in the absence of NuA4 or TFIID, and such recruitment of TBP is mediated via SAGA (Uprety et al., 2015). Further, another recent study (Ferdoush et al., 2018) shows that SAGA is recruited to the PHO84 promoter for TFIID-independent transcription initiation in the YPD medium (or plus Pi). This gene can become TFIID-dependent in absence of Pi in the growth medium (Ferdoush et al., 2018). These studies indicate that the absence of TFIID can make a gene SAGA dependent and vice versa. These relevant studies may be mentioned here in this paragraph (or may be discussed later).</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited the papers mentioned in this comment. We note that these comments are related to the role of NuA4 at ribosomal protein promoters and the role of SAGA, subjects that are only peripherally related to the experiments and conclusions here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the last paragraph of the Results section, the authors mention that &quot;We also note that our analysis involves Pol II occupancy measurements at the region between +200 to +400 from the transcription start site, which avoids complications between transcriptional initiation and elongation, whereas the other study utilized the region between 0 and +100 (Warfield et al., 2017). Indeed, the distinction between &quot;all TATA&quot; and &quot;all TFIID&quot; genes is virtually eliminated when our Taf1-depletion data is analyzed between 0 and +100 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).&quot;. How does the change in position of Pol II analysis by about ~200 bp alter the conclusion? This needs to be appropriately discussed. How is the complication avoided between transcriptional initiation and elongation at the region between +200 and +400 from transcription start site? RNA polymerase II pausing could be an issue in this region.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference between Pol II occupancy measurements at +200- to +400 vs. those at 0 to +100 is very subtle. In both cases, the Warfield et al. analysis of “all genes” shows very little difference between TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters, whereas our analysis of the 500 most well-expressed genes (i.e. the ones where there is reliable data) shows considerable difference. We do not know why the measurements at these two different regions are subtly different and hence haven’t commented on this in the revised paper. Pol II pausing is not relevant here, because numerous genome-wide experiments indicate that pausing does not occur in yeast, unlike what occurs in many other eukaryotic organisms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
