chemical cues. Recently, we described that focal activation of the FGF pathway promotes the migration of the parapineal in the zebrafish epithalamus. How FGF activity is restricted to leading cells in this system is, however, unclear. Here, we address the role of Notch signaling in modulating FGF activity within the parapineal. While Notch loss-of-function results in an increased number of parapineal cells activating the FGF pathway, global activation of Notch signaling decreases it; both contexts result in defects in parapineal migration and specification. Decreasing or increasing FGF signaling in a Notch loss-of-function context respectively rescues or aggravates parapineal migration defects without affecting parapineal cells specification. We propose that Notch signaling controls the migration of the parapineal through its capacity to restrict FGF pathway activation to a few leading cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46275.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animal cells must move through the body from the place they are born to where they are needed, for example, when embryos are developing or wounds are healing. Often cells migrate in groups, which helps them to navigate and co-ordinate more effectively. Cells typically migrate by sensing different signals across large areas, and groups of cells communicate with each other to co-ordinate their migration.</p><p>One group of cells that is studied to understand collective cell migration is found in the brain of the zebrafish. These cells are called parapineal cells and, in the developing fish, they move towards the left side of the brain under the influence of a signal called Fgf8. Although all parapineal cells can detect Fgf8, only those at the front of the migrating group respond to the signal. These are the cells that lead the migration. It was previously unclear how the capability of responding to Fgf8 is limited to only a few parapineal cells to ensure they all migrate correctly.</p><p>By studying parapineal cell migration, Wei et al. identified a different signaling system called Notch as a regulator of cell migration. When Notch signaling activity is artificially increased in the brain, parapineal cells do not respond to Fgf8 as efficiently as when levels of Notch are normal. Conversely, the number of parapineal cells that respond to Fgf8 increases when Notch signaling is lost. In both cases, migration of parapineal cells is affected. Therefore, Wei et al. showed that changing the balance of Notch signaling in the zebrafish brain modifies the ability of parapineal cells to respond to Fgf8 signal and stops parapineal cells from migrating correctly.</p><p>These results provide a general model for how cells migrate as a group. More studies are needed to see if similar mechanisms are involved in other examples of collective cell migration. This model of group migration could be applied to healthy processes such as embryonic development as well as examples of cell migration in illness such as cancer metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>notch signaling</kwd><kwd>FGF pathway</kwd><kwd>left right asymmetry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20131029166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blader</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20131200173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blader</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE13-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blader</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSC No.201504910807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roussigné</surname><given-names>Myriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009160</institution-id><institution>Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roussigné</surname><given-names>Myriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Inserm</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blader</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch signaling controls the collective migration of parapineal cells through its capacity to restrict FGF pathway activation to a few leading cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coordinated migration of cell collectives is a widespread phenomenon, being seen predominantly during embryonic development but also during tissue repair in adults, for example. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying collective cell migration have been studied <italic>in vivo</italic> in different model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pocha and Montell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theveneau and Mayor, 2013</xref>). Recent progress in the analysis of mechanical forces together with the development of <italic>in vitro</italic> models and in silico modeling have improved our understanding of coordinated cell migration. Such studies have highlighted the variability in mechanisms from one model to another, indicating that collective migration is a highly adaptive and plastic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haeger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theveneau and Linker, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Members of the FGF family of secreted signals have been implicated in many models of cell migration. For example, FGF signaling is described to promote migration of cell collectives, potentially through chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadam et al., 2012</xref>), through the modulation of cell adhesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciruna et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahon et al., 2010</xref>) or by increasing random cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>). In the lateral line primordium, the FGF pathway is required for Notch-dependent formation of neuromast rosettes at the trailing edge of the migrating primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durdu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozlovskaja-Gumbrienė et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>) and for a leading-to-trailing signaling that prevents splitting of the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalle Nogare et al., 2014</xref>), with both of these processes being required for proper lateral line primordium migration. Despite the widespread and iterative role of the FGF pathway in cell migration models, however, it is not clear how the dynamics of FGF signaling correlate with cell behaviors and how this can be modulated by other signals.</p><p>The parapineal is a small group of cells that segregates from the anterior part of the pineal gland at the midline of the zebrafish epithalamus and migrates in an FGF-dependent manner to the left side of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Concha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duboc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roussigne et al., 2012</xref>). To characterize the dynamics of FGF pathway activation during parapineal migration, we recently analyzed the temporal and spatial activation of a previously described FGF pathway reporter transgene, <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2GFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>). Using this reporter, we showed that the FGF pathway is activated in an Fgf8-dependant manner in only a few parapineal cells located at the migration front and that experimentally activating the FGF pathway in a few parapineal cells restores parapineal migration in <italic>fgf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant embryos. Taken together, these findings indicate that the restricted activation of FGF signaling in the parapineal promotes the migration of the parapineal cell collective. While the parapineal can receive Fgf8 signals from both sides of the midline, focal pathway activation is primarily detected on the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>). This asymmetry in FGF pathway activation requires the TGFβ/Nodal signaling pathway, which is activated on the left side of the epithalamus prior to parapineal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bisgrove et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Concha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>). Although the Nodal pathway appears to bias the focal activation of FGF signaling to the left, after a significant delay the restriction of FGF activity still occurs in the absence of Nodal activity and the parapineal migrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>All parapineal cells appear competent to activate the FGF pathway begging the question as to how the activation of the pathway is restricted to only a few cells. In this study, we address whether Notch signaling might modulate the activation of FGF pathway in the parapineal. We show that while loss-of-function of Notch leads to expanded FGF pathway activation in the parapineal, activating the Notch pathway causes a strong reduction in the expression of the FGF reporter transgene, with both contexts leading to defects in parapineal migration. Loss or gain of function for Notch signaling also interferes with the specification of parapineal cell identity; loss-of-function results in a significant increase in the number of <italic>gfi1ab</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> expressing parapineal cells, whereas gain of Notch activity results in the opposite phenotype. In contrast, the number of parapineal cells expressing <italic>tbx2b</italic>, a putative marker for parapineal progenitors cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snelson et al., 2008</xref>), is not affected in either loss or gain of function for Notch. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch pathway activity suggests that the roles of Notch in the specification and migration of parapineal cells can be uncoupled. Finally, a global decrease or an increase in the level of FGF signaling can respectively rescue or aggravate the parapineal migration defect caused by Notch loss-of-function but without affecting the specification of parapineal cells. Our data indicate that the Notch pathway regulates the specification and migration of parapineal cells independently and that the role of Notch signaling in promoting parapineal migration, but not specification, depends on its ability to restrict FGF pathway activation to a few parapineal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The parapineal of <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutant embryos display expanded FGF pathway activation</title><p>In models of cell migration during sprouting of tubular tissues, Notch-Delta mediated cell-cell communication contributes to tip cell selection by restricting the ability of followers cells to activate RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikeya and Hayashi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007a</xref>). To address whether Notch signaling could similarly restrict FGF pathway activation in the freely moving group of parapineal cells, and thus promote its migration, we analyzed the expression of an FGF pathway activity reporter transgene, <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molina et al., 2007</xref>), in embryos mutant for the <italic>mindbomb</italic> (<italic>mib<sup>ta52b</sup></italic>) gene, a well-described loss-of-function context for the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>).

These changes in FGF activation correlate with defect in parapineal migration.

Therefore, our data reveals that cell-type specification and migration can be uncoupled in the parapineal. Our results resemble previous observations describing uncoupling of specification and migration of cardiac cells during in heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Notch-mediated cell-cell communication is well described for its role on cell fate restriction and progenitors maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cau and Blader, 2009</xref>). In neural tissues or in the pancreas, for instance, inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway causes premature differentiation of the progenitor cells into mature differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In the lateral line system, Notch signaling is required to restrict sensory hair cell progenitor fate to a central cell in the forming pro-neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in the parapineal, the number of <italic>gfi1ab</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> expressing parapineal cells is affected in loss or gain of function for Notch. However, in both contexts, the parapineal rosette is formed and a normal number of <italic>tbx2b</italic> expressing parapineal cells is detected. Therefore, while in previous studies it was assumed that all described parapineal markers (<italic>tbx2b, sox1a, gfi1a</italic>b) label the same cells, our data indicate that the pool of <italic>tbx2b</italic>+ parapineal cells probably differs from a <italic>sox1a/gfi1ab</italic>+ pool.

Notch signaling is also described to be a downstream effector of the FGF pathway for epithelial proliferation in the pancreas in mammalian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al., 2003</xref>). Our epistasis experiments suggest that the Notch pathway acts upstream of FGF signaling in parapineal cells to restrict FGF pathway activation and promote migration. Therefore, although in both the parapineal and the lateral line system, Notch signaling plays a similar role in restricting the number of cells with a particular fate (as mentioned above), the crosstalk with the FGF pathway appears to differ between the two models; Notch signaling acts upstream or downstream of FGF pathway to promote parapineal migration or neuromast morphogenesis, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Notch signaling restricts activation of the FGF pathway to promote parapineal migration</title><p>Our data show that gain or loss of function for Notch respectively result in an increase or decrease in the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells in the parapineal, with both correlating with parapineal (PP) migration defects.

In all these models of sheet or sprouting morphogenesis, migrating cells remains attached to the bulk of the tissue. The parapineal is thus the first described model of an isolated cluster of migrating cells in which Notch signaling modulates RTK signaling to define leading cells.</p><p>In both the tracheal and vascular systems, Notch-Delta signaling contributes to the selection of the tip cells by restricting the ability of follower cells to activate RTK signaling. The molecular mechanisms underlying Notch mediated restriction of RTK signaling in these two models are not clear but could possibly involve the transcriptional control of RTK ligands or receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ikeya and Hayashi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007b</xref>). As FgfR4, the only Fgf receptor found to be expressed in the parapineal, does not display restricted expression in the parapineal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regan et al., 2009</xref>), it is unlikely that the Notch pathway acts through the control of this receptor.</p><p>How Notch signaling could modulate FGF pathway activity in parapineal cells remains an open question. The fact that some <italic>rbpja/b</italic> morphants display parapineal migration defects similar to <italic>mib<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants strongly supports a role for the canonical Notch pathway rather than a Notch-independent role of the Mindbomb ubiquitin ligase in parapineal migration, although we cannot exclude that Mindbomb also regulates migration independently of the Notch pathway, for instance through modulation of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizoguchi et al., 2017</xref>). As all parapineal cells are competent to migrate and to activate the FGF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Concha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>), a parsimonious mechanism would be that lateral inhibition based cell-cell communication between parapineal cells within the rosette would modulate the capacity of a cell to activate/maintain or to inhibit FGF pathway activity.

Alternatively, Notch signaling could be required outside the parapineal to trigger mosaic FGF pathway activation in parapineal cells. Finally, there could be both parapineal-intrinsic and extrinsic requirements for Notch. In any case, as the ectopic expression of the constitutive activated FGF receptor (CA-FgfR1) does not completely block parapineal migration in a wild-type background and can rescue migration in <italic>fgf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>), it appears that the restriction mechanism acts downstream of the receptor rather than at the level of receptor gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>When and where is Notch signaling required?</title><p>Given that LY411575 does not block migration in any of the tested time windows, we cannot be sure about the timing of the Notch requirement for migration <italic>per se</italic>.

Classically, Notch signaling is thought to act through a lateral inhibition mechanism leading to a Notch-ON or Notch-OFF outcome between neighboring cells. Recent work, however, suggests that Notch acts in a level-dependent rather than an all-or-nothing manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>). In light of this, the differential effect of LY411575 on specification and migration of parapineal cells could reflect a different requirement in Notch signaling threshold, with a lower threshold of Notch signaling being required for migration and a higher one being required to control fate specification of parapineal cells. If LY411575 does not completely block Notch signaling, then residual Notch activity could be sufficient to promote the restriction of FGF activity and parapineal migration while not to limit the specification of <italic>gfi1ab</italic> and <italic>sox1a-</italic>positive cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that LY411575 treatment might be partially effective, we observed that the average number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells increases slightly in LY411575 treated embryos from 22 to 32 hpf, without reaching statistical significance.

Here, we show that the restriction of FGF activity requires a functional Notch pathway. As mentioned above, the Nodal pathway is bilateral in the epithalamus of embryos with compromised Notch signaling. However, it is unlikely that the role of Notch in restricting FGF pathway activation depends on its ability to control Nodal signaling. Indeed, in other contexts of bilateral Nodal signaling, such as in embryos injected with morpholinos against <italic>notail</italic>, we have shown that FGF pathway activation ultimately becomes restricted to a few parapineal cells and parapineal eventually migrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roussigné et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> reporter expression in this context is no longer left lateralized, which correlates with the parapineal migrating either to the left or the right.

As datasets on the number of parapineal cells were usually normal and often of unequal variances, they were compared using unpaired Welch t-tests; means (± SEM) are indicated as horizontal bars on dot plots. Data on parapineal mean position usually did not distribute normally (because of few embryos with the parapineal on the right) and were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum non-parametric tests; we also compared parapineal mean position datasets with Welch t-tests using absolute values to discriminate between a defect in laterality (i.e. left-right randomization of parapineal migration) and a defect in migration <italic>per se</italic> (i.e. distance from the midline only). Most data are representative of at least two and more often three independent experiments and the number of biological replicates is mentioned in the figure legends for each graph. Means (± SD) are indicated in the text.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all members of the Blader lab, especially Elise Cau and Julie Batut for critical reading of the manuscript and Aurélie Quillien for insightful discussions.

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Notch signaling restricts FGF pathway activation in parapineal cells to promote their collective migration&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>In particular, the reviewers have several major concerns:</p><p>1) The reviewers wondered whether it was the levels of FGF activity rather than restricted FGF activity that may be playing an important role. To test this, they could us additional markers as a readout for FGF activity.</p><p>2) A crucial experiment is to determine in which cells Notch signaling is active. Without having this information, one cannot formulate a hypothesis of how Notch might be regulating FGF signaling.</p><p>3) While the study provides insights about when Notch activity is required, much less can be said about exactly where it is required. The authors can speculate in the discussion but must remain circumspect about this issue.</p><p>4) Although it would be interesting to know which Notch receptors and ligands are at play, this seems beyond the scope of what is necessary for this study.</p><p>Below are the full reviews from the three reviewers which we hope you find helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes how Notch signaling affects parapineal cell migration and cell type specification in the zebrafish brain. The manuscript is clearly written and illustrated, and the Discussion section is informative and thoughtful. The authors demonstrate that loss of Notch signaling leads to an expansion of the FGF pathway and defects in parapineal migration and laterality, and an increase in the number of <italic>gfi1ab</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> expressing parapineal cells. They further demonstrate that the roles of Notch signaling in cell type specification, cell migration and laterality of cell migration are uncoupled. Only the migration and laterality defects are FGF dependent, whereas the effect of Notch signaling on cell type specification is not. The authors also show that these different functions of Notch signaling occur at different time points of development. Cell migration to the left side (laterality) depends on Notch signaling before migration starts (8-22 hpf) by restricting Nodal signaling to the left side of the epithalamus. Whereas cell type specification occurs later. The main conclusion of the manuscript is that proper parapineal cell migration depends on Notch-dependent restriction of FGF signaling to just a few tip cells. The mechanisms by which Notch restrict FGF signaling is unknown.</p><p>The results are clearly illustrated and the majority of the data interpretation are sound. However, the manuscript would profit from a more detailed description of the different cell types. Also, the fact that suboptimal doses of SU5402 rescue the <italic>mib</italic> migration phenotype should be discussed/analyzed in more detail, as the results might suggest that it is not important that only the tip cells express FGF signaling but rather that these tip cells express the correct level of FGF signaling. Also, there is no description of where Notch signaling is active. As Notch reporter lines exist, the authors should add this information and discuss it.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Subsection “The parapineal of <italic>mindbomb</italic> mutant embryos display expanded FGF pathway activation”: The number of parapineal cells is slightly increased but the number of <italic>sox1a</italic> positive cells is not increased (which is a marker for parapineal cells). Are there sox1a-negative parapineal cells or is the difference between Figure 1F and 1G due to biological noise?</p><p>2) Figure 1A: please indicate in the figure legend or figure what structures are outlined by yellow and white dotted lines.</p><p>3) Subsection “Loss of Notch signaling results in an increase in the number of certain parapineal cell subtypes”: A more detailed characterization of <italic>tbx2b, sox1a</italic> and <italic>gfi1a</italic> expressing cells is necessary. Are <italic>sox1a</italic> and <italic>gfi1ab</italic> expressed in the same cells?</p><p>4) Subsection “Loss of Notch signaling results in an increase in the number of certain parapineal cell subtypes” (and subsection “Notch effects on parapineal cell specification can be uncoupled from migration”) the authors conclude that Notch probably controls the transition from <italic>tbx2b</italic>-expressing putative progenitors to <italic>sox1a/gfi1ab</italic>-expressing differentiated cells. After loss of Notch signaling in <italic>mib</italic> mutants, the number of <italic>sox1a/gfi1ab</italic> positive cells increases, whereas the <italic>tbx2b</italic> positive cell number remains the same. How do the authors envision that the progenitor pool stays the same? Normally, defects in Notch dependent lateral inhibition should lead to the increase of one cell population at the expense of another. Do the progenitor cells divide asymmetrically and only the future <italic>sox1a/gfi1ab</italic> cells proliferate more? In this scenario <italic>tbx2b</italic>-expressing progenitor cells are independent of Notch signaling. In many other systems progenitor maintenance crucially depends on Notch signaling. Either the parapineal is different or the <italic>tbx2b</italic> positive cells are not self-renewing progenitors? Please discuss in more detail what is known about <italic>tbx2b, sox1a</italic> and <italic>gfi1ab</italic> positive cells.</p><p>5) Regarding the hs:NICD experiments: Are control embryos also heat shocked? Please label figure accordingly.</p><p>6) Figure 2I: The time line of treatment shown above the graph is very useful. It would facilitate the interpretation even further if it was indicated at what time point (32 hpf) migration begins.</p><p>7) The fact that ectopic Notch signaling at late stages (26-28 hpf) can efficiently block migration argues for a role of Notch at the time when the parapineal initiates its migration. If Notch signaling is indeed required just before migration, it is unclear why LY411575 treatment (22 to 32 hpf) does not affect migration. Maybe activation of Notch by inducing NICD until 28hpf persists much longer and NICD is still active after 28hpf. Therefore, embryos should be treated with LY411575 beyond 32hpf, as Notch might be required for migration during these later stages.</p><p>8) Subsection “Notch activity is required early for unilateral activation of the Nodal pathway in the epithalamus”: 'To determine whether the parapineal migration defects we observed (add: in <italic>mib</italic> mutants) might be a direct…. In sentence in the paragraph above the authors conclude that there was no migration defect in LY411575 treated embryos, which is confusing.</p><p>9) Subsection “Decreasing FGF signaling rescues the parapineal migration defects in loss of Notch context while increasing FGF signaling aggravates it”. The authors show that suboptimal doses of the FGF inhibitor SU5402 rescue to some degree the migration defect in <italic>mib</italic> mutants, which are characterized by FGF signaling activation in all migrating cells. This experiment actually argues that it is not important that the tip cells possess more FGF signaling then the follower cells but rather that FGF signaling needs to be expressed at the correct level. The authors should discuss the results of this experiment in more detail.</p><p>10) Subsection “Decreasing FGF signaling rescues the parapineal migration defects in loss of Notch context while increasing FGF signaling aggravates it”: 'Taken together, our.…experiments argue that the Notch pathway is required for parapineal migration, and that it acts by restricting FGF activation in parapineal cells.' However, in subsection “Notch activity is required early for unilateral activation of the Nodal pathway in the epithalamus” the authors argue that Notch and FGF act synergistically during migration, as <italic>rbpj</italic> morphant:cafgfr1a embryos display a more severe migration phenotype then CAfgfr1 embryos alone. Therefore, one has to conclude that Notch and FGF partially act in parallel on parapineal migration, correct?</p><p>11) Epistasis: Notch and FGF could also act in a feedback loop. Is Notch signaling affected after manipulation of FGF signaling?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Lu et al., is an excellent follow up on previous work from Roussigne which demonstrated a role for restricted FGF signaling in collective migration of the parapineal cells. In this study the authors make good use of a combination of transgenic tools, mutants and chemical inhibitors to demonstrate the role of Notch signaling in a particular time window in restricting FGF signaling to a limited number of parapineal cells to determine asymmetric collective migration. They show that it is required after a relatively early stage when Notch is required to determine asymmetric Nodal signaling and after a stage is required to restrict the number of cells with <italic>gf1ab</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> positive cells. The experiments are presented in a logical order, the data is presented well, and its analysis supports the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>I have no major problems with the paper in its current form. My issues were only tangentially related to the study.</p><p>At various points in the Introduction and Discussion section the authors make comparisons with the role of FGF and Notch signaling in the lateral line system. I found those references confusing and potentially misleading. I would have liked to hear more about the role of Notch signaling in restricting migratory potential in tracheal cells and endothelial cells in vascular development. While the tracheal and vascular systems are referenced, the comparison could be elaborated on.</p><p>In the Introduction the authors suggest that the Dalle Nogare paper shows a role for FGF signaling in maintaining cluster cohesion. It is not clear what the authors have in mind here because the primary role of FGF shown in that paper is to suggest a role for FGFs released by leading cells in providing a guidance cue for collective migration of trailing cells. Their description of FGFs role in cluster cohesion is not essential for any point they wish to establish in this study and may only serve to establish a misleading impression about conclusions in the Dalle Nogare paper in the minds of readers for those not familiar with that paper.</p><p>Similarly, the authors contrast the role of Notch, downstream of FGF, in determining apical constriction in forming neuromasts in the migrating primordium, with the role of Notch in restricting the number of cells with FGF activity in the context of parapineal migration. The authors are not wrong here but they may give readers that not familiar with the Lateral Line system a simplistic idea about the role of Notch signaling in the primordium, where, as in the parapineal, it has multiple sequential roles. For example, first in restricting sensory hair cell progenitor fate to a central cell, and subsequently in determining Notch activation in neighboring cells to consolidate morphogenesis of epithelial rosettes. It is true that activation of Notch promotes apical constriction in the absence of FGF signaling and therefore in this context, downstream of FGF signaling and different in its epistatic relationship from the role of Notch in the parapineal. However, in the context of lateral inhibition and in restricting the number of cells with a particular fate/activity there may be important similarities in the role of Notch in the lateral line primordium and in parapineal cells. Without such a clarification, I felt the contrasting of the role of Notch in the parapineal and primordium could be potentially misleading.</p><p>A question that remained unanswered, which I was curious about and is not necessary in my mind for acceptance of the paper- which cells does Notch activity required in for its role in restricting migratory potential, which Notch ligands and receptors are required for this process and does their spatial distribution or that of downstream target genes provide insight about where Notch activity if required for restriction of FGF signaling in the parapineal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study by Wei et al., the authors investigate collective cell migration of parapineal cells during development using zebrafish as a model system. The authors found that global inhibition of Notch signaling, either by a chemical inhibitor or a MO-mediated knockdown, increased the number of cells that activate FGF signaling. As FGF is required for the parapineal migration and it is typically restricted to a few leading cells, this blocked the parapineal migration. Conversely, upregulating Notch signaling led to the loss of FGF signaling and also defects in its migration. These manipulations also affected a number of parapineal cells. Finally, the authors modulated FGF signaling in both Notch loss- and gain-of-function conditions. Decreasing FGF under this condition resulted in a partial rescue of the migration, whereas gain of FGF signaling worsened the migration phenotype. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect the number of parapineal cells, indicating that these two roles of Notch signaling are distinct. Based on these data, the authors concluded that Notch restricts FGF signaling to a few leading parapineal cells, a process required for the proper migration. In addition, during later stages, Notch signaling controls the number of parapineal cells and this particular role of Notch can be uncoupled from its earlier role in restricting FGF signaling.</p><p>Overall, the conclusions are based on carefully done and controlled experiments (with a few exceptions). And while they provide some interesting insights into mechanisms of parapineal migration, the study is quite descriptive and does not go beyond the superficial analysis of cellular phenotypes. It is also not clear which cells express Notch ligands and receptors and whether effects on FGF signaling are direct. In summary, the overall findings are quite specialized and somewhat incremental and, thus, more suited for a specialized audience.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>Subsection “Loss of Notch signaling results in defects in parapineal migration”: Indicates that migration of the parapineal failed in 1/3 of <italic>mib-/-</italic>. I don't believe the authors discussed why this is the case/why the phenotype is partially penetrant in <italic>mib</italic> mutants? As well as why this phenotype was partially penetrant in the <italic>rbpj</italic> MO-injected embryos (with only 13% failing to migrate).</p><p><italic>rbpj a/b</italic> MO: given specific guidelines for MOs (Stainier et al., 2017), these experiments do not seem to be appropriately controlled.</p><p>The results related to the inhibitor treatment seem odd. If the γ-secretase inhibitor, LY411575, is specific and Notch is playing a role in migration and specification of this system, I would expect to see a result with treatment from the 22-32 hpf time period. This drug and it has only been published in two zebrafish papers. Why not use the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT that has been utilized in many other studies. Related to this, I am confused that 8-22 hour inhibitor treatment did not interfere with the <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> transgene expression, neither did the 22-32 hour treatment. What is then the time window for Notch signaling that controls <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> expression?</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is not clear where Notch signaling is active/ where Notch signaling components are expressed. It would be helpful to see the expression of where particular Notch signaling components are expressed during the time points of interest to further validate the reason behind studying Notch signaling. In other words, is Notch acting directly on parapineal cells?</p><p>[Editors’ note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors’ plan of action.]</p><p>Further to my previous email, the editors and reviewers have considered your plan and invite you to proceed with your revisions as proposed.

To test this, they could us additional markers as a readout for FGF activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that gain or loss of function for Notch results respectively in an increase or decrease in the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells in the parapineal, with both resulting in parapineal (PP) migration defects. These data, together with the fact that partial rescue of migration (Figure 4F) correlates with a decrease in the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells (Figure 4G), led us to conclude that FGF signaling needs to be restricted within PP cells. Reviewer 1 proposed that a correct level of FGF signaling in the leading cell might be required rather than or in addition to a restriction of the pathway activation to a few cells. This alternative interpretation is indeed a possibility. As explained below, our capacity to analyze the absolute level of FGF signaling is limited by the complexity of the FGF pathway and the tools at our disposal. However, here we provide a fuller set of arguments in favor of a requirement for the restriction in activation over a specific level of FGF activity being necessary for correct parapineal migration.</p><p>We analyzed the expression of additional markers as readout for FGF activity prior to our original submission. The activation of the FGF pathway leads to the transcription of various target genes that either encode positive effectors, such as members of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS domain transcription factor (Etv5, ERM and Pea3), or feedback inhibitors (Sprouty 1,2,4 and sef) of the FGF pathway (Tsang and Dawid, 2004). As part of the so-called <italic>fgf8</italic> syn-expression group, these genes have been described in the literature or the ZFIN database to be expressed in the diencephalon in a pattern similar to Fgf8 and Fgf3, but their detailed expression pattern in the epithalamus had not been addressed. We analyzed the expression pattern of these genes in the epithalamus at cellular resolution and found that <italic>erm</italic> and <italic>pea3</italic> are expressed broadly in the epithalamus, in both the parapineal and presumptive habenulae, while <italic>etv5</italic> is more specifically detected in the PP and enriched at the migration front (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for reviewers). We also found that the <italic>Tg(sprouty1:YFP)</italic> transgene is expressed in some PP cells, although we could not detect endogenous <italic>sprouty1</italic> expression; the expression of <italic>sprouty 2,4</italic> or <italic>sef</italic> is only detected in the habenulae but not in the PP.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of others FGF target genes in the epithalamus.</title><p>Confocal sections of the head of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> embryos (A-C’’’) at 36 hpf after a whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization against <italic>erm</italic> (red, A-A’’’), <italic>pea3</italic> (red, B-B’’’), <italic>etv5a</italic> (red, C-C’’’) or of Tg(<italic>sprouty1:YFP)</italic> embryos at 30 hpf (D-D’) or 36 hpf (E, E’) after immunostaining against GFP (Green; A-E’); the pictures are merged with cell nuclei staining (Topro-3 in grey) that makes brain structures visible and specially the parapineal (yellow circle).

Nonetheless, their expression does not systematically overlap with <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> reporter transgene expression, highlighting the complexity of the FGF signaling pathway: although the classic FGF target genes are all expressed in the same territories as Fgf8 (the epithalamus), their expression pattern are somewhat distinct at a cellular level. As such, we do not think that performing <italic>in situ</italic> against these other markers will allow us to quantify absolute level of FGF activity better than we have already managed in the <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> line, and thus to fully address the alternative hypothesis raised by reviewer 1.</p><p>The complexity revealed by the expression pattern of other FGF target genes led us to choose to focus on <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> transgene expression only as we have previously shown that its expression reflects an Fgf8 dependent activation of one branch of the FGF pathway that is required for parapineal migration (Roussigné et al., 2018). To avoid any bias in counting the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)+</italic> cells, in our study, we quantified the mean intensity of d2EGFP expression for each PP cell and used, for each experiment, the same intensity threshold to determine if a cell was <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> positive or not in the various contexts (see Material and Methods). While not originally designed to address the level of FGF pathway activation <italic>per se</italic>, these data can be used to analyze the mean intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells in addition to the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>. As such, we revisited the data concerning <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutants versus wildtype (Figure 1) or in SU5402 versus DMSO treated wild-type and <italic>mib-/-</italic> (Figure 4) relative to the general level of d2GFP expression. Treatment with the suboptimal dose of SU5402 (5µM) in <italic>mib-/-</italic> context triggers a partial rescue of PP migration together with a decrease in both the number (Figure 4G) and the mean intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2E, F</xref>): although the p-value is higher than the 0,05 significance threshold (p=0,59), we observe a clear tendency for a decrease in the mean intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells upon SU5402 treatment (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). Therefore, in this experiment, we cannot conclude if the SU5402 mediated partial rescue is due to an overall decrease in the number or in the intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> FGF reporter. However, when we compare the mean intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells in <italic>mib-/-</italic> versus wild-type embryos, both in data from the original Figure 4 and Figure 1, we clearly observe that the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ increases (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2C, D, F</xref> for Reviewers) while the mean intensity does not change significantly in <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutants (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A, B, E</xref> for Reviewers). Therefore, PP migration defects in <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutants correlate with an increase in the number rather than the mean d2GFP intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic>+ cells. This strongly suggests that, rather than the level of FGF activity, it is the restriction of FGF activation to few parapineal cells that is important for correct migration.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The number but not the mean intensity of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP</italic>) expressing cells is increased in <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Dot plots showing the mean GFP fluorescence intensity (A, B) of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)</italic> expressing parapineal cells in the first (<bold>A</bold>) and second experiment (<bold>B</bold>) in controls (blue dots; A, n=21; B, n=15) or in <italic>mib<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant embryos (orange dots; A, n=21; B, n=13) at 32 hpf stage.

We found that, despite being expressed at very high level in the epiphysis, this transgene was not robustly detected in the parapineal. Indeed, we rarely detected parapineal cells expressing GFP at 30hpf (n=3/19) and no expression was observed in the parapineal at 36hpf (n=0/10).</p><p>In parallel, we analyzed the expression of several known target genes of the Notch pathway, including <italic>her2</italic> (Quillien et al., 2011)<italic>, her4</italic> (Chapouton et al., 2011)<italic>, her5 (</italic>Ninkovic et al., 2005)<italic>, her6</italic> (Chapouton et al., 2011)<italic>, her9</italic> (Chapouton et al., 2011)<italic>, her12</italic> (Nikolaou et al., 2009)<italic>, her15</italic> (Webb et al., 2009).

The manuscript is clearly written and illustrated, and the Discussion section is informative and thoughtful. The authors demonstrate that loss of Notch signaling leads to an expansion of the FGF pathway and defects in parapineal migration and laterality, and an increase in the number of gfi1ab and sox1a expressing parapineal cells. They further demonstrate that the roles of Notch signaling in cell type specification, cell migration and laterality of cell migration are uncoupled. Only the migration and laterality defects are FGF dependent, whereas the effect of Notch signaling on cell type specification is not. The authors also show that these different functions of Notch signaling occur at different time points of development. Cell migration to the left side (laterality) depends on Notch signaling before migration starts (8-22 hpf) by restricting Nodal signaling to the left side of the epithalamus. Whereas cell type specification occurs later.

After loss of Notch signaling in mib mutants, the number of sox1a/gfi1ab positive cells increases, whereas the tbx2b positive cell number remains the same. How do the authors envision that the progenitor pool stays the same? Normally, defects in Notch dependent lateral inhibition should lead to the increase of one cell population at the expense of another. Do the progenitor cells divide asymmetrically and only the future sox1a/gfi1ab cells proliferate more? In this scenario tbx2b-expressing progenitor cells are independent of Notch signaling. In many other systems progenitor maintenance crucially depends on Notch signaling. Either the parapineal is different or the tbx2b positive cells are not self-renewing progenitors? Please discuss in more detail what is known about tbx2b, sox1a and gfi1ab positive cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Nothing is known about the lineage of PP cells.

If Notch signaling is indeed required just before migration, it is unclear why LY411575 treatment (22 to 32 hpf) does not affect migration. Maybe activation of Notch by inducing NICD until 28hpf persists much longer and NICD is still active after 28hpf. Therefore, embryos should be treated with LY411575 beyond 32hpf, as Notch might be required for migration during these later stages.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply concerning the major issues raised and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>.</p><p>In our original discussion, we suggest that LY411575 might not completely block Notch signaling and that the differential effect of LY411575 on specification and migration of parapineal cells could reflect a different requirement in Notch signaling threshold.

The authors should discuss the results of this experiment in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replied to this point above. We can add a sentence in the discussion to mention this alternative hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Decreasing FGF signaling rescues the parapineal migration defects in loss of Notch context while increasing FGF signaling aggravates it”: 'Taken together, our.…experiments argue that the Notch pathway is required for parapineal migration, and that it acts by restricting FGF activation in parapineal cells.' However, in subsection “Notch activity is required early for unilateral activation of the Nodal pathway in the epithalamus” the authors argue that Notch and FGF act synergistically during migration, as rbpj morphant:cafgfr1a embryos display a more severe migration phenotype then CAfgfr1 embryos alone. Therefore, one has to conclude that Notch and FGF partially act in parallel on parapineal migration, correct?</p></disp-quote><p>By using ‘synergistic’, our goal was not to suggest that FGF and Notch act in parallel but rather that the two pathways appear to interact. Indeed, our data suggest that Notch acts upstream of the FGF pathway as LOF and GOF for Notch trigger an increase or decrease in FGF signaling in the PP. However, we understand from reviewer 1's comment that the wording chosen might be confusing. We can change the sentence ‘The interaction detected… ‘to ‘Notch and FGF pathways appears to interact in this context as the increase in parapineal migration defects observed in <italic>rbpja/b</italic> morphant embryos expressing the activated FGF receptor is significantly higher than expected from simply adding the effects of activated receptor transgene and <italic>rbpja/b</italic> MO injections alone.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Epistasis: Notch and FGF could also act in a feedback loop.

In this study the authors make good use of a combination of transgenic tools, mutants and chemical inhibitors to demonstrate the role of Notch signaling in a particular time window in restricting FGF signaling to a limited number of parapineal cells to determine asymmetric collective migration. They show that it is required after a relatively early stage when Notch is required to determine asymmetric Nodal signaling and after a stage is required to restrict the number of cells with gf1ab and sox1a positive cells. The experiments are presented in a logical order, the data is presented well, and its analysis supports the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>I have no major problems with the paper in its current form. My issues were only tangentially related to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for his enthusiasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At various points in the Introduction and Discussion section the authors make comparisons with the role of FGF and Notch signaling in the lateral line system. I found those references confusing and potentially misleading. I would have liked to hear more about the role of Notch signaling in restricting migratory potential in tracheal cells and endothelial cells in vascular development. While the tracheal and vascular systems are referenced, the comparison could be elaborated on.</p></disp-quote><p>The interaction between Notch and FGF/RTK pathways in the tracheal and vascular systems is not well understood but we could discuss it more if required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Introduction the authors suggest that the Dalle Nogare paper shows a role for FGF signaling in maintaining cluster cohesion. It is not clear what the authors have in mind here because the primary role of FGF shown in that paper is to suggest a role for FGFs released by leading cells in providing a guidance cue for collective migration of trailing cells. Their description of FGFs role in cluster cohesion is not essential for any point they wish to establish in this study and may only serve to establish a misleading impression about conclusions in the Dalle Nogare paper in the minds of readers for those not familiar with that paper.</p></disp-quote><p>By writing ‘a role of FGF in cluster cohesion’, we were referring to a function of FGF leading to trailing signaling in preventing splitting of the primordium. Therefore, we fully agree with reviewer 2 on the interpretation of the data from Dalle Nogare et al. We understand that referring to ‘cluster cohesion’ to summarize these data is misleading and we can re-word this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors contrast the role of Notch, downstream of FGF, in determining apical constriction in forming neuromasts in the migrating primordium, with the role of Notch in restricting the number of cells with FGF activity in the context of parapineal migration. The authors are not wrong here but they may give readers that not familiar with the Lateral Line system a simplistic idea about the role of Notch signaling in the primordium, where, as in the parapineal, it has multiple sequential roles. For example, first in restricting sensory hair cell progenitor fate to a central cell, and subsequently in determining Notch activation in neighboring cells to consolidate morphogenesis of epithelial rosettes. It is true that activation of Notch promotes apical constriction in the absence of FGF signaling and therefore in this context, downstream of FGF signaling and different in its epistatic relationship from the role of Notch in the parapineal. However, in the context of lateral inhibition and in restricting the number of cells with a particular fate/activity there may be important similarities in the role of Notch in the lateral line primordium and in parapineal cells. Without such a clarification, I felt the contrasting of the role of Notch in the parapineal and primordium could be potentially misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>To keep the manuscript‘s length within reason, we indeed decided to focus our discussion on the differences that exist in the interaction between Notch and FGF signaling in the PP (Notch upstream FGF) versus the LLP (FGF upstream Notch) rather than also including text on the role of Notch alone. We agree that, in both models (PP and LLP), the Notch pathway plays a similar role in restricting the number of differentiated cells. Nonetheless, we don’t feel we have the space to describe in detail the LLP system. We can add a sentence to mention the existence of similarities in the role of Notch between these two models, as suggested by reviewer 2 if requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A question that remained unanswered, which I was curious about and is not necessary in my mind for acceptance of the paper- which cells does Notch activity required in for its role in restricting migratory potential, which Notch ligands and receptors are required for this process and does their spatial distribution or that of downstream target genes provide insight about where Notch activity if required for restriction of FGF signaling in the parapineal.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study by Wei et al., the authors investigate collective cell migration of parapineal cells during development using zebrafish as a model system. The authors found that global inhibition of Notch signaling, either by a chemical inhibitor or a MO-mediated knockdown, increased the number of cells that activate FGF signaling. As FGF is required for the parapineal migration and it is typically restricted to a few leading cells, this blocked the parapineal migration. Conversely, upregulating Notch signaling led to the loss of FGF signaling and also defects in its migration. These manipulations also affected a number of parapineal cells. Finally, the authors modulated FGF signaling in both Notch loss- and gain-of-function conditions. Decreasing FGF under this condition resulted in a partial rescue of the migration, whereas gain of FGF signaling worsened the migration phenotype. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect the number of parapineal cells, indicating that these two roles of Notch signaling are distinct. Based on these data, the authors concluded that Notch restricts FGF signaling to a few leading parapineal cells, a process required for the proper migration. In addition, during later stages, Notch signaling controls the number of parapineal cells and this particular role of Notch can be uncoupled from its earlier role in restricting FGF signaling.</p><p>Overall, the conclusions are based on carefully done and controlled experiments (with a few exceptions). And while they provide some interesting insights into mechanisms of parapineal migration, the study is quite descriptive and does not go beyond the superficial analysis of cellular phenotypes. It is also not clear which cells express Notch ligands and receptors and whether effects on FGF signaling are direct. In summary, the overall findings are quite specialized and somewhat incremental and, thus, more suited for a specialized audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for acknowledging the quality of our work but we disagree with him/her on the fact that our findings will be more suited for specialized journal.</p><p>As mentioned in our cover letter to the editor, our work will be of interest to the community working on left-right brain asymmetry as it sets a framework to address how Nodal signaling provides a leftward bias to the Notch dependent restriction of FGF signaling that is required for parapineal laterality and subsequent habenular asymmetries. However, we believe that our study will also be of interest to groups interested in collective cell migration in general. Indeed, our findings potentially apply to other models of FGF dependent cell migration and, in the future, they would set the stage for studies investigating how Notch can restrict the activation of FGF pathway and how other factors or signaling pathways modulate this Notch dependent restriction in normal or pathological contexts of collective cell migration, including metastasis. For these reasons, we believe that our study will be of considerable interest to the broad audience readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>Subsection “Loss of Notch signaling results in defects in parapineal migration”: Indicates that migration of the parapineal failed in 1/3 of mib-/-. I don't believe the authors discussed why this is the case/why the phenotype is partially penetrant in mib mutants? As well as why this phenotype was partially penetrant in the rbpj MO-injected embryos (with only 13% failing to migrate).</p></disp-quote><p>Why a single gene mutation results in a partially penetrant phenotype (expressivity) is a common question in genetics, and probably depend on various parameters such as individual variation in the genetic background, a redundancy of the mechanisms at play or intrinsic properties of the system that make it more or less robust.</p><p>In the case of parapineal migration, the number of <italic>Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP)+</italic> cells is quite variable suggesting that parapineal migration tolerates variation in the degree of mosaicism of FGF pathway activation and/or in the level of FGF signaling. The general robustness of parapineal migration might also reflect that migration is very short in terms of distance travelled (measured in tens of µm) compared to, for instance, the migration of the lateral line primordium (LLP; measured in many hundreds of µm). As a consequence of the scale, intermediate migration phenotypes that can be observed for LLP migration might not be easily visible for PP migration. Indeed, in our study, we chose to define a parapineal as non-migrating when its mean position was found between -15 μm and +15 μm of the midline (the standard width of the epiphysis). One can notice, however, that in the <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutant embryos where the parapineal migrates further than -15µm, the parapineal often migrates less far from the midline than in wildtype (Figure 1N); we thus do observe a range of phenotypes that goes from no migration to delayed migration rather than a black or white phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>rbpj a/b MO: given specific guidelines for MOs (Stainier et al., 2017), these experiments do not seem to be appropriately controlled.</p></disp-quote><p>These MO have been previously validated as their injection phenocopy the <italic>mib-/-</italic> mutant phenotype in neurogenesis and somites boundary (Echeverri and Oates, 2007). Furthermore, in our study it is only used as a second approach to confirm a role of the Notch pathway in parallel to our use of <italic>midbomb</italic> mutants. As the phenotypes are similar, we do not see a need to control as strictly as if we were only using the morpholinos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results related to the inhibitor treatment seem odd. If the γ-secretase inhibitor, LY411575, is specific and Notch is playing a role in migration and specification of this system, I would expect to see a result with treatment from the 22-32 hpf time period. This drug and it has only been published in two zebrafish papers. Why not use the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT that has been utilized in many other studies. Related to this, I am confused that 8-22 hour inhibitor treatment did not interfere with the Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP) transgene expression, neither did the 22-32 hour treatment. What is then the time window for Notch signaling that controls Tg(dusp6:d2EGFP) expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to use LY411575 as it is understood to be more powerful compared to the previously described γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT. For instance, in Rothenaigner et al., 2011, the authors compared the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT with a dose range of its second-generation derivative, LY411575 and noted that ‘LY411575 (10 µM) proved as efficient as 100 µM DAPT in interfering with Notch signaling. As such, since its first description in 2007 (Fauq et al., 2007) and its first use in zebrafish (Rothenaigner et al., 2011), LY411575 has become the gold standard in the literature at the expense of DAPT; although numbers are difficult to assess, there are definitively more studies describing the use of LY411575 in zebrafish than just the two papers one can find referenced on Pubmed when using ‘zebrafish’ and ‘LY411575’ as searching keywords. For instance, recently, Kozlovskaja-Gumbrienė et al., (<italic>eLife</italic> 2017) or Thomas et al., (<italic>eLife</italic> 2019) used LY411575 to block Notch pathway in the migrating lateral line primordium or in neuromasts and these studies are not among the publication easily found in Pubmed with searching keywords.</p><p>Concerning the second point, treating with LY411575 between 8-22 hpf or 22-32 hpf does not block parapineal migration and we speculated in the discussion about potential reasons.

The expression of <italic>her6</italic> and <italic>her9</italic> appear to be globally decreased in <italic>mib<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, as we observed previously, but also in LY411575 treated embryos.

One explanation is probably that fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization are not quantitative enough to allow us to detect modest decreases in the level of expression or in the number of <italic>her</italic> expressing parapineal cells. In addition, <italic>her6</italic> and <italic>her9</italic> expression as detected by fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations is often weak and/or punctate, which makes the quantification difficult.

However, the evidence that Notch pathway acts within parapineal cells remains weak: deltaB and the reporter expression are not robust enough to make that conclusion, and functional experiments testing this hypothesis are absent. Therefore, please tone down that conclusions and present alternative possibilities.</p><p>We will look forward to hearing from you with a revised article with tracked changes, and a response letter (uploaded as an editable file) describing the changes made in response to the decision and review comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful that the reviewers found our revised manuscript is an improvement and we would like to thank them again for their constructive comments.</p><p>Concerning the final request of the reviewers, as we detect mosaic expression of <italic>deltaB</italic> Notch ligand in the parapineal of a majority of embryos (1 or 2 cells in more than 2/3 of embryos at 32 hpf) and the expression of some Notch target genes (<italic>her6</italic> and <italic>her9</italic>), our preferred hypothesis is that Notch signaling acts in the parapineal to restrict FGF pathway. However, we fully agree that we have not provided concrete proof of this, and have moderated our conclusion accordingly. For this, we have added sentences to our discussion mentioning that Notch signaling could be required in the tissue surrounding the parapineal rather than in the parapineal itself or could possibly act simultaneously within and outside parapineal cells. We believe that our modifications correspond to your expectations but would be happy to consider any specific suggestions to improve further this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
