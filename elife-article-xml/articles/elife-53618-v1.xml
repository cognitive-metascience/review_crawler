metabolic process that is observed clinically by <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET). However, is increased glucose uptake important for tumor cells, and which transporters are implicated in vivo? In a genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we show that the deletion of only one highly expressed glucose transporter, Glut1 or Glut3, in cancer cells does not impair tumor growth, whereas their combined loss diminishes tumor development. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET analyses of tumors demonstrate that Glut1 and Glut3 loss decreases glucose uptake, which is mainly dependent on Glut1. Using <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing with correlated nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and electron microscopy, we also report the presence of lamellar body-like organelles in tumor cells accumulating glucose-derived biomass, depending partially on Glut1. Our results demonstrate the requirement for two glucose transporters in lung adenocarcinoma, the dual blockade of which could reach therapeutic responses not achieved by individual targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetically engineered mouse model of cancer</kwd><kwd>glucose transporters</kwd><kwd>lamellar bodies</kwd><kwd>lung adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>NanoSIMS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KFS-3681-08-2015-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contat</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Ancey</surname><given-names>Pierre-Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabatino</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Pascual</surname><given-names>Justine</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossier</surname><given-names>Anouk</given-names></name><name><surname>Meylan</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_133661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meylan</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_157527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contat</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Meylan</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anna Fuller Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contat</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Meylan</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Emma Muschamp Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contat</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Ancey</surname><given-names>Pierre-Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabatino</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Meylan</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In lung adenocarcinoma, deleting one glucose transporter, whether it is Glut1 or Glut3 is insufficient, whereas their dual deletion reduces tumor growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucose transporters are the first and rate-limiting step for cellular glucose utilization, a process often exacerbated in tumor cells that enables their growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ancey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>).

Additionally, in solid cancers, tumor cell growth can be fueled by nutrients other than glucose, or by using transporter-independent metabolic processes including autophagy and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karsli-Uzunbas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Romero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Son et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we exploited the <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/WT</sup>; Trp53<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> (KP) mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma to explore the importance of glucose transporters, expressed by tumor cells, in disease development. By glucose tracing and ultrastructural analyses, we identified the presence of lamellar body-like organelles in tumor cells, which are the primary site of glucose-derived biomass accumulation, occurring partly in a Glut1-dependent manner.

From a human tissue microarray comprising 18 cases of stage IB-IIB LUAD and 18 cases of stage IA-IIB lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), GLUT1 protein was detected in all tumors. Specifically, it showed intermediate and strong GLUT1 expression in 44% (8/18) and 56% (10/18) of the LUAD lesions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In LUSCs, GLUT1 exhibited strong staining in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), confirming previous results obtained from squamous cell carcinomas of lung and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goodwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hsieh et al., 2019</xref>). To obtain more information about <italic>SLC2A1</italic> expression in LUAD, we applied a non-negative matrix factorization of TCGA-LUAD samples, which generated four distinct clusters (NMF1-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). <italic>SLC2A1</italic> and <italic>SLC2A3</italic> were the most expressed in NMF4, which contains the highest percentage of the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the immunocompetent <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/WT</sup>; Trp53<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> (KP) mouse model where tumors consist of pure LUADs all harboring <italic>Trp53</italic> gene deletion, RNA sequencing analyses of bulk tumor samples revealed a predominance of NMF4-like lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Glut1 protein levels in tumor cells gradually increased along tumor progression, with the majority of advanced grade lesions being positive with intermediate or strong Glut1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In normal lung, Glut1 was only weakly expressed or undetectable in the alveolar compartment that comprises alveolar type-1 and 2 (AT1, AT2) cells, endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>), AT2 cells being considered as the principal tumor cell-of-origin in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, Glut1 was strongly expressed in the bronchiolar epithelial compartment that contains Club cells, another cell type permissive to tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). To determine the contribution of Glut1 for tumor development, we crossed KP mice to <italic>Slc2a1<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> (G1) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Young et al., 2011</xref>), and initiated tumors in the resulting KPG1 mice and control KP mice by intratracheal lentiviral-Cre instillation (Lenti.PGK-Cre, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>). During tumor progression, we detected slightly but not significantly reduced changes in tumor growth rates monitored by X-rays micro-computed tomography (μCT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At sacrifice, although no significant difference was observed in the weight or in the number of lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>), a significant reduction of high grade tumors (grades 4 and 5) was determined upon Glut1 loss in KP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Because there was no significant increase in KPG1 mouse survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), these data together fail to reveal a clear impact of Glut1 deletion in the tumor epithelial cells on disease progression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Glut1 deletion does not impact disease progression in <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/WT</sup>; Trp53<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gene expression level (RSEM) of glucose transporters in TCGA-LUAD samples (n = 511).

Intense <sup>13</sup>C enrichments inside tumors revealed a compartmentalized intracellular accumulation of glucose-derived biomass, which can be attributed to a specific organelle of tumor cells visualized by the superposition of images obtained from scanning EM (SEM) and NanoSIMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). From SEM and transmission EM (TEM), these organelles resemble lamellar bodies (LBs) based on their size, secretory behavior and morphology, which exhibit more or less packed, occasionally visible lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). LBs are lipid-rich secretory organelles specifically produced in the lung by AT2 cells, responsible for surfactant production and release into the alveolar space. Within tumor cells, these LB-like organelles (LBOs) were typically from 200 nm to 2 μm in diameter, irregularly shaped and darkly stained. Often these contained more heavily stained regions and discernible tightly packed lamellae at higher magnifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized the existence of an alternative mechanism that sustains lung tumor growth. First, we isolated KP and KPG1 tumors, prepared single cell suspensions and tested their glycolytic capacity. In this <italic>ex vivo</italic> experimental setting, KPG1 tumors failed to stimulate glycolysis in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). As exception, one KPG1 tumor displayed the strongest glycolytic response of all tested tumors, which coincided with elevated expression of another high-affinity glucose transporter, Glut3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To understand better the mechanisms of Glut1-deficient tumor progression, we also performed RNA sequencing analyses from the non-immune (CD45<sup>-</sup>) fraction of KP and KPG1 tumors. To increase the relevance of this comparison, we analysed three cohorts of mice, where tumors were initiated with Lenti.PGK-Cre, Ad5.SPC-Cre or Ad5.CC10-Cre, the latter two providing SPC<sup>+</sup>- or CC10<sup>+</sup>-cell restricted Cre expression for tumor initiation in distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) highlighted, from all the Hallmark and KEGG up- and downregulated pathways, a unique significantly shared pathway between the three cohorts, which was upregulated in KPG1: ‘Hallmark_bile acid metabolism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Upon closer examination of the genes included in this pathway, we identified several target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), a crucial transcription factor in fatty acid catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Reddy and Hashimoto, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, when interrogating the expression of known PPARα targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010</xref>), GSEA highlighted their enrichment in KPG1 compared to KP tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Thus, KPG1 tumors have a stronger expression of known PPARα-target genes than KP lesions. Together, our metabolic and molecular analyses suggested two possible and distinct routes for Glut1-deficient tumor growth: the uptake of the same nutrient through another glucose transporter, Glut3, or <italic>via</italic> a PPARα-dependent metabolic shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Glut1-deficient tumor analyses suggest Glut3- or PPARα-dependent compensatory mechanisms.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (left) Tumor-derived single cell preparations were placed in a Seahorse XF analyzer and subjected to longitudinal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements.

Doxycycline-mediated PPARαΔ13 induction in KP mice led only to a trend toward a reduction in tumor growth rates, comparable to the growth of KPG1 versus KP tumors. Within the KPG1 group, PPARαΔ13 induction did not further reduce tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Global gene expression analyses from tumor samples confirmed the functionality of the PPARαΔ13 construct in both KP and KPG1 tumors, as ‘Hallmark_bile acid metabolism’, ‘Hallmark_fatty acid metabolism’, ‘KEGG_peroxisome’ and ‘KEGG_ fatty acid metabolism’ pathways were repressed in tumors harboring this construct compared to tumors from KP-rtTA or KPG1-rtTA mice not fed on a doxycycline diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Thus, although PPARαΔ13 downregulates PPARα-related pathways in tumors, it fails to affect their growth even in absence of Glut1.</p><p>To test our second hypothesis, we initially monitored Glut3 expression in tumors. By real-time PCR, <italic>Slc2a3</italic> was expressed to varying levels but not significantly differently between KP and KPG1 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

In absence of Glut1 (KLG1), <italic>Slc2a3</italic> mRNA expression remained very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Accordingly, Glut3 protein was undetectable by immunohistochemistry in KL and KLG1 tumors, whereas it was expressed in KP and KPG1 lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). More specifically, Glut3 stained at the tumor cell membrane in a minority (37%) of small and a majority (76%) of big KP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Furthermore, within Glut3-expressing KP tumors, areas positive for Glut3 frequently correlated with a stronger expression of Glut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>), suggesting intra-tumor heterogeneity in glucose utilization in this mouse model, as demonstrated earlier in human non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hensley et al., 2016</xref>). We then crossed KP mice to <italic>Slc2a3<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice (generating KPG3 mice, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>). When comparing tumor development in KP and KPG3 animals, we failed to detect differences in overall tumor growth rates, <italic>ex vivo</italic> glycolysis, mouse survival, or tumor grade distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–d</xref>). Although this indicates that Glut3 deletion alone does not affect tumors in a detectable manner, we next wanted to evaluate its importance in a Glut1-deficient context. To do this, we generated KPG1G3 mice by interbreeding KP mice with <italic>Slc2a1<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc2a3<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>). Deletion of the two glucose transporters, Glut1 and Glut3, from the tumor epithelial cell compartment resulted in a decreased number of tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Furthermore, contrasting with our data obtained from each separately-targeted Gluts, combined Glut1 and Glut3 deletion led to a significant reduction of tumor growth rates monitored by μCT scans, to a reduced tumor size with an absence of big (&gt;50 mg) lesions at sacrifice, to a decrease of high grade tumors, and to an extended mouse survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). This synergistic action of the dual Glut1 and Glut3 deletion was also demonstrated in vitro with four different human NSCLC cell lines, on which the strongest reduction of tumor cell viability resulted from the combined knockdown of these glucose transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c–f</xref>).

The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of each tumor revealed that Glut1-deficient KP tumors incorporated significantly less <sup>18</sup>F-FDG than control lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–i</xref>), which strengthens the NanoSIMS data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Glut3-deficient and control KP tumors presented a similar <sup>18</sup>F-FDG absorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–i</xref>). This result might be explained by the fact that Glut3 positive KP tumors mainly co-express Glut1 and Glut3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Thus, in absence of Glut3, lesions might certainly incorporate <sup>18</sup>F-FDG <italic>via</italic> Glut1. The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG absorption of Glut1- and Glut3-deficient KP tumors was significantly reduced as compared to control KP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–i</xref>). Because glucose uptake was not significantly lower in KPG3 compared to KP tumors, and in KPG1G3 compared to KPG1 tumors, a possible explanation is that most tumors analyzed had not yet gained Glut3 expression and become dependent on it, which agrees with an elevated Glut3 expression specifically in big lesions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Finally, to investigate if Glut1- and Glut3-deficient tumors might incorporate glucose <italic>via</italic> another glucose transporter, we performed a gene expression analysis of glucose transporter family members on KP and KPG1G3 lesions. This analysis showed that the expression of no other glucose transporter was changed upon dual Glut1 and Glut3 deletion in KP tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that deleting Glut1 and Glut3 in KP tumors reduces glucose uptake, and that Glut1 highly contributes to glucose uptake in KP tumors. These results may also lead to the hypothesis that at least a part of the remaining <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET signal detected in KPG1G3 tumors might come from glucose uptake by the cells of the tumor immune microenvironment.</p><p>Recently, pharmacological inhibition of a secondary active, Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glucose transporter, Sglt2, showed its role in premalignant KP lung lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scafoglio et al., 2018</xref>), while a glycolytic switch was identified in advanced compared to early tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kerr et al., 2016</xref>). These studies, together with our gene targeting approaches, definitively demonstrate the importance of glucose utilization for LUAD development in vivo. In the KL model, Glut1 deletion impairs LUSC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hsieh et al., 2019</xref>), and we find that Lkb1-deficient lung tumors lack detectable Glut3, precluding any compensation occurring through this transporter. In contrast, in pure LUAD our results indicate that <italic>Trp53</italic>-deficient tumor cells depend on glucose uptake based on a redundant system, whereby the expression of either Glut1 or Glut3 is sufficient to sustain tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). For clinical perspectives, we anticipate that dual Glut1 and Glut3 blockade will be necessary to achieve strong anti-tumor efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The last time frame (labeling steady-state) was used to derive standardized uptake values (SUV) images and measure maximal SUV (SUV<sub>max</sub>) values over tumor regions.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>R<sub>ROI</sub></italic> represents the radioactivity concentration measured in the region of interest (ROI), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the injected activity corrected for the radiotracer decay and <italic>w</italic> is the mouse weight.</p><p>PMOD 2.95 software (PMOD Technologies, Zurich) was used for the determination of the standardized uptake value (SUV) and for the delineation of the tumors’ ROIs, based on a visual slice-by-slice matching with the corresponding μCT images.

The suppression of tumor growth and tumor number is due to reduced cell proliferation or there`s also increased cell death?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Contat et al. assess the role of Glut1 and Glut3 expression in the KP mouse model of lung cancer. They show that either transporter alone is dispensible for tumor growth, but deletion of both transporters extends mouse survival. Using nanoSIMS, they also show that glucose carbon accumulates in lamellar bodies, although what these structures are or how they relate to tumor growth is not clear. Overall, this work supports some requirement for glucose uptake in lung cancer and is consistent with another paper showing Glut1 is required for tumor growth in a different lung cancer model. The major deficiency of the study is that glucose uptake is never directly assessed in vivo. Some other points to consider are listed below.</p><p>1) The Abstract implies that glucose uptake may not be important based on Glut1 deletion, although then suggests it is important since Glut3 is required if Glut1 is absent. Also it is stated that expression of two glucose transporters is needed, but it also may be their function is redundant. While many would argue that a role for glucose metabolism in tumors is well established, some work has questioned this recently and being clear about their findings in the Abstract is important to prevent further confusion in the field.</p><p>2) The use of nanoSIMS to assess glucose fate following glucose transporter deletion is interesting, however this is a poor surrogate for glucose uptake (see below). Given that FDG-PET is a commonly used way to assess glucose uptake in patients and mice, one is left wondering what effect Glut1 loss has on overall glucose uptake. Can FDG-PET be compared in KP and KPG1 mice?</p><p>3) IP injection of 13C-labeled glucose will achieve a steady state labeling and thus differences in accumulation in lamellar bodies could be caused by differences in uptake between different models. This is another reason why assessment of FDG-PET uptake would be useful to interpret these data.</p><p>4) It is implied based on ex vivo data that some cells adapt to Glut1 loss via Glut3 expression while other rely on PPARα. This is speculative at best, particularly when the dominant negative construct had a marginal effect. A simpler experiment test might be to ask if PPARα expression anti-correlates with Glut3 expression via IHC in tumors?</p><p>5) For completeness the effect of Glut3 loss, and combined Glut1/Glut3 loss on FDG-PET uptake would improve the study.</p><p>6) As the authors point out, Glut1 is required for tumor growth in the KL model. The fact that KL tumors fail to express Glut3 is a nice explanation for why Glut1 is not needed in the KP model. If the authors also have data on Glut1 and Glut3 deletion in the KL model it would make this point more clearly and be nice to include, although if the data are not available it would take too long to generate these data for this paper.</p><p>7) The extension in mouse survival with dual deletion of Glut1 and Glut3 is fairly modest. Is their data on whether the tumors that eventually form still take up glucose via another mechanism?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53618.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We appreciate the value in formally examining the requirement for GLUT1 and GLUT3 in lung cancers, however it was noted that glucose uptake was not formally examined in any system.

We have compared the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of each tumor and observed that Glut1-deficient KP tumors incorporated significantly less <sup>18</sup>F-FDG than the control lesions, which strengthened the NanoSIMS data (see manuscript Figure 2D). Glut3-deficient and control KP tumors presented a similar <sup>18</sup>F-FDG absorption. This result might be explained by the fact that Glut3 positive KP tumors mainly co-express Glut1 and Glut3 (see manuscript Figure 4—figure supplement 1D), or that some small tumors do not yet express Glut3. Thus, in absence of Glut3, lesions might certainly incorporate <sup>18</sup>F-FDG <italic>via</italic> Glut1. The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG absorption of Glut1- and Glut3-deficient KP tumors was significantly reduced as compared to control KP lesions. Of note, the two KPG1G3 tumors showing a high <sup>18</sup>F-FDG incorporation were probably escapers for one or both glucose transporters. These overall data suggest, as expected, that deleting glucose transporters in KP tumors reduces glucose uptake and that Glut1 mainly contributes to glucose uptake in KP tumors (Figure 4H-IA).</p><p>Material and methods:</p><p><sup>“18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucosewith positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET)</p><p>in vivo measurements of the tumors’ glucose uptake were performed on a group of animals (n = 14, i.e. 3 KP, 4 KPG1, 3 KPG3 and 4 KPG1G3, fasted overnight) with positron emission tomography (PET) as previously described in detail (Lanz et al., 2014).

Because our previous study highlighted that GLUT3 expression varies a lot between lung tumor cell lines (Masin et al., 2014), we selected four cell lines that express well GLUT3: A549, H460, Calu-6, and SW 1573.

We interbred KP<sup>frt</sup> animals with Glut1<sup>Flox/Flox</sup> mice, generating the KP<sup>frt</sup>G1 mouse model. We made a lentiviral vector expressing FlpO and CreER-T2 from a bi-directional promoter. We first validated, in vitro, the functionality of FlpO in recombining Frt sites, and CreER-T2 in recombining LoxP sites specifically upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen administration. We then intratracheally instilled KP<sup>frt</sup>G1 mice with the aforementioned lentiviral vector and followed tumor development using X-rays micro-computed tomography (μCT). At 41 weeks and 6 days post-tumor initiation, we injected mice with either vehicle control or with 4 doses of tamoxifen (100 μg/g of mouse every 3 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). We repeated tumor growth monitoring using μCT scans 2 weeks after the first tamoxifen injection, just before sacrifice. After sacrifice, we prepared lung sections for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.</p><p>To assess if Glut3 levels change upon acute Glut1 deletion, we analysed Glut1 and Glut3 protein expression by IHC staining. Our data showed that 50% of Glut1-deficient tumors (= tamoxifen-treated mice with no detectable expression of Glut1 in tumors) express Glut3 protein. In contrast, from this cohort 0% of Glut1-positive tumors (= vehicle-treated mice with detectable expression of Glut1 in tumors) express Glut3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B-C</xref>). Longitudinal μCT-based tumor growth rate measurements (n = 5 tumors from control-treated mice and n = 3 tumors from tamoxifen-treated mice) revealed that acute Glut1 deletion in established tumors seems to decrease tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2D</xref>). Besides, phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) staining indicated that Glut1-deficient KP tumors have a significantly reduced proliferation as compared to control KP tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that acute Glut1 deletion in established KP tumors reduce tumor growth, which might be partially compensated by an increased Glut3 protein expression.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Acute Glut1 deletion in established KP<sup>frt</sup> tumors may decrease tumor growth and may induce Glut3 expression.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mouse model of acute Glut1 deletion.

In contrast, we agree with Goodwin et al., 2017, that GLUT1 is always highly expressed in LUSC (score 2 in 18/18 cases). We also agree with Goodwin et al., 2017, that GLUT1 mRNA expression is higher in LUSC than in LUAD, when analysing data from the TCGA database (Figure 1B of their paper and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). However, we disagree that GLUT1 is minimally expressed in LUAD; GLUT1 is just less expressed in LUAD than in LUSC.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Glucose transporter expression in human lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) and in human lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD).</title><p>Gene expression level (RSEM) of glucose transporters in TCGA-LUSC (n = 501) and in TCGA-LUAD samples (n = 515).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53618-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we have compared the prognostic value of GLUT1 mRNA expression in LUAD and LUSC from the TCGA database.

The suppression of tumor growth and tumor number is due to reduced cell proliferation or there`s also increased cell death?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now looked at cell proliferation and cell death by IHC using anti-phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) staining, respectively. Unfortunately, cleaved caspase-3 staining did not reveal any apoptotic cell, which may be explained by the fact that we focused on a quick apoptotic process, the cleaved caspase-3 detection, at a specific time windows, the sacrifice. We may consequently have missed this rapid event on the IHC staining. Concerning cell proliferation, we surprisingly quantified an increased proliferation rate of KPG1G3 tumors compared to control KP lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>), which was particularly evident in small lesions. We then hypothesised, but unfortunately were not able to test it, that the immune microenvironment of KPG1G3 tumors might be more active than the one of the KP lesions. Ping-Chih Ho et al., 2015, indeed demonstrated that the anti-tumor T cell effector functions were regulated by glucose availability in tumor microenvironment with a glucose-deficient microenvironment suppressing the T cell anti-tumor response. KPG1G3 tumors absorbing much less glucose than the control KP lesions (see Essential revisions point 1), glucose might be available at higher concentration in the microenvironment, allowing the anti-tumor T cell effector functions to normally behave and attack the tumor cells. KPG1G3 tumor development should thus be controlled by the immune cells. The communication between glucose uptake in tumor cells and the functionality of the tumor-associated immune cells is an area of interest of our laboratory, but we believe these studies will go beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>KPG1G3 tumors proliferate significantly more than KP lesions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Dot plot with mean ± s.d shows percent of pHH3 positive cells per KP or KPG1G3 tumors (n = 4, 6 mice and n = 115, 101 tumors, respectively) at sacrifice. ****: p &lt; 0.0001 by Mann-Whitney test.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53618-resp-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Contat et al. assess the role of Glut1 and Glut3 expression in the KP mouse model of lung cancer. They show that either transporter alone is dispensible for tumor growth, but deletion of both transporters extends mouse survival. Using nanoSIMS, they also show that glucose carbon accumulates in lamellar bodies, although what these structures are or how they relate to tumor growth is not clear. Overall, this work supports some requirement for glucose uptake in lung cancer and is consistent with another paper showing Glut1 is required for tumor growth in a different lung cancer model. The major deficiency of the study is that glucose uptake is never directly assessed in vivo. Some other points to consider are listed below.</p><p>1) The Abstract implies that glucose uptake may not be important based on Glut1 deletion, although then suggests it is important since Glut3 is required if Glut1 is absent. Also it is stated that expression of two glucose transporters is needed, but it also may be their function is redundant. While many would argue that a role for glucose metabolism in tumors is well established, some work has questioned this recently and being clear about their findings in the Abstract is important to prevent further confusion in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation, and in response we have modified the Abstract. We hope this version is now clearer about our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of nanoSIMS to assess glucose fate following glucose transporter deletion is interesting, however this is a poor surrogate for glucose uptake (see below). Given that FDG-PET is a commonly used way to assess glucose uptake in patients and mice, one is left wondering what effect Glut1 loss has on overall glucose uptake. Can FDG-PET be compared in KP and KPG1 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To respond to this critical point, raised as Essential revision point 1, we have now used <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET imaging and have compared tumors from KP, KPG1, KPG3 and KPG1G3 mice.

The fact that KL tumors fail to express Glut3 is a nice explanation for why Glut1 is not needed in the KP model. If the authors also have data on Glut1 and Glut3 deletion in the KL model it would make this point more clearly and be nice to include, although if the data are not available it would take too long to generate these data for this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point.</p><p>Because we measured only very low Glut3 mRNA expression and failed to detect the protein in KL tumors (see manuscript Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B), we never generated KLG3 mice.</p><p>We had generated KLG1 mice and studied KL and KLG1 tumor development. However, we did not include these data in the manuscript since analysis of tumors from KLG1 mice have been reported recently (Hsieh et al., 2019). In that paper, Hsieh et al., 2019 showed a near-absence of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in Glut1-deficient condition and no difference in total tumor burden between KL and KLG1 tumors. They concluded that Glut1 is critical for adenocarcinoma transdifferentiation and so LUSC development. Of note, in this model LUSCs develop from a transdifferentiation of LUADs (Han et al., 2014).</p><p>Accordingly to Hsieh et al., 2019 study, we confirmed that Glut1 deletion in KL tumors impacts neither overall mouse survival, nor tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7A-B</xref>). Unexpectedly, after having used X-rays micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis to longitudinally follow KLG1 and KL tumor development, we observed that Glut1 deficiency led to a significantly accelerated tumor growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7C</xref>). Intrigued by these findings, we collected a few tumors from both genotypes after sacrifice and performed an RNA sequencing. Our analyses identified an increased cell cycle signature in Glut1-deficient KL lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7D</xref>), which corroborates the observed increased tumor growth of KLG1 lesions. We interpret these data as follows: KL tumors require Glut1 for LUAD-to-LUSC transdifferentiation, and Glut1 deletion prevents this, as reported by Hsieh et al., 2019. However, in Glut1 wild-type tumors, this transdifferentiation happens at the expense of a decreased tumor cell division. Accordingly, our data demonstrate that tumor cell proliferation marks are more elevated in absence of Glut1 and that in vivo tumor growth is faster: KLG1 LUAD tumors keep growing. Although we present these data for the reviewers, we do not feel confident enough yet to include them in the present manuscript, as we need confirmation of these surprising findings before.</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>The increased KLG1 tumor growth does not impact the overall mouse survival.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53618-resp-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(a) Kaplan-Meier curves of KL (n = 6) and KLG1 (n = 5) mice. ns: not significant by Log-rank test.

In other words, KPG1G3 mice lifespan is about 23% longer than the one of the control mice. Of note, in this survival analysis 2 out of 6 KPG1G3 mice analyzed were still alive and looked fine when we stopped the experiment.</p><p>Based on our new <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET imaging of glucose uptake (See the response to Essential revisions point 1), we can now conclude that although KPG1G3 tumors still absorb glucose, this uptake is significantly decreased as compared to control KP lesions. Thus, to determine if Glut1- and Glut3-deficient tumors might incorporate this remaining glucose <italic>via</italic> another glucose transporter, we performed a gene expression analysis of glucose transporter family members on KP and KPG1G3 tumors. This analysis revealed that no other glucose transporter is induced upon Glut1 and Glut3 deletion in KP tumors.
