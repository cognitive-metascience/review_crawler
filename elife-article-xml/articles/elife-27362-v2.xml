architecturally complex dendritic arbors. While the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports dendritic translation, most dendrites lack the Golgi apparatus (GA), an essential organelle for conventional secretory trafficking. Thus, whether secretory cargo is locally trafficked in dendrites through a non-canonical pathway remains a fundamental question. Here we define the dendritic trafficking itinerary for key synaptic molecules in rat cortical neurons. Following ER exit, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 and neuroligin 1 undergo spatially restricted entry into the dendritic secretory pathway and accumulate in recycling endosomes (REs) located in dendrites and spines before reaching the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, GluA1 surface delivery occurred even when GA function was disrupted. Thus, in addition to their canonical role in protein recycling, REs also mediate forward secretory trafficking in neuronal dendrites and spines through a specialized GA-independent trafficking network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27362.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells must produce, sort and deliver molecular building blocks to the right places at the right time and in appropriate amounts. This is particularly important for neurons, which are the largest and most structurally complex cells in the body. A typical neuron consists of a cell body covered in branches called dendrites, plus a single cable-like structure known as an axon. Dendrites receive inputs from other neurons and relay the information to the cell body in the form of electrical signals. The cell body processes these electrical signals and the resulting signals then travel along the axon to terminals at the far-end. The axon terminals in turn pass the signals on to the dendrites of other neurons via junctions called synapses.</p><p>For synapses to work correctly, the membranes surrounding the dendrites need to contain receptor proteins that can detect incoming signals. These proteins must be continually replenished, raising the question of how newly made receptor molecules are shuttled to the appropriate locations within the dendrites.</p><p>A series of compartments called the Golgi complex play an important role in processing newly-made proteins in many different types of cells. As proteins pass through the Golgi, enzymes within the tunnel walls modify the proteins by adding or removing molecular groups. Therefore, it has been suggested that the route that the synapse receptor proteins take through the neuron to reach the dendrites always includes a visit to the Golgi. However, the Golgi complex in neurons is mostly confined to the cell body, raising the question of whether proteins that are locally produced within dendrites can make the journey to nearby synapses without visiting the Golgi complex.</p><p>Bowen et al. used a microscope to follow the movements of synapse receptor proteins through neurons grown in a dish. The experiments show that proteins destined for the dendrites make a number of stops after leaving the cell body. However, some synaptic proteins reach the dendrites without passing through the Golgi at all, suggesting neurons are much less dependent on the Golgi to process newly-made proteins than other types of cells.</p><p>Genetic mutations that prevent proteins from finding their way to their required destinations, or that disrupt the work of enzymes inside trafficking stations like the Golgi, cause numerous human diseases. Understanding how proteins travel to specific destinations inside healthy cells should also help reveal what happens when this process fails.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>recycling endosome</kwd><kwd>AMPA receptor</kwd><kwd>secretory trafficking</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>secretory network</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS082271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 NS092421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowen</surname><given-names>Aaron B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourke</surname><given-names>Ashley M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la SantÃ© et de la Recherche MÃ©dicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanus</surname><given-names>Cyril</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1553798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourke</surname><given-names>Ashley M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE16-0009-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanus</surname><given-names>Cyril</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons use a non-canonical secretory network to deliver select proteins to postsynaptic sites in dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons face the challenge of tuning protein levels in dendritic processes that can project hundreds of micrometers from their cell bodies. Rather than solely relying on diffusion or long-range active transport of proteins synthesized in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2016</xref>), many dendritic proteins are synthesized near their site of action. Indeed, mRNAs encoding thousands of different proteins are found in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>), where their regulated translation is critical for neuronal dendrite development, maintenance and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bramham and Wells, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanus and Schuman, 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, many of these dendritic mRNAs encode secreted factors and critical integral membrane proteins, implying the presence of a satellite secretory system for local processing and trafficking of newly synthesized cargo. In addition to locally translated proteins, nascent proteins synthesized in the soma can also enter dendritic compartments through lateral diffusion in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>), or by active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valenzuela et al., 2014</xref>), since the ER network is contiguous throughout the somatodendritic domain. In contrast, most dendrites (~80%) lack Golgi apparatus (GA), a defining organelle of the cellular secretory network that mediates canonical post-ER trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krijnse-Locker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Torre and Steward, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanus et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, whether dendrites can support local secretory trafficking in the absence of GA and if so, the identity and spatial distribution of the organelles responsible have remained fundamental issues.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrate that cargo exiting the dendritic ER is initially directed to ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGICs), a collection of tubulovesicular membranes distributed throughout all dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krijnse-Locker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanus et al., 2014</xref>). The ERGIC network normally shuttles proteins between the ER and GA. However, given the lack of dendritic GA, the fate of dendritic secretory cargo following ERGIC accumulation remains unclear. In addition to mediating bi-directional trafficking at the ER-Golgi boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Tekaya et al., 2005</xref>), ERGIC membranes are also reported to physically interact with recycling endosomes (REs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marie et al., 2009</xref>). A number of secretory proteins traffic through REs on their initial voyage to the PM, and some cargoes, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR), may enter the RE network in a GA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grieve and Rabouille, 2011</xref>). The broad dendritic distribution of REs, including within a large fraction of dendritic spines, makes them well suited to mediate forward trafficking to the plasma membrane with high spatial precision, perhaps at the level of individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>). However, whether REs play any role in forward trafficking in neuronal dendrites remains unknown.</p><p>To better understand the organization of the neuronal secretory pathway, we employed an ER sequestration/inducible release strategy to visualize the trafficking itinerary for the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GluA1) and the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 1 (NL1) in neuronal dendrites. Following ER-release, we observed rapid, spatially confined delivery of GluA1 to dendritic ERGICs. This was immediately followed by robust accumulation in spine and dendritic REs, which were often observed in close physical proximity to ERGIC. Forward trafficking through REs to the plasma membrane still occurred even after GA function was disrupted with brefeldin A (BFA), indicating that a significant fraction of cargo enters the RE network in a GA-independent manner. Accordingly, disrupting RE function impaired surface delivery of GluA1 released from the ER. Combined, these data support a novel GA-independent mode of local trafficking in dendrites via a satellite secretory network defined by the ERGIC and RE networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inducible release of synaptic cargo molecules from the ER</title><p>In order to specifically visualize synaptic proteins trafficking through the neuronal secretory pathway, we employed a previously described inducible ER release system based on a self-associating mutant of FKBP (F<sub>M</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>). Proteins of interest are trapped in the ER by fusing them to tandem repeats of F<sub>M</sub>, but can be conditionally released by adding a biologically inert rapamycin analog (<underline>d</underline>imer-<underline>d</underline>imer <underline>s</underline>olubilizer or DDS), which dissociates F<sub>M</sub> multimers, allowing ER exit and progression through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, using live cell fluorescence microscopy, we can directly visualize a bolus of secretory cargo as it exits the ER and populates each organelle of the secretory pathway. We engineered ER-retained versions of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 (3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1) and the synaptic cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 1 (4xF<sub>M</sub>-NL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We included a consensus cleavage site for the GA-resident protease furin so that the F<sub>M</sub> repeat domains are removed as cargo transits the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We initially verified inducible ER release of NL1 (4xF<sub>M</sub>-NL1) in COS7 cells. Prior to addition of DDS, 4xF<sub>M</sub>-NL1 strongly colocalizes with an engineered ER marker (TfR-KDEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Following addition of 1 ÂµM DDS, 4xF<sub>M</sub>-NL1 rapidly redistributes to the perinuclear GA and ultimately to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Because AMPA receptors do not robustly traffic to the surface of non-neuronal cells, we tested ER retention and release of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 in dissociated cortical neuronal cultures. Without DDS, the distribution of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 closely resembled the endogenous ER-marker BIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Adding DDS triggered robust accumulation of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 in the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To verify subsequent PM delivery, we surface labeled live cortical neurons expressing 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 at various time-points following DDS addition using an antibody directed toward an engineered hemagglutinin (HA) tag on the extracellular domain of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed very low background levels of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 on the cell surface prior to release and robust surface delivery following ER-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). 4xF<sub>M</sub>-SEP-NL1 was also efficiently delivered to the cell surface of neurons following addition of DDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Significant surface delivery was detectable within two hours following ER-release for both cargoes. Maximum levels were reached at four and eight hours for NL1 and GluA1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). Following delivery to the PM, both GluA1 and NL1 localized to dendrites and spines, consistent with previous reports using similarly tagged expression constructs and their associated fluorescent proteins were sensitive to thrombin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chih et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patterson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27362.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inducible release system to investigate the dendritic secretory network.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting inducible release constructs.

We fused the photoconvertible fluorescent protein mEOS3.2 to 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 and locally photoconverted ER-localized 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mEOS-GluA1 from green to red in either dendrites or the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). For dendritic release experiments, we photoconverted 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mEOS-GluA1 within a 30â40 Âµm stretch of dendritic ER located approximately 50 Âµm from the soma. Locally photoconverted 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mEOS-GluA1 (hereafter referred to as mEOS*-GluA1) displayed limited mobility in the absence of DDS, consistent with effective clustering and ER retention by the F<sub>M</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, when we added DDS, mEOS-GluA1* exited the ER and accumulated in nearby trafficking organelles (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Two hours after dendritic photoconversion and ER-release, we observed that most mEOS*-GluA1 redistributed to trafficking organelles within dendrites, with only 12.9 Â± 3.0% (meanÂ Â±Â SEM, nÂ =Â 9 neurons from 3 experiments) of the photoconverted signal returning to the neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).

This analysis revealed that mEOS*-GluA1 preferentially accumulated at organelles close to or within the initial photoconverted region with a length constant (i.e. distance over which the photoconverted signal decreases to 63.2% relative to the edge of the photoconverted region) of 11.6 Âµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; nÂ =Â 5 neurons from 3 experiments). Conversely, after somatic photoconversion, we observed minimal entry of mEOS*-GluA1 into dendritic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Together, these experiments reveal a striking compartmentalization of the early secretory pathway between dendrites and soma, with little crosstalk, even though the ER is contiguous between these cellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synaptic cargo accumulates in dendritic ERGIC following ER exit</title><p>We next investigated the identity of the dendritic organelle that first receives GluA1 following ER exit. We first tested whether cargo flux through these organelles, like GA, was sensitive to temperature. We performed temperature block experiments where we maintained cells at 20 ËC during cargo release from the ER. While cargo can exit the ER at this temperature, it stalls in the GA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matlin and Simons, 1983</xref>). Indeed, we observed robust accumulation of newly released GluA1 in the somatic GA under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, we also observed cargo stalling in punctate dendritic organelles in nearly every dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Based on this temperature block experiment, we initially hypothesized these structures were previously described Golgi outposts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horton et al., 2005</xref>). However using antibodies against canonical GA markers we could only detect GA in a small minority of dendritic branches, usually proximal to the soma, in agreement with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krijnse-Locker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Torre and Steward, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiol et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, the dendritic GluA1 puncta that arose following ER release did not colocalize with classical <italic>cis-</italic> (GM130) or <italic>trans-</italic>GA markers (TGN38) even though the somatic GA was strongly labeled for both markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A previous study reported accumulation of a non-neuronal cargo in dendritic ERGICs shortly following ER release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanus et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with this study, we observed ERGIC membranes throughout the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). We also observed that the 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 puncta that formed early following ER release strongly colocalized with ERGIC53, detected either by antibody staining for endogenous p58 (rat homologue of ERGIC53) or by expressing GFP-ERGIC53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Colocalization between GFP-ERGIC53 and 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 peakedÂ ~50â60 min following ER-release, and declined as cargo progressed through the secretory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These experiments provide evidence for a local dendritic trafficking network, but we also wanted to determine whether long-range trafficking from the somatic GA to dendritic domains also occurs. To address this issue, we released 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 from the ER and allowed it to accumulate in the somatic GA and dendritic ERGICs for 1 hr. We then photobleached all of the detectable dendritic signal while preserving the somatic GA signal and performed rapid timelapse imagingÂ ~1 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We observed both mobile and stationary mCh-GluA1 puncta accumulate in dendrites with a proximal (more abundant) to distal gradient during the recovery period. Thus, transport from the somatic GA to the dendritic arbor (especially proximal regions) can also occur.

To do so, we utilized the extracellular thrombin cleavage site in 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 located between mCh and GluA1 and performed our co-trafficking assay in the presence of extracellular thrombin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Because thrombin quickly removes the fluorescent tag from surface GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), we would expect to observe a reduction in mCh-GluA1/GFP-Rab11 cotrafficking if prior surface trafficking is required for entry into the RE network. However, thrombin had no effect on the extent of Rab11/GluA1 co-trafficking following ER release supporting a prominent role for REs in forward trafficking in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>It remains formally possible that GluA1 could be inserted into the PM and then quickly endocytosed into the RE network before thrombin acts. While this possibility is unlikely given the slow basal rate of AMPA receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehlers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Passafaro et al., 2001</xref>), we confirmed anterograde RE trafficking using an entirely different strategy. We engineered a soluble anterograde trafficking marker consisting of mCh fused to four F<sub>M</sub> domains (4xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh). It is impossible for this cargo to recycle since it is released into the media following exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We observed nearly identical co-trafficking of 4xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh and GFP-Rab11 as we did with 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 and GFP-Rab11 (48.9 Â± 3% of Rab11 vesicles contained 4xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh 2.5 hr post-release; meanÂ Â±Â SEM; nÂ =Â 8 neurons from 2 experiments), indicating that RE-mediated forward trafficking in dendrites applies to soluble as well as integral membrane secretory cargoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). We further confirmed the generality of this trafficking route using a different synaptic protein NL1, which also entered the RE network soon after ER-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The comparatively rapid entry of NL1 into the RE network is consistent with its accelerated surface delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) relative to GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, we determined the location of newly trafficked GluA1 insertion into the neuronal PM by visualizing discrete insertion events using the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein superecliptic pHluorin (SEP) fused to GluA1. Because SEP is quenched in the acidic RE lumen, discrete exocytosis events can be observed as the RE fuses with the PM and quickly neutralizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yudowski et al., 2007</xref>). We included extracellular thrombin in this experiment to remove the SEP tag from the surface pool of receptors to limit the possibility of visualizing re-insertion of recycled receptors. We observed that 67 Â± 8% of fusion events occurred in the dendritic arbor vs. 33 Â± 8% in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GluA1 accumulates in a fraction of spine endosomes following ER release</title><p>Consistent with previous reports, we observed REs throughout dendrites, including within 48% of dendritic spines, the major postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>).

During live-cell imaging of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 and TfR-HaloTag (TfR-HT) labelled with HaloTag ligand JF646 (HTL-646) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>), we noted the accumulation of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 in spine REs that initially lacked GluA1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). We quantified the fraction of RE-positive spines that gained GluA1 signal 150 min following ER release in extracellular solution containing thrombin to eliminate recycling receptors from our analysis. We found that 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 was detectable within 20.6 Â± 3.7% of RE-positive spines vs only 4.8 Â± 2.1% in control (no ER release) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>; meanÂ Â±Â SEM, nÂ =Â 5 neurons/condition from 2 experiments, p=0.006 unpaired two-tailed Studentâs t-test.). Accordingly, when we surface labeled mCh-GluA1 receptors 120 min following ER release, we observed that spines harboring REs accumulated more surface GluA1 than neighboring spines lacking REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>) consistent with a role for REs in local delivery of secretory cargo. Finally, we tested whether there was any relationship between excitatory synapses with a spine apparatus, a membrane-stacked organelle hypothesized to play a GA-like function within spines, and REs. We expressed synaptopodin, a molecular marker for the spine apparatus, fused to GFP (GFP-SP), which displayed very punctate localization within or at the base ofÂ ~25% of spines consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korkotian et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, nearly every (97 Â± 3%; meanÂ Â±Â SEM, 554 RE-containing spines from 4 neurons) dendritic spine that contained GFP-SP also contained an RE marked by TfR-mCh (although not all RE-containing spines contained GFP-SP). In many cases the two labels were resolvable by confocal microscopy suggesting that they localize to distinct organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Together, these data support a model where REs not only relay cargo to the dendritic surface but can also direct newly synthesized cargo to select synapses, perhaps directly receiving cargo from the ER-derived spine apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Disruption of RE function impairs GluA1 ER to PM trafficking</title><p>To further support a role for REs in dendritic anterograde secretory trafficking, we disrupted RE function using a dominant-negative version of the RE-associated small GTPase, Rab11 (S25N mutation). Rab11(S25N) significantly impaired surface delivery of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-GluA1 compared to Rab11(WT) or mCh alone at the earliest time points we can detect appreciable surface GluA1 accumulation (2 and 4 hr after DDS addition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). While Rab11(S25N) robustly impaired surface delivery, it did not completely block it, suggesting that additional trafficking routes could mediate surface expression. To test whether the more canonical post-GA trafficking pathway (which depends on Rab8) is also utilized, we performed the same trafficking experiment using dominant negative Rab8 (T22N mutation). We observed that Rab8(T22N) did not significantly affect GluA1 surface delivery at an early timepoint (2 hr) following ER release, but significantly impaired surface delivery at a later (4 hr) timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This result suggests that Rab11-mediated trafficking plays a predominant role in early surface delivery while both Rab8 and Rab11 pathways participate in later phases of surface delivery. Finally, we tested dominant negative Rab5 (S34N mutation), which is critical for early endosome function, and observed no effect on surface delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

However, since the majority of dendrites lack canonical GA, we next tested whether secretory cargoes in dendrites can bypass the GA on their route to REs and the PM. We performed our trafficking assay in the presence of 5 Âµg/mL BFA, which potently disrupts Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiwara et al., 1988</xref>). To verify the efficacy of our BFA treatment, we imaged live neurons expressing galactosyl transferase fused to mEmerald (GalT-mEm). BFA caused a rapid (&lt;20 min) and complete dispersal of the somatic Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, ERGIC membranes and REs remained intact following BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8BâD</xref>). In addition to disrupting GA function, BFA is known to block ER-export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Misumi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>), which precluded us from simply adding BFA prior to ER release to test for a GA-independent trafficking network in neurons. To circumvent this issue, we took advantage of the temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>), but BFA insensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), of dendritic ERGICs. We first released 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 from the ER for 120 min at 20 ËC to allow cargo accumulation in somatic GA and dendritic ERGICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). While we observed robust accumulation of 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh-GluA1 in ERGIC at 20 ËC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>), it did not progress to REs or to the PM, confirming the efficacy of the temperature block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>). We then added BFA following ERGIC/GA accumulation at 20 ËC and incubated cells for an additional 20 min to disrupt GA before warming the cells to 37 ËC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In control experiments using HeLa cells, this protocol completely blocked delivery of secretory cargo to the PM, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, ERGIC-localized cargo can access the plasma membrane through the RE network in the absence of GA function.

Not surprisingly, we did observe a significant reduction in the fraction of TfR vesicles positive for GluA1, indicating that some fraction of RE-localized cargo is derived from BFA-sensitive GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Accordingly, the level of GluA1 surface delivery was reduced in BFA-treated cells (25.3 Â± 3.8% of control cells without BFA), but still 2.4-fold over background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

In contrast to GluA1, we observed that both NL1 and VSV-G surface expression was fully blocked by BFA indicating that not all cargoes follow the same trafficking route in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To further support a local, GA bypass model for GluA1 in neuronal dendrites, we employed the same local mEOS photoconversion strategy we used to demonstrate ER to ERGIC trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Neurons were transfected with 3xF<sub>M</sub>-mEOS-GluA1 and TfR-HT and labelled with HTL-JF646. The mEOS signal was converted from green to red in 80â100 Âµm segments of dendrite, followed by addition of DDS to release GluA1 from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Live imaging over the next 150 min revealed colocalization of mEOS*-GluA1 and TfR-HT(JF646) in the same dendritic branches that were initially photoconverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Importantly, we observed little accumulation of mEOS*-GluA1 in the somatic GA over the time course of the experiment. Thus, dendritic secretory cargo is spatially constrained as it progresses from ER to ERGIC to REs.</p><p>By necessity, our experiments rely on expressed proteins with tags to monitor their progression through the secretory pathway. To assess the fraction of endogenous proteins that utilize a GA-bypass pathway in neurons, we took a biochemical approach. A recent report demonstrated that a significant fraction of select neuronal surface proteins, including AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptors display immature (high mannose) glycosylation profiles, consistent with a GA-independent trafficking route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanus et al., 2016</xref>). High mannose glycans generated in the ER are normally processed in the GA to become resistant to cleavage by the glycolytic enzyme endoglycosidase H (endoH). Thus, to estimate the fraction of protein that circumvents the GA, we purified surface proteins by surface biotinylation and subjected them to either endoH or peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase, a glycolytic enzyme which removes both mature and immature N-linked carbohydrates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). We then compared the SDS/PAGE mobility of enzyme-treated surface GluA1 and GluA2 to an untreated control sample to estimate the fraction of immature surface GluA1 and GluA2. Consistent with previous work, we observed that the majority (88 Â± 1%; meanÂ Â±Â SEM 4 independent experiments) of surface GluA1 and a significant fraction of GluA2 (40 Â± 3%, meanÂ Â±Â SEM 5 independent experiments) were sensitive to endoH, further supporting a GA-bypass route for endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanus et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, while the majority of surface GluA1 was sensitive to endoH, endoH did not completely deglycosylate GluA1 (i.e. the mobility of endoH-treated GluA1 did not match that of PNGase-treated GluA1) suggesting surface GluA1 is either partially processed, or that an undefined post-ER modification is occurring. In contrast to AMPA receptors, TARPÎ³8 in the same biochemical preparation was completely endoH resistant, consistent with our data demonstrating that not all synaptic cargoes follow a GA-independent trafficking route to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27362.034</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Surface AMPA receptor subunits display immature glycosylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control experiment for surface biotinylation.

However, it remains unknown how, or even whether, dendritically translated integral membrane proteins are delivered to nearby sites following ER exit and subsequent trafficking through the labyrinthine cellular secretory network. Our findings reveal that synaptic proteins exiting the dendritic ER undergo spatially restricted trafficking to dendritic ERGICs. Following ERGIC accumulation, cargo next appears in dendritic REs, which are critical for subsequent PM delivery. Intriguingly, we observed that dendritic secretory cargo trafficking to REs and the PM could occur even when the GA was disrupted. Thus, dendritic secretory cargo can undergo direct, local trafficking through a unique secretory network involving ERGICs and REs, but bypassing the GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27362.035</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for local dendritic trafficking.</title><p>GluA1 exiting the dendritic ER undergoes local entry into nearby ERGIC (step 1).

Cargo can also enter REs through conventional post-GA trafficking that takes place in the soma, followed by long-range transport to dendrites (step 2a). In addition to mobile REs in the dendritic shaft, GluA1 is also directed to spine-resident REs (step 3). The RE compartment mediates a substantial fraction of surface delivery of GluA1 (step 4).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27362-fig10-v2"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Local entry of GluA1 into the secretory pathway</title><p>While synthesis of integral membrane proteins and secreted factors can occur locally in dendrites, it was unclear whether dendritic secretory organelles could spatially coordinate local delivery of these proteins to nearby dendritic sites. This issue is further complicated by the fact that nascent proteins are able to diffuse within the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>). While dendritic ER can undergo morphological plasticity to spatially restrict lateral diffusion, it was unknown whether proteins are similarly spatially constrained after they exit the ER and traffic through subsequent secretory organelles.</p><p>Previous studies using the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein (VSV-G) to investigate the dendritic secretory network report that following ER exit, a significant fraction of dendritic pre-Golgi vesicle carriers are shuttled towards the somatic GA, suggesting that spatial information may be lost as cargo exits the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</xref>). However, more recent studies report local trapping of a fraction of VSV-G in ERGIC structures following ER exit, supporting the possibility of a local secretory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanus et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, we find that the synaptic proteins GluA1 and NL1 follow the same initial itinerary as VSV-G, revealing a general dendritic trafficking principal that applies to diverse secretory cargoes. However, based on the BFA sensitivity of NL1 and VSV-G surface expression, their trafficking itineraries must diverge from GluA1 following ERGIC accumulation.</p><p>We also made the surprising observation that the dendritic and somatic trafficking networks were strikingly segregated. Using a local photoconversion strategy, we found that the majority of GluA1 released from the dendritic ER was effectively retained within nearby dendritic ERGICs. Little GluA1 accumulated in the somatic Golgi, even though the ER is contiguous between these compartments, and mobile vesicles can traverse the dendrite/soma boundary. Conversely, GluA1 released from the somatic ER was efficiently captured in the somatic GA, with little cargo accumulating in dendritic ERGICs. Thus, the downstream organelles and processing of secretory proteins largely depends on their location of ER exit, which would have a major impact on post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanus et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A role for Recycling Endosomes in dendritic anterograde trafficking</title><p>Following ERGIC accumulation, we observed that dendritic cargo trafficked to mobile vesicles positive for the RE markers TfR and Rab11. While the RE network plays a central role in recycling proteins to and from the PM, it has also been reported to mediate anterograde secretory trafficking of a number of different proteins in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lock and Stow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thuenauer et al., 2014</xref>). In neurons, REs are widely distributed throughout dendrites, where they play a critical role in integrating synaptic activity to regulate the protein composition of the neuronal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lasiecka and Winckler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esteves da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). While synaptic proteins, such as AMPA receptors can undergo basal and activity-induced recycling through the RE network, our findings expand the role of dendritic REs to include anterograde trafficking of newly secreted synaptic cargo molecules. Because REs are mobile, it is unclear whether the spatial distribution of cargo leaving the ER and ERGIC network is preserved once it accesses REs, but previous studies suggest that the dendritic RE network is spatially restricted near clusters of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooney et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, REs migrate into dendritic spines in an activity-dependent manner where they may regulate synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esteves da Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Our data indicate that REs could maintain and regulate dendritic and synaptic properties through constitutive delivery of newly synthesized integral membrane and secreted proteins, including to a select subset of synapses via spine-resident REs. Given the frequent juxtaposition of spine REs and the spine apparatus, it is tempting to speculate that REs receive locally generated cargo from the ER-derived spine apparatus for targeted synaptic delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bypassing the Golgi Apparatus in dendrites</title><p>Previous reports indicate that a subset of cargo molecules, including CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>), connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2001</xref>) and the drosophila anti-PS1 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schotman et al., 2008</xref>) can traffic to the cell surface without traversing the GA. These cargoes may have intrinsic signals that direct them on a trajectory that bypasses the GA. However, in neurons, the large majority of dendrites lack detectable GA, necessitating a bypass mechanism for a larger set of secreted and integral membrane molecules. To assess whether dendritic ER cargo can bypass the GA, we performed our trafficking assays in the presence of BFA to disrupt GA function. We found that GluA1 released from dendritic ER could still access the local RE network, even in BFA-treated cells where the somatic GA was disrupted. Accordingly, a significant fraction of GluA1 was delivered to the PM in the continued presence of BFA. These data provide compelling evidence for a GA bypass route in neurons, but whether this occurs through direct ERGIC to RE trafficking, or through an intermediate GA-like organelle (that lacks canonical GA markers) remains an open question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikhaylova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Similar to classic GA temperature block experiments, trafficking of secretory cargo from dendritic ERGIC to REs and to the PM is completely blocked at 20 ËC, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matlin and Simons, 1983</xref>), indicating that dendritic ERGICs and the somatic GA share some properties. However, the somatic GA was rapidly and robustly dismantled following BFA treatment, while dendritic ERGICs remained intact. Whether dendritic ERGICs harbor the same secretory processing enzymes as somatic GA remains an intriguing and open question, but our data support a previous study demonstrating that a diverse cohort of synaptic receptors, channels and cell adhesion proteins present on the neuronal cell surface lack mature N-glycosylation, a hallmark of GA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanus et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, local secretory processing in dendrites may yield an exclusive repertoire of posttranslational modifications that could uniquely impact protein structure and function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources table</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rattus Norvegicus</td><td>SpragueÂ Dawley</td><td>Charles river</td><td/><td>Both males and females used in this study</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (3xFM-FP-GluA1)</td><td>3xFM-GluA1</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Generated from GluA1 cDNA, gift from Dr. Michael Ehlers</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (4xFM-FP-Nlgn1)</td><td>4xFM-NL1</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Generated from neuroligin 1 construct obtained from Dr. Peter Scheiffele's lab, addgene clone #15262</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (VSV-G-4xFM-YFP)</td><td valign="bottom">VSV-G-YFP-4xFM</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Generated from VSV-G cDNA from Dr. Michael Ehlers</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (Rab11/Rab11DN)</td><td>GFP-Rab11</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Derived from Addgene(12674)</td><td>Gift from Dr. Richard Pagano</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (Rab8/Rab8DN)</td><td>GFP-Rab8</td><td/><td>Derived from Addgene (24898, 24899)</td><td>Gift from Dr. Maxence Nachury</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (Rab5/Rab5DN)</td><td>GFP-Rab5</td><td/><td>Derived from Addgene (28045)</td><td>Gift from Dr. Qing Zhong</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (ERGIC53)</td><td>GFP-ERGIC53</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 20639694</td><td>Addgene (38270)</td><td>Gift from Dr. Noboru Mizushima</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (TfR)</td><td>TfR-mCh/GFP</td><td>PMID: 20434989</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Gift from Dr. Michael Ehlers</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (4xFM-mCh)</td><td>4xFM-mCh</td><td>this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Generated from mCh N1 vector (Clontech) and Ariad regulated secretion kit 4xFM plasmid.</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (GalT)</td><td/><td/><td>Addgene (54108)</td><td>Gift from Dr. Michael Davidson</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (TfR-mCh-KDEL)</td><td/><td>this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Generated from TfR cDNA obtained from Dr. Michael Ehlers</td></tr><tr><td>transfected construct (GFP-synaptopodin)</td><td>GFP-Synpo</td><td>PMID: 25164660</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Gift from Dr. Menahem Segal</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>HA</td><td>Biolegends</td><td valign="bottom">clone 16B12;

TfR-Halotag was made by PCR amplifying the HaloTag domain from addgene #29644 (a gift from Eric Cambeau) and generating a C-terminal fusion with TfR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Constructs used in this study</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Construct</th><th valign="bottom">Fusion</th><th valign="bottom">Tag(s)</th><th valign="bottom">Epitope</th><th valign="bottom">Variants</th><th valign="bottom">Promoter</th><th valign="bottom">Signal peptide</th><th valign="bottom">Source</th><th valign="bottom">Gift from</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">3xF<sub>M</sub>-FP-GluA1</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">mEOS3.2, mCh, SEP, SNAP, dFP</td><td valign="bottom">HA</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCAG</td><td valign="bottom">Endogenous</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">4xF<sub>M</sub>-FP-Nlgn1</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">mCh, SEP, SNAP</td><td valign="bottom">HA</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCAG</td><td valign="bottom">Growth hormone</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">VSV-G-4xF<sub>M</sub>-FP</td><td valign="bottom">C</td><td valign="bottom">YFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Rab11</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">mCh, GFP</td><td valign="bottom">HA</td><td valign="bottom">[S25N]</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">Addgene (12674)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Richard Pagano</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Rab8</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">GFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">[T22N]</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Addgene (24898, 24899)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Maxence Nachury</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Rab5</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">GFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">[S34N]</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">Addgene (28045)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Qing Zhong</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ERGIC53</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">GFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">Calreticulin</td><td valign="bottom">Addgene (38270)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Noboru Mizushima</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TfR</td><td valign="bottom">C</td><td valign="bottom">GFP, mCh, HALO</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">4xF<sub>M</sub>-mCh</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">mCh</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCAG</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GalT</td><td valign="bottom">C</td><td valign="bottom">mEmerald</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">Endogenous</td><td valign="bottom">Addgene (54108)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Michael Davidson</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TfR-KDEL</td><td valign="bottom">C</td><td valign="bottom">mCh</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell Fill</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">mCh, GFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV and pCAG</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP-synaptopodin</td><td valign="bottom">N</td><td valign="bottom">GFP</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">pCMV</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Dr. Menahem Segal</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary cortical neurons were prepared from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats of either sex.

Neurons were plated at 200,000 cells/well in MEM and 10% FBS (Hyclone) containing penicillin/streptomycin on poly-D-lysine-coated 18 mm glass coverslips placed in a 12 well dish. After 1 d, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal-A media (NBA) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher;Â Waltham,Â MA). The neurons were then fed with NBA, B27, and mitotic inhibitors (uridine fluoro deoxyuridine) by replacing half of the medium on day 6 or day 7 and then once weekly. Neurons were maintained at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs recommendations and allowed to express for 48 hr. All neurons were between 15 days in vitro (DIV15) and DIV18 at the time of the experiment. For HeLa and COS7 cultures, cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin.

Generation of graphs and statistical analysis were carried out in Prism 7 (Graphpad). For all analysis, maximum intensity projections of each acquired Z-stack were used. For quantification of surface-labelling intensity after induction of ER-release, images were analyzed by automatically generating a mask based on neuronal morphology, determining the fluorescence intensity in each channel under the mask, and subtracting the background intensity based on a user-defined background region. For randomization of TfR puncta, a Matlab (Mathworks) code was written that randomly redistributes an equal number of puncta within the boundaries of the neuronal dendrite. For analysis of vesicular co-trafficking, a single time-point with low vesicle number in each fluorescent channel was selected. Coordinates of each vesicle were determined using the find maxima function in ImageJ. The distance between maxima coordinates was determined using the JACOP plugin for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolte and CordeliÃ¨res, 2006</xref>) and distances of less than 500 nm were considered to be colocalized.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jason D Shepherd (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Bowen and Kennedy describes a series of elegant experiments designed to track the movement of membrane proteins from ER to synaptic membranes. While the study of this type of intracellular trafficking is not new territory, the authors approach the question from a novel perspective by focusing on regions of dendrites lacking a traditional Golgi assembly (GA) that would normally be involved in such a pathway. The evidence provided by Bowen and Kennedy, particularly using their sophisticated inducible ER-release technique, indicate an involvement of recycling endosomes in membrane protein trafficking to the plasma membrane. Overall, the study is well-executed and the findings are of significant importance to the fields of neuronal protein trafficking. However, there remain two primary concerns, shared by the three reviewers of this work, that should be addressed.</p><p>Major Concerns â Consensus of all three reviewers:</p><p>1) Given that the paper relies heavily on creating an artificial aggregate of GLUA1 in the ER there is a potential worry that the trafficking route studied (ER-ERGIC-RE-Surface) is one that is not normally populated by GLUA1. Along this same line of logic, the emphasis on protein over-expression in cultured neurons could also create a bias toward the trafficking route emphasized in the current data. If the authors could come up with an experiment that gives some quantitative information about the population of GLUA1 the (ER-ERGIC-RE-Surface) pathway under normal conditions (ideally endogenous receptors), it would greatly strengthen the conclusiveness of the work. One possibility would be to determine roughly what fraction of protein normally goes through one route or the other. One can imagine trying to design a strategy where one looks at how much of a protein that makes it to a cell surface (without pre-aggregation in the ER) gets exposed to the enzymes of the GA, such as furin. Without such an experiment there may be more room to doubt the significance of the central findings of this manuscript. This is not a prescriptive experimental suggestion. The authors almost certainly will have ideas to address this general concern that they would consider feasible within the time-frame established by the <italic>eLife</italic> review process.</p><p>2) One incongruity in the experiments is the fact that is takes ~ 12 hours to reach steady-state surface concentrations of DDS release Glua1 yet many of the experiments looking at the confinement of the trafficking to ERGIC or RE are only carried out over ~2 or at most 4 hour time periods. When you photo convert the soma and release Glua1 with DDS and wait 12 hours where does this protein end up? It is possible that on these time scales it still ends up going out to dendrites and spines, which would be contrary to the principal conclusions and show that both routes are used equally. This should be straightforward to address.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27362.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] 1) Given that the paper relies heavily on creating an artificial aggregate of GLUA1 in the ER there is a potential worry that the trafficking route studied (ER-ERGIC-RE-Surface) is one that is not normally populated by GLUA1.

However, numerous groups have reported that furin is not solely localized to the Golgi network but is also present in the plasma membrane and the endosomal network (Liu et al., JCB 139:1719; Simmen et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 19:3136; Teuchert et al., JBC 274:36781). Accordingly, we did not detect any surface protein that had not been processed by furin (our approach was to surface label neurons expressing GluA1 harboring an epitope that is removed by furin and then surface label cells with antibodies against the epitope). However, the broad localization of furin at the plasma membrane and within endosomes makes this experiment difficult to interpret.</p><p>As an alternate approach to address this issue, we collaborated with Dr. Cyril Hanus (INSERM, Paris) who recently demonstrated that a large fraction of neuronal surface proteins display immature N-linked glycosylation (i.e. sensitive to the deglycosylating enzyme endoH), consistent with a GA bypass trafficking route (<italic>eLife</italic> 5:e20609). We have generated a new data set quantifying the fraction of endogenous surface AMPA receptors that display immature (high mannose) N-linked glycosylation assayed by endoH sensitivity. We found that 40 Â± 3% of surface GluA2 and 88 Â± 1% of surface GluA1 display endoH sensitivity, further supporting a GAbypass pathway for endogenous proteins (discussed in subsection âGolgi-independent transfer of GluA1 to the PM through ERGIC and Resâ). We included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One incongruity in the experiments is the fact that is takes ~ 12 hours to reach steady-state surface concentrations of DDS release Glua1 yet many of the experiments looking at the confinement of the trafficking to ERGIC or RE are only carried out over ~2 or at most 4 hour time periods. When you photo convert the soma and release Glua1 with DDS and wait 12 hours where does this protein end up? It is possible that on these time scales it still ends up going out to dendrites and spines, which would be contrary to the principal conclusions and show that both routes are used equally. This should be straightforward to address.</p></disp-quote><p>We defined the trafficking itinerary of GluA1 at early times (2-4 hours following ER release) to ensure our analysis was focused on cargo making its initial voyage to the PM. This timeframe corresponds to when GluA1 begins appearing on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Numerous other factors (endocytosis, recycling, degradation etc.) are likely to contribute to the long-term steady state surface level at later times. Nevertheless, this point deserves further clarification. Our experiments do not support a strict segregation of cargo between the somatic and dendritic compartments once the cargo progresses beyond the GA. For example, we observed a reduction in the fraction of dendritic REs that were positive for newly released GluA1 when we treated cells with brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> of the revised manuscript). This result suggests that under normal conditions a significant fraction of RE-localized cargo in dendrites originated from the somatic GA (included in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Indeed, direct GA to RE trafficking has been previously described in heterologous cells (Ang et al., J. Cell Biol. 167:531) and is further supported by our data. To more directly demonstrate that somatic GA produces mobile GluA1 carriers that can enter dendrites, we performed a new experiment where we conditionally released mCh-GluA1 from the ER and allowed it to accumulate in the somatic GA and dendritic ERGICs. We then photobleached all detectable signal in the dendritic arbor (preserving the somatic GA signal) and then performed rapid timelapse imaging 1 hour later. After the recovery period, we observed both mobile and stationary dendritic puncta that decreased in intensity and frequency as a function of distance from the soma. Since we had completely eliminated dendritic signal beforehand, this signal must have originated from the somatic GA. Thus, in addition to local trafficking routes, long-range transport from the somatic GA can also occur, especially in regions proximal to the soma. Whether these two pathways remain segregated or merge prior to PM delivery will be a topic of future experiments. We have now included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref> of the revised manuscript and included a more thorough discussion in the Results section (subsection âSynaptic cargo accumulates in dendritic ERGIC following ER exitâ) to clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
