Recent work has revealed tissue-specific roles for ILCs; however, the question of how a small population has large effects on immune homeostasis remains unclear. We identify two mechanisms that ILC3s utilise to exert their effects within intestinal tissue. ILC-driven colitis depends on production of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which recruits and maintains intestinal inflammatory monocytes. ILCs present in the intestine also enter and exit cryptopatches in a highly dynamic process. During colitis, ILC3s mobilize from cryptopatches, a process that can be inhibited by blocking GM-CSF, and mobilization precedes inflammatory foci elsewhere in the tissue. Together these data identify the IL-23R/GM-CSF axis within ILC3 as a key control point in the accumulation of innate effector cells in the intestine and in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ILCs in the intestinal inflammatory response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10066.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10066.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10066.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases in which the body’s own immune system causes inflammation of the large intestine. These autoimmune diseases can be severely debilitating and difficult to treat. However an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to the intestinal inflammation may lead to new and effective treatments.</p><p>Immune cells called innate lymphoid cells were discovered recently, and shown quickly to play a role in host defense, tissue repair and inflammation regulation. Several groups of innate lymphoid cells are now known; each group is characterized by the genes that control the cell’s development and the small proteins (called cytokines) that the cells release. One group of innate lymphoid cells, the ILC3s, are generally found in the intestinal tract, albeit in small numbers. Given that innate lymphoid cells are known to manage inflammatory responses, it is possible that ILC3s contribute to intestinal inflammation. However, it remains unclear how such a small population of cells could so dramatically inflame the gut.</p><p>Pearson et al. now reveal two mechanisms that these innate lymphoid cells use to amplify the inflammatory response and exacerbate intestinal inflammation. First, in both mice and humans, ILC3s were found to be a key source of a cytokine called GM-CSF, which recruits additional immune cells that further promote intestinal inflammation. Secondly, while ILC3s were traditionally regarded as immobile immune cells, Pearson et al. discovered that these cells can move within the intestinal tissue and mobilize from their starting points within this tissue if they are activated. These two mechanisms could explain how ILC3s can trigger inflammation that occurs throughout the gut.</p><p>The experiments suggest that blocking production of the GM-CSF cytokine or altering ILC3 movement or activity may help reduce intestinal inflammation. However, the use of GM-CSF blocking drugs to protect against colitis and similar conditions could be problematic, because GM-CSF also plays an important protective role in the intestines. Nevertheless, clinical trials are underway to investigate the use of anti-GM-CSF drugs to treat other inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis). These studies could offer insight into whether these drugs provide relief to trial participants who suffer from intestinal inflammation as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10066.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10066.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>innate lymphoid cell</kwd><kwd>mucosal immunology</kwd><kwd>colitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award, 095688/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Thornton</surname><given-names>Emily E</given-names></name><name><surname>Huskens</surname><given-names>Nicky</given-names></name><name><surname>Griseri</surname><given-names>Thibault</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000769</institution-id><institution>University Of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NDM Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaupp</surname><given-names>Anna-Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Sim</given-names></name><name><surname>Seddon</surname><given-names>Benedict P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001063</institution-id><institution>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhlig</surname><given-names>Holm H</given-names></name><name><surname>Powrie</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003522</institution-id><institution>Crohn's and Colitis UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhlig</surname><given-names>Holm H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

As with conventional Th1, Th2 and Th17 T cells, ILCs can be functionally classified based on the expression of transcription factors and associated signature cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spits et al., 2013</xref>). ILC1 are defined by Th1-like and ILC2 by Th2-like cytokine responses, whereas ILC3 express RORγt, and can secrete IL-17 and/or IL-22 upon activation. The ILC3 family includes the prototypic foetal lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells that play a non-redundant role in lymphoid tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mebius et al., 1997</xref>) via lymphotoxin-dependent interactions with stromal cells. This pathway is required not only for lymph node development but also for organised lymphoid structures in the gut such as dendritic cell (DC) and ILC containing cryptopatches (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberl and Sawa, 2010</xref>), B cell, DC and ILC containing isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>), and small intestinal Peyer’s Patches (PP) that have a very similar structure to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornes, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mebius et al., 1997</xref>). Postnatally, the LTi population can also make IL-17 and IL-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cupedo et al., 2009</xref>) and contribute to host defence against pathogens, particularly in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sonnenberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The multi-functional roles of ILCs in disease development and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>), as well as host defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sonnenberg et al., 2011</xref>) and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monticelli et al., 2011</xref>) have been the focus of much interest. Polyfunctional ILCs have also been described that do not fall into distinct ILC1 or ILC3 phenotypes but express both ILC1 and ILC3 lineage defining transcription factors Tbet and RORγt and secrete multiple cytokines such IL-17A, IL-22 as well as IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified a critical role for a phenotypically distinct population of IL-23R<sup>+</sup> RORγt<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>-</sup> NKp46<sup>-</sup> ILCs in the development of innate intestinal inflammation in <italic>Rag</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice following <italic>Helicobacter hepaticus</italic> infection or αCD40 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>). Similar ILC populations were enriched in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geremia et al., 2011</xref>), implicating IL-23-responsive, RORγt expressing ILCs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory gut disease in mice and humans. However, it remains unclear how ILCs, that are numerically sparse in vivo can initiate inflammatory processes that lead to colitis.</p><p>Despite advances in understanding of the functions of ILCs, little is known about their location in tissue at different stages of the inflammatory response, and how putative structural and cytokine-mediated functions are co-ordinated. Since its description in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uhlig et al., 2006</xref>), the induction of colitis by injecting agonistic anti-CD40 antibody has become an important tool to assess ILC-driven acute colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vonarbourg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast with other models, anti-CD40 induced colitis follows discrete phases at well-defined time points following initiation, offering the opportunity to probe the role of leukocytes in the development and amplification of the inflammatory response. Experiments have demonstrated that intestinal inflammation was mediated via Thy1<sup>+</sup> ILCs in a <italic>rorc</italic> dependent manner, making it an ideal system to study how ILCs contribute to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study investigating potential biomarkers for anti-IL-23 therapy described similar changes in the colons of both anti-CD40-treated mice and patients with active Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cayatte et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many recent publications have focused on the specific functions of ILC subsets within effector sites, and the location of ILCs has been proposed to contribute to their ability to affect systemic cytokine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nussbaum et al., 2013</xref>). Despite histological and flow cytometry data demonstrating the presence of ILCs within lymphoid structures in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberl and Sawa, 2010</xref>), it isn’t clear whether they function as sedentary, cytokine producing cells or play a more active role in cell interactions and organization. In vivo microscopy is a tool that provides an opportunity to look at the behaviour of ILCs within the tissue. By combining anti-CD40 stimulation with intra-vital microscopy we are able to reliably track cellular changes at discrete phases of disease and capture cell movement at key timepoints.</p><p>Our results show two novel mechanisms through which the small number of ILCs found in vivo orchestrate the intestinal inflammatory response. IL-23-driven GM-CSF production by ILC3s is critical for the development of colitis, and ILCs mobilise from cryptopatches after activation in a GM-CSF-dependent manner. Both of these behaviours likely contribute to the ability of ILCs to coordinate the immune response in the gut. Initiation and perpetuation of disease occur in distinct anatomical compartments, indicating both a temporal and spatial switch of ILC function during inflammatory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GM-CSF is a critical cytokine mediator in the pathogenesis of innate colitis</title><p>Anti-CD40 induced colitis is dependent on a RORγt/IL-23 axis but key downstream cytokines are less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uhlig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>).

Under non-inflammatory conditions, ILCs are found within lymphoid structures in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eberl and Sawa, 2010</xref>), and in <italic>Rag</italic>-deficient hosts these structures are limited to cryptopatches as there are no B cells to form ILFs. Under homeostatic conditions ILCs primarily reside within lymphoid aggregate cryptopatch (CP) structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and are found only rarely within the non-inflamed lamina propria. Within CP, RORγt<sup>+</sup> and IL-7Rα<sup>+</sup> ILC3s are present at high density surrounded by CD11c and MHCII expressing cells. Some of these ILCs within CP also express CD4, suggesting that some but not all are classical LTi cells that are known to be involved in lymphoid organogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to RORγt expression, ILCs are known to express IL-23R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buonocore et al., 2010</xref>).

In support of this hypothesis, analysis of RORγt protein revealed a transient decrease in the proportion of ILCs expressing it 3 days following anti-CD40 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D&amp;E</xref>), similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vonarbourg et al., 2010</xref>). Whilst these data suggested that ILCs are reacting to changes in the environment, it remained unclear how this leads to the downstream inflammatory cascade.</p><p>It is possible that ILCs that are resident within lymphoid structures produce cytokines locally to carry out their effects. Alternatively, ILCs may be able to mobilize into the tissue to coordinate the immune response. To understand which mechanism ILCs utilize, we adopted the strategy of McDole <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole et al., 2012</xref>) used to study leukocytes in the gut. In the steady-state, ILCs were much more motile than expected. While little motility could be observed within the cryptopatch, ILCs can be observed to enter and exit the cluster near the basal collagen layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). Interestingly, the cryptopatch did not have an obvious point of entry or exit, implying that trafficking into and out of the structure may be governed by mechanisms different to that of the lymph node. By gating on motile cells outside the cluster, we could see that the average velocity of motile ILCs (approximately 9 μm/min) is grossly similar to that of other lymphocytes and while cell velocity decreases after treatment with anti-CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), this difference does not appear to affect overall cell trafficking. To determine whether ILC trafficking changed in colitis, we plotted the displacements of ILCs in steady-state and after anti-CD40 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). While no gross changes appeared in track displacements, the overall movement of cells shifted. In steady-state, roughly equal numbers of cells move toward and away from the cluster; however, just 4–6 hr after anti-CD40 treatment, a greater proportion of cells exit the tissue and a smaller proportion enter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The ratio of entering to exiting cells indicates a significant skewing toward egress from cryptopatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To assess whether GM-CSF may be playing a role in ILC mobilization, we treated mice with anti-GM-CSF 24 hr before imaging.

We hypothesised that development of colitis is driven by initiation of the immune response in the cryptopatch, followed by accumulation of immune cells within anatomically distinct villus inflammatory foci.</p><p>To understand what impact the early mobilization of ILCs has on the tissue, we looked at several chemokines that could be influencing the development of inflammatory foci. 24 hr after anti-CD40 treatment the chemokines <italic>Ccl19</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> were increased in the tissue. The receptor for <italic>Ccl19, Ccr7</italic>, was also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Blocking GM-CSF prevented the increase of <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, supporting the idea that there is cross-talk between the GM-CSF and migration axes. Staining for CCR7 and CCR2 on lineage<sup>+</sup> and ILC subsets suggested that it is the lineage positive cells that are capable of responding to the increased tissue chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Histological analysis of the proximal colon 7 days after anti-CD40 treatment showed immune foci at the tips of villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining for CD11c and RORγt showed colocalization of ILCs with the CD11c positive immune infiltrate. The latter may reflect the inflammatory monocytes identified by flow cytometry from colon digests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>). Quantification of cryptopatch cellularity from H&amp;E after anti-CD40 treatment showed a decrease in cellularity after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The net egress of cells from cryptopatches over a short imaging window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) corresponds to the loss of cells from the tissue over 24 hr. This decrease is followed by an increase in inflammatory infiltrates starting one day later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Blocking GM-CSF resulted in maintenance of cryptopatch structure as would be predicted from the imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Our data indicate a spatiotemporal model for innate colitis that involves cellular activation, GM-CSF dependent mobilization of IL-23R<sup>+</sup> ILCs from cryptopatches, and subsequent perpetuation of the response through separate ILC-containing inflammatory foci and GM-CSF dependent accumulation of inflammatory monocytes.</p><p>Although IL-23 dependent, we found that anti-CD40 induced colitis was IL-17A and IL-17F independent in keeping with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eken et al., 2014</xref>). Two recent reports indicated a functional role for IL-22, possibly through neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2015</xref>). However our data show no impact of IL-22 blockade or neutrophil depletion (data not shown) on the incidence or severity of disease in this model. By contrast, double blockade of IL-17A and IL-22 reduced colitis severity, indicating that these cytokines may play a redundant role in driving intestinal inflammation possibly through shared effects on intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). The pathogenic role of IL-22 in CD40-triggered colitis may depend on the presence of microbial factors that also influence IL-17A production in the intestine. Consistent with this, IL-22 alone was required for the maintenance of bacteria driven innate colitis-associated cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirchberger et al., 2013</xref>). Together these results suggest that context-dependent effector functions mediate the colitogenic potential of IL-23.</p><p>Recent studies have focussed on the role of GM-CSF as an important mediator of IL-23 driven tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Codarri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Behi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griseri et al., 2012</xref>). We found that GM-CSF played a non-redundant role in both systemic and intestinal inflammation in the anti-CD40 model and was required for bacteria-induced innate colitis. The role of GM-CSF in anti-CD40 mediated systemic disease has been recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2015</xref>) but effects on colitis were not assessed. Our results indicate that IL-23-responsive ILCs can act as the main source of GM-CSF in an innate model. Importantly we also find that ILCs are potent sources of GM-CSF in humans, consistent with a previous report describing cytokine-driven GM-CSF production from an NKp44<sup>-</sup> ILC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glatzer et al., 2013</xref>). Our study goes further to show that GM-CSF is produced by ILC3s in the blood and colon of patients. The percent of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> ILCs is larger than the percent of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> T cells. This GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> ILC3 population is increased in the blood and colonic tissue of patients with IBD, indicating commonalities between mouse models and human disease pathogenesis.</p><p>IL-23 and GM-CSF may act in an autocrine loop early in the early inflammatory response as we found that anti-CD40-induced early colonic IL-23 expression was GM-CSF dependent and that in turn, IL-23 was required for sustained GM-CSF production by ILCs. A similar positive feedback loop has been described for T cell derived GM-CSF in CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Behi et al., 2011</xref>). Such a feedback loop would promote more GM-CSF production from ILCs as IL-23 production increases in disease. The role of GM-CSF may be to recruit myeloid cells to sites of inflammation, and impact their ability to coordinate inflammatory responses, as has recently been shown in EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croxford et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we found blocking GM-CSF prevented the accumulation of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes following anti-CD40 stimulation, in line with recent evidence for a key role for these cells in driving pathogenesis during anti-CD40 induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2015</xref>). However, GM-CSF expression also has wider consequences since it affects the behaviour of ILCs within the cryptopatch.</p><p>Functional analyses of ILC populations have mainly been restricted to cytokine production, and recent evidence that they do not recirculate suggested a primarily sedentary role for these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>). However, that study did not assess ILC movement within tissues as a mechanism through which ILCs may modulate the immune and inflammatory response. To investigate this, we utilized <italic>intra vital</italic> microscopy to image ILC movement within cryptopatches under homeostatic conditions and in anti-CD40 induced intestinal inflammation. Cryptopatches may provide a platform for the rapid amplification of the immune response and may provide a potential mechanism by which a very small number of ILCs could initiate an immune cascade that culminates in colonic inflammation. Because of the large overlap of cell surface molecule and transcription factor expression between ILCs and T cells, imaging <italic>Rag</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice provided the cleanest system to study ILC motility. The anti-CD40 model provided temporal synchronization, which is a feature unique to this model of colitis. To our surprise, a subset of ILCs associated with the cryptopatch was migratory under steady-state conditions. After anti-CD40 treatment, ILC motility shifted toward egress from the cryptopatch. In agreement with data that suggests they do not recirculate through the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>), ILCs were not observed migrating into the peripheral blood but appeared to crawl directly through the tissue, possibly following a local chemokine gradient. Future studies will be required to determine what factors govern entrance and exit from lymphoid structures within the tissue, which appears very different from the lymph node. Further understanding of this response may identify pathways that can be targeted to break the proinflammatory cycle within the tissue. As tools become available, studying ILC behaviour in lymphorepleate hosts will further expand these findings and allow increased interrogation of cellular interactions between ILCs and other immune cells as well as spatio-temporal control points in the inflammatory response.</p><p>Consistent with chemokine-induced migration of ILCs, we found an early peak in mRNA expression of the chemokines <italic>Ccl2, Ccl19</italic> and its receptor <italic>Ccr7</italic> in the tissue, suggesting an early role for CCR7 and CCR2. Despite data showing that migration of LTi ILC3s from the gut to the mesenteric lymph nodes is dependent on CCR7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackley et al., 2015</xref>), expression of CCR7 on ILCs was not assessed in that study and we were unable to identify CCR7 or CCR2 on intestinal ILC3s in anti-CD40 induced colitis. While this argues against CCR7 driven chemotaxis of the ILCs, it does not preclude an organizational function for ILCs in the tissue driven by other mediators. Indeed, our data indicate a role for GM-CSF in the net egress of ILCs from cryptopatches in anti-CD40 induced colitis. Similarly, increased amounts of <italic>ccl2</italic> and <italic>ccr7</italic> mRNA in the colon were also GM-CSF-dependent, as was accumulation of inflammatory monocytes which also express CCR7 and CCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Förster et al., 2008</xref>). Together, the data are compatible with a model in which GM-CSF-dependent activation of ILCs leads to exit from the cryptopatch to the villus tip. This coincides with the recruitment of CCR7 and CCR2 expressing inflammatory monocytes through a CCL19 and CCL2 gradient, culminating in tissue damage. Sustained production of GM-CSF by ILCs in inflammatory foci could recruit inflammatory progenitor cells and contribute to differentiation of myeloid effector cells. GM-CSF has been shown to control the differentiation of inflammatory monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenzo et al., 2012</xref>), and this population was markedly reduced following anti-GM-CSF treatment. GM-CSF may also impact on this pathway through altered haematopoiesis and accumulation of granulocyte macrophage progenitors as described in T cell dependent colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griseri et al., 2012</xref>). Given the multiple activities of GM-CSF on myeloid cell development and function, further studies will be required to delineate the key downstream pathways.</p><p>IL-23 has been suggested as a therapeutic target in IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uhlig et al., 2006</xref>). However, our studies indicate that neutralisation of GM-CSF is as efficacious as blockade of IL-23 in mouse models. In addition, increases in GM-CSF secreting ILCs are a feature of IBD. However, targeting GM-CSF may not be straightforward in IBD as there are clear host protective functions of GM-CSF in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sainathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernasconi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirata et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed neutralising anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies are increased in IBD, particularly in patients with ileal and stricturing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, administration of recombinant GM-CSF (sargramostim) has been used to treat Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korzenik et al., 2005</xref>) although further trials did not show any substantial benefit of GM-CSF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these issues, in light of recent developments testing anti-GM-CSF in clinical trials for the treatment of other inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Constantinescu et al., 2015</xref>) it will be interesting to see if subgroups of patients with hyperinflammatory innate immune activation-driven IBD could benefit from GM-CSF blockade.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human study subjects</title><p>IBD and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were recruited through the Oxford IBD cohort study, and samples were obtained from Oxford GI Biobank in collaboration with Oxford Radcliffe Biobank.

Inflammation was assessed using previously published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izcue et al., 2008</xref>). Each sample was graded semiquantitatively from 0 to 4 in each of the 4 following features: epithelial hyperplasia and goblet cell depletion, cellular infiltration of the lamina propria, percentage of the section affected, and markers of severe inflammation (submucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses). Three separate colon sections for each sample were examined. Scores for each criterion were added to give an overall score for each sample of 0–12. Samples were scored in a blinded fashion by two individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intravital microscopy</title><p>Gut imaging was performed as described in McDole <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, the gut was exposed and immobilized with an imaging window, and imaging proceeded using isoflurane to maintain anesthesia. Images were collected using a 20x water dipping lens and the spectral detector of a Zeiss 780 upright microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were linearly unmixed using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss) to separate autofluorescence, collagen, EGFP, and Texas red-dextran based on single color controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Blood vessel labelling</title><p>Mice were anesthetized for imaging and injected intravenously with 50 mg of 70 kDa texas-red labelled dextran (Life Technologies).

Images were drift corrected based on mucus or collagen signal. ILCs were tracked using autoregressive motion algorithm of the spot-tracking module. Motile ILCs were gated based on distance less than 75 μm from a cryptopatch, track duration greater than 5 min, and displacement greater than 14 μm (approximately two cell lengths). Images were smoothed using a Gaussian filter for display.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>For immunofluorescence, samples of the proximal colon were taken and immediately embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) and frozen in a bath of isopentane on dry ice prior to storage at -80<sup>o</sup>C. 6 μm frozen sections were cut and collected on frosted glass slides. For staining, slides were fixed in 2% formalin. For RORγt staining, slides were subsequently also treated with Fix-Perm buffer (eBioscience). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2% sodium azide and non-specific binding was blocked with 10% donkey serum. Sections were incubated with the following antibodies CD4 (RM4-5, BD Biosciences) IL-7Rα (A7R34, eBioscience) in 10% donkey serum or RORγt (AFKJS-9, eBioscience) in Perm buffer (eBioscience). Sections were then incubated with donkey anti-rat HRP secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Tyramide signal amplification was the performed (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Then sections were stained with CD11c (N418, eBioscience) in 10% goat serum followed by goat anti-hamster Cy3, or with MHCII-FITC or AF647 (both M5/114.15.2, Biolegend).</p><p>Sections were mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI.

Images were analysed using the linear unmixing module of Zen (Carl Zeiss) and Imaris (Bitplane).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis and graphical representations were performed using Prism 5.0a software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). For comparison of qPCR results and histopathological analysis, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used, and for multiple samples, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test was used unless otherwise stated. Technical replicates are from the same sample, analysed on the same day. Biological replicates are from independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Sample size was computed using an estimate of colitis score between 6–8, to detect a score reduction by 50% in a treated group with a standard deviation of 30%, false positive of 0.05, and power of 0.80. Sample size was therefore calculated to be between 6–7. Where smaller changes were expected, sample sizes were increased accordingly.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank R Stillion and the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology histology department for histology, and the staff of our animal houses for their assistance; S Kirchberger, M Hühn, A Hegazy, A Chauveau, and T Arnon for technical advice and discussion; C Lagerholm and the Wolfson Imaging Centre for microscopy assistance; B Owens and C Arancibia for critically reading the manuscript; W Ouyang (Genentech) for the blocking anti-IL-22 antibody and isotype controls; UCB Celltech for providing the blocking anti-IL-17 antibody; D Cua (Merck) for providing the blocking anti-IL-23R antibody.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript further elaborates the role ILCs play in the pathology of colitis induced by agonistic anti-CD40 antibody by showing that group 3 ILC-driven colitis in this model depends on GM-CSF. It also shows that ILCs traffic through gut cryptopatches under homeostatic conditions and that their egress is enhanced by anti-CD40 antibody, associated with increased tissue chemokine levels and development of inflammatory foci. However, before publication, the following issues would be important to address.</p><p>1) While the manuscript purports to exclude roles for IL-17A and IL-22, combined neutralisation of these two cytokines has not been done, nor has a role for IL-17F been tested. Also, the data indicate that GM-CSF neutralisation may not entirely abrogate disease, and triple-neutralisation studies would be useful to examine if there are some distinct non-overlapping quantitative roles for these various cytokines.</p><p>2) The determination of GM-CSF-producing cells is not precise. There is a significant GMCSF production by cells that weakly express lineage markers. CD127+ lineage- cells appear to contain some lineage+ cells. Have the lineage-dim cells been gated out when analyzing the ILC subsets producing GM-CSF? There is no negative control shown for IL7R staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), making the interpretation difficult to judge, since CD127-low cells could represent non-NK ILC1 cells that also express NK1.1 and NKp46 (Fuchs et al. 2013) and Eomes or perforin have not been used to exclude this possibility. In any case, these supposedly IL7Ra- 'NK' cells produce GM-CSF, raising the question of their contribution to disease.</p><p>3) For mechanistic insights into the anti-CD40-mediated modulation of the ability of ILC3s to produce GM-CSF, it is useful to test if the levels of Rorc or IL-23R have been modulated by anti-CD40 treatment.</p><p>4) Since a role for GM-CSF in inflammatory situations is not by itself novel (although not demonstrated for this particular situation), it is appropriate to expect some data attempting to examine possible mechanisms through which only GM-CSF appears to be non-redundantly required in a disease depending on cells that make all three potentially pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17, IL-22 and GM-CSF. Notably, the authors show data that GM-CSF appears to be required for the induction of a putative upstream mediator (of IL-17 and IL-22 as well as GM-CSF), IL-23, making a number of complex regulatory scenarios plausible and worth examination. Also, there is prior evidence that bacterial gut inflammation may require IL-22, at least, and comparative data on the relative roles of these inflammatory cytokines between non-microbial induction of colitis as used in the manuscript and, say, <italic>Helicobacter hepaticus</italic>-induced colitis (a model in use by the authors) would be very helpful.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is not very informative as it stands. It is already known that human NKp44<sup>+</sup> ILC3 produce GM-CSF (Glatzer et al. 2013), and the present data do not identify the subsets of total ILCs that produce GM-CSF. While more ILCs from the peripheral blood of IBD patients appear to express GM-CSF, the authors suggest in the text that this is not so for IFNγ, while the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> appear to show more IFNγ-producing ILCs as well. Further, there are no data regarding GM-CSF expression in healthy versus IBD-inflamed colonic tissue. Thus, these data are correlative and say little about a potential role of GM-CSF in human IBD. These ambiguities need to be addressed explicitly.</p><p>6) With respect to the data on ILC migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it would be useful to clarify if the authors are referring to aggregates in both villous tips and in crypts as inflammatory foci. It would also help to know if ILC3s express CCR2 and/or CCR7.</p><p>7) The manuscript suggests that migration of innate-like lymphoid cells is essential for colitogenesis, and that one role of GM-CSF is in controlling this migration by inducing the expression of CCR7, the receptor for the chemokine CCL19. Yet, the manuscript shows no studies examining, for example, the balance of cryptopatch-egress in animals with GM-CSF blockade or with CCL19 or CCR7 blockade, or indeed examining possible modulations in the state of the villous-tip inflammatory foci by CCL19 blockade, which would help provide evidence for these putative cause-and-effect relationships between innate-like lymphocyte migration and inflammogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10066.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This manuscript further elaborates the role ILCs play in the pathology of colitis induced by agonistic anti-CD40 antibody by showing that group 3 ILC-driven colitis in this model depends on GM-CSF.

IL-17F blockade did not reduce disease. Double blockade of IL-17A and IL­22 did reduce disease severity, indicating that these cytokines may play a redundant role in driving pathogenesis. The level to which blocking IL-22 ameliorates colitis may depend on microbial factors that also influence IL-17A production in the intestine. Indeed as pointed out by the reviewer our own studies revealed a non-­redundant role for IL­22 in bacteria driven innate colitis-associated cancer (Kirchberger et al. 2013). These findings illustrate the complex contextual role of IL-22 in intestinal pathophysiology and this point has now been included in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The determination of GM-CSF-producing cells is not precise.

We have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to focus only on GM-CSF producing ILCs. To clarify the role of lineage dim cells, we have identified them as NK cells by surface marker and perforin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). By using <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> l15ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic>we now show that lack of NK cells, while it does have an effect on weight loss, does not significantly affect colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) For mechanistic insights into the anti-CD40-mediated modulation of the ability of ILC3s to produce GM-CSF, it is useful to test if the levels of Rorc or IL-23R have been modulated by anti-CD40 treatment.</italic></p><p>We proposed that the effect of anti-CD40 on ILCs is from myeloid cell derived IL-23, which is supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The analysis of RORγt and IL-23R shows a transient decrease in both molecules 3 days after anti-CD40 administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). To understand how quickly this effect occurs, we looked at <italic>Il23r</italic> expression 6 hours after anti-CD40 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). At this time point, the receptor is increased, indicating that anti-CD40 triggers an inflammatory cascade (through effects on myeloid cells) that has very early effects on ILCs, which fits nicely with the imaging data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Since a role for GM-CSF in inflammatory situations is not by itself novel (although not demonstrated for this particular situation), it is appropriate to expect some data attempting to examine possible mechanisms through which only GM-CSF appears to be non-redundantly required in a disease depending on cells that make all three potentially pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17, IL-22 and GM-CSF.

We now show that GM-CSF is required for the mobilization of ILCs from cryptopatches, implicating the cytokine in the pro-inflammatory initiation step of the disease. These data, coupled with a decrease in inflammatory monocytes with anti-GM-CSF blockade, newly implicate ILCs in the development of inflammatory foci within the tissue. While our manuscript was in revision, a new study appeared demonstrating a role for GM-CSF in the systemic anti-CD40 induced disease in <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice and in accumulation of inflammatory monocytes in the intestine. There was no analysis of the functional role of GM-CSF in colitis or movement of ILCs in that study, so our data provide important new mechanistic insight into the functions of GM-CSF in the colon. However both studies together strongly support a role for GM-CSF in monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the intestine.</p><p>The inflammatory cytokines downstream of IL-23 likely play different roles in bacterial versus anti- CD40 driven colitis. Indeed anti-CD40 induced colitis occurs in germ free mice indicating the aetiopathogenesis can be microbe independent (Uhlig et al. 2006). However the presence of particular microbes in the RAG colony may alter IL-23 dependent down-stream effector mechanisms in anti-CD40 colitis. Indeed our own data supports this showing a non-redundant role for IL-23 driven IL-22 in <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> driven innate colitis associated cancer. This may reflect the differential involvement of epithelial derived signals in bacteria versus anti-CD40 induced colitis with IL-17 and IL-22, which act on the epithelium, having a more dominant role in the former. Importantly by contrast with the redundant role of IL-17 and IL-22 in anti-CD40 colitis, GM-CSF is required in both models and we have now included data showing anti-GM-CSF blockade ameliorates colitis in bacteria-driven innate colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A more in-depth discussion of the context dependent roles of IL-23 driven downstream cytokines, which are of relevance to therapeutic targeting in IBD, has been added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is not very informative as it stands. It is already known that human NKp44<sup>+</sup> ILC3 produce GM-CSF (Glatzer et al. 2013), and the present data do not identify the subsets of total ILCs that produce GM-CSF. While more ILCs from the peripheral blood of IBD patients appear to express GM-CSF, the authors suggest in the text that this is not so for IFN</italic>γ<italic>, while the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> appear to show more IFN</italic>γ<italic>-producing ILCs as well. Further, there are no data regarding GM-CSF expression in healthy versus IBD-inflamed colonic tissue. Thus, these data are correlative and say little about a potential role of GM-CSF in human IBD. These ambiguities need to be addressed explicitly.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments regarding the human data and have added additional new data to strengthen our findings. We now include the analysis of GM-CSF by distinct subsets of blood ILCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The text has been amended to clarify that inflammatory cytokines other than GMCSF are also increased in blood ILCs of IBD patients. We have included data showing that a larger proportion of ILCs express GM-CSF in the colon compared with the proportion of T cells, and the proportion of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> cells is higher in the colon than the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Data from the publicly available Leuven cohort as well as our Oxford TGU cohort show increased GM-CSF in patients with IBD with increased expression associated with increased disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Taken together these data support a role for GM-CSF in human IBD.</p><p><italic>6) With respect to the data on ILC migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it would be useful to clarify if the authors are referring to aggregates in both villous tips and in crypts as inflammatory foci. It would also help to know if ILC3s express CCR2 and/or CCR7.</italic></p><p>We have clarified that aggregates refer to accumulations in the villous tips. Data now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that ILC3s in the colon do not express CCR2 or CCR7. This suggests that the increase in CCR7 and CCR2 in the tissue is a result of chemokine receptor increase within the lineage<sup>+</sup> population. The question of ILC chemotaxis is therefore still an open topic, and further studies, beyond the scope of this report, will be required to elucidate what is likely a very complicated and possibly tissue-specific process.</p><p><italic>7) The manuscript suggests that migration of innate-like lymphoid cells is essential for colitogenesis, and that one role of GM-CSF is in controlling this migration by inducing the expression of CCR7, the receptor for the chemokine CCL19. Yet, the manuscript shows no studies examining, for example, the balance of cryptopatch-egress in animals with GM-CSF blockade or with CCL19 or CCR7 blockade, or indeed examining possible modulations in the state of the villous-tip inflammatory foci by CCL19 blockade, which would help provide evidence for these putative cause-and-effect relationships between innate-like lymphocyte migration and inflammogenesis.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We now show that blocking GM-CSF does return the cryptopatch balance of entrance and exit to steady-state levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This solidifies the role of GM-CSF in the earliest stages of inflammation. This data with the increase of IL-23R at 6 hours after anti-CD40 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) supports an early pro-inflammatory loop between IL-23 producing myeloid cells and GM-CSF producing ILCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
