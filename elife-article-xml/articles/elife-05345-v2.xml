adaptive immune responses, playing crucial roles in many kinds of disease and in vaccination. We report that breadth of peptide presentation and level of cell surface expression of class I molecules are inversely correlated in both chickens and humans. This relationship correlates with protective responses against infectious pathogens including Marek's disease virus leading to lethal tumours in chickens and human immunodeficiency virus infection progressing to AIDS in humans. We propose that differences in peptide binding repertoire define two groups of MHC class I molecules strategically evolved as generalists and specialists for different modes of pathogen resistance. We suggest that differences in cell surface expression level ensure the development of optimal peripheral T cell responses. The inverse relationship of peptide repertoire and expression is evidently a fundamental property of MHC molecules, with ramifications extending beyond immunology and medicine to evolutionary biology and conservation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05345.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05345.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05345.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune system has the remarkable ability to recognize and destroy damaged cells or invading microbes while leaving the healthy cells in the body alone. Groups of proteins called ‘MHC class I molecules’ play important roles in defence against invading microbes. If a cell becomes infected with a virus or a bacterium, these molecules can recognize and bind to fragments of foreign or unusual proteins inside the cell, and display them on the surface of the cell. This allows immune cells to identify and kill the infected cells.</p><p>Cells produce many different MHC class I molecules that are able to bind to different protein fragments. Some MHC molecules can bind to a wider variety of protein fragments than others, and the number of these molecules present on the cell surface can also vary between individuals. Researchers have noticed that individuals with particular MHC molecules tend to be more or less resistant to particular diseases. For instance, individuals with certain MHC molecules tend to take longer to develop AIDS if they become infected with HIV. However, it is not clear how either the variety of protein fragments bound or the numbers of MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells could alter the immune response.</p><p>Here, Chappell, Meziane et al. studied MHC class I molecules in chickens and humans. The experiments reveal that the MHC class I molecules that can bind to a larger variety of protein fragments (so-called ‘generalists’) are present in lower numbers on the surface of cells than molecules that can bind to a smaller variety of fragments (so-called ‘specialists’).</p><p>Furthermore, generalist MHC molecules were found to provide resistance to Marek's disease in chickens—which causes paralysis—but some specialists slowed the progression of HIV infections into AIDS in humans. Chappell, Meziane et al. propose that these two types of MHC class I molecules evolved to perform different roles in immune responses. This is a new way of looking at the role of MHC molecules in fighting disease, and the next challenge is to explore the implications for medicine and evolutionary biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05345.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05345.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Marek's disease</kwd><kwd>peptide repertoire</kwd><kwd>avian</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme grant 089305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meziane</surname><given-names>El Kahina</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Magiera</surname><given-names>Łukasz</given-names></name><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Clemens</given-names></name><name><surname>Mears</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Wrobel</surname><given-names>Antoni G</given-names></name><name><surname>Durant</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaufman</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Funding to the Pirbright Institute</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mwangi</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><name><surname>Butter</surname><given-names>Colin</given-names></name><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Venugopal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chappell</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The number of different peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules to the immune system's T lymphocytes is inversely correlated with cell surface expression and is strongly associated with the response to infectious disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Highly polymorphic class I molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are crucial in the adaptive immune response to viruses and some intracellular bacteria, binding peptides inside the cell and presenting them on the cell surface to CD8 T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">International HIV Controllers Study et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trowsdale and Knight, 2013</xref>). The impact of the MHC in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well recognized, with class I alleles like HLA-B*35:01 leading to rapid onset of AIDS while HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 confer long-term non-progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrington et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulder and Walker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">International HIV Controllers Study et al., 2013</xref>). Various explanations for these associations have been suggested, including antigen presentation of a particularly effective peptide or of a number of peptides to cytotoxic CD8 T cells or recognition (primarily) independent of peptide by natural killer (NK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrington et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kosmrlj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">International HIV Controllers Study et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, the level of cell surface expression of HLA-C alleles correlated with CD8 T cell cytotoxicity has been proposed as one important basis for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how cell expression level might impact on disease resistance is complicated in humans due to the presence of three class I loci, so we began by studying a simpler animal system before examining human class I alleles.</p><p>Long ago, we reported that the relative expression level of MHC class I molecules on the surface of chicken red blood cells as assessed by flow cytometry varies significantly, with cells of the MHC haplotype B21 approximately ten-fold lower than B4, B12, B15, and B19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>). This finding was of interest because the level of cell surface expression is inversely correlated with the reported levels of MHC-determined resistance to Marek's disease, an economically important disease caused by the oncogenic herpesvirus, Marek's disease virus (MDV). Decades of investigation identified B21 (and other haplotypes like B2, B6, and B14) as generally conferring resistance and B19 (and other haplotypes such as B4, B12, and B15) as generally conferring susceptibility (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plachy et al., 1992</xref>). On this basis, we proposed that MHC-determined resistance to Marek's disease could be due to the cell surface expression polymorphism of class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufman and Salomonsen, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Compared to humans, the chicken MHC is relatively simple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 1999</xref>), with two classical class I genes BF1 and BF2 that flank the genes for the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). The TAP transporter pumps peptides from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading nascent class I molecules, and in typical mammals is functionally monomorphic, pumping a wide variety of peptides for all members of the polymorphic class I multigene family. In contrast, chicken TAP genes are highly polymorphic, with each haplotype encoding a TAP molecule with a peptide-translocation specificity matching the peptide-binding specificity of the dominantly expressed class I molecule encoded by the BF2 gene, with the BF1 gene expressed poorly or not at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallny et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In chickens, the peptide-binding specificity of the dominantly expressed class I molecule can determine resistance to infectious pathogens as well as responses to vaccines. The peptide motifs from B4, B12, B15, and B19 class I molecules are if anything more fastidious than human and mouse motifs, with only one or two amino acids found at the positions of anchor residues, with the motifs explaining the immune response to infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>). The fastidious binding of these molecules could be easily understood from wire models of the binding site, in which charged and hydrophobic residues were found in appropriate places to interact in a simple manner with the anchor residues of the bound peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallny et al., 2006</xref>). This view was confirmed from the crystal structure of the dominantly expressed class I molecule BF2*0401 from the B4 haplotype, with positive-charged residues in a narrow groove allowing only certain anchor residues from the peptide to be accommodated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, much less peptide material was isolated from B21 cells, with many amino acids found in every peptide position. Crystal structures demonstrated that the dominantly expressed class I molecule BF2*2101 remodels the binding site to accommodate two peptides with completely different sequences, including the anchor residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the lack of a clear peptide motif could be explained as promiscuous peptide binding due to the remodelling of the peptide-binding site.</p><p>In this paper, we find that two other haplotypes known to confer resistance to Marek's disease also have low cell surface expression and promiscuous peptide motifs, and examine the structural basis for promiscuous binding in three low expressing molecules. We show that the same relationship between cell surface expression and peptide-binding repertoire is found for four human class I molecules, associated with progression to AIDS. Finally, we propose how promiscuous peptide binding might confer resistance to some pathogens, what the basis for the cell surface expression polymorphism might be, and how these properties may relate to different strategies for resistance to pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chicken class I molecules show an inverse correlation between cell surface expression and peptide-binding repertoire</title><p>We reported that the relative level of class I molecules on the surface of erythrocytes is ten-fold lower for adult chickens of the B21 MHC haplotype compared to the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes, as assessed by flow cytometry with two different monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>).

One of these studies reported the predicted peptide-binding repertoires for four human class I alleles, finding a rank hierarchy from the extremely fastidious HLA-B*57:01 to HLA-B*27:05 to HLA-B*07:02 to the highly promiscuous HLA-B*35:01, that correlated directly with progression from HIV infection to AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kosmrlj et al., 2010</xref>).

The two mAb (Tu149 and B1.23.2) reacted with all four HLA-B alleles and gave similar (but not identical) results for both lymphocytes and monocytes, with a rank hierarchy in cell surface expression ranging from HLA-B*57:01 as the highest to HLA-B*27:05 to HLA-B*07:02 to HLA-B*35:01 as the lowest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05345.011</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Anonymized donors with class I alleles and inferred HLA-C expression</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05345.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05345.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Donor</th><th>HLA-A alleles</th><th>HLA-B alleles</th><th>HLA-C alleles</th><th>HLA-C expression</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5701/02</td><td>02:01, 02:01</td><td>57:01, 57:01</td><td>06:02, 15:02</td><td>high, unknown</td></tr><tr><td>5701/03</td><td>01:01, 01:01</td><td>57:01, 57:01</td><td>06:02, 06:02</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>5701/04</td><td>01:01, 03:01</td><td>57:01, 57:01</td><td>06:02, 07:01</td><td>high, low</td></tr><tr><td>2705/1</td><td>03:01, 68:01</td><td>27:05, 27:05</td><td>01:02, 02:02</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>2705/2</td><td>02:06, 11:01</td><td>27:05, 27:05</td><td>01:02, 03:03</td><td>high, low</td></tr><tr><td>2705/3</td><td>02:01, 02:01</td><td>27:05, 27:05</td><td>01:02, 12:03</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>2705/4</td><td>02:01, 02:12</td><td>27:05, 27:05</td><td>unknown</td><td/></tr><tr><td>0702/1</td><td>02:01, 03:01</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>low, low</td></tr><tr><td>0702/2</td><td>03:01, 03:01</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>low, low</td></tr><tr><td>0702/3</td><td>02:01, 03:01</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>low, low</td></tr><tr><td>0702/4</td><td>03:01, 11:01</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>07:02, 07:02</td><td>low, low</td></tr><tr><td>3501/1</td><td>11:01, 11:01</td><td>35:01, 35:01</td><td>04:01, 04:01</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>3501/2</td><td>11:01, 11:01</td><td>35:01, 35:01</td><td>04:01, 04:01</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>3501/3</td><td>03:01, 03:01</td><td>35:01, 35:01</td><td>04:01, 04:01</td><td>high, high</td></tr><tr><td>3501/4</td><td>11:01, 11:01</td><td>35:01, 35:01</td><td>04:01, 04:01</td><td>high, high</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05345.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Human class I molecules show an inverse correlation between cell surface expression level and peptide binding promiscuity.</title><p>Levels of specific antibody binding capacity (SABC) for different mAb: (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Tu149, (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) B1.2.23, (<bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) 22E-1 for (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) ex vivo lymphoctyes and (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) ex vivo monocytes.

First, we extend previous work showing that the chicken BF2*2101 achieves promiscuity by remodelling the peptide binding site in a way unknown for mammals, but we find that two other low expressing chicken class I molecules achieve promiscuity with the same pockets typically used in mammals. By extension, these latter results provide a potential molecular explanation for recent reports that human class I molecules vary in peptide repertoire and other reports that they vary in cell surface expression level. Second, we show that peptide-binding repertoire and level of cell surface expression are inversely correlated in both chickens and humans, indicating that this relationship is a fundamental property of class I molecules. Finally, we find that there is a clear association with resistance to infectious diseases, with the low expressing promiscuous class I molecules associated with resistance to Marek's disease in chickens but associated with faster progression to AIDS in humans. We discuss each of these points in turn.</p><p>The first point is the structural and mechanistic basis for differences in peptide repertoire of chicken class I molecules. In this article, we confirm and extend the finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 2007</xref>) that BF2*2101 binds 10mer and 11mer peptides with three anchor positions, with many different amino acids with different chemical characteristics, mostly charged and polar at positions P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>c-2</sub> (and hydrophobic at P<sub>c</sub>), which is unlike any mammalian molecule described thus far. In contrast, we find that BF2*0201 and BF2*1401 bind 8mer and 9mer peptides with two anchor residues (much like typical mammalian class I molecules), each with a variety of amino acids at P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>c</sub>.</p><p>One question is why BF2*2101 and BF2*0201 bind in such different ways, given that both have Asp24 and Arg9 in their binding sites. In part, this may be due to the difference in residues lining the peptide-binding groove. In BF2*2101, small residues like Gly68(human position 69), Ser69(70), Ser97(99), and Gly152(155) create a big cavity in the centre of the binding groove, allowing Asp24 and Arg9 to move. In BF2*0201 and BF2*1401, the two Ser residues are replaced by the large residues Asn69(70) and Tyr97(99), creating a constricted groove much more like narrow grooves found in high expressing fastidious molecules such as BF2*0401. It is also possible that the length of peptides is determined at least in part by TAP specificity. Together, the narrower groove and the shorter peptides ensure that Asp24 and Arg9 in BF2*0201 (as well as Thr24 and Gln9 in BF2*1401) cannot reach the P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>c-2</sub> positions, and thus they interact (if at all) with the main chain atoms of the peptide.</p><p>Another question is how chicken class I molecules BF2*0201 and BF2*1401 compare to human molecules like HLA-A2, all of which bind peptides with hydrophobic anchor residues. HLA-A2 has one of the widest peptide repertoires among human class I molecules, as assessed by peptide-binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paul et al., 2013</xref>). The anchor residues for HLA-A2 fit into narrow and specific-binding pockets, which allow almost only P<sub>2</sub> Met and Leu for pocket B and P<sub>c</sub> Val and Leu for pocket F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 1993</xref>). Although Leu and Val in particular are relatively common in proteins (so that the number of peptides bearing these amino acids should be relatively high), there is a much larger number of hydrophobic amino acids that are accommodated by the shallower pockets in both BF2*0201 and BF2*1401. Hence, it seems likely that the peptide repertoire of the most promiscuous chicken class I molecules will be greater than the most promiscuous human class I molecules.</p><p>Finally, are there obvious mechanisms by which differences in peptide repertoire arise? In chickens, the peptides presented depend on the peptide-binding specificities of the class I molecule, but also on the peptide-translocation specificities of the TAPs and perhaps also on peptide-editing by tapasin. The genes for chicken TAP and tapasin have at least as many alleles as class I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62a">Walker et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Hateren et al., 2013</xref>). On this basis, we propose that the difference in peptide repertoire (and in cell surface expression level) between chicken class I alleles is determined at the level of peptide loading and editing, likely to take place mostly in the peptide-loading complex. It might not be immediately apparent whether such an explanation could account for the differences in peptide repertoire and cell surface expression of human class I molecules, since human TAPs and tapasin are functionally monomorphic. However, a recent paper suggests that the assembly and cell surface expression of different HLA-B alleles is determined by interaction with the near invariant tapasin molecule, based on variation in the certain HLA-B residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, it is striking that the rank order of expression level that we find for the four HLA-B alleles tested is exactly the same as the rank order of tapasin dependence found in this recent paper.</p><p>The second important point for discussion is why the cell surface expression would be inversely correlated with peptide-binding repertoire. A proximal explanation might be that the biochemical mechanism of peptide loading, as mentioned in the paragraph above, leads to this relationship. Another explanation, similar to the suggestion that multiple MHC molecules lead to a greater chance of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>), is that promiscuous class I molecules confer more resistance to pathogens but also lead to greater autoimmunity compared to fastidious class I molecules.</p><p>We favour a third possibility, prompted by the experimental and supporting theoretical evidence for the notion that a greater number of MHC loci would lead to greater level of negative selection in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vidović and Matzinger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nowak et al., 1992</xref>). In a similar way, one might expect that class I molecules presenting a lesser variety of peptides would negatively select fewer T cell clones, but class I molecules presenting a greater variety of peptides would negatively select many more T cells and create a pauperized T cell repertoire. Therefore, we propose that the peptide-binding repertoire and the cell surface expression levels are inversely correlated precisely to allow similar numbers of T cell clones to survive negative selection and be available in the periphery. In this view, low expressing and promiscuous class I molecules might present many more peptides but each individual peptide would be present on the surface at a much lower level, so that T cells would escape the negative selection that might have occurred at a higher concentration of a particular MHC-peptide complex. In essence, we propose that peptide-binding repertoires and cell surface expression levels have evolved to optimize peripheral T cell responses. Many papers have examined naïve CD8 T cell repertoire in humans and mice (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lo et al., 2014</xref>); such analyses with high and low expressing haplotypes would be informative.</p><p>The third important point for discussion is the fact that the inverse correlation between peptide binding repertoire and cell surface expression level also correlates with resistance and susceptibility to certain infectious pathogens. One important question is how it might work.</p><p>In chickens, these phenomena are correlated with MHC-determined resistance to historic Marek's disease. Many genetic loci contribute to resistance to Marek's disease, but historically the B locus (containing the MHC) was by far the most important, and under strong selection by MDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plachy et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vallejo et al., 1998</xref>). Here, we show that the low expressing promiscuous class I molecules are associated with resistance to Marek's disease, while the high expressing fastidious class I molecules are associated with susceptibility. A consequence of promiscuous binding is that these low expressing class I molecules present a larger repertoire of peptides which should activate a wider range of T cell clones, which may be beneficial in the immune response to certain pathogens. We propose that this breadth of antigen presentation leads to a breadth of T cell response that is the basis of MHC-determined resistance to Marek's disease. Conversely, a narrow T cell response to Marek's disease would be the basis for MHC-determined susceptibility, and there is already evidence for a limited repertoire of CD8 T cell clones infiltrating tumours in susceptible B19 chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mwangi et al., 2011</xref>). Parenthetically, if true this model suggests that the narrowing of CD8 T cell clonality characteristic of responses in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yewdell and Bennink, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yewdell and Del Val, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akram and Inman, 2012</xref>) may not be a feature of responses involving promiscuous class I molecules in chickens.</p><p>For our example in humans, however, we find the opposite disease association. We find that the low expressing promiscuous HLA-B alleles are associated with rapid progression from HIV infection to AIDS, while the high expressing fastidious HLA-B alleles are found in non-progressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrington et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulder and Walker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">International HIV Controllers Study et al., 2013</xref>). The correlation with peptide binding repertoire (as assessed by prediction) of HLA-B alleles had already been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kosmrlj et al., 2010</xref>), but the relationship with cell surface expression level has not. The controller alleles HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 are known to bind and present particular viral peptides that are both protective and difficult for the virus to change without a loss in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillespie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneidewind et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, particular class I molecules may be selected because their fastidious motif presents a particularly protective peptide.</p><p>Is there an obvious evolutionary basis for differences in peptide-binding repertoire? The fact that the fastidious HLA-B*57:01 confers resistance to AIDS while the promiscuous BF2*2101 confers resistance to Marek's disease may be no paradox, in that breadth of peptide presentation may be an appropriate response to some pathogens, while presentation of a particular peptide may be more suitable for other pathogens. Viewed from this perspective, the work presented in this paper has begun to define two groups (or a range between two extremes) of class I molecules that are strategically evolved for different modes of resistance.</p><p>One possible strategy is that fastidious class I molecules with pauci-clonal T cell responses might be better suited for rapidly evolving viruses with a limited scope for immune evasion, for which a particular peptide might be the most efficient way to achieve resistance. In contrast, promiscuous class I molecules might be better suited for pathogens with coding potential for many immune evasion genes and more stability over evolutionary time, such as large DNA viruses, bacteria, and even parasites. There are few reports about pathogen peptides that are presented in chickens, but the large literature on the MHC restriction of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in humans and mice (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fitzmaurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulder and Walker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macnamara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moss and Khan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steven et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yim and Selvaraj, 2010</xref>) may be reinterpreted, as the peptide repertoire and cell surface expression levels of the class I molecules become known.</p><p>Another potentially fruitful way of considering the strategies of class I molecules (not necessarily exclusive of the first view) might be as generalists and specialists. There is a large literature in biology that examines the generalist/specialist paradigm at the species level, typically testing the model that ‘the jack of all trades is the master of none’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McArthur, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Futuyma and Moreno, 1988</xref>). Recent examples, among many others, include breadth of diet by insect herbivore species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali and Agrawal, 2012</xref>), niche breadth by bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julliard et al., 2006</xref>), competition on shared hosts by aphid parasitoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Straub et al., 2011</xref>), and weasel predation of voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sundell and Ylönen, 2008</xref>), as well as mathematical models to disentangle the contributions by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remold, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Büchi and Vuilleumier, 2014</xref>). Indeed, the terms generalist and specialist MHC alleles have already been used for describing correlations of class II alleles of the striped mouse in Africa with number of nematode species carried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Froeschke and Sommer, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this view, the promiscuous class I molecules would be generalists, which one might expect to suffice for protection against a wide variety of the most common pathogens. However, such generalists might not suffice for protection from a new and/or an especially virulent pathogen that suddenly appears, at which point there would be a strong selection for a specialist class I molecule that was particularly suited to deal with the new threat. The properties of fastidious class I molecules are consistent with selection as specialists for particular pathogens, perhaps including those no longer a danger in the current population.</p><p>The importance of these concepts for immunology and medicine may be clear from the discussion above, but there are also ramifications for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation. As one example, the number of MHC alleles is considered a key measure for population diversity in estimating the risk of extinction, both as a measure of overall genome diversity and in terms of fitness, including resilience to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sommer, 2005</xref>). However, a population with a few generalist MHC alleles might remain healthy compared to a population with many inappropriate specialist MHC alleles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>Ex vivo chicken cells were from inbred chicken lines with known MHC haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>), kept at the University of Cambridge.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrej Kosmrlj, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this paper may represent an important study. You aim to demonstrate both in chickens and humans that the expression levels of MHC molecules on the surface of cells are inversely correlated with promiscuity of peptide binding. Interestingly MHC types, which are promiscuous for peptide binding and are thus expressed at lower levels, are associated with resistance to Marek's disease in chickens, while in humans they are associated with faster progression to AIDS. The opposite is true for MHC types, which are more restrictive for peptide binding. However, all reviewers also agree that several important points need to be addressed, and some speculations refined, before this paper is acceptable for publication. The points that need to be addressed are summarized below:</p><p>1) The authors state in the Results section, that both antibodies used to measure HLA*B expression levels gave similar but non-identical results, which suggested to them that they recognize different epitopes on the HLA-B molecules. This is very likely to be an incorrect conclusion, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps et al. (2009)</xref> present data strongly indicating that these antibodies actually do recognize the same epitope. The possibility that expression levels of HLA-B correlate with peptide binding promiscuity in humans is very intriguing, but the authors are encouraged to expand their monoclonals to a set that will more definitively measure HLA-B allotype expression. There are antibodies that recognize certain HLA-B allotypes specifically and with equal affinity, including pairs of the allotypes included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The bridging of this work from chickens (where the correlation data between peptide binding promiscuity and expression levels are clear cut) to humans is a major point of the paper, so the expression data need to be definitive. Finally, if possible, inclusion of data on HLA-A would strengthen conclusions drawn from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>?</p><p>2) Repertoire size in the study has been defined on the basis of the breadth of the primary anchor motif. But, it is not clear that this is the same as the number of peptides actually bound and presented. An allele with a diverse motif, defined here as having a large repertoire, might in the end present fewer peptides because nothing really binds well. Conversely, an allele with a narrow motif might bind everything that has the motif, and in the end have a large repertoire. In this respect, defining repertoire size on the basis of motif diversity, and not on the basis of actually bound peptides, is a limitation. Some way to quantify repertoire size beyond just the number of amino acids preferred at the various anchor residues needs to be established.</p><p>3) The demarcation of alleles into generalist and specialists is interesting. However, this is likely to be a continuum, and not a strict dichotomy. At the same time, surface expression is also likely to be a continuum. The present study suggests that these two continuums run in parallel (but opposite directions). There is too little data to convincingly establish this. An example of a manifestation of the looseness of this argument is the following. According to the authors, the HLA-B57 allele would be classified as a specialist for a particular pathogen. However, it is known that they are associated with protection against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). On the other hand the more promiscuous allele HLA-B8 would be classified as a generalist, but this allele is known to be associated with faster disease progression in HIV and HCV. In this regard, it may be good to also list T cell cross-reactivity as a potentially significant variable for highly mutable pathogens (see Kosmrlj et al), and the importance of presenting peptides from mutationally vulnerable regions of HIV (see Dahirel et al, 2011), Ferguson et al, 2013, and other references). What can be said about other infections where there is significant HLA association?</p><p>4) The authors suggest that the difference in cell surface expression level in chickens might have to do with peptide loading and editing? Is there any data that suggest peptide loading affects surface expression levels? This would be important to cite.</p><p>5) Is there any data to suggest that lower expression levels of class I leads to escape from negative selection (which is implied in the Discussion section, paragraph eight)?</p><p>6) The Discussion is thought-provoking, but a bit long and could do with some tightening and perhaps less speculation in cases where background data for the models do not yet exist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05345.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers agree that this paper may represent an important study.

To put this request into perspective, the two papers on the expression level of human class I molecules (Nature Genetics and Science, for which the level of proof should have been high) describe data with one single monoclonal antibody directed to HLA-C and large panels of humans bearing all kinds of HLA types, mostly heterozygote for HLA-C, giving a vast range of expression levels from which the authors derive a statistical result. Inspection of the data shows that the concordance of alleles with expression level is not perfect, even for identified homozygotes.</p><p>We chose a different approach, which was to pick individuals examined in great detail for their MHC alleles that had the right array of class I alleles to allow us to examine the four HLA-B alleles without confounding effects of heterozygosity or HLA-A cross-reaction. It took us over two years to get all these data, in large part because these carefully chosen individuals are only willing to donate at times of their own convenience. As appealing as it is (for us as well as for the reviewers) to gather substantially more data, recruitment of new donors and subsequent experiments are likely to take us at least another two years, and therefore are outside the scope of this current paper.</p><p>We also chose to use two different monoclonal antibodies, twice as many as were used in the two previous publications. On the basis of the similar but non-identical results of the two antibodies with the four kinds of donors, we suggested that the epitopes for these antibodies are likely not to be identical. The reviewer countered that data in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al 2013</xref> paper suggests that the epitopes are identical, presumably (since they did not state why) because of concordance of reaction with a range of class I alleles, with the implication that the two antibodies were not independent and thus were no better than previous data with HLA-C. We have responded in two ways. First, we test whether either antibody will inhibit the other, finding that the two antibodies do inhibit each other and therefore have at the least overlapping epitopes, but that one inhibited the other much better than the reverse suggesting that they have very different affinities. Second, we used a third monoclonal antibody that recognizes only HLA-B57 and HLA-B27 (and thus is extremely likely to recognize a separate epitope) and found the same pattern with two donors as with the other two antibodies.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers ask us to examine many other HLA allele pairs with monoclonal antibodies. We chose the four HLA-B alleles because they have been examined in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kosmrlj et al, 2010</xref>, Nature article (for which, again, the level of proof should have been high) that had gone some way towards understanding the story we have been working on for 20 years. It took us two years to recruit the donors for the experiments involving two monoclonal antibodies with these four alleles, and a further two months to recruit two further donors to examine with an additional antibody in response to the review. A study with the many antibodies envisaged by the reviewers would be extremely interesting, but it likely to take years to complete in a worthwhile fashion, and therefore is outside the scope of the current paper.</p><p><italic>2) Repertoire size in the study has been defined on the basis of the breadth of the primary anchor motif. But, it is not clear that this is the same as the number of peptides actually bound and presented. An allele with a diverse motif, defined here as having a large repertoire, might in the end present fewer peptides because nothing really binds well. Conversely, an allele with a narrow motif might bind everything that has the motif, and in the end have a large repertoire. In this respect, defining repertoire size on the basis of motif diversity, and not on the basis of actually bound peptides, is a limitation. Some way to quantify repertoire size beyond just the number of amino acids preferred at the various anchor residues needs to be established</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point that we should have considered. As a result, we now include an experiment comparing B19 and B21 cell lines. The B19 cells have twice as many class I molecules on the cell surface as assessed by flow cytometry, but have only one third as many sequences of peptides as assessed by immuno-isolation followed by mass spectrometry analysis. These results show that promiscuous class I alleles can and do bind a greater variety of peptides that are presented on the cell surface.</p><p><italic>3) The demarcation of alleles into generalist and specialists is interesting. However, this is likely to be a continuum, and not a strict dichotomy. At the same time, surface expression is also likely to be a continuum. The present study suggests that these two continuums run in parallel (but opposite directions). There is too little data to convincingly establish this</italic>.</p><p>This portion of the comment appears to repeat our arguments back to us. In the Discussion we say “the work presented in this paper has begun to define two groups (or a range between two extremes) of class I molecules that are strategically evolved for different modes of resistance”, although due to space limitations we only mention the two groups in the Abstract. Of course more data is always welcome, but we judge that we have shown enough data to support our argument.</p><p><italic>An example of a manifestation of the looseness of this argument is the following. According to the authors, the HLA-B57 allele would be classified as a specialist for a particular pathogen. However, it is known that they are associated with protection against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). On the other hand the more promiscuous allele HLA-B8 would be classified as a generalist, but this allele is known to be associated with faster disease progression in HIV and HCV. In this regard, it may be good to also list T cell cross-reactivity as a potentially significant variable for highly mutable pathogens (see Kosmrlj et al), and the importance of presenting peptides from mutationally vulnerable regions of HIV (see Dahirel et al, 2011</italic>, <italic>Ferguson et al, 2013, and other references). What can be said about other infections where there is significant HLA association?</italic></p><p>We are glad that reviewers find the generalist and specialist idea interesting, but it is only one of several ways we propose as ways to look at this phenomenon, and we are careful to say that the different proposals are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In the Discussion we state: “One possible strategy is that fastidious class I molecules with pauci-clonal T cell responses might be better suited for rapidly evolving viruses with a limited scope for immune evasion, for which a particular peptide might be the most efficient way to achieve resistance. In contrast, promiscuous class I molecules might be better suited for pathogens with coding potential for many immune evasion genes and more stability over evolutionary time, such as large DNA viruses, bacteria and even parasites.” The fact that B57 protects from both HIV and HCV, while B8 does not, may lend support to the proposal that fastidious class I molecules are better for viruses with mutable regions while promiscuous molecules are better for more stable pathogens with larger genomes. However, such an analysis as suggested is well beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that the difference in cell surface expression level in chickens might have to do with peptide loading and editing? Is there any data that suggest peptide loading affects surface expression levels? This would be important to cite</italic>.</p><p>The first sentence is phrased as a question, and there is no doubt that we have made this point as a proposal in the Discussion. To our knowledge, there is little pertinent data published even for mammals; we already have cited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizvi et al, 2014</xref>, J Immunol.</p><p><italic>5) Is there any data to suggest that lower expression levels of class I leads to escape from negative selection (which is implied in the Discussion section, paragraph eight)?</italic></p><p>We are not aware of any published data on this point, but it is stated explicitly (not implied as asserted by the reviewer) as part of our proposal in the Discussion that flows directly from our interpretation of the data presented in this manuscript and is an ongoing area of research in our laboratory. Extension of data into novel hypotheses is standard scientific practice, as a way of stimulating interest in further experimentation. For instance, in their 2010 Nature article Kosmrlj et al proposed that promiscuous class I molecules led to pauperized T cell repertoires, a proposal for which they presented no experimental evidence but which has stimulated further thought (not the least for us).</p><p><italic>6) The Discussion is thought-provoking, but a bit long and could do with some tightening and perhaps less speculation in cases where background data for the models do not yet exist</italic>.</p><p>We have made changes to the Discussion to clarify and add support to the proposals made. In any case, our main text is within 150 words of the 5000 words recommended by the current Author Guides and Policies published on-line by <italic>eLife</italic>. Therefore, we see no reason to shorten or limit the Discussion, which we hope is full of interesting new ideas.</p></body></sub-article></article>
