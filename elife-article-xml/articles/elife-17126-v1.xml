This decision is vital in animals that reproduce in an all-or-nothing mode, such as bristle worms: females committed to reproduction spend roughly half their body mass for yolk and egg production; following mass spawning, the parents die. An enigmatic brain hormone activity suppresses reproduction. We now identify this hormone as the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate. Methylfarnesoate suppresses transcript levels of the yolk precursor Vitellogenin both in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>, directly inhibiting a central energy–costly step of reproductive maturation. We reveal that contrary to common assumptions, sesquiterpenoids are ancient animal hormones present in marine and terrestrial lophotrochozoans. In turn, insecticides targeting this pathway suppress vitellogenesis in cultured worm cells. These findings challenge current views of animal hormone evolution, and indicate that non-target species and marine ecosystems are susceptible to commonly used insect larvicides.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17126.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17126.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17126.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All organisms need energy to survive and grow. However, sources of energy are limited and so organisms need to decide how to spend the resources they have available. For instance, animals must choose whether they should continue to grow or if they should invest energy into reproduction instead. This decision becomes even more important for animals that reproduce in an “all-or-nothing” manner and invest all their available energy into reproduction and die soon after.</p><p>Bristle worms live in coastal areas around world. In mass spawning events, thousands of individuals raise from the sea floor to the surface, to release sperm and eggs. While the fertilized eggs start to develop in the water, the parents invariably die. The female worms spend roughly half their body mass in producing eggs and supplying them with yolk as a source of energy. It has been known for decades that the brains of bristle worms produce a master hormone that promotes growth and suppresses reproduction. Yet the identity of this hormone that controls the life-or-death decision was not clear.</p><p>Schenk et al. took advantage of new molecular tools to solve this puzzle. The experiments show that this hormone directly regulates how much yolk the female animals produce. This allowed Schenk et al. to design a new molecular assay that helped to identify the hormone itself. Unexpectedly, the hormone – called methylfarnesoate – belongs to a family of small molecules called sesquiterpenoids, which researchers previously thought were only found in insects and related groups. Hence, many insecticides have been developed to target sesquiterpenoid signaling and they are used in massive amounts to fight pests like the tiger mosquito (which transmits the Zika virus). Schenk et al. also found that these insecticides also cause severe problems in bristle-worms.</p><p>These findings challenge current views of how animal hormones have evolved and indicate that common insecticides may be harming bristle worms and other animals in marine environments. The next steps are to find out whether methylfarnesoate is found in other closely related animals, such as snails and mussels, and whether the insecticides are harmful to these animals too. Another future challenge will be to investigate how this hormone actually promotes animal growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17126.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17126.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hormone</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>vitellogenin</kwd><kwd>insecticides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>P. dumerilii</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M1478-B19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schenk</surname><given-names>Sven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003065</institution-id><institution>Universität Wien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Platform Marine Rhythms of Life</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerner</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement 260304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A small brain-derived lipid prevents bristle worms from entering maturation and death, challenging current views of hormone evolution and pesticide specificity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As animals rely on limited energy resources, they require regulatory mechanisms to decide how to best invest available energy and biomaterial. Some of the most extreme changes of energy expenditure are observed in so-called semelparous animals that reproduce only once and typically die afterwards. In both vertebrate and invertebrate representatives of semelparous animals, the switch to the reproductive state is accompanied by a massive breakdown of somatic tissue, in favor of forming and nourishing germ cells: migrating salmon break down about 50% of their white muscle mass while their gonad mass multiplies around six-fold during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mommsen, 2004</xref>). Likewise, female squids exhibit almost complete histolysis of mantle muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson and Mladenov, 1994</xref>), and in mature female squids up to ~60% of the total body mass at spawning consists of eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in the marine annelid worm <italic>Nereis virens</italic>, oocytes represent up to about 40% of the body mass of the spawning adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoeger et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Insight into the molecules regulating these extreme shifts of energy expenditure has remained limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mommsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hébert Chatelain et al., 2008</xref>). This can largely be attributed to the lack of an appropriate laboratory model system amenable to molecular research. In this study, we explore the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, a semelparous animal that can easily be reared in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hauenschild and Fischer, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Dorresteijn, 2004</xref>) and has been established as a molecular model system over the last decade (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zantke et al., 2014</xref>). A series of studies show that <italic>Platynereis</italic> has retained various ancient-type characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raible et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keay and Thornton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christodoulou et al., 2010</xref>), compatible with the notion that the hormones present in this species are also more broadly comparable with other clades.</p><p>In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, the critical switch to the reproductive life stage has been linked to a hormonal activity released by the medial brain. This brain hormonal activity – also termed nereidin – was found to repress sexual maturation and to promote growth of the trunk and posterior regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): Decerebration of <italic>Platynereis</italic> leads to an accelerated sexual maturation and to the loss of regenerative abilities, whereas re-implantation of a juvenile head with neuroendocrine activity is able to reverse these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauenschild, 1956a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1956b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1966</xref>). In the related species <italic>Nereis diversicolor</italic>, it could be shown that implantation of ganglia from immature animals into the coelomic cavity of maturing animals, reversed the effects of the decreasing nereidin concentration. In particular, germ cells were resorbed and the ability to regenerate lost segments was re-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding and Yuwono, 1994</xref>). These findings highlight the exceptional importance of neuroendocrine signals in semelparous reproduction and suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms are conserved across different annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hauenschild, 1956b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golding, 1967a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1967b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durchon and Porchet, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hofmann, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding and Yuwono, 1994</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17126.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Vitellogenin</italic> expression in eleocytes is a quantitative measure for the maturation stage of <italic>Platynereis</italic>, allowing for the establishment of a bioassay to purify the enigmatic brain hormone, nereidin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme summarising the critical role of the brain hormone nereidin in energy expenditure, as derived from classical experiments: Before maturation (left), high nereidin levels sustain somatic growth, but repress reproduction; drops in nereidin activity levels initiate the generation of germ cells and sexual maturation (right).

However, the results of classical experiments allow for several hypotheses concerning the function and molecular properties of this key brain hormone: (i) When present, nereidin interferes with a critical step required for the animals to enter the cost-intensive process of maturation. (ii) The effective hormone concentration decreases from young animals to mature animals, such that the drop in nereidin concentration allows maturation to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauenschild, 1956a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1956b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding, 1983</xref>). (iii) As Nereidin-like activities have been identified in various annelids, this suggests that these substances could be chemically related.</p><p>Histological analyses of the proposed biosynthetically active brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Müller, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hofmann, 1976</xref>) were compatible with a fourth hypothesis, namely that nereidin is a neuropeptide.

These finally resulted in the identification of a hexapeptide (PPGPPG). However, this peptide did not display biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durchon, 1984</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we take advantage of a newly developed, quantitative cell culture-based bioassay that measures transcript levels of the main <italic>Platynereis</italic> yolk precursor Vitellogenin (Vtg). Using this assay, we demonstrate that nereidin activity is not sensitive to proteinase treatment, challenging the long-standing hypothesis that nereidin is a peptide. Instead, we correlate nereidin activity with methylfarnesoate (MF), a substance belonging to the hormone class of sesquiterpenoids that has so far been assumed to be restricted to arthropods. We demonstrate that the concentration of MF drops in the course of maturation – as predicted from classical nereidin activity assays – and that eleocytes express the orthologue of a sesquiterpenoid receptor. This, together with our finding that MF exerts its action on <italic>vitellogenin</italic> production not only in cell culture, but also <italic>in vivo</italic>, establishes MF as a brain hormone orchestrating a critical metabolic switch in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>. We finally show that insecticides targeting the sesquiterpenoid pathway interfere with <italic>Platynereis</italic> vitellogenesis, revealing a profound impact of insect growth regulators on a presumed non-target organism that serves as a key marine reference species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A fast and sensitive assay to assess maturation in <italic>Platynereis</italic></title><p>One of the major challenges faced by previous attempts to identify the brain hormone activity was the absence of a fast and sensitive bioassay to measure the inhibitory effect of nereidin on sexual maturation.

However, the respective assay required more than a week of culturing and substantial input material (thousands of sampled heads). Using this qualitative assay, and systematic fractionating of head extracts, the brain hormone activity could be associated with a small (M<sub>R</sub> ≤ 2.000), lipophilic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardon, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durchon and Porchet, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardon et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>In order to establish a sensitive read-out for <italic>Platynereis</italic> maturation, we decided to focus on the yolk protein precursor Vtg. Yolk production underlies the significant increase in oocyte diameter observed in nereidids during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer and Hoeger, 1993</xref>). Yolk protein is derived by endocytotic uptake of Vtg into the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 1991</xref>), where it accounts for more than 40% of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer and Schmitz, 1981</xref>), reflecting its central role as reproductive investment. Vtg is synthesised in coelomic cells called eleocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that are present in large numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baert and Slomianny, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hoeger, 1991</xref>). Eleocytes and oocytes are freely floating in the coelomic cavity and can therefore easily be isolated and taken into primary (co)-culture, making them an excellent experimental model system to assess and monitor maturation in <italic>Platynereis</italic> and other nereidids, and to investigate the concomitant metabolic changes associated with this process.</p><p>Based on the central role of eleocytes and Vtg for oocyte growth, we hypothesised that the expression level of <italic>vtg</italic> in eleocytes might be a suitable molecular read-out for maturation. As a first step, we identified a <italic>Platynereis vtg</italic> candidate in eleocyte transcriptome data (Sven Schenk, Fritz Sedlazeck, Florian Raible, unpublished). Domain analyses and molecular phylogeny indicate that the protein encoded by this gene is an orthologue of Vtg identified in other animals (insects, molluscs, amphibians and birds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we designed qRT-PCR primers to test if <italic>vtg</italic> transcript levels in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> eleocytes increased over female maturation, as suggested by the increase of Vtg protein secretion in <italic>P. cultrifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baert and Slomianny, 1992</xref>). Indeed, we found a strong correlation between <italic>vtg</italic>-transcript abundance in eleocytes and the maturation state of the animal (as assessed by oocyte diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that <italic>vtg</italic> transcript levels could be used for a quantitative maturation assay. Given the central metabolic role of eleocytes in the reproductive switch, we further hypothesised that nereidin acts directly on eleocytes to regulate <italic>vtg</italic> production. We therefore designed a bioassay that takes coelomic cells into primary cell culture. After adding fractions of our purification scheme to small aliquots of this culture, and incubating these overnight, we extracted RNA from the cells and analysed them by qRT-PCR to determine the levels of <italic>vtg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Methylfarnesoate is the active component of the brain hormone and acts at physiological concentrations</title><p>After establishing this bioassay, we used it to chemically isolate the brain hormone-activity of <italic>Platynereis</italic>.

This assumption was mainly based on the results of partial characterisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durchon, 1984</xref>), as well as histological observations, by which the brain regions producing nereidin were shown to contain highly active secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Müller, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hofmann, 1976</xref>). To assess whether the recovered nereidin activity was of proteinaceous nature, we treated the obtained eluate with proteinase K, and tested if this affected the ability of the eluate to repress <italic>vtg</italic> levels in cell culture. Our results demonstrate that nereidin is insensitive to proteinase K-treatment, thus strongly arguing against the notion that it is a neuropeptide hormone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To further characterise the recovered eluate, 250 premature worm heads were extracted and fractionated on a Phenyl-SPE-column.

A total of 16 fractions eluting from the column were collected and tested in the cell culture-based bioassay for their impact on <italic>vtg</italic> transcript levels. One peak (peak 15) could be identified that robustly and significantly reduced <italic>vtg</italic> transcripts in two independent experiments and showed a reasonable chromatographic purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Analysis of peak 15 by LC-MS/MS clearly demonstrated the presence of the sesquiterpenoid methylfarnesoate (MF), when compared to an authentic standard run under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test if MF was indeed the active compound in peak 15, we tested the effect of authentic MF on <italic>vtg</italic> transcript levels in the established cell culture assay.

Strongest effects were observed in the range between 1 and 100 nM MF, in agreement with physiological concentrations expected for a hormone.

However, as we used heads to extract MF rather than haemolymph, we used in a first step 80% methanol (as in our initial extraction protocol, see above) followed by liquid-liquid extraction into heptane, instead of directly diluting the sample with the methanolic-organic extraction solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Westerlund and Hoffmann, 2004</xref>).

Both functions have been used interchangeably in nereidin research. However, the lack of molecular candidates for nereidin has prevented the assessment of whether both functions rely on identical molecules, or if they can be separated. In a final set of experiments, we therefore tested if MF had any impact on regeneration of caudal body segments. To minimise inter-individual variations in regenerative capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golding, 1967b</xref>), we followed a similar approach as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauenschild (1974)</xref> in which hormone-exposed and control fragments were derived from the same animal. In addition, as in our maturation assays, we aimed to develop a quantitative approach to assess the molecular effect of MF on caudal regeneration. For this, we established a qRT-PCR assay quantifying the expression of the homeobox gene <italic>hox3. Hox3</italic> expression has earlier been demonstrated to be a highly specific early on marker in caudal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfeifer et al., 2012</xref>). More specifically, it has recently been linked to ectodermal cells of likely stem cell character (ectoteleoblasts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gazave et al., 2013</xref>) involved in the regenerative process. Our results show that the expression of <italic>hox3</italic> is significantly up-regulated (~2 fold) after 5 days in test fragments treated with 100 nM MF when compared to DMSO-treated control fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This finding is consistent with the idea that besides its role in repressing maturation, MF may also contributes to sustaining putative stem cells involved in regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Together, our results establish methylfarnesoate as a critical neurohormone suppressing maturation in a key lophotrochozoan reference species. Our data are fully consistent with properties classically attributed to nereidin: in light of the massive amounts of Vitellogenin that are produced by animals committed to reproduction, the ability of MF to suppress <italic>vtg</italic> levels is compatible with a central role of this compound in controlling reproduction-associated energy expenditure, as expected for nereidin. Likewise, our quantifications of MF levels over the course of reproductive development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are consistent with the decline in nereidin activity present in transplanted heads of different stages. Although our data clearly argue against the long-held assumption that nereidin is a neuropeptide, they are still consistent with the chemical properties (apparent mass, lipophilic nature) that have been derived from previous purification attempts. Likewise, the data are consistent with the notion that related hormones are present in other annelids (see below).</p><p>Our findings not only reveal an overall role of this sesquiterpenoid in governing energy expenditure but also highlight critical mechanistic aspects: (i) We show that eleocytes are direct target cells for MF, indicating a direct cross-talk between the brain and a highly relevant metabolic cell type. (ii) Moreover, the observed effect of MF on <italic>vitellogenin</italic> levels is consistent with a direct function of MF in controlling this key factor for oocyte maturation. (iii) The positive autoregulation of the sesquiterpenoid receptor orthologue Met that we observe is reminiscent of other hormone ligand-receptor systems, such as thyroxin or ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thummel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamasbad and Denver, 2011</xref>). In the biological context of semelparous reproduction, such autoregulation provides an attractive model how graded changes in MF levels can be amplified, contributing to sharpening the response of the target cells to above- vs. below-threshold levels.</p><p>Future work on the fine-tuning of MF regulation, and its effect on target cells, will likely yield more detailed insight into the role of MF for eleocyte physiology. Such analyses will extend our understanding of molecular changes in the eleocyte, for instance to cover genes involved in nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoeger et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, they will resolve the question if residual levels of MF signalling are required for proper vitellogenesis, or if vitellogenesis only takes place in complete absence of MF. This addresses classical debates about the requirement of nereidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauenschild, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durchon and Porchet, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding, 1983</xref>) but is also interesting for cross-comparisons between the annelid system and insects, where sesquiterpenoids do not only define juvenile stages – similar to <italic>Platynereis</italic> – but in later life play a – positive – role for vitellogenesis itself.</p><p>A second phenomenon where the identification of MF provides important mechanistic insight, and opens up new experimental possibilities concerns the question of how regenerative abilities of <italic>Platynereis</italic> and other species are controlled. From a global perspective of organismal energy expenditure, it is plausible that semelparous reproduction (investment in growth of germ cells) and regeneration (investment in re-growth of soma) are anti-correlated, although it remains unclear exactly how this is achieved at the molecular level. Our finding that MF sustains expression of a marker (<italic>hox3</italic>) characteristic for a population of putative stem cells in posterior segment addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfeifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gazave et al., 2013</xref>) is consistent with the idea that MF also plays a role in regenerative control, but in contrast to <italic>vtg</italic> regulation in eleocytes, it is less clear if this effect is direct or caused by other mediating factors. Due to the complexity of regeneration, reliable and quantitative short-term assays for regeneration will need to be established to pursue this question.</p><p>The identification of MF in <italic>Platynereis</italic> heads challenges several hypotheses: most directly, it defeats the hypothesis that nereidin is a peptide, a notion that has been propagated in the literature for more than 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durchon, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, MF and related sesquiterpenoid hormones have so far only been found in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellés et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jindra et al., 2015</xref>), and their evolution has been hypothesised to be a secondary consequence of the loss of the sterol synthesis pathway in this clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zandee, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellés et al., 2005</xref>). As marine nereidid worms were previously shown to possess a functional sterol synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wootton and Wright, 1962</xref>), and <italic>Platynereis</italic> even has a functional estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keay and Thornton, 2009</xref>), our discovery makes it unlikely that loss of sterol synthesis preceded the evolution of sesquiterpenoid hormones. Rather, it suggests that, like sterols, bioactive sesquiterpenoids, could have been part of the ancient molecular repertoire available in the common ancestor of protostomes, if not even at earlier stages of animal evolution.</p><p>Several lines of experimental evidence support this notion: Exogenous MF was found to affect larval development of the annelid <italic>Capitella sp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laufer and Biggers, 2001</xref>), and annelid extracts displayed biological activity in assays for insect juvenile hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneiderman and Gilbert, 1958</xref>). The latter result would suggest that insect juvenile hormones might also be active in the annelid system, but this issue has not yet been addressed experimentally. Moreover, we have detected MF in head extracts of common earthworms (<italic>Lumbricus sp.</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Beyond the annelid clade, our identification of Methoprene-tolerant orthologues in the limpet <italic>Lottia</italic> and the pond snail <italic>Lymnaea</italic> indicates that the sesquiterpenoid signalling pathway might even exist in molluscs. As annelids and molluscs are large groups within the lophotrochozoan superphylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halanych et al., 1995</xref>), this implies a potential physiological role for sesquiterpenoids in a broad set of (mostly aquatic) species.</p><p>What could such physiological roles be? Semelparity, as it occurs in <italic>Platynereis</italic>, is considered an extreme form of 'capital breeding', a reproductive strategy where females build up large energy stores in their bodies that are then invested into offspring at particular time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drent and Daan, 1980</xref>). Capital breeding strategies allow animals to time their reproduction more precisely and have larger clutches of offspring than could be afforded by daily nutrient uptake. It likely represents an ancient reproductive strategy that is very common in poikilothermic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnet et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that the role for MF uncovered in the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis</italic> could reflect a more general role of sesquiterpenoids in regulating reproductive energy expenditure. The inhibitory function for maturation we uncover in <italic>Platynereis</italic> is reminiscent of the juvenoid functions of insect juvenile hormones: During pre-adult development, these provide a molecular cue for juvenile status, preventing insects from entering into adulthood, and thereby indirectly preventing reproductive energy expenditure as well. Likewise, MF treatment of larval stages of crustaceans can delay metamorphosis or prevent gonad formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borst et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsukimura et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>During adulthood, however, insect and crustacean sesquiterpenoids have distinct functions. In contrast to our results in worms, juvenile hormones commonly act as positive regulators of vitellogenesis in the adult insect fat body, whereas their down-regulation is associated with diapause and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gäde et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wyatt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, MF promotes adult maturation, vitellogenesis and mating behaviour in crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laufer et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Homola and Chang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Subramoniam, 2011</xref>), with a separate function in sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Toyota et al., 2015</xref>). As <italic>Platynereis</italic> retains certain MF levels even in the mature stage (see above), it will be a suitable model to address additional roles of MF in the life history of an annelid.</p><p>Finally, our discovery of a sesquiterpenoid hormone in an annelid is not only relevant to understand hormone evolution but it likely also has significant ecological implications. Reproductive hormones are attractive targets for pesticides. Juvenile hormone analogues like methoprene and later pyriproxyfen have initially been designed to interfere with insect development and are broadly used to fight insect pests such as <italic>Aedes</italic>, a vector for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Henrick, 2007</xref>). The discovery the sesquiterpenoid MF in crustaceans by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laufer et al. (1987)</xref> already raised concerns if the effect of juvenile hormone analogues is restricted to insect development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2015</xref>), calling for more specific tests with non-target species. Our results argue that aquatic lophotrochozoans should also be systematically included in specificity tests for compounds targeting sesquiterpenoid signalling pathway, and that such tests should not be restricted to mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Henrick, 2007</xref>), but include assays on reproductive fitness. For instance, in our studies, pyriproxyfen impacts on <italic>vtg</italic> levels at concentrations of 10 nM which lies in the range of pyriproxyfen found in surface waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sullivan and Goh, 2008</xref>). In turn, sesquiterpenoid analogues may also be suitable leads in the search for specific compounds targeting pest species outside the arthropod clade or factors to favourably affect the balance between reproductive and somatic growth in aqua- and mariculture.</p><p>Taken together, our data argue for a critical role of sesquiterpenoid hormones outside arthropods and indicate that methylfarnesoate is the major constituent of the long-sought brain hormone nereidin, a key factor in regulating maturation in marine capital breeders. The discovery of this hormone in an annelid provides a new entry point to understand hormonal regulation of energy expenditure and sheds new light on the evolution of animal hormone systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> were kept in a continuous culture at the Marine Facility of the Max F.

The fragments were then kept in 1 mL sterile-filtered NSW containing half concentrated ampicillin/streptomycin in GC-auto sampler vials containing either 100 nM methylfarnesoate (added from a 100 µM stock solution in DMSO, fragment ‘+MF’), or vehicle alone (0.1% DMSO, fragment ‘−MF’); during the course of the experiment, the water was exchanged every 24 hr, care was taken to not let the worm fragments dry out. To rule out any effect of the position within the animal on regenerative abilities, +MF and control were alternated between the anterior and posterior fragments. The anterior and posterior +MF- and control fragments of two individual worms were combined, to serve as one biological replicate for +MF, and –MF treatment groups, respectively. They were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80°C and used for the quantification of hox3 via qRT-PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Gene identification and confirmation</title><p>A transcript sequence encoding <italic>Platynereis</italic> Vitellogenin (accession no.

If more than one comparison was to be assessed, statistical significance was first tested by a one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA), and if significance was given, pair wise comparisons were carried out by a (Welch-corrected) t-test and the obtained p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by the method of Benjamini and Hochberg implemented in R yielding adjusted p-values (p<sub>adj</sub>).

Can the authors explain why a one-tailed t-test is performed? Since MF is actually crucial for vitellogenesis in insect with ancestral characteristics, I don't think the hypothesis can automatically be that MF will reduce Vg mRNA levels… For several of the experiments, the two-sided t-test does not show significant effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.

This is basically a very good analytical biochemistry paper that focused on a developmental problem – but didn't provide any insight into how the molecule works or how it is regulated.</italic> </p><p>In line with the procedure agreed upon in discussion with the editors, we have revised the manuscript to improve the two aspects that the reviewer highlighted:</p><p>1) Mechanistic insight (“how the molecule works”). We significantly revised our Discussion (relevant sections: second and fourth paragraphs) to emphasize more clearly the significant novel mechanistic insight that this study achieved. This includes:</p><p>1.1) Identification of specific target cells.</p><p>We were not only able to assign overall effects of methylfarnesoate on the whole organism, but rather could pinpoint the impact of the hormone on a specific target cell type (the eleocyte). As we show, this cell type consistently also express the seqsquiterpenoid receptor orthologue of the bristleworm. Eleocytes are known to play pivotal roles in reproductive decision, and identifying them as direct targets of the brain hormone is significant insight into the mechanism how reproduction is controlled by the brain hormone.</p><p>1.2) The role of methylfarnesoate to directly regulate vitellogenesis.</p><p>We report that methylfarnesoate has a significant effect on the expression of vitellogenin, the yolk precursor, in eleocytes. As yolk makes up almost half of the biomass of a mature female, and is thought to be exclusively produced by eleocytes, the regulation we report is strong mechanistic evidence for a major and relevant metabolic switch being controlled by the brain hormone.</p><p>1.3) Methylfarnesoate autoregulates is putative receptor.</p><p>This insight results from quantification of receptor gene expression both in a context where endogenous levels of the hormone are sinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and from the addition of increased amounts of the hormone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is relevant mechanistic insight, as it provides a plausible mechanism for how the target cells are able to interpret a graded regulation of the hormone into a sharp biological response, as it is required for an all-or-nothing mode of reproduction.</p><p>2) Regulation of methylfarnesoate (“how the molecule […] is regulated”).</p><p>The regulation of methylfarnesaoate is one of the criteria that we explicitly address in the manuscript. We developed and validated a sensitive quantitative mass spectrometry assay exactly for this purpose, and assessed regulation of methylfarnesoate in the relevant period of development (see subsection “MF concentration drops in the course of maturation”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and corresponding supplements). In the revised version of the manuscript, this point is also explicitly covered in our discussion on the mechanistic insight provided by the manuscript (see above; Discussion, second paragraph), and the respective conceptual outlook (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper 'Discovery of methylfarnesoate as the annelid brain hormone reveals an ancient role of sesquiterpenoids in reproduction' is an intriguing read. The fact that a sesquiterpenoid can be part of the long sought for nereidin is a significant finding and would be of crucial importance to reinvestigate the effects of commonly used JH analogues as insecticides. The authors have evidently spent a great amount of time in setting up successful assays. Having said this, I have some major reservations about the methods and the conclusions before I am completely convinced.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the careful review by this reviewer, and thank the reviewer for pointing out the significance of our discovery for invertebrate biology. We are confident that by addressing all of the raised questions (see below) and by adding the additional dataset on pyriproxyfen, we provide convincing support for all of our findings.</p><p><italic>1) Please adhere to the MIQE standards for publishing q-RT-PCR results. I am missing qPCR primer efficiencies, the Methods section does not tell me which controls were used -RT, NTC, the PCR cycle, there is no mention of a DNAse treatment, amount of technical replicates, does not mention how the stability of the chosen reference genes was tested, were these selected from a whole suite of reference genes, as is required for certain algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder…), if there is a transcriptome available, this should not involve that much extra work, does state that in case only one stable reference gene was used in some cases, MIQE standards require you to use at least two. Since most conclusions are based on the q-RT-PCR results, it is vital this is performed correctly. As the manuscript is written now, there is no way of knowing.</italic> </p><p>1.1) Concerning the request to provide clearer technical details, these are now mentioned / expressed more clearly in the Methods section, (subsection “qRT-PCR analyses”, as well as in the applicable legends. In particular:</p><p>a) qPCR primer efficiencies are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> (respective calculations described in the aforementioned subsection, first paragraph);</p><p>b) qPCR cycles are described in the fourth paragraph;</p><p>c) qPCR controls are specified in lines the last two paragraphs;</p><p>d) DNAse treatments and reaction conditions are described in the second paragraph;</p><p>e) The details on technical replicates and further reaction details have been added to the Methods section as well (second and third paragraphs).</p><p>Concerning the use of reference genes, we revised the manuscript in the following way:</p><p>1.2) Choice of reference genes and overall quantification standards.</p><p>The Methods section now clearly outlines the criteria by which reference genes were chosen, and the fact that expression levels were generally controlled by the use of two reference genes, as requested by the reviewer (subsection “qRT-PCR analyses”, last two paragraphs).</p><p>The only exception to this two-reference-gene-rule, also addressed in the revised paper (subsection “qRT-PCR analyses”, fourth paragraph), were the qPCRs performed on coelomocytes in the context of the large biochemical fractionation assay. Here, only limited material was available for each fraction, which is why only a single, previously benchmarked reference gene (rps9, references: see below) was used for quantification. Additional data – supplied as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> (see below) demonstrate the stability of rps9 in these assays.</p><p>Performing these experiments on an even larger scale would not only require a large investment of time and reagents, but also require sacrificing hundreds of animals, in order to obtain suitable amounts of coelomocytes and brain hormone extracts. We do not consider this investment appropriate, especially as the qPCRs in this context did not primarily serve to make quantitative statements, but rather to determine active fractions (in a binary fashion), whereas the identified substance was then later validated in numerous separate, and well-controlled assays. In keeping with this argument, we have systematically avoided any quantitative statement from the respective section, and more precisely describe the “recovery” of bioactivity in the active fractions (subsection “Methylfarnesoate is the active component of the brain hormone and acts at physiological concentrations”).</p><p>1.3) Suitability of reference genes.</p><p>In the respective methods section (subsection “qRT-PCR analyses”, last two paragraphs), we explicitly refer the reader to previous publications in which two of these reference genes (rps9 and cdc5) have already been validated for their suitability in <italic>Platynereis</italic> qPCR assays (see e.g. Dray et al. (2010) Science 329(5989), 339–342; Zantke et al. (2013). Cell Reports, 5(1), 99–113; Tosches et al. (2014) Cell, 159(1), 46–57). In further support of the suitability of these genes, we also included a graph that shows consistent quantification of <italic>vtg</italic> against either of these two genes in our own assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In the revised version, we also include a similar, separate quantification for the cases where we used one of the additional reference genes <italic>S-adenosylmethionine synthase (sams)</italic> and <italic>cation-idependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (cim6pr)</italic>. In either case – presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, respectively – the statements on significant gene regulation are fully supported by either evaluation, and the respective summary graphs are presented in the main figures. This is strong support for the suitability of these genes for the conclusions drawn from these assays.</p><p>Finally, as outlined above, the qPCRs performed on coelomocytes in the context of the large biochemical fractionation assay were only normalised against the single reference gene rps9. In this context, we assessed the stability of rps9 in cell culture by plotting the normalised Ct-values for each experimental series, demonstrating that – as expected from the published accounts – there is a high stability of these values (SD of 3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Together, these clarifications and additional data all support the robustness of the performed qPCR assays, and also the validity of all relevant conclusions that we drew from these experiments.</p><p><italic>2) Some of the effects seem to be rather weak if the conclusion of the manuscript is to be that decreasing levels of MF are crucial for reproduction. Can the authors explain why a one-tailed t-test is performed?</italic> </p><p>2.1) For testing for the ability of fractions to act as nereidin / brain hormone, we generally only performed one-sided t-tests, as brain hormone activity is defined as inhibiting maturation, and this is the hypothesis tested in the experiments. As we discover MF in the most active brain hormone fraction and then show that application of authentic MF lowers <italic>vtg</italic>-transcript abundance in separate, well-controlled analyses, we believe that a one-sided t-test is appropriate for the comparisons performed at this stage.</p><p><italic>Since MF is actually crucial for vitellogenesis in insect with ancestral characteristics, I don't think the hypothesis can automatically be that MF will reduce Vg mRNA levels…</italic> </p><p>2.2) As to the comparison of our discoveries with insect data – and the question if these have predictive power – please see our common response below (point 4).</p><p><italic>For several of the experiments, the two-sided t-test does not show significant effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Can the authors explain why ANOVA was performed followed by one-sided t-tests? This seems a little unconventional to me.</italic> </p><p>2.3) We appreciate the effort of the reviewer to recalculate our statistics. As we stated in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Data analysis and statistics”), however, we performed Welch`s t-test, which is a t-test that does not assume equal variances (homoscedasticity) as does Student`s t-test; Welch`s t-test is therefore not prone to heteroscedasticity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test</ext-link>). This makes Welch`s t-test better suited for unequal sample sizes (as they occur in our analyses) than Student`s t-test. Using Welch`s t-test yields significance in a two-sided test for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, only a one-sided t-test is performed, as we again are only interested in the inhibitory properties of MF and the comparison to PA and RA. However, the values obtained by R using a pairwise t-test are corrected for multiple testing, for all six combinations, out of which only the three referring to the control (control vs. MF, control vs. PA and control vs. RA) are relevant for our statement. If we perform multiple testing for only these three combinations, the p-values in a two sided t-test would be:</p><p>control vs. MF: 0.0419</p><p>control vs. PA: 0.3608</p><p>control vs. RA: 0.1907</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the reviewer is indeed correct in that a two sided t-test would be appropriate, and that the current data do not show statistical significance in such a test. In order to test our statement more rigorously, we now included more replicates in the data. In the revised analysis, we do reach statistical significance with a two-sided t-test (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and the corresponding source data). We additionally also corrected the statistical test from a one-sided t-test to a two-sided t-test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>, where this test is also mandatory.</p><p>2.4) As to the last argument, the reviewer is right that first performing an ANOVA and then t-test seems unconventional. However, this does not affect the statistical statement. The reason why we did this is as follows. The classical approach for testing for group differences in more than one comparison is a one-way ANOVA. However, this only indicates that there are statistical differences (if any) between any of the groups tested. To resolve in which of the groups show statistical differences, to do this, classically a <italic>post-hoc</italic> test, in our case the pairwise t-test with correction for multiple testing, is performed.</p><p><italic>3) Weird that when I blast the Lottia Met ortholog in GenBank with insects as a parameter for organism search set, I only retrieve 'Circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput' as hits. If this is a true ortholog of Met, I would expect upon re-blast to at least get Met hits? Also the Platynereis sequence accession number is not available, so I have no way of knowing if this sequence, which apparently clearly is related to the Lottia clock, is a true Met.</italic></p><p>3.1) As to the accession numbers for <italic>Platynereis</italic> sequences, these were already included in the first version of the manuscript (see legend <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> / Methods section “gene identification and confirmation”). But following standard procedures, these sequences are not openly accessible until the publication has gone into print. In order to allow the reviewer to validate the analysis, we refer the reviewer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>.aln that contains the full alignment file for the phylogenetic tree of all displayed Met and Clock homologs.</p><p>3.2) As to the argument that blast may yield a different “closest” gene than the tree, this phenomenon is well known in molecular phylogeny, as the blast algorithm scores local similarities, whereas phylogeny is the dedicated method to assess the most likely evolutionary scenario. Depending on selection pressure, proteins or whole protein families evolve with different evolutionary speed, which is typically reflected by differences in branch length in the molecular phylogenetic analysis. As the reviewer will appreciate, both our original and our revised tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) shows much shorter branch lengths for Clock proteins, and longer ones for the Met group. Hence, a simple similarity search with a lophotrochozoan Met orthologue may indeed pick up an insect Clock protein (rather than an insect Met protein) as a first annotated hit, because the absolute distance (i.e sequence variation) appears shorter to Clock.</p><p>Please note that this situation will obviously change with the discovery – and proper annotation – of <italic>Platynereis</italic> Met and other lophotrochozoan Met orthologs, such as the <italic>Lymnaea</italic> candidate that we have added to the revised tree.</p><p><italic>4) I find the relative expression level changes in Met when administering MF unexpected since to my knowledge there is little dynamic range in Met expression levels in Arthropods, in these animals, downstream genes, like Kr-h1 are way more affected by changing JH levels, this could be discussed more.</italic> </p><p>4) Here and in other sections (point 2: expectation for an inhibition of vitellogenesis; point 5 below), the reviewer correctly points out differences between the worms and several insect models.</p><p>While we appreciate the interest of these differences for discussion (and have improved these aspects accordingly – see below), we would like to emphasize clearly that this study did not start with a candidate approach, looking for the presence and activity of insect-type juvenile hormones in a lophotrochozoan model. Rather, we uncovered the identity of a long-sought hormone in a lophotrochozoan reference species, in which sesquiterpenoids are commonly thought not to be present, and then characterized this candidate and its effects further. Assuming that the split between ecdysozoans (the early arthropod ancestors) and lophotrochozoans occurred some 500 million years ago, the overall separation between insects and annelids is around a billion years. On the one hand, this makes the discovery of sesquiterpenoids in annelids such a relevant finding, but on the other hand, this clearly also has left ample time for modification of the ancient system in either lineage.</p><p>As a consequence of these facts, we do not see that our analysis should in any way be logically guided by the assumption that the role of the identified hormone should by default be equivalent to the role of sesquiterpenoids in insects or other arthropods, and we apologize should the previous version of the manuscript have lent support to that impression. Likewise, we believe that differences between the particular effects of sesquiterpenoids in either branch are perfectly possible, if not expected, and that studying these differences – and reconstruction commonalities as well as divergences – is an interesting task for future analyses, for which our study just paves the way.</p><p>To clarify these points better, our revised Discussion now explicitely refers to insects at three sections:</p><p>a) We explicitly mention that both similarities and differences exist in the role of sesquiterpenoid hormones between these systems when first discussing the function vitellogenesis (third paragraph);</p><p>b) In the fifth paragraph, we refer to the inferred ancestry of sesquiterpenoid (and steroid hormone) systems in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids;</p><p>c) In the sixth and seventh paragraphs, we highlight both similarities and differences between the systems in our discussion on the possible ancient function of the sesquiterpenoid system.</p><p><italic>5) Differences in in vitro and in vivo effects between administration of methoprene is also surprising. Methoprene should be more stable, a bigger effect could be expected. Was the actual JHIII tested? This could be relevant to claiming bio-availability issues.</italic> </p><p>5) We thank the reviewer for pointing out these aspects. As to the role of insect juvenile hormones (like JHIII), for the reason just outlined, we consider this test less relevant for the main discovery that we report, but rather relevant for more detailed studies on the degree of divergence of the sesquiterpenoid system – in both arthropods and annelids – from their common ancestor. As a technical side note, we have not been able to obtain pure preparations of distinct insect juvenile hormones to be able to test this in our bioassay. We have, however, introduced a clarifying statement on cross-reactivities in the section where we discuss classical reports on the bioactivity of annelid extracts in insect juvenile hormone bioassays (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p>Concerning the expectancy for the effects of methoprene – or JHIII – on whole worms, one factor that may be relevant is the efficiency by which these substances can diffuse into / are taken up by the animals. There is a variety of sesquiterpenoid-based insect growth regulators with different chemical side groups, and we note that MF is more lipophilic than methoprene, which may explain why methoprene has more subtle effects at the tested conditions. However, we also note that there are additonal parameters (time, temperature, light regimes) that may play into the availability and efficacy of these drugs.</p><p>As we are unable to provide a full series of conditions, we decided that for the revised version, we would leave out more extensive speculations about the bioavailability, and rather focus on the immediate effects we observed in the bioassay. Moreover, we included the dataset on pyriproxyfen, which is a chemically distinct, but highly used insecticide, and shows clear activity in the bioassay as well. This finding further substantiates similarities between the signalling pathways in insects and annelids, and also supports the relevance of our evolutionary discovery for the specificity of pest control mechanisms.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: I'm missing the non-decapitated animals as a control here.</italic> </p><p>As the text details, the maturation is synchronized by decapitation, which is why non-decapitated animals would not be suitable as controls (subsection “Methylfarnesoate exerts a dominant repressive effect on vitellogenesis in vivo, and worms are susceptible to insecticides targeting the pathway”, second paragraph). However, we revised this section and the corresponding legend to point out more clearly that the control animals were also appropriately treated with DMSO.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Can a methoprene and JH treatment be included in the data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. I'm missing this as somewhat of a positive control.</italic> </p><p>7.1) For the reasons outlined under point (4), the effect of insect Juvenile hormones like JHIII refers to the sepcific question to which extent sesquiterpenoid hormone ligands have exchangeable functions between these two – evolutionarily distant – clades.</p><p>For the given reasons (scope of this study, logical flow of the arguments, inavailability of pure fractions of JHIII), we can at present not include the dataset the reviewer suggests, but also do not think that it will be relevant for supporting the main findings of our study.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: Is the 0.1 nM treatment really necessary for the statement you want to make? Some values are higher than the control. If yes, maybe it would be advisable to get more resolution in this range.</italic></p><p>7.2) This test provided first evidence that MF acts at levels that are considered physiological for a hormone (1-100nM); they also match with the levels that were later determined to be present in the head. In that sense, to discover that the lower bound of significant effects is at around 1nM is neither unexpected nor contradictory, nor does it, in our eyes, require a deeper analysis in that range.</p><p>We understand that the reviewer may take the enlarged spread of data in this panel (in the positive range) as supportive evidence that low levels of sesquiterpenoids may be involved in positive regulation of vitellogenesis (see point 2.2 above). While we cannot exclude this, the current data do not provide statistically robust evidence for this.</p><p>As a result, we propose to leave the figure panel as is, but we more explicitly discuss the possibility of low-level-requirements of MF for vitellogenesis in the revised Discussion section (third and seventh paragraphs).</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Can you please state whether non-treated actually means treated with 0.01% DMSO?
