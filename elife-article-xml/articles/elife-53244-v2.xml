antitumor effects in cancer patients. Previous human T cell research has largely focused on the few HLA alleles prevalent in a subset of ethnic groups. Here, using a panel of newly developed peptide-exchangeable peptide/HLA multimers and artificial antigen-presenting cells for 25 different class I alleles and greater than 800 peptides, we systematically and comprehensively mapped shared antigenic epitopes recognized by tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) from eight melanoma patients for all their class I alleles. We were able to determine the specificity, on average, of 12.2% of the TILs recognizing a mean of 3.1 shared antigen-derived epitopes across HLA-A, B, and C. Furthermore, we isolated a number of cognate T cell receptor genes with tumor reactivity. Our novel strategy allows for a more complete examination of the immune response and development of novel cancer immunotherapy not limited by HLA allele prevalence or tumor mutation burden.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system is the body’s way of defending itself, offering protection against diseases such as cancer. But to remove the cancer cells, the immune system must be able to identify them as different from the rest of the body. All cells break down proteins into shorter fragments, known as peptides, that are displayed on the cell surface by a protein called human leukocyte antigen, HLA for short. Cancer cells display distinctive peptides on their surface as they generate different proteins to those of healthy cells. Immune cells called T cells use these abnormal peptides to identify the cancer so that it can be destroyed.</p><p>Sometimes T cells can lack the right equipment to detect abnormal peptides, allowing cancer cells to hide from the immune system. However, T cells can be trained through a treatment called immunotherapy, which provides T cells with new tools so that they can spot the peptides displayed by HLA on the previously ‘hidden’ cancer cells.</p><p>There are many different forms of HLA, each of which can display different peptides. Current research in immunotherapy commonly targets only a subset of HLA forms, and not all cancer patients have these types. This means that immunotherapy research is only likely to be of most benefit to a limited number of patients. Immunotherapy could be made effective for more people if new cancer peptides that are displayed by the other ‘under-represented’ forms of HLA were identified.</p><p>Murata, Nakatsugawa et al. have now used T cells that were taken from tumors in eight patients with melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer. A library of fluorescent HLA-peptides was generated – using a new, simplified methodology – with 25 forms of HLA that displayed over 800 peptides. T cells were then mixed with the library to identify which HLA-peptides they can target. As a result, Murata, Nakatsugawa et al. found the cancer targets of around 12% of the tumor-infiltrating T cells tested, including those from under-represented forms of HLA. Consequently, these findings could be used to develop new immunotherapies that can treat more patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptide/HLA

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that is designed to harness the power of the body's immune system to fight cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finn, 2018a</xref>). The magnitude and breadth of T cell responses can serve as a critical biomarker in cancer immunotherapy and conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>). Immunotherapy is now widely considered a game-changer, as it is rapidly becoming the 4th pillar of cancer treatment, following surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.</p><p>The adoptive transfer of antitumor T cells can induce clinical responses in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feldman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karpanen and Olweus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rapoport et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robbins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sahin and Türeci, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2017</xref>). However, comprehensive analysis of the specificity of antitumor T cell responses against mutated or non-mutated tumor antigens is lacking. This deficit is exacerbated by the fact that non-mutated antigens are greater in number than mutated antigens by multiple orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finn and Rammensee, 2018</xref>) and the high polymorphism of HLA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). The clinical importance of identifying antitumor T cell responses is highlighted by the results of recent clinical trials which attest that a shared antigen, such as NY-ESO-1, can be targeted with potent on-target efficacy and minimal off-target toxicity in T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rapoport et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robbins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike shared antigens, the vast majority of neoantigens are unique to each patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finn, 2018b</xref>). The elucidation of T cell epitopes derived from shared antigens may facilitate the robust development of an efficacious and safe adoptive T cell therapy that is readily available to a larger cohort of cancer patients.</p><p>Analysis of antigen-specific T cells using peptide/HLA (pHLA) multimers has been utilized as a standard technique in immunology over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzen and Hadrup, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolton et al., 2015</xref>). Recent progress in multimer technology has enabled the high-throughput analysis of antigen-specific T cells during immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzen and Hadrup, 2017</xref>). However, the production of each multimer is still cumbersome and expensive because in vitro peptide exchange of generated complete pHLA proteins requires multiple complicated steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toebes et al., 2006</xref>) and some class I alleles are not easily produced in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Migueles et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, further advancements in multimer technology are needed to investigate the multitude of potential tumor-associated antigen (TAA) peptides presented by any given class I allele.</p><p>The combination of pHLA multimer-based analysis and functional assays are utilized to measure antigen-specific T cell responses. We have developed a novel peptide-exchangeable pHLA class I multimer technology that can be applied for any given class I allele and bound peptide. Unlike comparable methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Migueles et al., 2000</xref>), our novel pHLA multimer technology enables a one-step peptide exchange in one tube and is more effective in class I alleles that are difficult to produce in bacteria. These technical advantages allow for a rapid, versatile, and less labor-intensive examination of the immune response. In addition, to functionally detect HLA-restricted antigen-specific T cell responses, we previously demonstrated the versatility of gene-engineered artificial antigen-presenting cells (APCs) individually expressing various class I alleles as a single HLA allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler and Hirano, 2014</xref>). Our strategy using a paired library of the novel pHLA multimer and human cell-based artificial APC system enables identification of novel class I epitopes and detection of cognate T cells in a comprehensive and systematic way.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-throughput staining of polyclonally expanded TILs with a panel of pHLA multimers</title><p>The adoptive transfer of TILs can induce sustained antitumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma in combination with lymphodepletion and IL-2 administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang and Rosenberg, 2016</xref>). It is well established that melanoma TILs contain antitumor T cells that are specific for both non-mutated and mutated antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duhen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Here, TILs were isolated from eight metastatic melanoma patients, polyclonally expanded in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>), and then examined for their shared antigen specificities recognizing epitopes in the context of all 25 different class I alleles present. The combination of structure-based analysis using pHLA multimers and functional analysis has been widely used to measure antigen-specific T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzen and Hadrup, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Newell et al., 2013</xref>). We initially stained the T cells using our novel peptide-exchangeable pHLA multimers with bound peptides that were previously known or predicted by publicly available algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreatta and Nielsen, 2016</xref>). The previously known peptides were chosen from the Cancer Antigenic Peptide Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://caped.icp.ucl.ac.be">https://caped.icp.ucl.ac.be</ext-link>) for all the class I alleles of eight melanoma patients, and we also synthesized several high-affinity binding peptides derived from TAAs based on prediction algorithms for the class I alleles that were positive in multiple patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To identify new epitope peptides, we conducted functional assays using artificial APCs, which can take up and process longer peptides and present epitope peptides via class I molecules, as stimulator cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler and Hirano, 2014</xref>). The class I-matched artificial APCs were pulsed with overlapping peptides (20-mers with an overlap of 15 amino acids) to cover the whole proteins of six shared antigens (MART1, NY-ESO-1, SSX2, gp100, MAGE-A1, and survivin) that are frequently expressed by melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finn, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and used as stimulators in cytokine ELISPOT assays.</p><p>When stimulated with B*18:01-artificial APCs pulsed with MART1-derived overlapping peptides, B*18:01<sup>+</sup> M87 TILs showed positive responses to two adjacent peptides with the shared sequence <sub>21</sub>YTTAEEAAGIGILTV<sub>35</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). Using a series of deletion mutant peptides, we determined the minimally required epitope peptide, <sub>25</sub>EEAAGIGIL<sub>33</sub> presented by B*18:01 molecules. Notably, this epitope partially overlaps with but is distinct from one of the most immunogenic epitopes, A*02:01/MART1<sub>27-35</sub>, suggesting that this region of the MART1 protein is an immunological hotspot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawakami et al., 1994</xref>). Importantly, the B*18:01/MART1<sub>25-33</sub> multimer successfully stained up to 9.2% of the polyclonally expanded M87 TILs, suggesting that the B*18:01/MART1<sub>25-33</sub> T cells were a dominant population of TILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

Additionally, following peptide-specific stimulation with B*40:01-artificial APCs pulsed with NY-ESO-1-derived overlapping peptides, a novel B*40:01-restricted NY-ESO-1 epitope, <sub>125</sub>EFTVSGNIL<sub>133</sub>, was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>).

Although we performed similar experiments using overlapping peptides for SSX2, MAGE-A1, and survivin, no T cell response was observed. It should be noted that in this study, we did not investigate the expression of shared antigens in the patient’s own tumor tissues. Therefore, it is possible that the absence of a T cell response toward some shared antigens is due to the lack of their expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>T cell epitope determination following stimulation with artificial APCs pulsed with overlapping peptides.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Identification of a new epitope B*18:01/MART1<sub>25-33</sub> in polyclonally expanded M87 TILs.

For the majority of tumor reactivities that we identified, multimer-positive antitumor T cells were collected and their TCR genes were molecularly cloned. All the HLA-B- and HLA-C-restricted T cell populations contained one pair of TCR genes each. These results suggested that all the HLA-B- and HLA-C-restricted antigen-specific T cells found in this study were monoclonal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The antigen specificity and functional reactivity of the cloned TCRs were verified by multimer staining and ELISPOT assays of TCR-reconstituted T cells. For example, when reconstituted on primary T cells, B*18:01/MART1<sub>25-33</sub> TCR-transduced T cells were successfully stained with the cognate multimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and strongly reacted with the MART1<sub>25-33</sub> peptide presented by surface B*18:01 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Although both the Malme-3M and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell lines are negative for B*18:01, they express the MART1 gene endogenously. When B*18:01 molecules were ectopically expressed, both melanoma cell lines were successfully recognized by B*18:01/MART1<sub>25-33</sub> TCR-transduced T cells.

Since the HLA gene is the most polymorphic gene in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shao et al., 2018</xref>), previous human T cell research has largely been limited to the few HLA alleles that are prevalent in a subset of ethnic groups. Therefore, a precise and comprehensive understanding of the antigen specificity for antitumor T cell responses remains lacking, including against non-mutated tumor antigens and infrequent HLA alleles. The sheer number of potential non-mutated antigens and the high polymorphism of HLA genes may have hampered comprehensive analysis of the specificity of antitumor T cell responses.</p><p>The adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive T cells, such as TILs or T cells transduced with high-affinity TCR genes, can induce sustained tumor regression in some cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feldman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rapoport et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robbins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, using a library of the paired pHLA multimers and artificial APCs for 25 different class I alleles and greater than 800 peptides, we systematically and comprehensively mapped shared antigenic epitopes recognized by TILs from eight melanoma patients for all their class I alleles. Furthermore, we isolated multiple TCR genes highly tumor-reactive to shared antigens from the TILs. In particular, NY-ESO-1 is one of the shared antigens that have been most promising and extensively studied, and many clinical trials using A*02:01/NY-ESO-1<sub>157-165</sub> TCR genes are ongoing. The use of these newly cloned tumor-reactive B*07:02, B*40:01, and C*03:04-restricted NY-ESO-1 TCR genes may widen the applicability of anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR gene therapy and immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTAC) therapy beyond HLA-A*02:01-positive cancer patients. ImmTAC therapy trials targeting A*02:01/gp100 are also ongoing in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liddy et al., 2012</xref>). The newly cloned tumor-reactive gp100 TCRs restricted by four different class I alleles (A*24:02, B*40:01, C*06:02, and C*07:01) could substantially extend the applicability of ImmTAC therapy targeting gp100.</p><p>The strategy employed in this study has enabled us to decipher the antigen specificity of tumor-specific T cells for any given HLA class I allele, regardless of allele frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), and for a very large number of peptides. Although we studied T cell responses to greater than 800 peptides derived from more than 90 proteins across all the 25 class I alleles expressed by eight melanoma patients, our study is still limited. Additional comprehensive studies are required to elucidate the full spectrum of antitumor T cell response in TILs. Since in vitro expanded TILs were studied in the current study, further assessment of TIL directly ex vivo is needed in future studies. Our strategy has also allowed us to build a large database of class I-restricted peptides and cognate tumor-reactive TCR genes at an unprecedented scale. This database will facilitate individual examination of the personal immune response with precision as well as the identification and validation of biomarkers to aid in patient-based selection of a cancer immunotherapy regimen. Furthermore, this database will help the robust development of novel cancer vaccines, TCR gene therapies, and ImmTAC therapies for patients without being limited by HLA allele prevalence or tumor mutation burden.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">K562</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0004">CVCL_0004</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">T2</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2211">CVCL_2211</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A375</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0132">CVCL_0132</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Malme-3M</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1438">CVCL_1438</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SK-MEL-28</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0526">CVCL_0526</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LM-MEL-53</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_UC56">CVCL_UC56</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRIID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCF7</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_UC56">CVCL_UC56</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ACHN</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1067">CVCL_1067</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SK-MEL-21</td><td valign="top">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_3877">CVCL_3877</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SK-MEL-37</td><td valign="top">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_3878">CVCL_3878</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Me275</td><td valign="top">Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_S597">CVCL_S597</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Jurkat 76</td><td valign="top">Leiden University Medical Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heemskerk et al.

Next, the cells were washed three times and costained with an anti-CD8 mAb for 15 min at 4°C. Dead cells were finally discriminated using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit. For multiplex staining, after incubation with PE-conjugated multimer, the cells were washed three times and then incubated with 5–10 μg/ml of APC-conjugated multimer for 30 min at room temperature followed by costaining with an anti-CD8 mAb. The stability and multiplexing ability of the reagents were confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Landscape mapping of shared antigenic epitopes and their cognate TCRs of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes in melanoma&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ravi Sachidanandam (Reviewer #1); Kunle Odunsi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Murata, Nakatsugawa et al., describes extensive testing of melanoma infiltrating T-cell reactivity against a large panel of shared tumor antigen-derived epitopes to comprehensively analyze tumor antigen-specific T-cell response in the tumor microenvironment. More than 800 synthetic peptides that were previously reported or expected to bind on 25 different HLA types were tested. To enable cost- and labor-effective testing, the group developed a novel peptide-exchangeable pHLA class I multimer technology. Low-frequency responses by multimer-staining were validated by additional experiments such as IFN-γ ELISPOT assays and peptide-specific T-cell expansion using their unique artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs). Finally, the group cloned T-cell receptor (TCR) genes from multimer-reactive T cells and demonstrated tumor-recognition by TCR gene-engineered T cells. The strategy can be useful in the development of personalized cancer vaccines or adoptive T-cell therapy using TCR gene-engineered T cells. This is a very intensive and meticulous effort in understanding T-cell reactivity in the tumor microenvironment, and the authors are to be commended for their approach.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 1 which shows the results from a screening experiment – in total this figure shows 200 FACS plots. The presentation of the data needs to be reconsidered to emphasize the key conclusions.</p><p>Sequencing the TCR repertoires to determine the actual clonality would have been very useful. But it does not seem to have been successful in most cases. Was it because the expanded clones were still polyclonal? A related question, how often are they polyclonal? This could be an interesting question to address.</p><p>What about the obvious control, the circulating T cells from the patients, to see if they have a different characteristic from the TIL?</p><p>One of the major strengths of the study is the development of a unique peptide-exchangeable pHLA class I multimers. However, characterization and validation of these critical reagents were not sufficiently provided. At least the following points should be discussed: (i) efficiency of peptide-exchange reaction (% of monomers complexed with synthetic peptides) and a possibility that some of the tested epitopes may not be incorporated; (ii) stability of the reagents after loading with synthetic peptides and after multimerized with anti-His tag antibodies; and (iii) multiplexing ability, testing multiple epitopes using different fluorochromes in a single tube. Similarly, it will be important to discuss the possibility that the absence of T-cell response against the some tumor antigens is due to lack of expression of the antigens.</p><p>It is important to show tetramer-staining results for samples that are not considered to contain tumor antigen-specific T cells, for example, peripheral T cells from healthy donors. If low-frequency responses are detected in these negative control samples, further testing using aAPCs could be considered.</p><p>For experiments using overlapping peptides to identify novel epitopes in Figure 4, only successful results for MART-1, NY-ESO-1, and gp100 were described. If available, results for other antigens (SSX2, MAGE-A1, and survivin) are also important to report, even with the negative results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Landscape mapping of shared antigenic epitopes and their cognate TCRs of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes in melanoma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jeffrey Settleman (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer No. 1 requests some textual changes and explanations that should be provided (points 1, 3, 4). The concern No. 1 by reviewer No. 2 should be commented on in the text, by discussing the limitation of the study with respect to the number of melanoma antigens explored in the work.</p><p>For your information, here are the reviewers' comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors seem to have addressed many/most of the concerns from the previous reviews. I like the technology and feel like it will be useful, not sure how much the patent etc. is going to hinder its use elsewhere, but maybe the data can form a reference that others can check against.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the abstract I am still uncomfortable with this statement &quot;We were able to determine the specificity of 12.2 {plus minus} 7.3% (mean {plus minus} SD, max 25.9%, min 4.6%) of TILs recognizing 3.1 {plus minus} 2.0 (mean {plus minus} SD, max 7, min 1) previously known and novel epitopes across HLA-A, B, and C&quot;.</p><p>I think wording it like this</p><p>&quot;On average we identified specificity of 12% of the TILs, and each TIL on average recognized 3 epitopes across various HLA-A, B and C alleles&quot;makes the meaning clearer (and the uncertainty etc. can be given in the text) ?</p><p>2) The authors indicate they do not have PBMCs for the patients to check the &quot;background&quot; T cell population and how much is shared with the TILs. This seems like something that should not have happened? If so, much effort is being put into developing this technology and testing it, why handicap oneself at the start by going with samples that don't have the corresponding PBMCs? I am worried that this is an excuse to avoid addressing the question or not revealing &quot;adverse&quot; findings.</p><p>3) The term &quot;exponential examination&quot; of the immune response (line 76) might need to be explained. what aspect is exponential here?</p><p>4) The novelty of the technology: Introduction &quot;We have developed a novel peptide-exchangeable pHLA class I multimer technology that can be applied for any given class I allele. Compared with conventional methods (Andersen et al., 2012), our multimers enable an exponential examination of the immune response, and are more effective in class I alleles that are difficult to produce in bacteria (Migueles et al., 2000)&quot;.</p><p>It was still not clear to me the exact novelty in the method. maybe a line or two could be added to explain the exact novelty and how it differs from other comparable technologies. Sorry for being difficult here, but I cannot still explain what is the novelty to myself after reading these lines (in addition to not knowing what the term &quot;exponential examination&quot; means).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have chosen an unusual approach to respond to the reviewers. Rather than going through each of the reviewer’s issues, they bundled them together and numbered them as comments 1-11.</p><p>Importantly, they chose to ignore all of my major points in this rebuttal. They only responded to one stylistic point (comment #1). All other points were ignored.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A significant limitation of this study is that the authors limited their effort to six previously defined shared melanoma antigens. Unfortunately, other types of antigens were not considered.</p><p>2) The authors also did not evaluate whether some of the T cells were neoantigen-specific, even though the tools were in hand. It would indeed be relevant to determine whether T cells specific for shared antigens or neoantigens are more common in TILs.</p><p>3) Overall, the scope of the paper is limited, given the primary focus of the study on the screening of TILs for their peptide specificity.</p><p>Overall, I believe that this paper is more suitable for a clinically oriented cancer immunology journal than <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed all my comments and concerns. This body of work is highly innovative and meritorious. It represents the most comprehensive testing of melanoma infiltrating T-cell reactivity against a large panel of shared tumor antigen-derived epitopes. The experimental approach and data interpretation are solid, and all appropriate controls were included or at least considered. The major conclusions are supported by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53244.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 which shows the results from a screening experiment – in total this figure shows 200 FACS plots.

We now show the data of high-throughput pHLA multimer staining for B*07:02<sup>+</sup> M68 TILs in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, while all the data of high-throughput staining for A*02:01<sup>+</sup> and C*05:01<sup>+</sup> M87 TILs and only the positive staining data for the other A*02:01<sup>+</sup> TILs, A*24:02<sup>+</sup> M37 TILs, and B*07:02<sup>+</sup> M68 TILs are shown in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sequencing the TCR repertoires to determine the actual clonality would have been very useful. But it does not seem to have been successful in most cases. Was it because the expanded clones were still polyclonal? A related question, how often are they polyclonal? This could be an interesting question to address.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the important comment. We molecularly cloned TCR genes from multimer-positive T cells via 5’-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. All the HLA-B and C-restricted T cell populations contained one pair of TCR genes each. These results suggested that all the HLA-B and C-restricted antigen-specific T cells found in this study were monoclonal (Table 1).</p><p>We performed high-throughput TCR repertoire analysis for A*02:01-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific to the A*02:01/MART1 (M25, M66, and M96), A*02:01/NY-ESO-1 (M31), A*02:01/SSX2 (M37 and M40), and A*02:01/gp100 (M66) multimers using CapTCR-seq (Mulder et al., Blood Adv. 2018). All their T cell populations contained polyclonal TCRα and TCRβ genes (data not shown).</p><p>Quite a few TCR genes recognizing A*02:01/MART1, NY-ESO-1, gp100, and tyrosinase have been cloned previously, and some of these TCRs have been tested in TCR gene therapy clinical trials (Feldman et al., 2015; Fesnak et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2006). Therefore, we did not isolate TCR genes from multimer-positive T cells specific to these antigens. A*02:01/ABCB5-specific TCR genes were molecularly cloned from M87 TILs. Since ABCB5 is expressed in various normal tissues (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000004846-ABCB5/tissue), TCR gene therapy targeting ABCB5 is very likely to cause undesired on-target off-tumor toxicity. Therefore, we did not study the tumor reactivity of the A*02:01/ABCB5 TCR.</p><p>Subsection “Primary T cells transduced with TIL-derived TCR genes recognize tumor cells”: “For the majority of tumor reactivities that we identified, multimer-positive antitumor T cells were collected, and their TCR genes were molecularly cloned.

We agree that the circulating T cells from the patients might have different characteristics from the TILs. Unfortunately, peripheral blood was not available from any of the patients, and we were not able to address the question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One of the major strengths of the study is the development of a unique peptide-exchangeable pHLA class I multimers. However, characterization and validation of these critical reagents were not sufficiently provided. At least the following points should be discussed: (i) efficiency of peptide-exchange reaction (% of monomers complexed with synthetic peptides) and a possibility that some of the tested epitopes may not be incorporated; (ii) stability of the reagents after loading with synthetic peptides and after multimerized with anti-His tag antibodies; and (iii) multiplexing ability, testing multiple epitopes using different fluorochromes in a single tube. Similarly, it will be important to discuss the possibility that the absence of T-cell response against the some tumor antigens is due to lack of expression of the antigens.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these important points. We have performed a number of experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the peptide-exchange reaction, stability, and multiplexing ability of the reagents.</p><p>(i) Efficiency of the peptide-exchange reaction in the monomers</p><p>We established a protocol to measure the efficiency of peptide exchange in soluble class I<sup>Q115E</sup>-K<sup>b</sup> monomers and evaluated the efficiency for A*02:01, B*07:02, and C*07:02 with class I-restricted peptides (Supplementary files 2, 4, and 8). As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the peptide exchange efficiencies in the A*02:01, B*07:02, and C*07:02 monomers were 62.0 ± 14.9% (mean ± SD), 94.2 ± 12.0%, and 80.5 ± 22.1%, respectively. All the peptides tested in this experiment were efficiently exchanged in our monomers, except for one peptide (No. 9 in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>We have added this information to the Materials and methods section, as shown below.</p><p>Subsection “Measurement of peptide exchange efficiency using ELISA”:</p><p>“The efficiency of peptide exchange in soluble class I<sup>Q115E</sup>-K<sup>b</sup> monomers was assessed using a competition binding assay and ELISA. The monomer was loaded with 100 μg/ml biotinylated peptide and incubated overnight at 37°C. Biotinylated peptide-monomer was purified and exchanged with PBS using Amicon Ultra filters (molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 10 kDa) (Millipore Σ, Burlington, MA) and mixed with 1 mg/ml HLA-restricted peptide of interest or an equivalent volume of DMSO followed by overnight incubation at 37°C. ELISA plates were coated with anti-pan class I mAb (clone W6/32) at 10 μg/mL in PBS overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed and blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. Peptide-monomer was added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, the plates were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase for 30 minutes at room temperature. Finally, the plates were washed and incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mol/L NaOH. The optic density (OD) (405 nm) was read (Spectramax 190 Microplate Reader; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The OD values from the control wells containing nonbiotinylated peptide were subtracted from the OD values in test wells containing biotinylated peptide. The efficiency of peptide exchange for each monomer was calculated as follows: Peptide exchange efficiency = [1 – (OD value with peptide/OD value with DMSO)] x 100. Every sample was assayed in triplicate wells. The biotinylated peptides used were HLA-A*02:01-restricted telomerase<sub>540-548</sub> ILAK(-biotin)FLHWL, B*07:02-restricted MiHAg SMCY<sub>1041-1051</sub>SPSVDK(-biotin)ARAEL, and C*07:02-restricted adenovirus B<sub>585-593</sub>FRK(-biotin)DVNMVL. The efficiencies of peptide exchange in the A*02:01, B*07:02, and C*07:02 monomers were shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.”</p><p>(ii) Stability of the reagents</p><p>We evaluated the stability of the reagents after peptide loading and multimerization. When the peptide-loaded monomers were multimerized with anti-His mAb at several time points, the ability of the A*02:01 and B*07:02 multimers to stain cognate T cells did not change for 5 days but decreased as time passed (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). On the other hand, the ability of the pHLA multimers to stain T cells did not change until day 11 after multimerization (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). These results suggested that the peptide-loaded class I monomer should be multimerized within 5 days and that the reagents after multimerization were stable for at least 10 days.</p><p>Subsection “Production of human cell-based pHLA multimers”: Soluble monomeric class I<sup>Q115E</sup>-K<sup>b</sup> loaded with the peptide were multimerized using an anti-His mAb (clone AD1.1.10; Abcam) conjugated to a fluorochrome such as phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC) at a 2:1 molar ratio for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.</p><p>(iii) Multiplexing ability of pHLA multimers</p><p>We first studied whether our pHLA complexes individually dimerized using anti-His mAb (clone AD1.1.10) conjugated with various fluorochromes (PE (Abcam), APC (Abcam), FITC (Abcam), PerCP (Abcam), Alexa Fluor 680 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Alexa Fluor 790 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PE-Cy7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)), can stain cognate T cells.
