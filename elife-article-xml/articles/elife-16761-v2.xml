thought to have arisen through the amplification of subdomain-sized peptides. Many of these originated in a non-repetitive context as cofactors of RNA-based replication and catalysis, and required the RNA to assume their active conformation. In search of the origins of one of the most widespread repeat protein families, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), we identified several potential homologs of its repeated helical hairpin in non-repetitive proteins, including the putatively ancient ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), which only becomes structured in the context of the ribosome. We evaluated the ability of the RPS20 hairpin to form a TPR fold by amplification and obtained structures identical to natural TPRs for variants with 2–5 point mutations per repeat. The mutations were neutral in the parent organism, suggesting that they could have been sampled in the course of evolution. TPRs could thus have plausibly arisen by amplification from an ancestral helical hairpin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16761.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16761.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All life is built upon the chemical activity of proteins. For this activity, proteins need to fold into specific 3D structures. Protein folding is complicated and easily disrupted, and its evolutionary origin remains poorly understood. A possibility is that folded proteins arose through different genetic processes from shorter pieces of protein called peptides, which participated in an ancient, primordial form of life. One of these processes involves the same peptide being repeated within one protein chain.</p><p>In 2015, researchers identified 40 primordial peptides whose sequences appear in seemingly unrelated proteins. The study suggested that repetition allows peptides that are unable to fold by themselves to yield folded proteins. Now, Zhu et al. – who are members of the same research group who performed the 2015 study – have explored experimentally whether one of these peptides could indeed yield a folded protein by repetition.</p><p>The studied primordial peptide gave rise to several protein folds seen today, including – by repetition – a type of fold called TPR. Zhu et al. tried to retrace the emergence of the TPR fold by taking a descendant of the primordial peptide from a ribosomal protein, which is unable to fold without the assistance of an RNA scaffold, and repeating it three times within the same protein chain. The ribosome is a central component of all living cells and evolves very slowly, and so the peptide Zhu et al. took from it is likely to retain many properties of its primordial ancestor.</p><p>Further experiments found that the repeated peptide was indeed able to fold into a TPR-like structure, but needed several mutations to do so. Introducing these mutations back into the ribosomal protein, however, did not affect the survival and growth of the cell. Thus, they could have occurred without adverse effects during evolution.</p><p>Structure is a prerequisite for chemical activity, but it is activity that is under selection in living beings. Having produced a new protein, Zhu et al. will now explore ways of endowing it with a selectable activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16761.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16761.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TPR</kwd><kwd>ancient peptides</kwd><kwd>ribosomal protein</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>amplification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Hongbo</given-names></name><name><surname>Sepulveda</surname><given-names>Edgardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Marcus D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kogenaru</surname><given-names>Manjunatha</given-names></name><name><surname>Ursinus</surname><given-names>Astrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Sulz</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Coles</surname><given-names>Murray</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name><name><surname>Lupas</surname><given-names>Andrei N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Minimal changes allow an ancestral, unfolded peptide to adopt a known fold by repetition, illuminating a possible path for the emergence of folded proteins at the origin of life.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most present-day proteins arose through the combinatorial shuffling and differentiation of a set of domain prototypes. In many cases, these prototypes can be traced back to the root of cellular life and have since acted as the primary unit of protein evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anantharaman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koonin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kyrpides et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Orengo and Thornton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ponting and Russell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ranea et al., 2006</xref>). The mechanisms by which they themselves arose are however still poorly understood. We have proposed that the first folded domains emerged through the repetition, fusion, recombination, and accretion of an ancestral set of peptides, which supported RNA-based replication and catalysis (the RNA world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernhardt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gilbert, 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Söding and Lupas, 2003</xref>). Repetition would have been a particularly prominent mechanism by which these peptides yielded folds; six of the ten most populated folds in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murzin et al., 1995</xref>) – including the five most frequent ones – have repetitive structures. In all cases, their amplification from subdomain-sized fragments can also be retraced at the sequence level in at least some of their members.</p><p>One of these highly populated repetitive folds is the αα-solenoid (SCOP a.118), whose most widespread superfamily is the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR; a.118.8). This was originally identified as a repeating 34 amino-acid motif in Cdc23p of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sikorski et al., 1990</xref>) – hence its name. Since then, TPR-containing proteins have been discovered in all kingdoms of life, where they mediate protein-protein interactions in a broad range of biological processes, such as cell cycle control, transcription, protein translocation, protein folding, signal transduction and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cortajarena and Regan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Katibah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keiski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kyrpides and Woese, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lamb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sikorski et al., 1990</xref>). The ﬁrst crystal structure of a TPR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Das et al., 1998</xref>) showed that the repeat units are helical hairpins, stacked into a continuous, right-handed superhelical architecture with an inner groove that mediates the interaction with target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Forrer et al., 2004</xref>). The hairpins interact via a specific geometry involving knobs-into-holes packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crick, 1953</xref>) and burying about 40% of their surface between repeat units. This tightly packed, superhelical arrangement of a repeating structural unit is typical of all αα-solenoid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Di Domenico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kajava, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kobe and Kajava, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of TPRs from a variety of proteins reveals a high degree of sequence diversity, with conservation observed mainly in the size of the repeating unit and the hydrophobicity of a few key residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Magliery and Regan, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, almost all known TPR-containing proteins can be detected using a single sequence proﬁle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karpenahalli et al., 2007</xref>), underscoring their homologous origin. As their name implies, TPR proteins generally contain at least two unit hairpins in a repeated fashion. The few that have only one hairpin, notably the mitochondrial import protein Tom20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2000</xref>), are clearly not ancestral based on their phylogenetic distribution and functionality, implying that the ancestor of the superfamily already had a repeated structure. In searching for the origin of TPRs, we hypothesized that the hairpin at the root of the fold might either have been part of a different, non-repetitive fold or have given rise to both repetitive and non-repetitive folds at the origin of folded domains. Either way we hoped that we might find α-hairpins in non-repetitive proteins that are similar in both sequence and structure to the TPR unit, suggesting a common origin. Here we show that such hairpins are detectable and that one of them, from the ribosomal protein RPS20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schluenzen et al., 2000</xref>), can be customized to yield a TPR fold by repetition, with only a small number of point mutations that are neutral for the parent organism. Ribosomal proteins most likely constitute some of the oldest proteins observable today and are still intimately involved in an RNA-driven process: translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fox, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>). They are mostly incapable of assuming their folds outside the ribosomal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) and thus belong to a class of intrinsically disordered proteins that become structured upon binding to a macromolecular scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Habchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Varadi et al., 2014</xref>). This hairpin therefore plausibly retains today many of the properties likely to have been present in the ancestral peptide that gave rise to the TPR fold.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recently amplified TPR arrays in present-day proteins</title><p>Repetitive folds with variable numbers of repeats, such as HEAT, LRR, TPR or β-propellers, usually have some members with a high level of sequence identity between their repeat units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>). In these proteins, the units are more similar to each other than to any other unit in the protein sequence database, showing that they were recently amplified. In a detailed study of β-propellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>), we found that this process of amplification and differentiation has been ongoing since the origin of the fold. TPR proteins show a similar evolutionary history. In some proteins, most of the repeats can be seen to have been amplified separately and to a different extent in each ortholog, pointing to their recent origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>); in others, the amplification must have occurred much earlier, as their ancestor already had fully differentiated repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In recently amplified proteins, such as the ones shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, within which repeats frequently have &gt;80% pairwise sequence identity, tracking the probable α-hairpin at the root of the amplification is a fairly straightforward proposition. We wondered, however, whether it might be possible to go much further back in time and track the original α-hairpin from which the first TPR protein was amplified. We therefore searched for TPR-like α-hairpins in non-repetitive proteins as present-day descendants of the original hairpin.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two evolutionary scenarios for TPRs, illustrated by neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amplification from single helical hairpin, as seen in TPR proteins from Cyanobacteria.

Since evolutionary reconstructions are subject to Occam’s razor and reflect the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions, we have postulated here one amplification event from one precursor hairpin. Our findings would however also be fully compatible with the precursor hairpin yielding a population of homologous variants, some of which were independently amplified to TPR-like folds; one or more survivors among these would have become the ancestor(s) of today’s TPR proteins. In this more complex scenario, the homology of TPR proteins, which we trace through the comparison of individual hairpins, is still given, but the TPR fold could have arisen from several independent amplifications, and not just a single one.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16761.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16761.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16761-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignments of recently amplified TPR repeat units.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Alignments of the TPR units used for the phylogeny in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.

Here, in a first step, we used TPRpred to scan protein sequences in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berman et al., 2000</xref>) for peptides that share statistically significant similarity to the TPR sequence profile and yet have not been annotated as TPR in Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Finn et al., 2014</xref>); we used a p-value cutoff = 1.0e−4, which leads to an estimated false discovery rate of 1.0%, see Materials and methods. We ignored tandem repeats in the hit list and focused only on the singleton cases. Subsequently, we compared the structures of these helical hairpin singletons to the average TPR hairpin and removed non-hairpin-like structures. This yielded 31 helical hairpins that are similar to the TPR unit with respect to both sequence and structure. Among them, 22 are part of solenoid-like structures and were discarded. The remaining nine hits belong to three families: (I) mitochondrial import receptor subunit Tom20; (II) microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain including katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Iwaya et al., 2010</xref>); and (III) 30S ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TPR-like hairpins found in non-repetitive proteins in the PDB.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure gallery of non-repetitive helical hairpins in the PDB that share both sequence and structure similarity to TPR unit hairpin.

To further explore the similarity between the helical hairpin in RPS20 (in short, RPS20-hh) and TPR, we used TPRpred to rank the RPS20 sequences in Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Finn et al., 2014</xref>). The top-scoring hit was RPS20-hh from <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> (NCBI accession number = WP_003044315.1, UniProt id = B7A5L8_THEAQ), which matches the TPR unit sequence proﬁle at a p-value of 5.4e−07, almost an order of magnitude better than the second hit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the surface residues of RPS20-hh fragments to assess their suitability to occur in a tandem repeat mode, as in TPRs. To this end, we first defined five interface positions on the TPR helical hairpin and transferred the definition to RPS20-hh according to their structure alignment (positions 3, 7, 10, 21 and 28 using TPR unit numbering). Then, we searched for RPS20-hhs with as many hydrophobic residues as possible at these interface positions. We found 42 RPS20-hhs that contain at least three hydrophobic residues out of the five interface positions. Among them, the only RPS20-hh predicted to match the TPR unit proﬁle above a p-value of 1.0e−4 was again the RPS20 from <italic>T. aquaticus</italic>, in which three of the ﬁve interface residues are hydrophobic (L10, I21 and V28). We therefore chose this helical hairpin (RPS20-hhta) to construct a TPR-like solenoid by amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The design of TPR using RPS20.</title><p>RPS20-hh is identified by TPRpred to match the sequence profile of TPR units.

We designed a TPR protein using a RPS20-hh with up to five mutations (yellow strips) in each repeat unit. The C-terminal loop in the TPR unit (dark magenta loop) is used to replace the corresponding C-terminus (light magenta cylinder) of RPS20-hh to connect adjacent repeats.

This so-called C-terminal 'stop helix' had been observed in all known TPR structures and was considered essential for the solubility of natural TPR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Das et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Main et al., 2003b</xref>). Most other designed TPRs employ purpose-designed stop helix sequences. Here, we chose to use the RPS20 C-terminal helix to become a natural stop helix, since it is already known to interact favorably with RPS20-hhta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Further, we inserted two residues (Asn-Ser) before the ﬁrst TPR unit as an N-terminal cap to the first helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aurora and Rose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kumar and Bansal, 1998</xref>), in analogy to a previously designed idealized TPR protein, CTPR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Main et al., 2003b</xref>).</p><p>To model the structure of the designed proteins in silico, we fused two structures to create a hybrid template: We used CTPR3 (PDB id: 1na0 chain A) as the structural template for the three RPS20-hhta fragments, and the best-resolved RPS20 structure (PDB id: 2vqe chain T; 2.5 Å) for helix B3 and the stop helix.

Three proteins (M0, M4RD and M5) could be purified from soluble extracts; the other constructs were insoluble and were refolded from inclusion bodies. In far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra, all proteins displayed a strong alpha-helical pattern, except M0 and M4RD, which appeared to be unfolded, but not prone to aggregation and precipitation, even at high concentrations. When we studied the melting curves, M4N showed cooperative unfolding with a T<sub>m</sub> of 77°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>), while the unfolding of M2, M4E and M5 did not conform to a classical two-state transition, consistent with an unstable molten globule-like state. On the other hand, non-cooperative unfolding processes have been demonstrated for perfectly stable TPR repeats and suggested to be common for various types of repeat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cortajarena and Regan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kajander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stumpp et al., 2003</xref>). To clarify this point, urea-induced unfolding transitions were monitored by CD. Like M4N, the three variants M2, M4E and M5 yielded typical cooperative denaturation curves, indicative of folded polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ∆G<sub>U-F</sub><sup>H2O</sup> values agree well with those reported for other designed TPRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Main et al., 2005</xref>). In line with these findings, M5, the only protein containing tryptophan residues, had a λ<sub>max</sub> of 336 nm in fluorescence emission spectra, as expected for partially shielded aromatic residues. We conclude that four of the five designed TPR variants, M2, M4E, M4N and M5, result in well-folded repeat proteins. To determine the oligomeric state of our folded proteins, we performed static light scattering experiments. Surprisingly, all four constructs were exclusively dimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the ribosomal parent protein RPS20. Within the ribosome, RPS20 is partially embedded in the 16S rRNA, making many nucleic acid contacts. Like many other ribosomal proteins, it is not expected to adopt a stable structure in isolation. Indeed, it has a biased amino acid composition and is predicted to be largely unstructured by many prediction programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1J</xref>). It had been shown previously that isolated RPS20 exhibits only one third helical content by CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Paterakis et al., 1983</xref>). For <italic>Thermus</italic> RPS20 specifically, simulations predict a flexible conformation in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burton et al., 2012</xref>). We cloned RPS20 from <italic>T. aquaticus</italic> and its close relative <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>. Upon expression, both proteins were insoluble and had to be refolded. In static light scattering measurements, both proteins behaved as monomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). Based on CD spectra, which showed a high proportion of random structure, and the absence of defined melting and urea-denaturation curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>), we conclude that RPS20 indeed exhibits considerable conformational variation in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structure of a designed TPR</title><p>To obtain high-resolution structural information on our designed proteins, we set up crystallization trials for all four folded constructs. We obtained crystals and solved the structure of M4N to a resolution of 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The asymmetric unit (ASU) contains three polypeptide chains of almost identical structure (all pairwise C<sub>α</sub> RMSD values below 1.4 Å). Notably, all three chains exhibit the desired TPR architecture with three repetitive hairpins, which interact via knobs-into-holes packing between helices Ai and B(i-1), as is characteristic of TPR hairpins. A superposition to the CTPR3 structure yields C<sub>α</sub> RMSD values below 2.6 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">supplementary file 1I</xref>). An unexpected difference to the canonical TPR structure is that the stop helix of M4N is not resolved in any of the three chains. However, this missing helix is compensated for by a specific dimerization mode of two M4N protomers. Therein, the C-terminal TPR units of the two protomers form a tight interface, in which the B3 helix of each chain substitutes for the stop helix of the other, mimicking the capping effect of the stop helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A superposition of this mimicry to the last TPR unit and stop helix of CTPR3 yields C<sub>α</sub> RMSD values as low as 1.2 Å over 44 residues. The third chain of the ASU, however, was found as a monomer, capping its C-terminal TPR unit in a more unspecific manner by packing it orthogonally against the two A1 helices of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16761.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The X-ray structure of M4N.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The three chains A, B and C in the asymmetric unit are colored green, blue and yellow, respectively.

We conclude that in the amplified constructs, the observed interactions are more favorable than the interaction with the native stop helix, releasing it and rendering it prone to degradation.

This folding process is complicated and easily disrupted, witness the elaborate systems for protein folding, quality control and degradation universal to all living beings. Despite the widespread problems to reach and maintain the folded state, natural proteins nevertheless form a best-case group, since the overwhelming majority of random polypeptides do not appear to have a folded structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keefe and Szostak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). It thus seems impossible that, at the origin of life, the prototypes for the folded proteins we see today could have arisen by random concatenation of amino acids. We have proposed that folding resulted from the increasing complexity of peptides that supported RNA replication and catalysis, and that these peptides assumed their structure through the interaction with the RNA scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Söding and Lupas, 2003</xref>). In this view, protein folding was an emergent property of RNA-peptide coevolution. We have recently described 40 such peptides whose conservation in diverse folds suggests that they predated folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alva et al., 2015</xref>). These peptides are enriched for nucleic-acid binders, particularly in the context of the ribosome.</p><p>Due to its extremely slow rate of change, the ribosome essentially represents a living fossil, providing the possibility to study the chronology of ancient events in molecular evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, core ribosomal proteins offer a window into the time when proteins were acquiring the ability to fold. Those close to the catalytic center almost entirely lack secondary structure. Further away from the center, their secondary structure content gradually increases and at the periphery, these secondary structure elements become arranged into topologies that parallel those seen in cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, the structures of ribosomal proteins chart a path of progressive emancipation from the RNA scaffold. Even the peripheral proteins, however, still mostly assume their structure only in the context of the ribosomal RNA, as exemplified by RPS20 in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Paterakis et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>The simplest mechanism to achieve an increase in complexity is the repetition of building blocks and nature provides many examples for this, at all levels of organization. The dominant role of repetition in the genesis of protein folds has been documented in many publications since the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blundell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Broom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Eck and Dayhoff, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lee and Blaber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McLachlan, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Söding et al., 2006</xref>). As a test of this mechanism, we explored whether a peptide originating from a ribosomal protein that is disordered outside the context of the ribosome, could form a folded protein through an increase in complexity afforded by repetition. For this, we chose a present-day representative of one of the 40 fragments we reconstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alva et al., 2015</xref>); this fragment is naturally found in a single copy in several different folds, including that of ribosomal protein RPS20, and repetitively in one fold, TPR. Simple repetition was not sufficient in our case, but the repeat protein was so close to a folded structure that only two point mutations per repeat were necessary to allow it to fold reliably. The mutations needed for this transition did not appear to affect negatively the interaction with the RNA scaffold, raising the possibility that they could have been among the variants sampled multiply in the course of evolution.</p><p>Our experiments recapitulate a scenario for the emergence of a protein fold by a widespread and well-documented mechanism, and show that this could have proceeded in a straightforward way. These experiments represent a proof of concept, starting with a modern peptide likely to still retain many features of an ancestral αα-hairpin that gave rise to a number of folds, including TPR. Rather than proposing proto-RPS20 as the parent of TPR domains, we see it as one of many proteins emerging from this ancestral hairpin. Given the ease with which repetition of the RPS20 hairpin yielded a TPR-like fold, we consider it likely that the hairpins belonging to the ancestral group were amplified many times during the emergence of folded proteins to yield a range of TPR-like offspring, of which only one may have survived to this day (but see also the figure legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The reason for this limited survival may lie in the fact that a structure is a prerequisite for protein function, but it is the function that is under biological selection. It could be that the newly emerged TPR-like folds required many additional changes to achieve a useful activity and that therefore only very few – possibly just one – survived. We consider a different scenario more probable, however. All present-day TPR domains whose function has been characterized mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to linear sequence motifs in unstructured polypeptide segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zeytuni and Zarivach, 2012</xref>). This activity would have been particularly relevant at a time of transition from peptides dependent on RNA scaffolds for their structure, to autonomously folded polypeptides. Functions relevant in this context would have been to prevent aggregation and increase the solubility of newly emerging (poly)peptides, to promote autonomous folding, to serve as assembling factors for RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes, and to recognize targeting sequences in the emerging cellular networks. It therefore seems likely to us that many of the newly evolved TPR-like folds became established in one or the other of these activities, only to be subsequently displaced by folding becoming a general property of cellular polypeptides and by more advanced, energy-dependent folding factors, which offered much better regulation. Exploring the extent to which our new TPR protein could fulfill such functions represents the next frontier in our studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phylogeny for recently amplified TPR arrays</title><p>All sequence similarity searches in this work were performed using the Web BLAST (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004870">SCR_004870</ext-link>) from the National Institute for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boratyn et al., 2013</xref>) and in the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010277">SCR_010277</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/">https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alva et al., 2016</xref>).

Protein sequences from the SEQRES record in PDB files were downloaded from the PDB. We only considered sequences with at least 34 residues, which is the length of the TPR unit. Redundancy was removed by keeping only non-identical sequences. In total, 68,197 sequences were scanned by using TPRpred with default parameters. Only fragments predicted to be TPR with a p-value lower than 1.0e−4 were retained (646 hits). We estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Noble, 2009</xref>) associated with this p-value cutoff using a simulated sequence dataset generated by using the amino-acid composition derived from the PDB sequences. The dataset contains the same number of sequences of the same length distribution as the PDB sequences. The FDR was estimated to be the ratio of the number of hits in the simulated dataset to the number of detected hits in the PDB sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Noble, 2009</xref>). We repeated the simulation 100 times and the FDR was estimated to be 1.0 ± 0.4%.</p><p>Within the 646 hits, we kept only TPR unit singletons, which are TPR units that have no other TPR units close to them within a distance of 10 residues in the same sequence. TPR units of identical sequences are considered only once. Subsequently, these TPR unit singletons were filtered by removing those annotated to belong to clan <italic>TPR</italic> (CL0020) in Pfam 27.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004726">SCR_004726</ext-link>).</p><p>The structures of the predicted TPR units obtained from the previous step were then compared to an average TPR unit structure. A predicted TPR unit was discarded if the C<sub>α</sub> RMSD of the 34 residues is greater than 2.0 Å after superposition. The average TPR unit structure was generated by considering all proteins belonging to family tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) (a.118.8.1) in SCOP 1.75 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007039">SCR_007039</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murzin et al., 1995</xref>). TPR repeats in these proteins were again detected using TPRpred and a per-repeat p-value cutoff of 1.0e−4 was used. In total, 50 non-redundant TPR repeat fragments were identiﬁed and superposed using a multiple structure alignment tool MultiProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shatsky et al., 2004</xref>). The average C<sub>α</sub> positions were calculated from the 50 structures after superposition. We obtained 31 fragments after the structure filtering step (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).

There are 4402 and 2284 sequences in the two sets. We merged the two sets and removed identical sequences to create a dataset of 3742 RPS20 sequences. TPRpred was used to detect TPR unit homologs in them. We obtained 24 hits in these RPS20 sequences predicted by TPRpred to match TPR unit proﬁle with a p-value smaller than 1.0e−4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).</p><p>We defined 'interface positions' in the TPR unit and then transferred the definition to RPS20-hh according to their structure superposition. We considered the residues on the outer side of the two helices facing neighboring TPR units. Both helix A and helix B in the TPR unit are α-helices, which have on average 3.6 residues per turn. Thus, every third or fourth residue always appears on the same side of the helix. They are positions 3, 7 and 10 in helix A and positions 17, 21, 24 and 28 in helix B. According to the TPR sequence proﬁle compiled by Main et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Main et al., 2003b</xref>), the most common residues at these positions are hydrophobic except for positions 17 and 24, where the most common residues are both Tyr (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Therefore, positions 17 and 24 were not included in the definition of interface positions. Furthermore, the residue at position equivalent to position 24 in RPS20 structure faces its C-terminal helix and is already an interface residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Thus, it was not considered as an interface position to be checked in the study. In the end, only positions 3, 7, 10, 21 and 28 in RPS20-hh were deﬁned to be interface positions to be examined, because they are exposed to the solvent or interact with the RNA molecules in the ribosome, but would interact with neighboring repeats in the TPR fold.</p><p>We searched all RPS20 sequences in Pfam 27.0 family <italic>Ribosomal_S20p</italic> (PF01649), including both datasets 'full' and 'ncbi', for candidates in which the interface positions are occupied by as many hydrophobic residues as possible. In the MSA provided by Pfam, we extracted the 34 columns that correspond to the sequence fragment of RPS20-hh from <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic>, which was found by TPRpred to be the hit with the best p-value and was thus used as the reference RPS20-hh. We obtained 1370 sequence fragments that do not contain any indels, in which the interface positions were examined for hydrophobicity. Here, Ala, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Val were considered as hydrophobic residues. Trp was not included as its side chain may be too large to be accommodated at the interface.</p><p>We employed several low-complexity / intrinsically disordered region prediction methods (SEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wootton, 1994</xref>], PONDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Romero et al., 2001</xref>], DisEMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Linding et al., 2003</xref>], IUPred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dosztányi et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005b</xref>]) to investigate putative intrinsically disordered regions in the RPS20 of <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic>. We ran SEG with three sets of recommended parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wootton and Federhen, 1996</xref>) and the other approaches with default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Optimization of RPS20-hh in the designed TPRs</title><p>We considered eight positions (2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 22, 23 and 25) in RPS20-hhta for optimization apart from the four residues at the C-terminus.</p><p>Main et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Main et al., 2003b</xref>) discovered a set of eight 'TPR signature residues' in the consensus design: W4, L7, G8, Y11, A20, Y24, A27 and P32. Six of them are missing in RPS20-hhta except A20 and A27. Following the principle of consensus design, we introduced L4W and K7L into RPS20-hhta. K7 is also one of the interface positions that ought to be mutated to hydrophobic residue for better packing at interfaces. A8 and L11 were not optimized because they are the second and third most common residues at positions 8 and 11 in the TPR profile, respectively. M24 was also retained because it seems long hydrophobic side chains are favored at position 24 though Met is not one of the three most common residues (YFL). P32 was introduced to replace D32 in RPS20-hhta as part of the C-terminal consensus loop (DPNN) between repeats.</p><p>Co-evolution is commonly observed between physically interacting residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">de Juan et al., 2013</xref>). We investigated if any positions we optimized are involved in a co-evolution relationship so that we can preserve such correlations. We performed a direct coupling analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>) and computed the mutual information using MatrixPlot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gorodkin et al., 1999</xref>) between all positions in TPR repeat sequences. The results of both approaches revealed that the highest correlation occurs between positions 7 and 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the most commonly observed combinations being R7-D23 and L7-Y23. Therefore, we always mutated I23 to the most commonly observed residue tyrosine (I23Y) in the TPR consensus sequence together with aforementioned mutation K7L. In addition, we considered combination K7R and I23D together. Combination K7-I23D was also tested because of highly similar physicochemical properties between Lys and Arg side chains.</p><p>The hydrophobic side chain of valine at position 9 in RPS20-hhta is buried between helices in RPS20, but would be exposed on the surface of the designed protein except in the last repeat, in which V9 interacts with the stop helix. Therefore, it is considered to be mutated to the most common residue asparagine (V9N) in the TPR repeat consensus except in the last repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>RPS20-hhta sequence and surface is enriched with positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This would lead to the exceedingly high theoretical iso-electric point (pI) of the designed proteins. Natural TPR proteins tend to exhibit zero net charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Magliery and Regan, 2004</xref>). Hence, we decided to randomly mutate the positively charged residues (Lys and Arg) in the two helices of RPS20-hhta to the corresponding most common residues in TPR sequence profile (K2E, K6N, K22E, R25Q/E). K26 was not mutated as Lys is already the most common residue in the TPR profile.</p><p>At the C-terminus of the designed TPR, the last four residue of RPS20-hhta (IDKA) were replaced with the TPR consensus loop sequence (DPNN) between repeat units. The reason is as follows. The secondary structure of the TPR unit is helix (13 aa) – loop (3aa) – helix (14 aa) – loop (4aa), while the secondary structure of the RPS20-hhta identiﬁed to be homologous to TPR unit is helix (13 aa) – loop (3 aa) – helix (18 aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The last four residues may have been included in the prediction by TPRpred merely to fulﬁll the size requirement of TPR repeat (34 aa). Indeed, when we scanned RPS20-hhta sequence using the hidden Markov model constructed for Pfam family <italic>TPR_1</italic>, only positions 2–28 were found to be similar to the <italic>TPR_1</italic> proﬁle using HMMER 3.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005305">SCR_005305</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eddy, 2009</xref>), even if all filters were switched oﬀ. So the four very C-terminal residues in RPS20-hhta were not used in the designed TPR between repeat units. They were not replaced in the last repeat unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Structure modeling and refinement in silico</title><p>CTPR3 structure of an idealized TPR repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Main et al., 2003b</xref>) (PDB id: 1na0, chain A) was taken as the main template to build an initial TPR structure model using RPS20-hhta. Helix B3 and the stop helix in our designed protein are different from natural TPRs, but more similar to natural RPS20s. So we also used a RPS20 protein as the structure template for the last repeat and the stop helix. The structure of RPS20 from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> HB8 (PDB id: 2vqe, chain T) was used because it was the structure with the best resolution (2.5 Å). The C-terminal loop in 2vqeT was discarded. The two structures 1na0A and 2vqeT were merged into a hybrid template based on the superposition of their homologous helical hairpins: the third TPR unit in 1na0A and the RPS20-hh in 2vqeT (the very C-terminal four residues were not used).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Dan S. Tawfik (Reviewer #3) and Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The lead author, Lupas, has suggested back in 2001 a model for the emergence of proteins in our evolutionary history. According to his model, short amino acid fragments that were capable of RNA binding emerged. Of these, some improved RNA function, and survived. Eventually, some of these became foldable (and functional) on their own. Proteins emerged by duplications of these ancestral fragments.

According to his model, short amino acid fragments that were capable of RNA binding emerged. Of these, some improved RNA function, and survived. Eventually, some of these became foldable (and functional) on their own. Proteins emerged by duplications of these ancestral fragments. In an eLife publication last year, the Lupas lab conducted bioinformatics analysis and detected a gallery of 40 commonly found protein fragments. That they are popular, and found also in ancient proteins, makes them candidates as ancestral fragments. Here, Lupas and colleagues examine one of these: an α helical hairpin with about 35-residues long sequence motif, known as tetratricopeptide. Sequence analysis showed that it appears also in the ribosomal protein RPS20, but it is not stable on its own, detached from the ribosome.

We did not wish to imply a scenario where RPS20 was the ancestor of the TPR fold, but rather one of common descent of RPS20 and TPR from an ancestral hairpin, which also gave rise to a number of other folds. For our study, we used RPS20 because we consider it the oldest still surviving descendant of this ancestral hairpin and, due to its slow rate of evolution, also the one most likely to reflect ancestral properties. In the process, we hoped to find that repetition is a sufficiently powerful mechanism to allow the emergence of a folded protein from an unstructured parent (note that the entire RPS20 is unstructured in the absence of ribosomal RNA, not just the isolated helix hairpin).</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The title and emphasis on &quot;intrinsically unfolded&quot; is misleading and may be misinterpreted by causal readers. The authors are not proposing that globular proteins originated from low complexity stretches of protein sequence. Although a single α-hairpin is indeed unfolded without RNA because it is simply too short, it does have a good α-helical content, and indeed is an α-hairpin rather than low complexity intrinsically unfolded protein.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the term will be misunderstood by readers who consider that only proteins unstructured under all conditions are in fact intrinsically disordered. However, it has become widely accepted that unstructured proteins that become partly or fully structured upon binding to small molecules or macromolecular ligands are also usefully included among the intrinsically disordered proteins. We have changed the title to use the term “disordered”, which is the generally used term (rather than “unfolded”, which we had used before as a contrast to the “folded” repeat protein) and have added a sentence to the Introduction to explain why we refer to ribosomal proteins as intrinsically disordered, also providing references to recent high-profile reviews that can further illuminate this point. We have further added material to section 2.4 and the Methods in order to substantiate that the sequence of RPS20 is in fact similar to that of intrinsically disordered proteins as judged by many disorder predictors, and with a biased residue distribution seen as low-complexity by the program SEG.</p><p>With respect to the single α-hairpin being unfolded, we agree that its lack of structure in solution would not be surprising, but that was not the point we were trying to make. Our point was that the parent protein is unstructured in solution. For this reason, we deleted “intrinsically unfolded” from the description of the helical hairpin in the last sentence of the Abstract.</p><p><italic>2) The constructed protein had been shown to adopt the TPR fold, but has no biochemical function, and as we know, structure in itself does is not 'visible' by natural selection. Presumably identifying potential function(s) for these designed TPRs is not a trivial task. However, the authors should explicitly acknowledge this and discuss what might be the function(s) which this protein could perform.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with this point and have expanded the last section of the paper to explicitly address it. Structure is a prerequisite for function, but it is the function that is under selection. Although the goal of our study was to explore the origin of structure from an unstructured precursor, we had been aware all along that the survival of this newly emerged structure would be dependent on the benefits it confers.</p><p>Thus, we started experiments on this point as soon as we had obtained the M4N structure. Following the reviewers’ comments, we decided to extend these in revision, but have not succeeded in obtaining conclusive results so far.</p><p>Guided by the observation that TPR domains, where of known activity, mediate protein-protein interactions, we started screens to identify potential binders to our new protein. Specifically, we performed pulldowns with soluble cell extracts from <italic>T. aquaticus, T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> using M4NΔC and M5ΔC, but were unable to discover interactors of even moderate affinity. Since TPR domains typically recognize linear sequence motifs in unstructured segments, we also screened a peptide library against M4NΔC and M5ΔC, using phage display with the Ph.D.-12 Library (NEB) containing ca. 10<sub>9</sub> 12-mers, but again, so far, no peptides could be identified (these experiments are still ongoing). This inability to identify protein or peptide ligands binding to our TPR domains may well be due to the dimerization of the protein, which obstructs the ligand-binding face common to TPR proteins. We are therefore now exploring whether we can disrupt dimerization by single mutations in the C-terminal helices before resuming these screens.</p><p>In parallel, however, we are also trying to exploit the central crevice formed in the dimer to find small- molecule ligands that could open an entirely new set of functionalities not seen in TPR proteins today.</p><p>Finally, we are exploring to what extent our new proteins still retain the ability of the RPS20 parent to interact with RNA. Preliminary experiments show that the folded dimers have no affinity for heterologous RNA molecules, but experiments remain to be done with Thermus ribosomal RNA and with the yet to be obtained monomeric variants.</p><p><italic>3) A related issue: The likelihood of an evolutionary step that involves 2-5 mutations should be discussed further. Reassuringly, none of the mutations harm the parent organism (Thermus has been used here), but would such mutants survive without providing evolutionary value? Or would they provide some merit even alone? Perhaps still bound to RNA? What is the evolutionary scenario here?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the evolutionary scenario did not become clear enough from the manuscript and we therefore made multiple changes to clarify it. We did not wish to imply that TPR proteins arose from a proto-RPS20 in a fully formed cell (such as Thermus is today); rather, we think that they arose from a precursor form that, like RPS20, interacted with RNA, but in a much more primitive cell-like environment. The reason for the in vivoexperiments was to establish that the mutations necessary for folding are neutral with respect to RNA interaction in our model system. We take this finding to suggest that these (and other fold-promoting) mutations could have been sampled by neutral drift also in the ancestral hairpin. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that in a more primitive, less networked and less integrated setting, many more mutations would have been (largely) neutral than in the Thermus cytosol. A further corollary of the evolutionary steps happening in a pre-cellular environment is that, in the absence of performant control and repair mechanisms, the frequency of all kinds of genetic mutations would have been much higher.</p></body></sub-article></article>
