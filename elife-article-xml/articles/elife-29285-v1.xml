Humans, monkeys and ferrets have gyrencephalic brains (i.e. brains with folded cerebral cortices), whereas the brains of rodents are often lissencephalic (i.e. lacking cortical folds). It has been believed that the creation of cortical folds during evolution was a milestone, allowing for an increase in the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewitus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>). Malformations of cortical folds in human patients are associated with severe intellectual disabilities, epilepsy and diseases such as lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ross and Walsh, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation and malformation of cortical folds during development have been of great interest; however, they are still largely unknown.</p><p>One attractive hypothesis for the mechanism of cortical folding is that an increase in the numbers of neural progenitors is responsible for cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poluch and Juliano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>). The developing cerebral cortex contains two germinal layers containing neural progenitors: the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ). The VZ comprises radial glial cells (RG cells, also known as apical progenitors/ventricular RG cells/apical RG cells), which undergo multiple rounds of cell divisions and generate SVZ progenitors. The SVZ is further subdivided into the outer SVZ (OSVZ) and the inner SVZ (ISVZ), and contains two types of neural progenitors: intermediate progenitor cells (IP cells, also known as basal progenitors) and outer radial glial cells (oRG cells, also known as OSVZ RG cells/basal RG cells/intermediate RG cells/translocating RG cells). Because a prominent thick SVZ was found in gyrencephalic animals, it has been hypothesized that thickening of the SVZ leads to acquiring cortical folds during development and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-Cerdeño et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>). However, the hypotheses about the mechanisms of cortical folding had been difficult to test experimentally in vivo, mainly because rapid and efficient genetic manipulation techniques that can be applied to gyrencephalic mammalian brains were poorly available.</p><p>To overcome this difficulty, we recently developed a genetic manipulation technique for gyrencephalic carnivore ferrets using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2013</xref>). By taking the advantage of our IUE technique for ferrets, we successfully demonstrated that the transcription factor Tbr2 was required for producing SVZ progenitors and that SVZ progenitors were indeed crucial for cortical folding during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toda et al., 2016</xref>). These results uncovered cell-autonomous molecular mechanisms of cortical folding. The next important question was what the upstream mechanisms regulating SVZ production and cortical folding were. Recently, we succeeded in producing a ferret model of polymicrogyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). When fibroblast growth factor (FGF) was overexpressed into the ferret cerebral cortex using our IUE technique, a number of undulating folds appeared, suggesting that excess FGF is sufficient for producing additional cortical folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). This finding further raised the possibility that endogenous FGF signaling is crucial for cortical folding during development. Here we uncovered that cortical folding was impaired in the ferret cortex when FGF signaling was inhibited. We further found that Pax6-positive oRG cells and upper layers of the cerebral cortex were selectively reduced by inhibiting FGF signaling. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammalian brains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF signaling mediates the formation of cortical folds</title><p>We first examined which FGF receptors (FGFRs) are expressed in the developing cerebral cortex of ferrets at postnatal day 0 (P0), when cortical folds are about to be formed. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated that <italic>FGFR1</italic>, <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> were expressed in the ferret cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To examine the role of FGF signaling in cortical folding, we inhibited FGF signaling in the developing ferret cortex. Because multiple FGFRs are expressed in the cortex, we introduced a soluble extracellular domain of FGFR3 (sFGFR3), which acts in a dominant-negative manner, into the ferret cerebral cortex using our IUE technique to suppress all FGFR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It should be noted that sFGFR3, which consists of the extracellular domain of FGFR3 without the transmembrane domain, is released from transfected cells and binds to endogenous FGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001</xref>). It was therefore supposed that sFGFR3 suppresses FGF signaling not only in transfected cells but also in neighboring non-transfected cells non-cell-autonomously, presumably resulting in stronger phenotypes. To test this, we introduced sFGFR3 into the ferret cerebral cortex using IUE and performed in situ hybridization for <italic>Sprouty2</italic>, whose expression is known to be up-regulated by FGFR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsang and Dawid, 2004</xref>). <italic>Sprouty2</italic> signals were abundantly distributed in the OSVZ and the VZ of the control ferret cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results suggest that sFGFR3 indeed suppresses FGF signaling non-cell-autonomously.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29285.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FGF signaling is required for cortical folding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of FGFRs in the developing ferret cortex.

Interestingly, we found that cortical folding was impaired in sFGFR3-transfected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistently, coronal sections showed that cortical folding was inhibited in the sFGFR3-transfected side of the cortex compared with the contralateral side of the cortex and the EGFP-transfected control cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). To quantify the effects of sFGFR3 on cortical folding, we utilized the local gyrus size (GS) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), the local sulcus depth (SD) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and the local gyrification index (GI) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with our observation, the local GS ratio, the local SD ratio and the local GI ratio were significantly reduced by sFGFR3 (local GS ratio: control, 0.75 ± 0.05; sFGFR3, 0.25 ± 0.05; p=0.003; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (local SD ratio: control, 0.88 ± 0.03; sFGFR3, 0.47 ± 0.10; p=0.019; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (local GI ratio: control, 0.95 ± 0.04; sFGFR3, 0.72 ± 0.05; p=0.025; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results clearly indicate that FGF signaling is crucial for cortical folding. It should be noted that cortical folding in peripheral regions of the GFP-positive area did not seem to be affected in the sFGFR3-transfected cortex. It seemed likely that the expression level of sFGFR3 was not sufficient to inhibit FGF signaling strongly in peripheral regions of the GFP-positive area. We also noticed that the local GS ratio and the local SD ratio were slightly smaller than 1 in the GFP-transfected control cortex (local GS ratio, p=0.009; local SD ratio, p=0.02; local GI ratio, p=0.19; one sample <italic>t</italic>-test), raising the possibility that cortical folding can be affected by electroporation itself. It would be important to be careful when interpreting experimental results using IUE. In addition, it is worth noting that because GFP-positive areas were wide enough to include both the gyrus and sulcus regions, it seemed possible that sFGFR3 affected both the formation of the gyrus and that of the sulcus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Regional differences in FGFR expression in the ferret cerebral cortex during development</title><p>We examined the detailed expression patterns of <italic>FGFR1</italic>, <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> in coronal sections of the ferret cerebral cortex during development. In situ hybridization showed that <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> mRNAs were predominantly expressed in the germinal zones such as the VZ at E32, and the VZ and the SVZ at E36 and E40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). <italic>FGFR1</italic> was also expressed in the VZ, but its signals were weaker than those of <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of <italic>FGFR2</italic> and that of <italic>FGFR3</italic> in the OSVZ were not uniform throughout the cortex at E36 and E40. Some areas contained abundant <italic>FGFR</italic> signals in the OSVZ, whereas other areas had fewer <italic>FGFR</italic> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These results led to the hypothesis that the regional differences in FGFR expression in the OSVZ mediate cortical folding. We quantified <italic>FGFR</italic> signal intensities along the tangential axis in the OSVZ at E40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). <italic>FGFR</italic> signals indeed showed regional differences in the OSVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).</p><p>Previously, lateral to medial gradients in cell proliferation were reported in the rodent cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer and Altman, 1991</xref>). Similarly, it was also reported that <italic>Fgfr</italic> expression showed medio-lateral gradients in the VZ of the rodent cerebral cortex during early corticogenesis, although it became uniform afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hébert et al., 2003</xref>). It therefore seemed possible that the regional differences in <italic>FGFR</italic> signals found in the ferret cortex reflected the medio-lateral gradients found in mice. Another possibility was that the regional differences in <italic>FGFR</italic> expression in ferrets corresponded to the positions of gyri and sulci. To address these possibilities, we next performed in situ hybridization for <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> at P6, when the gyrus was beginning to be formed.

Because it has been hypothesized that evolutional expansion of upper layers in gyrencephalic mammals resulted from an increase in the number of oRG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lukaszewicz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>), it seemed plausible that the reduction of Pax6-positive/Tbr2-negative oRG cells by sFGFR3 led to preferential reduction of upper layers. Consistently, we found that the thickness of layer 2/3 was significantly reduced by sFGFR3 (Control, 0.97 ± 0.06; sFGFR3, 0.77 ± 0.06; p=0.017; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, the thicknesses of layer 4, layer 5 and layer 6 were not affected by sFGFR3 (Layer 4: Control, 0.99 ± 0.05; sFGFR3, 0.96 ± 0.06; p=0.34; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (Layer 5: Control, 0.95 ± 0.03; sFGFR3, 1.12 ± 0.13; p=0.078; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (Layer 6: Control, 1.08 ± 0.13; sFGFR3, 1.00 ± 0.08; p=0.26; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is worth noting that GFP-positive transfected neurons were distributed in layers 4 and 5, but there were almost no GFP-positive cells in layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting our results that sFGFR3 exhibits a non-cell-autonomous effect. These findings suggest that FGF signaling affects the ratio between upper and lower layers of the cerebral cortex, and that the increased upper/lower ratio results in cortical folding. The most conceivable scenario would be that FGF increases OSVZ progenitors and preferentially increases upper layer neurons, generating the protrusion of cortical folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the mechanisms underlying the formation of cortical folds have been of great interest, they had remained largely unknown. Here we have shown that regional differences in FGFR expression exist in the ferret cerebral cortex even before cortical folds are formed. Using our IUE technique, we uncovered that FGF signaling is required for cortical folding and the proliferation of OSVZ progenitors. Furthermore, FGF signaling preferentially affects the thickness of upper layers. We previously demonstrated that FGF overexpression was sufficient to increase cortical folds and OSVZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, FGF overexpression preferentially increased the thickness of layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that FGF signaling is crucial for cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammals and is a pivotal upstream regulator of the production of OSVZ progenitors. FGF signaling is the first signaling pathway found to regulate cortical folding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Involvement of SVZ progenitors in cortical folding</title><p>Our results showed that sFGFR3 inhibited both cortical folding and the production of SVZ progenitors. Our previous study showed that activation of FGF signaling resulted in both additional cortical folds and increased SVZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). These correlations between cortical folding and SVZ progenitors raised the possibility that SVZ progenitors are responsible for generating cortical folds. Consistently, previous pioneering studies using monkeys reported that even before cortical folds are formed during development, SVZ progenitors are abundant in the cortical regions where the gyri will be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, we directly tested this possibility and uncovered that the formation of cortical folds was inhibited when SVZ progenitors were reduced by expressing dominant-negative Tbr2 transcription factor (DN-Tbr2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toda et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that SVZ progenitors are indeed crucial for cortical folding during development.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the ratio between upper layers and lower layers of the cerebral cortex is crucial for cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>). A preferential increase in upper layers relative to lower layers is supposed to produce the protrusion (i.e. the gyrus) of the cortex. Consistent with this hypothesis, current and previous our findings demonstrated that sFGFR3 and DN-Tbr2 preferentially reduced upper layers where cortical folding was impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toda et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, when FGF signaling was enhanced, upper layers were predominantly increased and additional gyri were formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Besides the ratio between upper layers and lower layers mentioned above, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewitus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>). It was previously proposed that radial fibers provided by oRG cells are involved in gyrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). In prospective gyral regions, oRG cells provide oblique radial fibers for conical neuronal migration, which could contribute to the expansion of the cortical surface. Because our results showed that the numbers of oRG cells were reduced by sFGFR3, reduction of oRG fibers could also be involved in the effect of sFGFR3. Another hypothesis is that the tension of nerve fibers plays a key role in gyrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Essen, 1997</xref>). This also seemed possible because axonal trajectories could also be affected by sFGFR3. Future investigations would be necessary in order to gain a complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying cortical folding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The roles of FGF signaling in cortical folding and the production of SVZ progenitors</title><p>Our findings demonstrated that the protrusion of the gyrus was reduced by sFGFR3, whereas the pattern of the gyrus was preserved. These results suggest that FGF signaling is involved in making the protrusion of the gyri rather than regulating the positions of the gyri. Consistently, the overall gyral patterns seemed to be unaffected by FGF8, although small additional gyri appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the role of FGF signaling in determining the number of the gyri is unclear. sFGFR3 did not seem to affect the number of the gyri, though FGF8 increased it, leading to polymicrogyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). Because a previous study reported that an increase in the number of neurons resulted in additional folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>), the increase in neurons induced by FGF8 seemed to be sufficient for producing additional gyri.</p><p>Our findings indicate that FGF signaling regulates cortical folding and the proliferation of OSVZ progenitors. In contrast to OSVZ progenitors, the proliferation of RG cells in the VZ was not affected by inhibition of FGF signaling, even though FGFR is expressed in the VZ. Previous studies have demonstrated that several ligands (e.g. growth factors and morphogens) other than FGF, such as BMP7, promoted the proliferation of RG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segklia et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it seemed plausible that FGFs and other growth factors act redundantly to promote the proliferation of RG cells in the VZ. It should be noted that although our findings indicate that FGF signaling regulates the proliferation of OSVZ progenitors, it remains possible that FGF also regulates the differentiation of RG cells into SVZ progenitors because FGFRs are also expressed in RG cells. Future investigations would be necessary for addressing these points.</p><p>Although our findings clearly uncovered a crucial role of FGF signaling in cortical folding, currently it is unknown which types of FGFR and FGF are responsible for cortical folding. Our in situ hybridization showed that FGFR1, 2 and 3 were expressed in the developing ferret cortex. Because similar downstream signaling pathways are activated by FGFR1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwata and Hevner, 2009</xref>), it seems likely that they work redundantly. Similarly, because several FGFs are expressed in the developing mouse cortex (Allen Brain Atlas), they may work cooperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Advantages of ferrets for examining the mechanisms of cortical folding</title><p>Although several hypotheses about the mechanisms of cortical folding have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelava et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>), it had been difficult to test these hypotheses directly through experiments. This was mainly because efficient genetic manipulation techniques that can be used for gyrencephalic mammals were missing. Taking advantage of our IUE technique for ferrets, here we uncovered the crucial role of FGF signaling in cortical folding. Using the same technique, we previously reported that SVZ progenitors were indispensable for cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toda et al., 2016</xref>), and produced polymicrogyria model ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). Ferrets are clearly an important option for investigating the mechanisms of cortical folding.</p><p>Ferrets have several important advantages. First, anatomical and electrophysiological information about the ferret brain is available because the ferret brain has been widely used for anatomical and electrophysiological research. The structures of cortical gyri and sulci are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smart and McSherry, 1986b</xref>). Second, the processes of the formation of cortical gyri during development have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smart and McSherry, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smart and McSherry, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neal et al., 2007</xref>). For example, when ferret babies are born, their brains are lissencephalic, and cortical folds are formed after birth. Therefore, the mechanisms of cortical folding can be analyzed using neonatal ferrets rather than embryos. Third, usually more than six ferret babies are born from one pregnant mother. This large number of babies per pregnant mother facilitates examination under various experimental conditions and the ability to obtain a sufficient number of experimental samples. Finally, because our IUE technique is now available, genetically manipulated ferret brains can be obtained within a few weeks. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of gyrencephalic brains using ferrets would help lead to our ultimate goal of understanding the human brain and its diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

After background signals were removed using the ‘threshold’ tool of ImageJ software (Default or MaxEntropy option), the numbers of immunopositive cells in GFP-positive areas were manually counted using the ‘cell counter’ tool and were divided by the total area of the ROI to calculate cell densities. To calculate the numbers of Pax6-positive and Tbr2-positive cells, coronal sections containing the striatum were used. The densities of Pax6-positive and Tbr2-positive cells in each germinal layer in dorsolateral regions of the cerebral cortex were multiplied by its thickness. One region per each animal was used. The thickness of each germinal layer was measured as follows using three sections for each animal: the area of each germinal layer was divided by its tangential length. The cell-dense layer next to the VZ was identified as the ISVZ and the cell-sparse layer between the ISVZ and the IZ was identified as the OSVZ. In addition, the border between the ISVZ and the OSVZ was also identified by the presence of GFP-positive fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Calculation of the local GS ratio, the local SD ratio and the local GI ratio</title><p>Serial coronal sections containing the suprasylvian gyrus (SSG) were prepared from electroporated brains.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleason as the Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Edwin Monuki (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous work by Masuda et al., 2015 using FGF8 in utero electroporation (IUE) showed surprising extra &quot;normal-appearing&quot; sulci and gyri, and previous work by the Borrell group to show differential expression between cortical gyri and sulci for FGFR3. The current sFGFR3 IUE work to decrease FGF signaling is a natural complement to the Masuda et al. study, and especially relevant because it was performed in the ferret neocortex, which maintains cardinal features of gyrate mammalian brain – i.e. folded pial surfaces paralleled by curved and continuous cortical layers, which generally overlie an unfolded ventricular surface. By performing an in utero knock-down of FGFR3, the authors have been able to demonstrate the necessity of this gene for cortical folding. Because the experiments are performed in a gyrencephalic species, this study provides the most clear insight into the molecular mechanisms of gyrification to date. The data is of high quality.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given that the authors recognize non-cell autonomous role of FGFR3 in regulating FGF signaling,the authors should perform in situ hybridization for a few of the downstream effectors of FGF signaling and correlate the phenotype with in utero electroporated cells.</p><p>Most cortical folding studies employ the gyrification index (GI), which the authors have also used previously, but GI is not included here, for reasons that are unclear. This should be straightforward to include, since contralateral non-electroporated cortex is present in every section. If possible, it would be most beneficial to the field to include GI among the metrics used.</p><p>sFGFR3 IUE generates a thinner cortex with fewer oRG, IPs, and upper layer neurons, which alone creates an interpretive issue with regard to normal gyrification/sulcation – cytoarchitechtonically-defined cortical areas (e.g. individual Brodmann areas) typically span multiple sulci. Current findings seem entirely consistent with a selective effect on gyral &quot;bulging&quot; rather than sulcal formation per se, but this would depend on whether sufficient EP occured in sulcal regions. The electroporations themselves span sulci, but most of the construct-bearing (green) cortical mantle cells – and perhaps more so in controls? – appear to be in gyral crowns rather than sulcal depths. Most folding mechanisms require a local difference or asymmetry between bulging gyri and indenting sulci, but sulcal-gyral differences in electroporation and phenotype are not delineated here. In addition to differences across this tangential domain, differences in radial distribution of green cells could be important, given the non-autonomy of sFGFR3, but this is also not assessed. In general, careful interpretation of current findings in relation to existing models of cortical folding would be essential to fully realize the impact of this work.</p><p>The authors main point, that expression varies by 'region' is understood, but it needs to be shown that these changes across the tangential axis of developing cortex are meaningful for the topic at hand. Therefore, this data would become more interesting if the authors were to show another relevant molecule(s) that are expressed by neural precursor cells that do *not* show lateral to medial gradients of expression.</p><p>The authors show that most <italic>FGFR1</italic>, 2 and 3 cells are Pax6 positive and Tbr2 negative, and conclude that these cells must therefore be translocating radial glia, but it would be good to recognize that astroglial cells express Pax6 during and after neurogenic stages of development, therefore some of the cells could be related to gliogenesis not neurogenesis (an important point that is often lost in studies of cortical development, we all sometimes lose sight of the fact that cortex contains many many glial cells too).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29285.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given that the authors recognize non-cell autonomous role of FGFR3 in regulating FGF signaling,the authors should perform in situ hybridization for a few of the downstream effectors of FGF signaling and correlate the phenotype with in utero electroporated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer's comment, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for a downstream effector of FGF signaling.

We found that these expression patterns were similar, suggesting that the regional difference of FGFR expression reflects that of neural progenitors. Our results suggest that FGF signaling induces a preferential increase of FGFR-positive neural progenitors in the prospective gyrus regions. In addition, our finding that the regional differences of FGFR expression found in the OSVZ in ferrets were not observed in mice (see Minor point #4) also supports our idea that the regional differences of FGFR expression are important for cortical folding.

Therefore, although our result showed that FGFRs were preferentially expressed in Pax6-positive/Tbr2-negaitve cells of the OSVZ in the developing ferret cerebral cortex, it remained possible that these cells were astroglial cells. To test this possibility, we examined if Pax6-positive cells in the OSVZ expressed GFAP. We found that Pax6-positive cells in the OSVZ did not express GFAP, suggesting that they are not astroglial cells.
