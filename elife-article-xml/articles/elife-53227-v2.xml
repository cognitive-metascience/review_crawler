metabolism that provides the reducing equivalents for numerous essential processes, most being mediated by tryparedoxin (Tpx). While the biosynthesis and reduction of trypanothione are cytosolic, the molecular basis of the thiol redox homeostasis in the single mitochondrion of these parasites has remained largely unknown. Here we expressed Tpx-roGFP2, roGFP2-hGrx1 or roGFP2 in either the cytosol or mitochondrion of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. We show that the novel Tpx-roGFP2 is a superior probe for the trypanothione redox couple and that the mitochondrial matrix harbors a trypanothione system. Inhibition of trypanothione biosynthesis by the anti-trypanosomal drug Eflornithine impairs the ability of the cytosol and mitochondrion to cope with exogenous oxidative stresses, indicating a direct link between both thiol systems. Tpx depletion abolishes the cytosolic, but only partially affects the mitochondrial sensor response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This strongly suggests that the mitochondrion harbors some Tpx and, another, as yet unidentified, oxidoreductase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> are single-celled parasites that cause human sleeping sickness and animal diseases.

All these parasitic protozoa lack the nearly ubiquitous glutathione reductases (GRs) and thioredoxin reductases but, instead, have a trypanothione (T(SH)<sub>2</sub>)/trypanothione reductase (TR) system. The trypanothione system delivers reducing equivalents for a large number of vital processes (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krauth-Siegel and Leroux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manta et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manta et al., 2013</xref>). Most of the reactions are mediated by tryparedoxin (Tpx), a distant member of the thioredoxin family.</p><p>For T(SH)<sub>2</sub> synthesis, two molecules of glutathione (GSH) are linked by one molecule of spermidine, with glutathionylspermidine (Gsp) as intermediate. Both steps are catalyzed by trypanothione synthetase (TryS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Comini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krauth-Siegel and Leroux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oza et al., 2002</xref>). Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, Eflornithine), a drug against late-stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> sleeping sickness, is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the enzyme generating putrescine, the precursor for spermidine synthesis. Treatment of <italic>T. brucei</italic> with DFMO decreases the levels of spermidine and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> and slightly increases the level of GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellofatto et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fairlamb et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). All enzymes involved in T(SH)<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis and also TR, which catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of trypanothione disulfide (TS<sub>2</sub>) as well as glutathionylspermidine disulfide (Gsp<sub>2</sub>), appear to be restricted to the cytosol.</p><p>African trypanosomes lack catalase.

However, survival and proliferation of cells lacking Pxs can be restored by supplementing the medium with an iron chelator or the vitamin E analogue Trolox [(±)−6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz and Krauth-Siegel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). Cell death of Px-deficient insect stage procyclic (PC) <italic>T. brucei</italic> closely resembles ferroptosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz and Krauth-Siegel, 2018</xref>). In the case of the Prxs, two different enzymes are expressed, one in the cytosol (cPrx) and one in the mitochondrion (mPrx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomás and Castro, 2013</xref>). In bloodstream (BS) <italic>T. brucei</italic>, depletion of cPrx, but not of mPrx, is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilkinson et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Leishmania</italic>, mPrx is required for survival of the parasite in the mammalian host. However, this essential function is not related to its peroxidase activity but to the ability of the protein to act as a thiol-independent molecular chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The thiol-disulfide redox state of roGFP2 (reduction-oxidation-sensitive green fluorescence protein 2) can be monitored in real time, inside intact cells, in a ratiometric manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwarzländer et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, this approach allows to measure the degree of probe oxidation independently of absolute sensor concentration. Equilibration of the roGFP2 thiol-disulfide redox couple with the intracellular glutathione redox couple was found to be mediated, almost exclusively, by glutaredoxins (Grxs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, fusion of roGFP2 to human glutaredoxin 1 (hGrx1) generated a probe for specifically measuring the redox potential of the glutathione redox couple (E<sub>GSH</sub>) which is a function of both the GSH:GSSG ratio and total glutathione concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). The hGrx1-roGFP2 fusion protein proved to be a valuable tool for measuring changes in E<sub>GSH</sub> in various model organisms and compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kojer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Radzinski et al., 2018</xref>). It has also been used to follow drug-induced changes of E<sub>GSH</sub> in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasozi et al., 2013</xref>) and in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franco et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franco et al., 2017a</xref>). By genetically fusing roGFP2 to thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases other than Grx, additional biosensors, selective for other kinds of small thiols, were generated. For instance, fusion of roGFP2 to mycoredoxin-1 yielded a probe selectively responding to changes in the mycothiol redox potential in actinomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhaskar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reyes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tung et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In yeast and human cells, GSH biosynthesis is confined to the cytosol. GSH must therefore be imported into both the intermembrane space (IMS) and the matrix of the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese et al., 2017</xref>). In yeast, the hGrx1-roGFP2 probe revealed that the cytosol, IMS and mitochondrial matrix rapidly recover after exposure of cells to an oxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kojer et al., 2015</xref>). This indicates that all three compartments either harbor a GSSG reducing system or are connected to a compartment in which GSSG is reduced. Indeed, GR localizes to both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese et al., 2017</xref>). Trypanosomatids contain both free GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krauth-Siegel and Comini, 2008</xref>). This finding, however, does not provide any information about the nature and concentration of the individual thiol(s) within distinct subcellular compartments. Trypanosomes have a single mitochondrion that spans the complete length of the cell. In BS <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the mitochondrion has a tubular cristae-poor morphology and the parasites produce ATP by glycolysis and possibly also by substrate-level phosphorylation reactions in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zíková et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, PC cells have a highly reticulated, cristae-rich mitochondrion and generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> have a high demand for mitochondrial iron sulfur cluster proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukeš and Basu, 2015</xref>), the synthesis of which usually involves GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lill et al., 2015</xref>). However, virtually nothing is known about the low-molecular-weight thiols that reside in the mitochondrion of trypanosomatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomás and Castro, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here we studied PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines constitutively expressing a novel biosensor, Tpx-roGFP2, in either the cytosol or mitochondrion. We show for the first time that the mitochondrial matrix of trypanosomes harbors a trypanothione-based redox metabolism. The disulfide reducing capacity in the mitochondrial matrix appears to be slightly weaker than in the cytosol, probably due to a lower T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> ratio. Inhibition of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis by DFMO does not alter the redox steady state of the probe but impairs the ability of both the cytosol and mitochondrion to cope with exogenously applied oxidants, indicating a direct link between the trypanothione systems of the two compartments. Depletion of Tpx abolishes the response of cytosolic roGFP2-hGrx1 or roGFP2 to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but only partially affects the mitochondrial sensor response. This finding strongly suggests that the mitochondrion harbors low levels of Tpx and, in addition, another, as yet unidentified, oxidoreductase that is also able to transfer reducing equivalents from T(SH)<sub>2</sub> to the mitochondrial thiol peroxidases. Notably, our data also reveal that the high selectivity of roGFP2-hGrx1 for the GSH/GSSG redox couple is restricted to cells that do not convert GSH into additional closely related low molecular weight thiols such as Gsp and T(SH)<sub>2</sub>. In trypanosomes, roGFP2-hGrx1 predominantly equilibrates with the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> redox couple.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tpx-roGFP2 is a sensor for the trypanothione redox state</title><p>To generate a trypanothione-selective sensor, roGFP2 was fused to Tpx.

Finally, we followed the response of Tpx-roGFP2 and hGrx1-roGFP2 to small incremental additions of GSSG or TS<sub>2</sub> when both GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> were present at physiological concentrations. In the presence of 100 µM GSH and 500 µM T(SH)<sub>2</sub>, Tpx-roGFP2 and hGrx1-roGFP2 reached an OxD of 0.15 and 0.24, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Addition of 1 µM GSSG or TS<sub>2</sub> did not have any effect. At a starting OxD of about 0.2, the incremental addition of 1 µM disulfide may be too small to cause any significant further sensor oxidation. When 25 µM disulfide was applied, TS<sub>2</sub> oxidized both sensors to a higher degree than GSSG. Interestingly, when treated with 10 µM GSSG, hGrx1-roGFP2 displayed a small transient increase in OxD. Thus, hGrx1-roGFP2 appears to be able to sense GSSG before it rapidly equilibrates with the trypanothione redox couple. Nevertheless, a physiological situation that could give rise to an increase of GSSG, but not of TS<sub>2</sub>, appears to be highly unlikely.

Oxidation of roGFP2-hGrx1 and roGFP2 was slightly slower and yielded a maximum OxD of about 0.6 and 0.4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Also, the re-reduction was fastest in the case of Tpx-roGFP2. Nine min after treating the cells with 10 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the sensor was again fully reduced, whereas roGFP2-hGrx1 and roGFP2 required 15 min and 22 min, respectively. The unprocessed fluorescence curves are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. Both Tpx-roGFP2 and roGFP2-hGrx1 showed a stronger response than roGFP2, confirming that the detection of transient redox changes by the probes is facilitated by the fused oxidoreductase. In contrast, the response of roGFP2 requires the interaction with an endogenous oxidoreductase, most probably Tpx. Making the assumption that the thiol concentration in the cytosol is comparable to that in the total cell lysate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we conclude that both fusion probes respond primarily to changes in the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> redox couple. This is supported by the efficient reduction of Tpx-roGFP2 by low micromolar concentrations of T(SH)<sub>2 </sub>in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the inability of 100 µM GSH to reduce Tpx-roGFP2 as well as hGrx1-roGFP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). To rule out direct oxidation of the sensors by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we incubated the pre-reduced recombinant sensors with 50 µM or even 100 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 11 min which resulted in an only marginal increase in OxD comparable with the non-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, in DFMO treated cells, the GSH concentration was doubled, whereas the T(SH)<sub>2</sub> concentration was halved, in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellofatto et al., 1987</xref>). When the parasites were disintegrated in the absence of the reducing agent TCEP, the values in all samples were 10–20% lower, indicating that the cellular thiols are mainly in the reduced state as previously shown for BS <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ulrich et al., 2017</xref>). This finding matches the highly reduced state of the sensors expressed in the cytosol. Clearly, DFMO treatment did not cause any shift of intracellular thiol/disulfide ratios. The basal OxD of the Tpx-roGFP2 sensor was almost zero, independently if the cells had been cultured in the absence or presence of DFMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), indicating that the altered GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> concentrations had no effect on the steady state thiol/disulfide ratios in the cytosol. The rate and degree of sensor oxidation triggered by exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was also unaffected. However, recovery of reduced Tpx-roGFP2 appeared to be slightly delayed in cells that had been cultured in the presence of DFMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Upon diamide stress, reductive recovery was clearly delayed in the drug-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In cells induced for seven days and treated with 20 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Tpx-roGFP2 displayed an OxD peak lasting for at least 10 min. At all H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations used, re-reduction of cytosolic Tpx-roGFP2 was markedly attenuated relative to non-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, right and left graphs). At this time point, also roGFP2 was oxidized to a higher degree and for a longer time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, right graph). Thus, depletion of mPrx affected the response of mito-roGFP2-Tpx and mito-roGFP2 to a challenge with exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that mPrx is involved in the reduction of exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and is the main mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-metabolising thiol peroxidase. However, the mitochondrial sensor response was not completely lost. Probably, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can still be reduced by Px III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz and Krauth-Siegel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). In cells that were subjected to long-term mPrx depletion, reduction of exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the cytosol was strongly delayed. One may speculate that this is due to a general impairment of metabolism in these proliferation arrested cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The expression of Tpx-roGFP2, a novel biosensor, in African trypanosomes allowed for the first time to follow real-time changes of the trypanothione redox state and, most importantly, to demonstrate that the parasites harbor a mitochondrial T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> system. Remarkably, hGrx1-roGFP2 also equilibrated with the parasite thiol/disulfide couples, albeit less efficiently than the Tpx-roGFP2 sensor. As expected, unfused roGFP2 showed an overall low reactivity. Nevertheless, T(SH)<sub>2</sub> was the most efficient reductant for all three sensors. This finding does not appear to be related to the redox potential as the E<sub>0</sub>’ of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> has been reported to be only slightly more negative (−242 mV) than that of GSH (−230 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fairlamb and Cerami, 1992</xref>). However, formation of an intramolecular disulfide (TS<sub>2</sub>) can be expected to be kinetically more favorable than the formation of intermolecular disulfides (GSSG, Gsp<sub>2</sub>). Another crucial point is that the thiol pK-value of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> is at least one pH unit lower than that of GSH. Thus, at physiological pH values, a significantly higher portion of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> is present in the reactive deprotonated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moutiez et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>When treated with small increments of TS<sub>2</sub> or GSSG in the presence of cellular GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> concentrations, both Tpx-roGFP2 and hGrx1-roGFP2 were oxidized, with TS<sub>2</sub> yielding a slightly faster response. As trypanosomes lack glutathione-dependent peroxidases and GSH is regenerated from GSSG by thiol-disulfide exchange with T(SH)<sub>2</sub>, an in vivo situation that could lead to the specific formation of GSSG is not known. In the physiological context of trypanosomes, both Tpx-roGFP2 and hGrx1-roGFP2 equilibrate with the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> redox couple. The reactivity of Grxs towards T(SH)<sub>2</sub> has been observed in previous studies showing that the parasite dithiol reduces <italic>E. coli</italic> Grx1 as efficiently as dithioerythritol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceylan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Tpx-roGFP2, roGFP2-hGrx1 and roGFP2 expressed in PC trypanosomes reported a fully reduced cytosol, similar to other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasozi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>) and the reduced state was rapidly restored after a challenge with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The sensor response to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is most likely mediated by cellular thiol peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>). The parasite enzymes use the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/Tpx system for re-reduction and thus enzymatically generate TS<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro and Tomás, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krauth-Siegel and Comini, 2008</xref>) which is then reported by the biosensors. Tpx-roGFP2 showed the fastest and strongest response, but also roGFP2-hGrx1 and even unfused roGFP2 reversibly responded to exogenous oxidants. This strongly suggested that all three sensors reacted to changes of the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> ratio in vivo. BS <italic>T. brucei</italic> expressing hGrx1-roGFP2 in the cytosol show sensor oxidation in response to treatment with different anti-parasitic compounds which was proposed to reflect a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franco et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franco et al., 2017a</xref>). However, as shown here, it is more likely that the compounds affected the cytosolic T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> redox state.</p><p>When PC cells were treated with diamide, Tpx-roGFP2 displayed a lower maximum OxD and shorter lag phase compared to roGFP2-hGrx1 and roGFP2, in accordance with the efficient in vitro reduction of the sensor by low micromolar concentrations of T(SH)<sub>2</sub>. In BS <italic>T. brucei</italic>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment results primarily in the formation of free disulfides, whereas in the case of diamide, the main products are protein-bound thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ulrich et al., 2017</xref>). The generally slower probe re-reduction after diamide- relative to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment may be due to a slower reduction of protein-mixed disulfides than of TS<sub>2</sub> by TR.</p><p>In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, depletion of bacillithiol and mycothiol, respectively, leads to basal sensor oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tung et al., 2019</xref>). When PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> were grown in the presence of DFMO, the cellular GSH was almost doubled and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> dropped to 40% of the concentration in untreated cells. Nevertheless, the basal OxD of Tpx-roGFP2 remained close to zero. This is consistent with data from BS trypanosomes, where depletion of TryS also causes an increase of GSH and a decrease of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Comini et al., 2004</xref>) without affecting the cellular thiol-disulfide ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ulrich et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, in the DFMO-treated cells, the total thiol concentration (GSH plus 2 x T(SH)<sub>2</sub>) was lowered by 63%. This further corroborates that the cytosolic redox potential is unaffected by these changes in thiol concentration. Indeed, the total acid-soluble thiol content can vary by up to 20-fold between life cycle stages, yet intact trypanosomes and <italic>Leishmania</italic> differ only 2-fold in their capacity to metabolize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> between stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 2001</xref>). In the DFMO-treated cells, recovery of reduced Tpx-roGFP2 after an exogenous oxidative challenge was slowed down whereby the effect was less pronounced with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compared to diamide. Thus, the cytosolic peroxidases were still able to efficiently reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, even at the significantly lower T(SH)<sub>2</sub> level.</p><p>In an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutant with 20% GSH compared to WT cells, the cellular GSH/GSSG ratio is unaffected. However, cytosolic roGFP2 is slightly oxidized because the lowered glutathione level shifts the glutathione redox potential to less negative values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>). The redox state of Tpx-roGFP2 was unaffected in the DFMO-treated parasites. Oxidation of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> results in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide. This distinguishes trypanosomatids from all other organisms. Independently of the nature of the individual thiol, mammals, yeast, plants and bacteria employ a monothiol for regulating the cellular redox homeostasis which renders the redox potential sensitive to changes in the overall thiol concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tung et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> couple, the redox potential and corresponding steady state sensor response are only determined by the thiol-disulfide ratio.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains with elevated GSH levels display a lower sensor OxD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kasozi et al., 2013</xref>) reflecting an increased reducing capacity. Depletion of Tpx resulted in a 10–20% increase of the intracellular GSH and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> levels in PC <italic>T. brucei</italic>. As the steady state OxD of the cytosolic sensors was almost zero already in the non-induced cells, a further decrease in the Tpx-depleted cells could not be observed and was also not expected. In the absence of Tpx, both roGFP2 and roGFP2-hGrx1 did not respond to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Tpx depletion abolishes the electron transfer from T(SH)<sub>2</sub> onto the parasite peroxidases and thus the enzymatic production of TS<sub>2</sub>. This provided additional evidence that in trypanosomes, roGFP2-hGrx1 senses changes in the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> system. In cells in which the Px-type peroxidases were depleted, all three biosensors showed a dramatic increase of the steady state OxD. Thus, lipid peroxidation rapidly translates into the oxidation of the cytosolic trypanothione pool.</p><p>When targeted to the mitochondrion, the redox sensors revealed an overall similar response as the cytosolic probes. This was strong evidence that the mitochondrial matrix harbors a trypanothione-based thiol metabolism. However, the slightly elevated basal OxD of the mitochondrial probes indicated that the mitochondrion is less reducing than the cytosol, in accordance with data reported for yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kojer et al., 2012</xref>). When the parasites were exposed to exogenous oxidants, all three mitochondrial probes were oxidized to a higher degree and were more slowly re-reduced than the respective cytosolic sensors. Also in yeast cells, the matrix glutathione pool was found to be significantly more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation than the cytosolic glutathione pool even though the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the matrix is lower than in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2019</xref>). This indicates that the reducing capacity in the single mitochondrion of trypanosomes is comparably low which could be due to a diminished T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> ratio and/or low total thiol concentration. In contrast to the cytosolic sensors, the mitochondrial probes responded to a second pulse of 50 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This suggested that the mPrx is less prone to over-oxidation than the cPrx as shown for mammalian Prx3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox et al., 2010</xref>); or less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reaches the mitochondrion due to the buffering capacity of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>). To analyze this point in more detail, future studies should include probes that directly record changes in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The de novo synthesis of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> and the reduction of TS<sub>2</sub> are confined to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, the question arises how T(SH)<sub>2</sub> reaches the mitochondrial matrix and is then kept in the reduced state. So far, specific transporters for T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> have not been identified. In yeast and human cells, the biosynthesis of GSH is also cytosolic, but GR occurs in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese et al., 2017</xref>). In rabbit kidney mitochondria and mitoplasts, the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) and oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) were identified as GSH transporters in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), whereas transport of GSH in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> is independent of the two anion carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booty et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the mitochondrial carrier protein 12 (MCP12) was shown to act as carboxylate and tricarboxylate carrier, thereby fulfilling the functions of DIC and OGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colasante et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colasante et al., 2018</xref>). Due to its overall positive charge, it is highly unlikely that T(SH)<sub>2</sub> is imported by these transporters. Regeneration of reduced mitochondrial hGrx1-roGFP2 in oxidatively challenged yeast cells requires the matrix-localized GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kojer et al., 2012</xref>). This is not the case in trypanosomes. The basal OxD of the sensors in the matrix was only slightly higher than in the cytosol and the probes reversibly responded to exogenous oxidative challenges. One may thus speculate that trypanosomes possess a protein that mediates an exchange of TS<sub>2</sub> and T(SH)<sub>2</sub> over the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p><p>The finding that unfused mito-roGFP2 responded to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pointed to the presence of an oxidoreductase that facilitates the equilibration of the sensor with the mitochondrial T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> couple and is capable of transferring reducing equivalents from T(SH)<sub>2</sub> onto the mitochondrial peroxidases. Nevertheless, re-reduction of mito-roGFP2 was slow when compared to cytosolic roGFP2. The catalytic capacity of the mitochondrial oxidoreductase appears to be limited due to either low reactivity or low concentration. Tpx-depletion affected the response of mito-roGFP2 and mito-roGFP2-hGrx1. One putative explanation may be that a minor fraction of Tpx resides in the mitochondrion. This would be in agreement with immuno-electron microscopy data which revealed some gold particles in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tetaud et al., 2001</xref>) although immunofluorescence studies and fractionated cell lysis displayed a cytosolic localization of Tpx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Currier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ebersoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tetaud et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, Tpx-depletion did not fully abolish the response of the mitochondrial sensors to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Probably, another oxidoreductase can mediate the electron transfer between T(SH)<sub>2</sub> and the mitochondrial peroxidases. With respect to the identity of this protein we can only speculate. A second <italic>T. brucei</italic> Tpx is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro et al., 2010</xref>). Other proteins that might catalyze the electron transfer from T(SH)<sub>2</sub> are Grxs and Trxs. <italic>T. brucei</italic> Grx1 is a cytosolic protein. Grx2 is located in the IMS and is unable to replace Tpx in the Px-catalyzed peroxidase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ebersoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceylan et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>T. brucei</italic> Trx1 lacks a mitochondrial pre-sequence, but a genome-wide localization study revealed the N-terminally mNeonGreen-tagged protein in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dean et al., 2017</xref>). Trx1 reduces Px and cPrx albeit with much lower efficiency than Tpx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hillebrand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt and Krauth-Siegel, 2003</xref>) and was inactive in an mPrx assay (unpublished data). A recently characterized mitochondrial Trx2 lacks reductase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Currier et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, human Trx1 does not engage in thiol-disulfide exchange with roGFP2, not even when genetically fused to the redox sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>). An importome study identified 21 new mitochondrial proteins with annotated oxidoreductase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peikert et al., 2017</xref>). Only three proteins appear to be possible candidates for the transfer of electrons from the trypanothione redox couple to the mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidases. These are Trx1, Grx2 and a putative glutathione-S-transferase/glutaredoxin (Tb927.7.3500). The latter protein harbors a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a CxxC motif but has not yet been characterized.</p><p>Depletion of mPrx affected neither the mitochondrial nor the cytosolic T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> steady state, similar to various peroxidase deletion mutants of <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> which also show no alteration in the basal mycothiol redox potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tung et al., 2019</xref>). After three days of RNAi against mPrx, the protein was strongly depleted but the cells still proliferated like WT parasites. When these cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, mitochondrial roGFP2-Tpx and roGFP2 displayed a markedly diminished response. Thus, in PC <italic>T. brucei</italic>, mPrx is the key peroxidase that couples H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduction to trypanothione oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix. This contrasts with the situation in promastigote <italic>Leishmania</italic> where the enzyme neither plays a role for proliferation nor for detoxification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teixeira et al., 2015</xref>), but compares with yeast cells where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced matrix glutathione oxidation is dependent on the presence of the mitochondrial 1-Cys-peroxiredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2019</xref>). After seven days of mPrx-depletion, the parasites adapted a highly elongated shape and virtually stopped proliferation. At this time point, the cytosolic sensors displayed an extremely long lag phase before they recovered from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation. Apparently, the capacity of the cytosol to cope with exogenous oxidants was severely hampered in these growth-arrested cells, in agreement with the notion that there is a cross-talk between the two compartments. Future work should focus on the identification of the proteins that allow the transport/exchange of T(SH)<sub>2</sub> and TS<sub>2</sub> in and out of the mitochondrion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The key resources table is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

involved in trypanothione synthesis and metabolism are potential drug targets. Although the functions of trypanothione and associated redox proteins are well characterized, it remains unclear whether trypanothione regulates the redox state of organelles such as the mitochondrion. In this study, the authors have generated a new probe, comprising the redox-sensitive roGFP2 protein coupled to either glutaredoxin or a trypanothione-specific tryparedoxin, to measure the redox state of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments following treatment of parasites with different oxidants and drugs. Their studies suggest that mitochondria contain a trypanothione-based thiol system and a new oxidoreductase activity capable of sustaining peroxidase activity. The findings provide new insights into the redox biology of these important human pathogens and add to the growing list of applications for which the roGFP sensors are being developed.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A tryparedoxin-coupled biosensor reveals a mitochondrial trypanothione metabolism in trypanosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Malcolm J McConville as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ana Tomas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found the development of new biosensors for monitoring the redox state of the cytosolic and mitochondrion compartments of the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, to be of significant interest. Expression of these biosensors, which included the previously established redox-sensitive roGFP2 protein coupled to either glutaredoxin or a trypanothione-specific tryparedoxin (Tpx-roGFP2), in different cellular compartments, allowed real-time monitoring of the thiol redox state of parasites in response to different oxidants and drugs. The authors show that the probes react preferentially to changes in the trypanothione (T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub>) redox couple, and present evidence that the trypanosome mitochondrion possess a trypanothione-based thiol system and, an as yet unidentified, oxidoreductase capable of sustaining peroxidase activity. The experimental validation of the sensor is comprehensive and the manuscript well written. The findings provide new insights into the redox biology of these important human pathogens and add to the growing list of applications for which the roGFP sensors are being developed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised a number of points that need to be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented techniques.</p><p>1) A question remains around what the new Tpx-roGFP2 probe is measuring (i.e. what drives the reducing and oxidizing half reactions in different organelles of intact cells). For example, while the authors demonstrate that Tpx mediates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent oxidation processes, they do not assess the extent to which Tpx-roGFP2 becomes oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> directly. It would be useful if the authors could (1) test the in vitro reaction of pre-reduced probe with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and (2) probe hyperoxidation by 50µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3); the diamide control tests reactivity of roGFP2 but not necessarily the TPX moiety which might be hyperoxidized. The probe redox-state could be tested using e.g. the maleimide-based shift assays</p><p>2) The authors propose that the <italic>T. brucei</italic> mitochondrion contains an additional oxidoreductase that is dependent on the trypanothione redox couple. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that this oxidoreductase could also or alternatively use a mitochondrial glutathione redox couple. The authors need to address this point.</p><p>3) Further to point 1, the impact of the paper would be greatly strengthened if the authors could provide additional information on the identity of the mitochondrial oxidoreductase. The authors note that other studies have identified 21 mitochondrial candidate proteins in <italic>T. brucei</italic> with annotated oxidoreductase activity. Although not essential, confirmation of location or function of these proteins would add to the study.</p><p>4) Figure 8C and D. It is noted that &quot;… in cells lacking Tpx, the mitochondrial sensors are still able to respond to exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in sharp contrast to the situation in the cytosol.&quot; Indeed, comparison of these graphs with those of Figure 5C and D, right panels shows a different response. However, the response of the non-induced cells (i.e., maintaining Tpx), is apparently quite different and more marked in the case of the mitochondrial sensors. Could it be that cells expressing the mito probes have inherent higher reactivity and resistance to oxidative stress?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53227.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised a number of points that need to be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.

Neither Tpx-roGFP2 nor hGrx1-roGFP2 and roGFP2 were oxidized by hydrogen peroxide. All three sensors were oxidized by TS<sub>2</sub> with the same rate and to the same degree as the respective non-treated probes (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). The data are presented in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 3. This rules out a direct sensor oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as well as a (hyper)oxidation of Tpx. The latter reaction is anyhow not be expected in the case of a protein with a CxxC active site motif.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors propose that the T. brucei mitochondrion contains an additional oxidoreductase that is dependent on the trypanothione redox couple. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that this oxidoreductase could also or alternatively use a mitochondrial glutathione redox couple. The authors need to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Our studies do not allow any statement about the presence or absence of glutathione in the mitochondrion. Nevertheless, due to the lack of glutathione reductase, also a mitochondrial glutathione redox system would be directly linked to the trypanothione system. A physiological situation that could give rise to an increase of GSSG, but not TS<sub>2</sub>, is not known. Given a total cellular concentration of ≤ 150 µM, the mitochondrial glutathione concentration is clearly submillimolar. This is in accordance with the finding that the hGrx1-coupled sensor, which is known for its general specificity for the glutathione redox couple, displayed an overall similar and slightly weaker response than the Tpx-coupled sensor when expressed in the cytosol or mitochondrion (Figures 3B and D and 7B and 7D). In trypanosomes, also hGrx1-roGFP2 responds primarily to changes in the T(SH)<sub>2</sub>/TS<sub>2</sub> ratio. The presence of a mitochondrial glutathione-specific oxidoreductase is highly unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Further to point 1, the impact of the paper would be greatly strengthened if the authors could provide additional information on the identity of the mitochondrial oxidoreductase.

Although not essential, confirmation of location or function of these proteins would add to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>A closer inspection of the 21 mitochondrial oxidoreductases described in the proteome analysis of Peikert et al., 2017, yielded only three proteins that might be suitable for the transfer of electrons from the trypanothione redox couple to the mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidases. These are Trx1 (Tb927.9.3370), Grx2 (Tb927.1.1770) and a putative glutathione-S-transferase/glutaredoxin (Tb927.7.3500). <italic>T. brucei</italic> Trx1 lacks a mitochondrial pre-sequence, but a genome-wide localization study revealed the protein in the mitochondrion (Dean et al., 2017). Trx1 is inactive in an mPrx assay (unpublished data) but together with human thioredoxin reductase is able to replace the trypanothione/Tpx couple in the Px-assay (Hillebrand et al., 2003). Grx2 also lacks an obvious targeting sequence and has been localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Ebersoll et al., 2018). Grx2 neither replaces nor supports Tpx in the Px-dependent peroxidase assay (Ceylan et al., 2010). Tb927.7.3500 harbors a mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as a CxxC motif but has not been characterized so far. We included a short description of this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 8C and D. It is noted that &quot;… in cells lacking Tpx, the mitochondrial sensors are still able to respond to exogenously applied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in sharp contrast to the situation in the cytosol.&quot; Indeed, comparison of these graphs with those of Figure 5C and D, right panels shows a different response. However, the response of the non-induced cells (i.e., maintaining Tpx), is apparently quite different and more marked in the case of the mitochondrial sensors. Could it be that cells expressing the mito probes have inherent higher reactivity and resistance to oxidative stress?</p></disp-quote><p>All cell lines expressing the mitochondrial sensors revealed a slightly higher basal OxD, stronger oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and delayed re-reduction when compared to cells harboring the respective cytosolic sensor (compare Figure 7B, D, F with Figure 7B, D, F as well as Figure 5C and D with Figure 8C and D). If the mitochondrial sensors conferred to the cells an inherent higher reactivity and resistance to oxidative stress, one would expect the opposite behavior. Yet, to address this point more explicitly, we treated mito-roGFP2-Tpx-expressing cells and WT parasites with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 3, both cell types displayed an identical sensitivity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
