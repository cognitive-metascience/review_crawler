Linking two sensations that arrive within a split second of one another, such as sound and the feeling of wind, is a type of learning that requires the cerebellum, a region found at the base of the brain. When done in a laboratory setting, this particular form of learning has been dubbed eyeblink conditioning.</p><p>Individuals with autism tend to have difficulties with appropriate matching of different senses. For example, they have trouble identifying a video that goes with a spoken soundtrack. They also do not learn eyeblink conditioning the same way that other individuals do. However, it is not known which circuits in the brain are responsible for their difficulty. Kloth et al. now investigate this issue by asking whether versions of genes that increase the risk of autism in humans also disrupt eyeblink conditioning in mice. They tested five types of mouse model, each with a different genetic mutation that has previously been linked to autism. All five of these mutations cause defects in different cell types of the cerebellum, and all mice have abnormal social and habitual behaviors, similar to autistic people.</p><p>The tests involved shining a bright light at the mice, which was followed, a split second later, by a puff of air that always causes the mice to blink. After this had occurred dozens of times, the mice started to blink earlier, as soon as the light appeared, in anticipation of the puff of air. To test whether the mice had successfully learned to respond to just the bright light, the light was also occasionally flashed without a puff of air.</p><p>Kloth et al. found that the mice generally performed poorly in eyeblink conditioning, although in different ways depending on which cell types of the cerebellum were affected by the genetic mutations. Some mice blinked too soon or too late after the light appeared; others blinked weakly or less frequently; and some did not blink at all. This suggests that autism can affect the processing of sensory information in the cerebellum in different ways.</p><p>This work is important because it demonstrates that a form of split-second multisensory learning is generally disrupted by autism genes. If defects in cerebellar learning are present early in life, they could keep autistic children from learning about the world around them, and drive their developing brains off track. Hundreds of autism genes have been found. Linking these genes to a single brain region identifies the cerebellum as an important anatomical target for future diagnosis and intervention.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In autism spectrum disorder (ASD; hereafter referred to as autism), atypical sensory processing is widely reported starting in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leekam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Markram and Markram, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dinstein et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to early-life abnormal processing of single sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leekam et al., 2007</xref>), more complex deficits become apparent as early as 2 years of age, a time when autistic children attend poorly to natural combinations of spoken stimuli and natural visual motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klin et al., 2009</xref>), a circumstance that calls upon the ability to integrate, from moment to moment, information from two sensory modalities, hearing and vision. Abnormalities of sensory responsiveness are strongly correlated with severity of social phenotypes in high-functioning autism patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hilton et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that abnormal processing of multiple sensory modalities on subsecond time scales might impede the acquisition of cognitive and affective capacities that are affected in autism.</p><p>Abnormal sensory processing in autism is likely to arise in part from genetic mutations and variants that predispose for neural circuit dysfunction. To investigate the ability to associate two near-simultaneous sensory inputs, we used delay eyeblink conditioning, a form of learning that is found in multiple mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ivarsson and Hesslow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Boele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>). Persons with autism show alterations to delay eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sears et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oristaglio et al., 2013</xref>). Delay eyeblink conditioning depends on plasticity in the cerebellum, a common site of anatomical deviation in patients with autism, and cerebellar gross and cellular malformation are common features of autistic brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). These factors led us to search for aberrations in the quantitative parameters of delay eyeblink conditioning.</p><p>Autism is among the most heritable of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaugler et al., 2014</xref>), and hundreds of autism risk loci have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Devlin and Scherer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stein et al., 2013</xref>). We examined five mouse models that both recapitulate mutations that occur in human idiopathic and syndromic autisms and display phenotypes reminiscent of human autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Banerjee-Basu and Packer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahams et al., 2013</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gene.sfari.org">http://gene.sfari.org</ext-link>).

A mouse with an implanted headplate is head-fixed above a stationary foam cylinder, allowing the mouse to locomote freely. Eyeblink conditioning is carried out by delivering an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, airpuff) that coterminates with a conditioned stimulus (CS, LED) to the same eye. Eyelid deflection is measured using induced current from a small magnet affixed to the eyelid. (<bold>B</bold>) When delivered to a trained animal, the co-terminating CS and US produce an anticipatory eyelid deflection (the conditioned response, CR) followed by a reflex blink evoked by the US. When the CS is delivered alone (blue trace), a bell-shaped CR is produced that peaks at the expected time of the US. The onset time is the time from the onset of the CS to a change in concavity of the eyeblink. The rise time is the amount of time between 10% and 90% of the maximum amplitude of the CR (10–90% rise). (<bold>C</bold>) Over twelve training sessions, the CR (portion of trace preceding US, indicated in red) develops in response to the US-CS pairing. One CS-alone response is shown as a blue trace.

The output of clustered PCs (gray) converges onto neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (DCN), which drive downstream neurons in the output pathway.

Information about the aversive US is conveyed through the olivocerebellar loop, consisting of PCs in the cerebellar cortex, the inferior olive, and the DCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, red pathway). This information instructs plasticity in the mossy fiber (mf)—GrC—PC pathway, which conveys incoming CS information. The GrC layer pathway undergoes multiple forms of plasticity, including parallel fiber (PF)-PC long-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carey and Lisberger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), and after training.

Thus, defects in the reliable learning and production of CRs might be interpreted as disruption of the olivocerebellar ‘instruction’ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Garcia et al., 1999</xref>) or the granule cell layer ‘representation’ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arenz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Activity in the GrC network, which receives direct mf input, is thought to represent key temporal components to drive a well-timed response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Medina and Mauk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D'Angelo and De Zeeuw, 2009</xref>).

However, these measures conflate changes in the probability of learning with changes in the amplitude of learned responses. For example, a study that examined de novo (i.e., no previous conditioning) delay eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sears et al., 1994</xref>) found that in high-functioning (average IQ &gt; 100) autistics, the %CR fraction rose more rapidly than in controls, reaching close to a half-maximum after only two blocks of trials. In the direction of loss-of-function, impairments in delay eyeblink conditioning have been observed in Fragile X patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tobia and Woodruff-Pak, 2009</xref>); in this case, PC-specific knockout of the Fragile X protein Fmr1 in mice was sufficient to cause eyeblink-conditioning defects, suggesting that learning was specifically perturbed. For comparison with the work reported here, future human eyeblink-conditioning studies would have to distinguish changes in learning from changes in response amplitude.</p><p>A second promising domain for investigations of ASD patients is eyeblink response kinetics. Variations in response kinetics may depend on the specific genetic background. In idiopathic autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sears et al., 1994</xref>), CRs came approximately 50 ms earlier, as measured using both the time to CR onset and the time to CR peak. Similarly, after two sessions of trace conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oristaglio et al., 2013</xref>), delay conditioning initially leads to a decrease in response onset and latency of approximately 50 ms, followed by a convergence toward normal performance as training continues. In contrast, Fragile X patients show no differences in timing in early training sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tobia and Woodruff-Pak, 2009</xref>), but after average CR amplitude reaches a plateau, the peak latency to CR decreases by approximately 30 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tobia and Woodruff-Pak, 2009</xref>). Changes of 30–50 ms are comparable in size to the effects we have observed in mice with granule cell pathway perturbation. In addition, in a valproate-based rat model of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arndt et al., 2005</xref>), prematurely timed eyeblink responses were found for long interstimulus intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murawski et al., 2009</xref>). In summary, past findings suggest that perturbation of cerebellar granule cell layer activation may be common in both idiopathic and syndromic autism. The general observation of shortened latency is consistent with our findings in <italic>Shank3+/ΔC</italic> mice, suggesting this line as a model for the timing deficits observed in autistic persons.</p><p>Finally, although past measurements have been done in older children post-diagnosis, eyeblink conditioning can be assayed in subjects as young as 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Claflin et al., 2002</xref>).

This specific dissociation (i.e., the absence of correlation with non-cerebellar phenotypes) suggests that cerebellar plasticity and autism's cognitive deficits might be related in some specific manner. The cerebellum arises repeatedly in the study of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In an analysis of gene–phenotype associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meehan et al., 2011</xref>), autism-related genes were found to be associated with a cluster of phenotypes that included social defects, abnormal motor behavior, and cerebellar foliation.

In this context, eyeblink conditioning is an example of learning from the close timing of two events of different sensory modality, and defects in it may reflect broader difficulties in subsecond temporal sensory association.

To ensure that the ages of the mice did not affect the results, we corrected our statistical tests of average CR performance, response probability, and response amplitude across sessions 9–12 and the CR timing parameters, using analysis of covariance tests with age (days) as a covariant with post hoc Tukey's tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Piochon et al., 2014</xref>). This analysis produced no changes in statistical significance of the findings reported throughout this paper (Tukey's test, p &gt; 0.05 in all instances).</p><p>Mice were group-housed (at ≥ 8 weeks of age) and maintained on a 12-hr reverse light–dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Eyeblink conditioning</title><p>Each mouse was head-fixed above a stationary, freely rotating foam wheel, which allowed it to locomote throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this position, the US (airpuff) could be delivered from a consistently to the eye through a blunted 27-gage needle. The eyelid deflection was detected using a Hall effect sensor (AA004-00, NVE Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN) that was mounted above the same eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Koekkoek et al., 2002</xref>). Prior to placement in the experimental apparatus, each mouse was briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and a small neodymium magnet (3 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm, chrome, item N50, Supermagnetman, Birmingham, AL) was attached to the lower eyelid with cyanoacrylate glue (Krazy Glue, Westerville, OH). The sensor provided a readout of eyelid position by linearly converting a change in magnetic field due to the displacement of the magnet relative to the sensor a change in voltage. The CS (ultraviolet LED) was also delivered to the ipsilateral eye.</p><p>The animals were allowed to habituate to this apparatus for at least 195 min over 3–5 days. Following habituation, acquisition training took place over 12 training sessions (1 session/day, 6 days/week), during which the animals received 22 blocks of 10 trials each. CSs (ultraviolet light, 280 ms) were paired with an aversive US (airpuff delivered by a blunted needle to the cornea, 30–40 psi, 30 ms, co-terminating with the CS). Ultraviolet light is in the sensitive range of laboratory mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>). Each block contained 9 paired US-CS trials and 1 unpaired CS trial, arranged pseudorandomly within the block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each trial was separated by an interval of at least 12 s (see below).</p><p>Following acquisition training, the mice received extinction and reacquisition training. Extinction training took place over 4 sessions (1 session/day) consisting of 22 blocks of 10 trials each. Each block contained five unpaired CS trials and five unpaired US trials, arranged pseudorandomly within the block. Reacquisition training took place over 3 sessions, and the animals received the same training sequence as in acquisition training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data processing and analysis for eyeblink conditioning</title><p>Trials were triggered automatically using a custom MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) graphical user interface. Stimuli were triggered by Master-8 (AMPI, Inc., Jerusalem, Israel) via the data acquisition system (National Instruments, Austin, TX). (Scripts for data collection and analysis along with sample data are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/akloth0325/eyeblink-conditioning">https://github.com/akloth0325/eyeblink-conditioning</ext-link>.) The Master-8 controlled the stimulus timing and sent square signals to an ultraviolet LED and a Toohey Pressure System IIe spritzer (Toohey Co., Fairfield, NJ) to generate the CS and US, respectively. The output from the Master-8 was returned to the data acquisition system. The voltage output of the Hall-effect sensor was filtered and amplified (band-pass filtered from 0.01 Hz to 4 kHz, gain adjusted to signal quality) and sent to the data acquisition system.</p><p>The beginning of an individual trial was subject to the following criteria. First, at least 12 s must have elapsed since the last trial. Time was added to the interval between any two consecutive trials according to the stability of the eyelid position signal: if the eyelid position signal (the ‘baseline’ signal) strayed outside an experimenter-determined range during 1 s prior to the planned delivery of the CS, an additional 1 s was added to the intertrial interval until this criterion was met, after which the trial was initiated. The experimenter used the voltage range of UR (baseline to peak) during 3–12 unpaired US trials delivered at the beginning of the session to determine an acceptable voltage range for baseline activity prior to the beginning of each trial; typically, this range was ±10% of the average size of the UR.</p><p>The data from each trial were normalized prior to analysis. For the paired US-CS trials, the eyelid position was normalized to the range between the baseline and the peak amplitude of the UR during the trial. For the unpaired CS trials, the eyelid position was normalized to the range between the baseline and the UR peak for the most recent US-CS trial. Then, the response probability and response amplitude for a single training session were calculated. This normalization scheme yielded results that were not significantly different from those acquired by normalizing to a sessionwide average UR (paired t-tests within groups for CR performance, response probability, and response amplitude on session 12, p &gt; 0.05 in all instances).</p><p>The analysis method was inspired by brain slice recording of single-synapse plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>) to analyze the full range of detectable responses to a CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The peak response size for the period between 100 ms and 280 ms after the onset of the CS was collected for every trial during each session, and a probability distribution was computed from these data. The part of the probability distribution that lay below a peak response size of 0 was considered the ‘non-response distribution’. This part of the distribution plus a reflection of this distribution for a positive peak response size was subtracted from the original probability distribution. The remaining distribution was the ‘response distribution’. The response probability for the given session was the area under the response distribution. The response amplitude was computed as the center of mass for the response distribution. Response timing was analyzed from the unpaired CS trials. The normalized response during the CS scored as a CR if it exceeded 0.15 between 100 ms and 400 ms after the onset of the CS and remained below 0.05 between 0 ms and 99 ms. (Again, trials for which the responses exceeded 0.05 between 0 ms and 99 ms after the onset of the CS were excluded.)</p><p>As sensory and motor tests, motor function was analyzed using unpaired US trials from the first session of training. Peak time, rise time, and onset time were calculated on smoothed individual traces as described above, within 75 ms of US onset. Photic eyelid opening was analyzed during the first session of eyeblink conditioning, during which no conditioned eyeblink was generated. Using the normalized individual eyelid deflection traces, deflections that were more than 5% below the baseline 70–250 ms after the CS onset—but not before—were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Water Y-maze acquisition</title><p>Mice underwent one session of habituation training (1 day), four sessions of acquisition training (the next day), and two sessions of testing (the following day) in a water Y-maze (custom made: 32 cm arms positioned at 120° from one another, made of semitransparent polycarbonate) filled with opaque water (non-toxic white tempera paint was added to achieve opacity). On the habituation day, mice were dropped into 10 cm of water in order to measure their swimming ability. The habituation day consisted of three 60-s trials, each trial starting from one arm of the maze. No platform was hidden beneath the surface of the water during this phase of training. During acquisition, the mice were randomly sorted into leftward-going or rightward-groups; this selection determined in which arm the platform would be hidden beneath the surface of the opaque water for each mouse. For five trials per training session, the mice were dropped into the arm closest to the experimenter and were given 40 s to find the platform. On the following day, the animals underwent two more sessions of the same protocol to test memory. The swimming trajectories of the mice were captured on video and were processed by a custom Python script (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bensondaled/three-chamber">https://github.com/bensondaled/three-chamber</ext-link>) to determine whether the animal found the platform on a given trial. Excursions to the wrong arm of the maze were counted as incorrect. Results were reported the fraction of correct trials to valid trials, where valid trials included all trials on which the animal successfully to swam to either the left or the right arms of the Y-maze.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Gait analysis</title><p>Mice videotaped during two runs along a 100-cm track over a plexiglass surface. Each run was initiated with an airpuff to the hindlimb. Runs were videotaped (iPhone 6, 40 frames/s) from below, and light was sourced from below. After being separated using a custom MATLAB scripts, JPEG stacks were analyzed using FIJI Manual Tracker (LOCI, Madison, WI) for the centroid of each paw. Stance and stride parameters were calculated from four paw centroid trajectories (≥10 strides per run) for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Surgery</title><p>Mice were fitted with a 1′′ × ½′′ × 1/32′′ custom titanium headplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87a">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>). During the surgery, each mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2% in oxygen, 1 l/min, for 15–25 min) and mounted in a stereotaxic head holder (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The scalp was shaved and cleaned, and an incision was made down the midline of the scalp. The skull was cleaned and the scalp margin was kept open with cyanoacrylate glue (Krazy Glue). The center of the headplate was positioned over bregma and attached to the skull with quick-drying dental cement (Metabond, Parkell, Edgewood, NY). Following the surgery, the mice received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (0.1 ml, 50 mg/ml Rimadyl [carprofen, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ]) subcutaneously and were allowed to recover for at least 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tissue processing and analysis</title><p>Tissue from separate groups of mice for each cohort was used to analyze the morphology of the cerebellum.

The brain was extracted and stored at 4°C in 4% formalin in PBS overnight. Then, the brains were split into hemispheres. The hemispheres used for Nissl staining were stored in 0.1% sodium azide in PBS at 4°C until vibratome sectioning. The hemispheres used for immunohistochemistry were prepared for cryosection. These hemispheres were stored in 10% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight and were blocked in a solution of 11% gelatin/10% sucrose.

The cross-sectional area of the soma and the maximum height, maximum width, and the cross-sectional area of the PC dendritic arbor were measured using ImageJ. In addition, the complexity of the PC dendritic arbor was determined using Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sholl, 1956</xref>) using ImageJ; briefly, the number of intersections of the dendritic arbor with concentric circles drawn at 12-μm intervals from the soma was counted (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Spines on the distal dendrites were counted in an unbiased manner from these cells (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The spines on distal dendrites of every fifth branchlet (random starting point) were counted and the dendrite length was measured.</p><p>Brain hemispheres used for immunohistochemistry were sectioned sagittally on a cryotome (−20°C) at a thickness of 30 μm and stored in PBS.

Sections were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:100, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). The sections were mounted on Fisherbrand SuperFrost microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) slides and coverslipped with VectaShield without DAPI (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The sections were imaged at 10× magnification on an epifluorescence microscope and ‘virtual slices’ were constructed from serial images taken by the MicroBrightField software Stereo Investigator.

All pairwise statistical tests were unpaired two-sample t-tests unless otherwise noted. Time course data were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures; main genotype effects were reported regardless of significance, whereas main session effects (which would indicate a learning effect through time) are significant and session × genotype interactions are not significant unless otherwise indicated. When comparing a single measurement across more than two groups, one-way analyses of variance were performed with Bonferroni post hoc tests with planned comparisons.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, and we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes delay eyeblink conditioning in five mouse models of autism spectrum disorder. The authors point out that the cerebellar malformations are characteristic of autism and that this behavioral task depends on the cerebellum. They therefore test whether the mutation of autism linked genes alters the acquisition and execution of conditioned eyeblink responses, and demonstrate that this is indeed the case. On the one hand, one could argue that the results are obvious – if the genes are expressed in cerebellar cells (known) and the gene products have any effects on the neurons that express them (likely) then it is inevitable that changes in eyeblink conditioning will occur. On the other hand, a characterization of the specific deficits is informative, and since there has been resistance among autism experts to acknowledge a role for the cerebellum, it is valuable to gather such survey data to make the case convincingly.</p><p>Overall, the Reviewing editor and referees agreed that this is an interesting, and potentially important study that could have a significant impact among cerebellum and autism researchers. The experiments are for the most part carefully carried out and well-presented.</p><p>However, there were serious concerns about the validity of the conclusions that the authors draw from their data, as well as their presentation of the results. Addressing these concerns will require additional experiments and quantification to strengthen the association with ASD. In particular, they should test whether the severity of social deficits is correlated with severity of impairment in eyelid conditioning – this would significantly strengthen the paper. Also, if eyelid conditioning is a more sensitive assay than other cerebellar tasks, this would provide more support for their central hypothesis. Furthermore, the authors should drop their vague claim that eyelid conditioning is a model for “multisensory learning” deficits in autism. Instead, the authors should be more direct and realistic about the content and limitations of the observations. This involves including more discussion and/or data related to timing deficits or lack thereof and how this relates specifically to literature regarding eyelid conditioning in ASD patients. The Reviewing editor and referees agreed that final acceptance or rejection of the revised manuscript will depend on the outcome of the new experiments.</p><p>1) Is there any cerebellar test which is not multisensory? If so, please indicate which one and then subject one or two mutants to such a task, so as to increase the impact of the association created.</p><p>2) Is there any non-cerebellar test which is not multisensory? If so, please indicate which one and then subject one or two mutants that express the relevant genes in the non-cerebellar regions involved to such a task, so as to increase the impact of the association created. This might create a double dissociation and/or association.</p><p>3) The deficits observed in the mice do not appear to closely resemble those observed in autistic children or adults. Sears et al. reports deficits in appropriate timing of the eyelid responses, but faster learning and larger amplitude CRs in ASD patients. Another study (Oristaglio et al.) in children with ASD also reports timing deficits. The present manuscript does not present much data on timing of CRs, save some very small changes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Instead, the amplitude and probability of the CRs is smaller in some of the mice. It is not clear how to relate these differences to those observed in humans or how they fit with the well-documented role of cerebellar cortex in controlling the timing of CRs. This is a serious concern which needs to be discussed.</p><p>4) Altered gene expression is global in 4 of the 5 mouse models used. Given this, it is unclear how the authors can be sure the deficits are actually due to changes in the cerebellum. Relatively small differences observed in amplitude and probability could have many origins outside of cerebellum. This is a major shortcoming which needs to be addressed, as one of the main motivations of the paper seems to be to approach the problem of understanding the link between cerebellum and ASD.</p><p>5) The phenotypes are mostly relatively subtle, but at the same time compelling in that all ASD mouse models show some deficit. To what extent is the eyeblink test specific for autism? Wouldn't all specific cerebellar tests show some phenotype in the ASD mouse models tested here? Please note that tests like rotarod are not cell specific.</p><p>6) To strengthen the association between cerebellar behavioral deficits and autism, shouldn't the level of the behavioral cerebellar motor deficit be correlated quantitatively to the level of more authentic autistic behavior such as grooming, vocalization, repetitive behavior etc? If there is a positive relation between these levels, the association will be stronger. So please try to provide these correlations at a quantitative level (if necessary by digging into the literature).</p><p>7) Are there mouse mutants that do show cerebellar deficits, but no signs of autism (as described above)? Please indicate and/or show which ones.</p><p>8) Please provide a more detailed description of the precise cellular distribution of the expression of all five genes involved within the entire olivocerebellar system as well as the non-cerebellar regions involved in eyeblink conditioning (e.g. trigeminal and facial nucleus and red nucleus) in the Introduction, Methods or Results section (a table would also be nice), so the reader can better relate the phenotypes later on to the anatomy. The authors already did quite a good job on this point, but it can be made more extensive, which in this case is relevant as the models concern mostly global mutants.</p><p>9) What is the point was of measuring probability in two different ways, first as 15% of the UR and next from the integration of the non-failure distribution? The two analyses did not appear to give statistically different outcomes, and it remains unclear what was gained by the second analysis (or retaining the first analysis). After the description of the method and the report that the data are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, nothing is stated as being learned. What is the purpose of including both?</p><p>10) Results (subsection headed “General eyeblink conditioning defects”): “These findings indicate that delay eyeblink conditioning can be used to further probe defects specific to the initial acquisition of conditioning, a process that requires the cerebellum.” This concluding statement from the primary experiment of manuscript does not make sense. The first half (conditioning can be used to probe conditioning) is tautological, and the second part (cerebellar dependence) was known before the experiments were done. The sentence also doesn't follow logically from the observation that extinction was normal and acquisition was altered. Statements like this give the sense that this is an archival set of measurements that were definitely worth making and may be of value in a deeper investigative context, but that there really are no major insights gained from the work.</p><p>11) It makes sense to measure both response probability and amplitude, since these may reflect different aspects of the learning, but the presentation of the data is bizarre and makes it hard to follow the point. In the subsection headed “Performance differences associated with olivocerebellar pathway perturbations”, it is almost as though another writer took over the paper. The text reverts to explaining the circuit, restates the purpose of the experiments, re-identifies the genes, and re-calls <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. All the data that actually matter in the manuscript are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> (and the raw traces of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are helpful as well as illustrations of data that gave rise to these summaries). The plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> catalogue the defects associated with different genes (useful) but are not interpreted in a way that is particularly compelling. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection comes the conclusion of three of the models, “Taken together, [these] models suggest that Purkinje cell disruption is accompanied by deficits in learning.” This is not a new discovery; it is a confirmation of something long known. It seems the cart is before the horse here; it is plausible that the discovery is that these autism-linked mutations alter the cerebellar circuit sufficiently to affect learning processes known to depend on the cerebellum. That the effect can be localized to Purkinje cells, however, is not convincing.</p><p>12) Ascribing the changes in amplitude in the <italic>MeCP2</italic> and <italic>Shank</italic> mutants to the “mossy fiber pathway,” which means granule and Golgi cells, is not convincing. For <italic>Shank</italic>, given that the protein is expressed in the cerebellum only in granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), any changes in these cells may well contribute to deficits, but why this should affect amplitude specifically is not clearly justified. For the <italic>MeCP2</italic> mutants, the more widespread expression does not make the link to the mossy fiber pathway make sense. Besides, as defined, the mossy fiber pathway is everything downstream from the mossy fibers, which encompasses the full cerebellum. It should also affect Purkinje cell activity, which the authors just said would necessarily affect response probability. A key piece of information missing is what the expression of all proteins is in mossy fibers, which are heterogeneous. Besides, without knowing what the nature of the signals made by Purkinje cells is under the different conditions, these types of conclusions cannot be drawn with certainty (this does not require redoing all the experiments with electrophysiological recordings; just being realistic in the written interpretations).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Cerebellar multisensory learning defects in five mouse autism models” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>The referees appreciated the effort the authors have made to address their concerns and agreed that the manuscript is much improved. However, it was felt that the authors need to go further in order to tone down the rhetoric in the discussion regarding eyelid conditioning representing a model system for multisensory learning. It is also strongly recommended that the authors drop “multisensory” from the title. Detailed suggestions for revision from the three reviewers are below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Job well done. All my major concerns have been addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Though I appreciate the authors' efforts and believe that the data in this paper will be useful for future investigations into the intriguing links between cerebellum and ASD, I still have concerns about the overall significance of the findings as well as the authors’ interpretation. Several other papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murawski et al., 2009</xref>) have already documented deficits in eyelid conditioning in rodent models of autism and related disorders. These include a recent paper in Nature Communications from Piochon et al. (with some of the same authors as Kloth et al.) that documents eyelid conditioning deficits in one of the same mouse lines that is used in the present study. While it is true that the present manuscript shows that eyelid conditioning deficits are common to several different autism models, there doesn't seem to me any compelling pattern or mechanistic explanation for the various deficits that the authors observe in the various models. The facts that (1) the deficits are fairly subtle and vary across the different lines and (2) many of the disrupted genes are expressed outside the cerebellum and/or at multiple sites within the cerebellum make it impossible to link the phenotypes with known models/mechanisms of cerebellar learning. The authors’ attempts to make such links in the Discussion were not convincing.</p><p>I also am still unconvinced that eyeblink conditioning is a paradigm for studying multisensory deficits in autism. The authors state in the Discussion that “Learning that an auditory or visual stimulus predicts some other sensory event is likely to be at the core of how infants gain cognitive capacities. In this context, eyeblink conditioning is unusually interesting because it captures a central component of statistical learning, the close timing of two events. Future research may identify parallels between delay eyeblink conditioning and other forms of learning that rely on the cerebellum.”</p><p>This kind of “statistical learning” is what one imagines is going on in cerebral cortex. For that matter, associating two closely spaced events could occur almost anywhere in the brain via Hebbian plasticity. One thinks about the cerebellum as a structure for supervised learning or learning from error. Virtually all real-life learning is multisensory, so I really don't see the specific connection to the cerebellum. Deficits in cerebellar function may well be playing a special/critical role in autism, as highlighted in Dr. Wang's excellent recent review. The idea of disrupted internal model learning is particularly intriguing in relation to the cerebellum-autism connection. However, I am not convinced by the multisensory learning/eyelid conditioning angle pushed here.</p><p>Another concern voiced in my original review related to the unclear relationship between the eyelid conditioning deficits in mice and those reported previously in individuals with ASD. I appreciate that methodological differences complicate comparisons, but the fact that there is not a close alignment of the animal and human studies remains concerning to me.</p><p>In the first round of reviews one of the reviewers commented that “…statements like this give the sense that this is an archival set of measurements that were definitely worth making and may be of value in a deeper investigative context, but that there really are no major insights gained from the work.” This statement sums up my overall feeling about this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>To my reading, the authors have done a very good job in revising the manuscript. It is much more coherently written, accessible, and complete. The new data lend strength to the interpretations, and the reorganization and rewriting make it much easier to understand the authors' main line of reasoning. The data present a good case for how cerebellar learning is affected in specific ways by autism linked mutations. My comments are mostly minor.</p><p>1) Introduction, first paragraph. “Sensory responsiveness and social symptoms are strongly correlated in high-functioning autism patients.” It is not clear what is meant by “social symptoms” or how they would vary along an axis.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>, please define and explain the red and blue (portions of the) records. I think blue is CS only in a trained animal but it is not explicitly stated.</p><p>3) In the Results, subsection “Normal extinction and reacquisition of conditioned responses”, the authors state: “…eyeblink extinction and savings, two processes ascribed to the deep cerebellar nuclei…”. This statement is inaccurate, probably because it is written as shorthand. Extinction requires the cerebellar cortex (and the whole olivocerebellar loop) as shown in Medina Nores and Mauk 2002 Nature. It is argued that savings results from plasticity in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but re-acquisition of well-timed responses (facilitated by savings) likely requires the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Medina, Garcia and Mauk 2001</xref> J Neurosci). Please edit for accuracy. (Also eyeblinks are not extinguished; conditioned responses are extinguished.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06085.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] However, there were serious concerns about the validity of the conclusions that the authors draw from their data, as well as their presentation of the results.

We have carefully taken their advice into account. We have reorganized the paper to emphasize the results before putting them into the context of cerebellar function. We have also carefully laid out how eyeblink conditioning – as opposed to other assays of motor performance or non-cerebellar learning and memory – can be a useful tool in understanding ASD pathophysiology. As described below, we have performed new experiments suggested by the reviewers and expanded the Discussion to help make this case.</p><p><italic>1) Is there any cerebellar test which is not multisensory? If so, please indicate which one and then subject one or two mutants to such a task, so as to increase the impact of the association created</italic>.</p><p>We performed new gait analysis experiments in three mouse models to evaluate motor performance that is partially influenced by the cerebellum. Importantly, this task does not require the multisensory associative learning that is modeled in delay eyeblink conditioning (although it is true that gait adjustment does require sensory feedback). As the reviewers point out, demonstration of a cerebellar, non-multisensory phenotype that is not affected by ASD-related mutations would strengthen our claim that the defects associated with cerebellar learning are particularly connected to the overall ASD phenotype. We found no significant gait differences in the three models we tested, as described (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we added information from the literature on gait and rotarod to strengthen our point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Is there any non-cerebellar test which is not multisensory? If so, please indicate which one and then subject one or two mutants that express the relevant genes in the non-cerebellar regions involved to such a task, so as to increase the impact of the association created. This might create a double dissociation and/or association</italic>.</p><p>We performed new swimming Y-maze acquisition experiments in three mouse models to evaluate learning and memory in a non-cerebellar task not typically related to ASD dysfunction. As the reviewers point out, demonstration that eyeblink conditioning does not simply represent a global defect in the mechanisms of learning would strengthen our claim that the defects association with cerebellear learning are particularly connected to the overall ASD phenotype. We found no significant swimming Y-maze acquisition differences in the three models we tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we added information on ASD-related cognitive differences in these mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) to further strengthen our point.</p><p><italic>3) The deficits observed in the mice do not appear to closely resemble those observed in autistic children or adults. Sears et al. reports deficits in appropriate timing of the eyelid responses, but faster learning and larger amplitude CRs in ASD patients. Another study (Oristaglio et al.) in children with ASD also reports timing deficits. The present manuscript does not present much data on timing of CRs, save some very small changes shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>.

It is not clear how to relate these differences to those observed in humans or how they fit with the well-documented role of cerebellar cortex in controlling the timing of CRs. This is a serious concern which needs to be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is important to evaluate the potential clinical relevance of our findings. We have included two new paragraphs in the Discussion on this point (“Comparison with eyeblink conditioning phenotypes in autistic persons”). We have closely analyzed the sparse literature on eyeblink conditioning in ASD patients. While the literature does point out differences between our results and the clinical results – for instance, gains in learning function in ASD patients and loss of learning function in Fragile X patients, compared with loss of learning function in our mouse models – we believe that there are important limitations to the existing clinical studies. We explore these limitations in the Discussion, and suggest ways in which our results might inform expansion of the clinical ASD eyeblink conditioning literature.</p><p>Finally, we note that the changes we have observed are quite comparable in magnitude to published findings from human subjects. In particular, differences in latency-to-CR-onset are in the same range as human literature. This is now discussed in the subsection headed “Comparison with eyeblink conditioning phenotypes in autistic persons”.</p><p><italic>4) Altered gene expression is global in 4 of the 5 mouse models used.

We have added new discussion to examine how dysfunction of extracerebellar areas might account for our findings (“Extracerebellar sites”). At the same time, we also point out how cerebellar cell-type specificity in two of our models, <italic>L7-Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Shank3ΔC</italic>, strengthens the cerebellar nature of findings with respect to ASD.</p><p><italic>5) The phenotypes are mostly relatively subtle, but at the same time compelling in that all ASD mouse models show some deficit. To what extent is the eyeblink test specific for autism? Wouldn't all specific cerebellar tests show some phenotype in the ASD mouse models tested here? Please note that tests like rotarod are not cell specific</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that eyeblink conditioning requires specific justification. This is now done, and as mentioned in our response to major point #1, we now provide information about other phenotypes that have partial cerebellar involvement (gait and rotarod) to emphasize our point about eyeblink conditioning: gross motor performance does not map to brain circuitry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), or to ASD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), with the precision of our delay eyeblink conditioning data. Furthermore, in the Discussion (second paragraph) we explore the advantages of using eyeblink conditioning as a probe of cerebellar function.</p><p><italic>6) To strengthen the association between cerebellar behavioral deficits and autism, shouldn't the level of the behavioral cerebellar motor deficit be correlated quantitatively to the level of more authentic autistic behavior such as grooming, vocalization, repetitive behavior etc? If there is a positive relation between these levels, the association will be stronger. So please try to provide these correlations at a quantitative level (if necessary by digging into the literature)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the sentiment behind this question. However, assays of grooming, ultrasonic vocalization, and social deficits vary between labs, making it difficult to make even a rank-order comparison. Despite this difficulty, we did collect what information we could. We now supply extensive information about the ASD phenotypes from the literature, including the direction and the significance of the results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We suggest that a qualitative point stands out: delay eyeblink conditioning is the one non-cognitive phenotypes that correlate strongly with cognitive and social deficits. This strengthens the specificity of the link between cerebellar learning and ASD function (end of Discussion, “The cerebellum in cognition and autism”).</p><p><italic>7) Are there mouse mutants that do show cerebellar deficits, but no signs of autism (as described above)? Please indicate and/or show which ones</italic>.</p><p>This possibility has been explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galliano et al. (2013)</xref>. In their experiments, they find no such link, putting it seemingly at odds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tsai et al. 2012</xref>, as well as our own findings. We discuss contrasts among these studies that might be resolved in the future (in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “The cerebellum in cognition and autism”).</p><p><italic>8) Please provide a more detailed description of the precise cellular distribution of the expression of all five genes involved within the entire olivocerebellar system as well as the non-cerebellar regions involved in eyeblink conditioning (e.g. trigeminal and facial nucleus and red nucleus) in the Introduction, Methods or Results section (a table would also be nice), so the reader can better relate the phenotypes later on to the anatomy. The authors already did quite a good job on this point, but it can be made more extensive, which in this case is relevant as the models concern mostly global mutants</italic>.</p><p>In the Discussion, we provide a more extensive description of the involvement of extracerebellar areas in this phenotype (“Extracerebellar sites”). We also provide additional information about gene expression in these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) What is the point was of measuring probability in two different ways, first as 15% of the UR and next from the integration of the non-failure distribution? The two analyses did not appear to give statistically different outcomes, and it remains unclear what was gained by the second analysis (or retaining the first analysis). After the description of the method and the report that the data are in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, nothing is stated as being learned. What is the purpose of including both</italic>?</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to focus on only one method of analysis.</p><p><italic>10) Results (subsection headed “General eyeblink conditioning defects”): “These findings indicate that delay eyeblink conditioning can be used to further probe defects specific to the initial acquisition of conditioning, a process that requires the cerebellum.” This concluding statement from the primary experiment of manuscript does not make sense. The first half (conditioning can be used to probe conditioning) is tautological, and the second part (cerebellar dependence) was known before the experiments were done. The sentence also doesn't follow logically from the observation that extinction was normal and acquisition was altered. Statements like this give the sense that this is an archival set of measurements that were definitely worth making and may be of value in a deeper investigative context, but that there really are no major insights gained from the work</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have reorganized the Results section to remove such statements. We now use the Discussion section to show how the data fit into a framework of cerebellar function.</p><p><italic>11) It makes sense to measure both response probability and amplitude, since these may reflect different aspects of the learning, but the presentation of the data is bizarre and makes it hard to follow the point. In the subsection headed “Performance differences associated with olivocerebellar pathway perturbations”, it is almost as though another writer took over the paper. The text reverts to explaining the circuit, restates the purpose of the experiments, re-identifies the genes, and re-calls</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>. All the data that actually matter in the manuscript are in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref> <italic>(and the raw traces of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are helpful as well as illustrations of data that gave rise to these summaries). The plots of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref> <italic>catalogue the defects associated with different genes (useful) but are not interpreted in a way that is particularly compelling. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection comes the conclusion of three of the models, “Taken together, [these] models suggest that Purkinje cell disruption is accompanied by deficits in learning.” This is not a new discovery; it is a confirmation of something long known. It seems the cart is before the horse here; it is plausible that the discovery is that these autism-linked mutations alter the cerebellar circuit sufficiently to affect learning processes known to depend on the cerebellum. That the effect can be localized to Purkinje cells, however, is not convincing</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. As mentioned in major point #10, we have reorganized the Results and Discussion sections to avoid the problem described by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>12) Ascribing the changes in amplitude in the</italic> MeCP2 <italic>and</italic> Shank <italic>mutants to the “mossy fiber pathway,” which means granule and Golgi cells, is not convincing. For</italic> Shank<italic>, given that the protein is expressed in the cerebellum only in granule cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>), any changes in these cells may well contribute to deficits, but why this should affect amplitude specifically is not clearly justified. For the</italic> MeCP2 <italic>mutants, the more widespread expression does not make the link to the mossy fiber pathway make sense. Besides, as defined, the mossy fiber pathway is everything downstream from the mossy fibers, which encompasses the full cerebellum. It should also affect Purkinje cell activity, which the authors just said would necessarily affect response probability. A key piece of information missing is what the expression of all proteins is in mossy fibers, which are heterogeneous. Besides, without knowing what the nature of the signals made by Purkinje cells is under the different conditions, these types of conclusions cannot be drawn with certainty (this does not require redoing all the experiments with electrophysiological recordings; just being realistic in the written interpretations)</italic>.</p><p>We now describe more extensively the possible involvement of these genes in mossy fiber-granule cell function and put this in the context of basic research on granule layer function. We discuss the limits to the interpretability of our evidence in the Discussion (in the subsection headed “Putative substrates for performance defects: the granule cell pathway”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The referees appreciated the effort the authors have made to address their concerns and agreed that the manuscript is much improved. However, it was felt that the authors need to go further in order to tone down the rhetoric in the discussion regarding eyelid conditioning representing a model system for multisensory learning. It is also strongly recommended that the authors drop “multisensory” from the title. Detailed suggestions for revision from the three reviewers are below</italic>.</p><p>We thank the three reviewers and two editors for their detailed attention to our manuscript. In the revised manuscript we respond to all remaining comments. Specifically, the word “multisensory” no longer appears in the manuscript. In addition, we have rewritten the last paragraph of Discussion to get away from the multisensory concept, which we agree was too broad.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Though I appreciate the authors' efforts and believe that the data in this paper will be useful for future investigations into the intriguing links between cerebellum and ASD, I still have concerns about the overall significance of the findings as well as the authors’ interpretation. Several other papers (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62"><italic>Koekkoek et al., 2005</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82"><italic>Murawski et al., 2009</italic></xref><italic>) have already documented deficits in eyelid conditioning in rodent models of autism and related disorders. These include a recent paper in Nature Communications from Piochon et al. (with some of the same authors as Kloth et al.) that documents eyelid conditioning deficits in one of the same mouse lines that is used in the present study. While it is true that the present manuscript shows that eyelid conditioning deficits are common to several different autism models, there doesn't seem to me any compelling pattern or mechanistic explanation for the various deficits that the authors observe in the various models. The facts that (1) the deficits are fairly subtle and vary across the different lines and (2) many of the disrupted genes are expressed outside the cerebellum and/or at multiple sites within the cerebellum make it impossible to link the phenotypes with known models/mechanisms of cerebellar learning. The authors’ attempts to make such links in the Discussion were not convincing</italic>.</p><p>We disagree strongly. It was by no means a foregone conclusion that we would discover delay eyeblink conditioning deficits in every model that had ASD-like phenotypes. We have also demonstrated several types of dissociation (for which we are grateful to the reviewers for suggesting we do). We are now confident that our findings are significant and nontrivial.</p><p><italic>I also am still unconvinced that eyeblink conditioning is a paradigm for studying multisensory deficits in autism. The authors state in the Discussion that “Learning that an auditory or visual stimulus predicts some other sensory event is likely to be at the core of how infants gain cognitive capacities. In this context, eyeblink conditioning is unusually interesting because it captures a central component of statistical learning, the close timing of two events. Future research may identify parallels between delay eyeblink conditioning and other forms of learning that rely on the cerebellum</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>This kind of “statistical learning” is what one imagines is going on in cerebral cortex. For that matter, associating two closely spaced events could occur almost anywhere in the brain via Hebbian plasticity. One thinks about the cerebellum as a structure for supervised learning or learning from error. Virtually all real-life learning is multisensory, so I really don't see the specific connection to the cerebellum. Deficits in cerebellar function may well be playing a special/critical role in autism, as highlighted in Dr. Wang's excellent recent review. The idea of disrupted internal model learning is particularly intriguing in relation to the cerebellum-autism connection. However, I am not convinced by the multisensory learning/eyelid conditioning angle pushed here</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the cerebral cortex is a prime suspect for engaging in statistical learning. However, to our knowledge it is unknown whether the information processing that supports such learning is performed entirely by one brain region, or distributed in some manner across brain regions. We have rewritten the last paragraph of Discussion to remove the word “multisensory” and to link the work to temporally precise associative learning. We have also removed “multisensory” from the Title and the rest of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Another concern voiced in my original review related to the unclear relationship between the eyelid conditioning deficits in mice and those reported previously in individuals with ASD. I appreciate that methodological differences complicate comparisons, but the fact that there is not a close alignment of the animal and human studies remains concerning to me</italic>.</p><p>In response to the original review, we added a thorough discussion of human eyeblink conditioning. We pointed out areas that require future experiments, and concluded that “past findings suggest that perturbation of cerebellar granule cell layer activation may be common in both idiopathic and syndromic autism, with impacts that vary by specific genotype and disease model.” We have now added text to make an explicit mouse-vs-human comparison. The text appears in the subsection headed “Comparison with eyeblink conditioning phenotypes in autistic persons”.</p><p><italic>In the first round of reviews one of the reviewers commented that “…statements like this give the sense that this is an archival set of measurements that were definitely worth making and may be of value in a deeper investigative context, but that there really are no major insights gained from the work.” This statement sums up my overall feeling about this paper</italic>.</p><p>In the face of this, we thank the reviewer for his/her willingness to provide a vigorous critique.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) Introduction, first paragraph. “Sensory responsiveness and social symptoms are strongly correlated in high-functioning autism patients.” It is not clear what is meant by “social symptoms” or how they would vary along an axis</italic>.</p><p>Reworded to reflect the original Hilton et al. paper.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B, 1C</italic></xref><italic>, please define and explain the red and blue (portions of the) records.

This statement is inaccurate, probably because it is written as shorthand. Extinction requires the cerebellar cortex (and the whole olivocerebellar loop) as shown in Medina Nores and Mauk 2002 Nature. It is argued that savings results from plasticity in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but re-acquisition of well-timed responses (facilitated by savings) likely requires the cerebellar cortex (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76"><italic>Medina, Garcia and Mauk 2001</italic></xref> <italic>J Neurosci).
