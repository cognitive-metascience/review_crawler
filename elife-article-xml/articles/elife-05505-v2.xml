While such capacity deteriorates with age in mammals, it remains intact in species such as salamanders, which have an extensive repertoire of regeneration and can undergo multiple episodes through their lifespan. Here we show that, surprisingly, there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration, but that rapid and effective mechanisms of senescent cell clearance operate in normal and regenerating tissues. Furthermore, the number of senescent cells does not increase upon repetitive amputation or ageing, in contrast to mammals. Finally, we identify the macrophage as a critical player in this efficient senescent cell clearance mechanism. We propose that effective immunosurveillance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo regeneration throughout their lifespan.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05505.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05505.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05505.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As humans and other mammals get older, they become less able to recover from injury or repair damage to their tissues. This happens because mammalian cells gradually lose the ability to divide to produce new cells. This process is called senescence and it helps to prevent cancer by stopping old cells that are more likely to carry harmful mutations from replicating. However the link between senescence and many age-related declines in human health has led scientists to ask whether targeting senescent cells might be one way to treat age-related conditions.</p><p>Some organisms can regenerate their tissues throughout their lives; and creatures like salamanders are even able to re-grow limbs and organs if they are lost. Scientists are eager to learn how these animals are able to do this when humans are not, and answering this and related questions might help us to develop therapies that boost our ability to recover from injury or age-related diseases.</p><p>Yun et al. took a closer look at senescence in salamanders and unexpectedly found that a large number of senescent cells appeared in a salamander limb as it regenerates. But, by the time the limb had completely regrown, these senescent cells had disappeared. Further experiments revealed that when normal and senescent cells are implanted into a salamander the senescent cells also quickly disappear.</p><p>These findings suggest that senescent cells may possibly play a role in the regeneration process, and that salamanders have a system that can efficiently destroy these cells. Previous research had suggested that parts of the immune system, in particular cells called macrophages, help to eliminate senescent cells in some tissues. Yun et al. found that macrophages did accumulate around senescent cells in the regenerating limbs of living salamanders. And when a toxin was used to destroy the macrophages in some salamanders, the senescent cells were not cleared in the way they were in salamanders with active macrophages. Hence, macrophages are an essential part of the mechanism that eliminates senescent cells from salamander tissues.</p><p>This efficient mechanism for the elimination of senescent cells could explain how salamanders are able to maintain their ability to regenerate in spite of ageing. These findings also reveal the salamander as a model system that could be used to find new ways to target senescent cells, which could be eventually used in anti-ageing therapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05505.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05505.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>salamander</kwd><kwd>newt</kwd><kwd>axolotl</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Programme Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brockes</surname><given-names>Jeremy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>UCL - Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VIP award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Maximina H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davaapil</surname><given-names>Hongorzul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Senescent cells are recurrently induced during limb regeneration in salamanders and subsequently eliminated by a highly efficient mechanism of macrophage-dependent surveillance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular senescence was previously identified as a process that permanently halts the proliferation of normal cells in culture following replicative exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</xref>). It subsequently became clear that cellular senescence is a stress response that acts both in culture and in vivo to prevent proliferation of cells exposed to oncogenic stress, such as telomere attrition, and various types of DNA damage and oncogene insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008</xref>). It therefore acts as an effective anti-tumourigenic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collado et al., 2005</xref>). However, senescent cells can also have detrimental effects on biological processes. Long-term accumulation of senescent cells leads to disruption of tissue structure and function, possibly through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campisi et al., 2011</xref>). This is particularly relevant in the context of ageing, as in most species there is a marked accumulation of senescent cells with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have uncovered a causative link between cellular senescence and age-related deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2013</xref>), underscoring the therapeutic benefits of targeting senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Deursen, 2014</xref>), and establishing cellular senescence as a hallmark of ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Otin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, the ability to regenerate tissues declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>). The decline in muscle regeneration with age has recently been linked to the loss of quiescent stem cells through senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, other vertebrates, such as zebrafish and salamanders, are able to accomplish perfect regeneration of a wide range of complex structures throughout their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Margotta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azevedo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itou et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore possible that these organisms exhibit mechanisms to curtail cellular senescence, thus allowing them to undergo indefinite rounds of regeneration. However, the occurrence and regulation of cellular senescence during regeneration have not been addressed in such regeneration-competent species. Here, we analysed the process of cellular senescence in salamanders. Our results demonstrate that cellular senescence is a recurrent process during salamander limb regeneration, and is subject to a highly efficient mechanism of macrophage-dependent elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the occurrence of cellular senescence in the salamander system, we first adapted and validated reagents that allow the identification of senescent cells in cell culture and tissue sections. Cellular senescence is a mechanism that irreversibly arrests the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shay and Roninson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi, 2005</xref>), and is triggered upon DNA insults such as UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi, 2011</xref>). We therefore exposed A1 salamander limb cells to UV, while stabilising the level of p53, which is required for the induction of senescence in certain mammalian contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Up to 80% of the irradiated cells entered a state of cell cycle withdrawal within 12 days that, in contrast to quiescence, was accompanied by high levels of Gadd45 expression, permanent Î³H2AX foci, and high levels of senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²gal), a hallmark of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâF</xref>). The timing of SA-Î²gal induction in salamander cells is similar to that reported in mammalian fibroblasts undergoing stress-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parrinello et al., 2003</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05505.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterisation of cellular senescence in salamander cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol for the induction of cellular senescence in salamander cells.

Furthermore, the cells identified by the SA-Î²gal staining exhibit other markers of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi, 2005</xref>) such as sustained production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extended mitochondrial and lysosomal networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>) relative to non-senescent parallel cultures. In addition, these cells acquire a secretory phenotype comprising a number of cytokines, signalling and matrix remodelling factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). It is nothworthy that many of these factors, such as the interleukins IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-13, IL-7, IFNÎ³ (Interferon gamma), TNF-Î± (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha), M-CSF (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor), the matrix metelloproteases MMP1, 3 and 9, uPA (urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator) and Cathepsin D, have been previously reported to integrate the senescence-associated phenotype (SASP) in various contexts of mammalian senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">CoppÃ© et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the regulation and properties of the senescent state are comparable in salamanders and mammals.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration</title><p>In order to determine whether cellular senescence occurs in vivo within normal and regenerating salamander tissues, we adapted the SA-Î²gal staining to detect senescent cells within salamander tissues and addressed whether senescence occurs during limb regeneration in an adult salamander, the newt (<italic>Notophthalmus viridescens</italic>).

In addition, recent evidence suggests that there is an extensive recruitment of immune cells, and in particular macrophages, to the regenerating limb in salamanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, we decided to investigate if the macrophage was part of the senescence clearance mechanism. In vivo labelling using TMR-dextran, which is specifically internalised by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâC</xref>), as well as monocyte specific Î±-naphthyl acetate esterase staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), reveal that macrophages and senescent cells are found in close proximity within regenerating limbs, suggesting cell-to-cell contact and engulfment in some cases. To determine whether macrophages mediate the clearance of senescent cells, we took advantage of an efficient method for macrophage depletion, based on the intravenous administration of selectively toxic, clodronate salt-filled liposomes (clodrosomes). These are internalised specifically by macrophages via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010</xref>) and have been shown to operate effectively in salamanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). We found that treatment with clodrosomes is able to reduce the macrophage population by fivefold, compared with control DiI liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As with the TMR-dextran, these liposomes are specifically internalised by macrophages, as shown by their incorporation into cells expressing F4/80, a specific macrophage marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morris et al., 1991</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We therefore used this system to induce systemic macrophage depletion in salamanders prior to the implantation of senescent or normal nGFP+ cells in contralateral regenerating limbs, and followed the fate of the implanted cells with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At 20 hr post implantation, we observed a strong accumulation of DiI-labelled macrophages in the vicinity of senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâF</xref>). In contrast, macrophage recruitment to areas of normal cells (control) was not significantly different from their recruitment to other areas of the limb mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>). At 2 weeks post implantation, the normal cells remained within the regenerating limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). However, the senescent cells were cleared in animals injected with control DiI liposomes, but remained in animals whose macrophages had been depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This demonstrates that the macrophage is critical for clearance of senescent cells, and constitutes the first evidence for senescence surveillance mechanisms that operate during normal regeneration.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05505.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Macrophages are recruited to senescent cells within salamander tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of axolotl limbs and gills, 24 hr after i.v. injection of TMR-dextran -left panels- or PBS -right panels-.

Our study demonstrates that a robust macrophage-dependent surveillance mechanism operates in normal and regenerating tissues of adult salamanders, and this allows them to circumvent the negative effects associated with the long-term accumulation of senescent cells, such as the disruption of tissue structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodier and Campisi, 2011</xref>). These surveillance mechanisms are particularly significant for limb regeneration because there is a notable induction of cellular senescence during this process. Consistent with this, recent reports show that systemic macrophage depletion during salamander limb regeneration leads to defects in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). This has also been observed during zebrafish fin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, cellular senescence has been recently shown to contribute to the decline in muscle regenerative ability upon ageing in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>). In light of these observations, we propose that the effective immune clearance of senescent cells in salamanders supports their ability to undergo multiple rounds of regeneration through their lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05505.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A simplified model for the induction and clearance of senescent cells during salamander regeneration.</title><p>Salamander cells are induced (by as yet unidentified stimuli) during regeneration and accumulate within the blastema. They produce a range of secreted molecules (SASPs) which affect their microenvironment and could contribute to different aspects of the regeneration process such as matrix remodelling, vascularisation, growth and patterning. As regeneration proceeds to more advanced stages, senescent cells are cleared by an efficient mechanism of macrophage dependent immunesurveillance, which results in a regenerated limb devoid of senescent cells. This allows for the possibility of multiple rounds of regeneration through lifespan as well as avoiding the disadvantages of senescent cell accummulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05505.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05505.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05505-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The mechanisms underlying the induction of senescent cells and their clearance, for example the involvement of other immune cell types in their surveillance, constitute an important outstanding issue. The analysis of these problems has been limited by lack of reagents, as well as cellular and molecular tools for in vitro modelling of senescent-immune cell interactions as well as gain or loss-of-function approaches to evaluate induction and clearance of endogenous senescent cells. Further progress in this area will enable the exploration of these important matters.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is interesting that we find a consistent induction of cellular senescence during regeneration, suggesting that this could be integral to the mechanism. Senescent cells could play a positive role during regeneration, a proposal that is consistent with recent findings that senescence contributes to tissue remodelling during mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munoz-Espin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campisi, 2014</xref>) and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krizhanovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun and Lau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, senescent cells could contribute to regeneration indirectly, by promoting the efficient recruitment of macrophages, since the latter have been shown to promote tissue remodelling and patterning in various contexts, including regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lobov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian and Pollard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). In either case, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype is likely to play an important role. These are important issues that merit further examination.</p><p>It has recently been suggested that targeting senescent cells could lead to therapeutic strategies for age-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Deursen, 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), three reviewers, and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers raised a number of concerns that will have to be addressed before publication can be envisaged. This will require further experimentation as well as modifications to the text.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The finding that senescent cells are present in regenerating salamander tissue and that they are cleared by macrophages, with lack of persistence both after repeated injury or on ageing, is of interest, although cell senescence and macrophage clearance have been reported previously in the context of wound healing. To consolidate the results and provide more mechanistic insight the authors should address the following issues:</p><p>1) The authors use the concept that since there are no EdU positive cells that are also SA-Î²gal positive, then the senescent cells must be cleared by macrophages. However, the investigators fail to mention or consider that if there was a SA-Î²gal positive cell that incorporated EdU then the SA-Î²gal staining would go away. This needs to be addressed very carefully, since this is a central point in the manuscript.</p><p>Related to this, it is not clear from the text if the transplanted senescent cells are also expressing a fluorescent marker; it seems not. If not, it would be better to have experiments tracking the senescent cells with an independent marker such as RFP. As it stands, although unlikely, cells could be reversing the senescence and losing B-gal expression rather than being cleared from the blastema.</p><p>2) The authors should consider depleting macrophages from salamanders using the technique they described, then induce regeneration and provide quantitative data on Î²gal positive cells with time in a real animal. Do the numbers of senescent cells still disappear in macrophage depleted animals similarly to salamanders with macrophages?</p><p>What happens in vitro when salamander A1 senescent cells are mixed with macrophages?</p><p>3) Many immune processes are dependent on macrophages and there are several different cells types that could have been examined. The lack of molecular mechanisms of the pathways from senescent cells to them being cleared is a serious weakness.</p><p>That both normal and senescent cells are cleared but with a different time course suggests the mechanisms of clearance may be more complex than the investigators claim.</p><p>4) It is disappointing that the investigators did not attempt to identify what is secreted by the senescent cells? Is it the same SASP factors as demonstrated in mammals? This would have added some mechanistic information to the study.</p><p>Also, nothing is detailed about the mechanism of how senescent cells can induce senescence in normal cells.</p><p>5) The role of paracrine-senescence is poorly investigated and does not contribute significantly to the paper. The fact that it can be induced is clear, as has been reported in a number of other papers (Acosta et al., Nature Cell Biol, 2013 reference is missing). And this could help to explain how the co-injection of senescent cells with normal cells favors the removal of the normal. However, it could as easily be that the senescent cells simply recruit immune cells to the site of injection, which then remove any exogenous cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> suggests that paracrine senescence may contribute, but this should be quantified to show this is the mechanism.</p><p>Furthermore, it is claimed that senescent cells are found in clusters in the spleen because of a paracrine-senescence effect. It is more likely that senescent cells injected in one site are being removed to the spleen, and this is why they appear in âclustersâ. Such claims should be experimentally validated.</p><p>6) The use of UV as an irreversible senescence inducer is not robust. UV treatment of mammalian cells (depending on the dose) results in cell repair or death. UV induces p53 and a variety of different types of DNA strand breaks, and depending on the dose, many cells can repair and survive. Almost nothing is mentioned about a dose curve for these experiments. If the investigators use a dose that induces senescence but is reversible (low doses) do the cells clear similarly to normal or senescent cells.</p><p>7) It appears that senescence can only be induced in salamander cells by the stabilization of p53, but this is completely omitted from the Discussion. This is confusing, given that the same group has recently shown that down regulation of p53 correlates with the timing of senescence induction (Yun et al., PNAS 2013). In addition, nutlin treatment impairs limb regeneration if treated at the blastema stage, but increased it at the regeneration phase.</p><p>Given the importance of p53 in the regulation of senescence and their previous paper, this needs more detailed explanation.</p><p>8) The fact that there is an increase in senescence with wounding is well established in other studies (Jun and Lau, Nature Cell Biology, July 2010; Krizhanovsky et al., Cell, 2008), as is the fact that senescent cells are cleared by macrophage-mediated removal (Xue et al., Nature, 2007; Krizhanovsky et al., Cell, 2008; Kang et al., Nature 2011). These papers should be cited.</p><p>9) Most figures need better explanation in the text, describing exactly what was done, and in enough detail to follow. The figure legends similarly need more detail.</p><p>Many figures and experiments also lack quantification and controls. While the result can be taken at face-value as a description of what was observed, more detail would make the data much more convincing.</p><p>E.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> needs control staining of non-senescent cells to show these markers of senescence are increased under these conditions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it is quite difficult to see the senescent cells and where they are located. Higher resolution images, with some reference to localization/distribution are needed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the transplanted senescent cells should also be GFP positive to track their disappearance (see 1).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05505.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors use the concept that since there are no EdU positive cells that are also SA-Î²gal positive, then the senescent cells must be cleared by macrophages.

As it stands, although unlikely, cells could be reversing the senescence and losing B-gal expression rather than being cleared from the blastema</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that there are two possible explanations for the disappearance of SAbgal senescent cells: their active clearance, or the reversal of the senescent state. These two possibilities can be distinguished with the use of retrovirally labelled nGFP+ senescent cells. Therefore, we have incorporated a full set of experiments, tracing the clearance of senescent cells genetically labeled with nGFP. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the rate of clearance of nGFP+ senescent cells corresponds to the rate of clearance of unlabelled senescent cells, providing conclusive evidence that senescent cells are indeed cleared from salamander tissues. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We have incorporated a sentence covering this point in the subsection headed âEfficient surveillance of senescent cells in adult salamander tissuesâ.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should consider depleting macrophages from salamanders using the technique they described</italic>, <italic>then induce regeneration and provide quantitative data on Î²gal positive cells with time in a real animal. Do the numbers of senescent cells still disappear in macrophage depleted animals similarly to salamanders with macrophages?</italic></p><p>We welcome the reviewersâ suggestion, which we have indeed considered. At present, it is not possible to carry out the experiment suggested by the reviewers, as macrophages are essential for regeneration and the blastema will not develop upon macrophage depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>What happens in vitro when salamander A1 senescent cells are mixed with macrophages?</italic></p><p>This is an interesting suggestion. However, we cannot currently address this due to a lack of methods to study the macrophage-senescent cell interaction in the salamander context (we have tested senescent cells-total blood cultures, however the blood elements are highly reactive; we are now trying to successfully sort and culture macrophages in order to study this critical interaction).</p><p><italic>3) Many immune processes are dependent on macrophages and there are several different cells types that could have been examined. The lack of molecular mechanisms of the pathways from senescent cells to them being cleared is a serious weakness</italic>.</p><p>We strongly agree with the reviewers that elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the clearance of senescent cells is paramount. We have set out to address this from an early start, but faced the difficulties of working with a system that is not as well developed as human or mice. Indeed, the characterization of the immune system of the salamander is still in its infancy, with only a couple of reports published so far, and a serious lack of reagents to study it. The present study is concerned to establish that the surveillance process operates in regenerating and normal salamander tissues, but, if reagent developments allow, further studies will focus on the mechanisms that underlie this important process.</p><p><italic>That both normal and senescent cells are cleared but with a different time course suggests the mechanisms of clearance may be more complex than the investigators claim</italic>.</p><p>We do not agree with this last statement. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, all cells suffer from an initial reduction in numbers (likely due to a combination of the implantation method, tissue integration and accessibility to nutrients) however normal cells clearly persist while senescent cells are actively removed (with a half-life of 9 days).</p><p><italic>4) It is disappointing that the investigators did not attempt to identify what is secreted by the senescent cells? Is it the same SASP factors as demonstrated in mammals? This would have added some mechanistic information to the study</italic>.</p><p><italic>Also, nothing is detailed about the mechanism of how senescent cells can induce senescence in normal cells</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that adding a characterization of the SASPs would enrich the study, as it may shed light into the way senescent cells affect their own clearance and their environment, as shown by the pioneering work of the Campisi lab and others. Therefore, we have incorporated this analysis to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, based on a combination of human cytokine and protease arrays (although with the limitation that many non-conserved factors could not be evaluated as they result in negative reads). We show that senescent salamander cells secrete many factors, which have been reported to be secreted by mammalian senescent cells in various contexts (as SASPs differ between different species, cell types and modes of senescence). Note additional Methods and Results.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of paracrine senescence, we cannot speculate at this point which factors are responsible for such effect, as this requires an extensive analysis. It is possible that TGF-Î², which has been shown to mediate paracrine senescence in a mammalian context (as shown by the Gil Lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2013</xref>), is implicated. Certainly, our experiments suggest that a secreted factor is involved. However, this is an issue that merits further investigation.</p><p><italic>5) The role of paracrine-senescence is poorly investigated and does not contribute significantly to the paper. The fact that it can be induced is clear, as has been reported in a number of other papers (Acosta et al., Nature Cell Biol, 2013 reference is missing). And this could help to explain how the co-injection of senescent cells with normal cells favors the removal of the normal. However, it could as easily be that the senescent cells simply recruit immune cells to the site of injection, which then remove any exogenous cells.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4F</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that paracrine senescence may contribute, but this should be quantified to show this is the mechanism</italic>.</p><p>We do not share the reviewersâ view on our dataset on the paracrine effect, as our data clearly demonstrates, by various means, that salamander cells are able to induce senescence in normal cells in a paracrine fashion (using similar assays to those commonly used within the field). This constitutes a valuable insight regarding the conservation of this aspect of cellular senescence in salamanders (particularly as this is the first thorough characterisation of senescence in the amphibian branch of the animal kingdom). Furthermore, as recommended by the reviewer, we have incorporated a quantification of the % SAbgal+/nGFP+ cells after co-implantation of control (nGFP+) and senescent (nGFP-) cells. The results suggest that, indeed, paracrine senescence does contribute to the clearance of this mixed population (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), providing an explanation for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the missing reference, which has now been incorporated.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, it is claimed that senescent cells are found in clusters in the spleen because of a paracrine-senescence effect.

Such claims should be experimentally validated</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an issue that merits further exploration.

If the investigators use a dose that induces senescence but is reversible (low doses) do the cells clear similarly to normal or senescent cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now incorporated an additional condition for implantation: nGFP cells treated with a low UV dose (1J/m2) which leads to &lt;15% senescence induction (which results in persistence of nGFP cells within the limb, much like nGFP control cells). Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) It appears that senescence can only be induced in salamander cells by the stabilization of p53, but this is completely omitted from the Discussion. This is confusing, given that the same group has recently shown that down regulation of p53 correlates with the timing of senescence induction (Yun et al., PNAS 2013). In addition, nutlin treatment impairs limb regeneration if treated at the blastema stage, but increased it at the regeneration phase</italic>.</p><p><italic>Given the importance of p53 in the regulation of senescence and their previous paper, this needs more detailed explanation</italic>.</p><p>During regeneration, p53 is indeed downregulated during blastema formation (excluding the first 48h), however its activity comes down 3-fold from high levels in normal tissues (In contrast, the levels of p53 activity are very low in A1 cells). Furthermore, p53 is still functional during regeneration (we show in our PNAS paper that complete inhibition of p53 impairs regeneration, suggesting that p53 activity, albeit lower than in normal libs, is present during the critical stages that coincide with senescent induction). Finally, it is important to note that the measurements of p53 activity in regeneration represent the average of p53 activity in the entire structure, while in the case of senescent cells one is only looking at a minority population (&lt;10%). Hence, the conditions during regeneration are not inconsistent with an environment permissive for p53- induced senescence.</p><p><italic>8) The fact that there is an increase in senescence with wounding is well established in other studies (Jun and Lau, Nature Cell Biology, July 2010; Krizhanovsky et al., Cell, 2008), as is the fact that senescent cells are cleared by macrophage-mediated removal (Xue et al., Nature, 2007; Krizhanovsky et al., Cell, 2008; Kang et al., Nature 2011). These papers should be cited</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing this to our attention. We have incorporated the additional missing references (Kang et al. was already present in the original manuscript).
