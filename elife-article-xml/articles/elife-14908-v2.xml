Deletion of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, induces CNS axon regeneration through the activation of PI3K-mTOR signaling. We have conducted an extensive molecular dissection of the cross-regulating mechanisms in axon regeneration that involve the downstream effectors of PI3K, AKT and the two mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). We found that the predominant AKT isoform in CNS, AKT3, induces much more robust axon regeneration than AKT1 and that activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of GSK3β are two critical parallel pathways for AKT-induced axon regeneration. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of T308 and S473 of AKT play opposite roles in GSK3β phosphorylation and inhibition, by which mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 negatively regulate axon regeneration. Thus, our study revealed a complex neuron-intrinsic balancing mechanism involving AKT as the nodal point of PI3K, mTORC1/2 and GSK3β that coordinates both positive and negative cues to regulate adult CNS axon regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14908.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14908.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14908.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The central nervous system consists of the neurons that make up the brain and spinal cord. An important part of a neuron is the long, slender projection along which electrical signals travel, called the axon. In the central nervous system of mammals, damaged axons cannot regrow, which is why spinal injuries or optic nerve injuries can result in life-long neuronal deficits.</p><p>Recent studies have found that activating a particular signaling pathway in central nervous system neurons causes their axons to regenerate. A key protein in this pathway is called AKT. Several signaling cascades are triggered by AKT to regulate cell survival and growth, but it was not known how the different branches of the AKT pathway are involved in axon regeneration.</p><p>Miao, Yang et al. have now investigated AKT’s role in axon regeneration using a range of approaches to manipulate signaling in damaged mouse neurons. This revealed that a particular form of AKT (called AKT3) causes damaged axons to regenerate to a greater extent than other forms of this protein. This response depends on two parallel pathways: one in which AKT3 activates a protein complex called mTORC1, and one where AKT3 inhibits a protein called GSK3β. In addition, another protein complex called mTORC2, which is closely related to mTORC1, helps to inhibit the activity of AKT3 on GSK3β and hence inhibits axon regeneration.</p><p>These findings reveal that a complex balancing mechanism, with AKT at its center, coordinates the many signals that regulate axon regeneration. Future studies into this system could ultimately help to develop new treatments for brain and spinal injuries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14908.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14908.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>mTORC2</kwd><kwd>GSK3</kwd><kwd>optic nerve</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY023295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY024932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#85700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Linqing</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Liu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinase AKT acts as a nodal point that coordinates both positive and negative cues to regulate the regeneration of central nervous system axons in adult mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Injuries of mature central nervous system (CNS) axons result in loss of vital functions due to the failure of CNS axons to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldberg et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitch and Silver, 2008</xref>). We and other investigators have found that the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by the deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) induces CNS axon regeneration through the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). PI3K is a lipid kinase, which can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and subsequently phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in the lipid membrane to produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub> in turn recruits AKT, a member of the AGC family of serine/threonine kinases, to the membrane to be activated by phosphorylation at T308 via phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that converts PIP<sub>3</sub> to PIP<sub>2</sub>, and thus inhibits the activation of downstream effectors of PI3K. The PI3K-AKT pathway is the main effector by which RTKs promote cell survival and growth in response to growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song et al., 2012a</xref>). One of the multiple AKT downstream effectors is the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2), the negative regulator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Thus AKT activation removes the inhibition of TSC and activates mTORC1. The PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway is a master regulator of protein synthesis and cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The two best characterized substrates of mTORC1 have been suggested as mediators of mTORC1’s prominent roles in regulating cell growth, size, proliferation, motility and survival. One of these is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs); their phosphorylation releases inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and initiates cap-dependent translation. The other is the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks); their phosphorylation is critical for mRNA biogenesis, translation initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</xref>). Phosphorylation of ribosome protein S6 (pS6) by S6K has often served as a marker for mTORC1 activation. Interestingly, S6K also functions as feedback inhibition of RTK/PI3K signaling, which balances mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radimerski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Um et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Both 4E-BP inhibition and S6K activation promote protein synthesis, but 4E-BPs act specifically to control cell proliferation (cell number) and S6Ks preferentially regulate cell growth (cell size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dowling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohanna et al., 2005</xref>). We previously reported that, although S6K1 activation, but not 4E-BP inhibition, is sufficient for axon regeneration, 4E-BP inhibition is necessary for PTEN deletion-induced axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Phosphorylation and inhibition of another AKT substrate, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), is critical for neuronal polarization, axon branching and axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2011b</xref>). However, how GSK-3β regulates peripheral axon regeneration is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saijilafu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gobrecht et al., 2014</xref>) and its function in CNS axon regeneration remains to be determined.</p><p>Although the mechanism is unclear, PI3K also activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) in a ribosome-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zinzalla et al., 2011</xref>), which in turn phosphorylates AKT at S473 (pS473) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hresko and Mueckler, 2005</xref>). pS473 enhances phosphorylation of AKT-T308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheid et al., 2002</xref>), and inhibition of S473 phosphorylation by destroying mTORC2 decreases AKT-T308 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hresko and Mueckler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guertin et al., 2009</xref>). mTORC2 is involved in cell survival and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>) and, like mTORC1, plays a role in lipogenesis and adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamming and Sabatini, 2013</xref>). It is not clear how these two mTOR complexes interact to determine multiple cellular events, and this information is particularly lacking for axon regeneration.</p><p>AKT appears to be the nodal point that acts as the key substrate of both PI3K-PDK1 and PI3K-mTORC2, and is also the critical upstream regulator of mTORC1 and GSK3β. By exploiting the anatomical and technical advantages of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the crushed optic nerve (ON) as an in vivo model, we elucidated the important roles of AKT, mTORC1/2 and GSK3β in adult CNS axon regeneration. Understanding this cross-regulating mechanism should provide promising therapeutic targets for CNS injuries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three AKT isoforms display different effects on axon regeneration and RGC survival</title><p>To determine the role of AKT in axon regeneration, we generated adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vectors containing Myr-3HA-AKT1, 2 and 3 to express membrane-bound constitutively active forms of HA-tagged AKTs in vivoWe and other investigators have demonstrated a specific tropism of AAV2 for RGCs after intravitreal injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We made AAV2-AKT viruses containing triple mutant capsid (Y444, 500, 730F) to take the advantage of the high RGC transduction efficiency of capsid-mutated AAV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petrs-Silva et al., 2011</xref>): transduction exceeded 80% of RGC, based on the ratio of HA (transgene tag) to Tuj1 (antibody for RGC marker, β-III tubulin) positive cells in flat-mount retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also confirmed that all three isoforms of AKT produced the expected changes in RGCs: significantly increased levels of pAKT-S473 and pS6 (mTORC1 activation marker), indicating activation of AKT and mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, note that pAKT-T308 antibody did not effectively immunostain retina). Western blot analysis of retina lysates showed comparable expression of AKT isoforms (HA levels), but levels of pT308 and pS6 were significantly higher in retinas transfected by AKT3 than by AKT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This difference indicates the greater activity of AKT3 in retina. We noticed that both pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473 antibodies can only be used to detect AKT1 and AKT3 reliably in Western blot, whereas the pAKT2-S474 specific antibody readily detected p-AKT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14908.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of three constitutively active AKT isoforms in RGCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of flat-mounted retinas showing co-labeling of HA tag, Tuj1, pAKT-S473 and their merged images, and pS6 in a separate retina sample.

RGC axons that regenerated through the lesion site were labeled anterogradely by intravitreal injection of the tracer Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin β (CTB), and imaged and quantified in ON longitudinal sections at 2 weeks post-crush (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the three isoforms of AKT elicited different patterns of axon regeneration: AKT2 and AKT3 caused significantly more axon regeneration than AKT1; AKT2 induced the longest axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The differing capabilities of the three isoforms of AKT in axon regeneration could not be explained simply by their expression levels, which HA staining showed to be comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The higher pT308 and pS6 levels and more potent axon regeneration induced by AKT3 suggest that its function in retina differs from those of AKT1 and AKT2. Similar to their effects on axon regeneration, all three isoforms increased RGC survival to more than 40% based on Tuj1 staining in retinal flat-mounts, at least a 1-fold increase over WT mice; and significantly more RGCs survived in mice injected with AAV-AKT3 than with AKT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

This contradicts the common theme that phosphorylation of both T308 and S473 is additive to AKT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhaskar and Hay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheid et al., 2002</xref>).

We injected AAV-AKT3 and AAV-Cre together into one eye of <italic>Rictor</italic> floxed mice and compared ON regeneration to that elicited by the injection of AAV-AKT3 alone into the contralateral eye. Consistent with our AKT3-S472A result, AKT3 and <italic>Rictor</italic> KO produced even more extensive and lengthier axon regeneration than AKT3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This was not due to an additive effect because <italic>Rictor</italic> KO alone did not cause any axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but presumably through inhibition of S473 phosphorylation. Indeed, both immunostaining and Western blot analysis confirmed that AKT3-S472A mutant and <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion significantly decreased pS473 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,F</xref>). The enhanced axon regeneration was not due to increased expression of AKT3, which was slightly decreased in <italic>Rictor</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). It was also not due to enhanced activation of AKT or mTORC1, because levels of pT308 and pS6 were also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E,G</xref>). This is consistent with the positive effect of pS473 on T308 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hresko and Mueckler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guertin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheid et al., 2002</xref>).

Indeed, regenerating axons were more numerous and longer in <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO mice injected with AAV-AKT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), indicating incomplete inhibition of GSK3β by WT AKT3 and/or AKT-independent GSK3β activity, which acted additively with AKT-dependent GSK3β activity on axon regeneration.

In fact, even though expression of AKT3 was also lower in <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO mice, axon regeneration was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).

In contrast to AKT1 and AKT2, which are widely expressed, AKT3 is the predominant isoform in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Easton et al., 2005</xref>). Deletion of AKT1 reduces whole body size and deletion of AKT2 results in diabetes-like syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2001b</xref>). Deletion only of AKT3 specifically reduces brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Easton et al., 2005</xref>), indicating a specific role of AKT3 in regulation of CNS growth. Interestingly, AKT2 and AKT3, but not AKT1, regulate survival and growth of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diez et al., 2012</xref>). Our analysis of the expression levels of the three AKT isoforms in RGCs and their distinct roles in axon regeneration provides additional in vivo evidence of the unique properties of AKT3 in CNS: AKT3 activation promotes significantly greater RGC survival and ON regeneration than AKT1, presumably through its unique ability to activate mTORC1 (higher pS6) in retina. This is also true in brain as AKT3 KO, but not AKT1 deletion, decreases pS6 significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Easton et al., 2005</xref>). AKT3 may also selectively activate unknown, neuronal-specific signaling molecules. The partial functional redundancy of AKT isoforms, however, makes identification of these molecules difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dummler and Hemmings, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We found that mTORC1 inhibition (<italic>Rptor</italic> or <italic>Mtor</italic> deletion, S6K1-DN or 4E-BP1-4A over-expression) decreased AKT3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Decreased AKT3 by itself may not account for reduced axon regeneration, however, because the remaining amounts enabled RGCs to survive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease in AKT3 contributed to the reduced axon regeneration, we consider the significant decreases in mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis to be the main reason for the inhibition of axon regeneration. This notion receives additional support from our observation of other conditions in which axon regeneration was enhanced despite downregulation of AKT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), which suggests that high levels are not required for axon regeneration. Based on our previous demonstration of the necessary role of 4E-BP and S6K1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>),we therefore conclude that mTORC1 is critically important for axon regeneration and that the effects on axon regeneration are due to the signaling alterations, rather than to the changed levels of AKT expression per se.</p><p>Our observation of enhanced axon regeneration by AKT3-S472A mutant and <italic>Rictor</italic> KO suggests that pS473 either inhibits phosphorylation of T308 directly or allows AKT to activate distinct substrates that are different from those of pT308, which are inhibitory for axon regeneration. Our finding that pS473 enhances, rather than inhibits, phosphorylation of T308, implies that different substrates or differentially regulated substrates by pT308 and pS473, must contribute to the difference in axon regeneration. The inhibitory effect of mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 on GSK3β phosphorylation is striking and very interesting. The significantly increased pGSK3β-S9 after blocking mTORC2 and S473 phosphorylation suggests that GSK3β is one of the AKT effectors that are differentially regulated by pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473. Although previous in vitro study showed unchanged GSK3β phosphorylation after <italic>Rictor</italic> KO and reduced S473 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>), the liver or muscle-specific <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion increases GSK3β phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). The results of our studies using GSK3β-S9A mutant and <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO mice provide additional evidence of the inhibitory role of GSK3β in axon regeneration and definitively resolve the contradictory information in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saijilafu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gobrecht et al., 2014</xref>). In vitrokinase assay will be necessary to definitively demonstrate the roles of pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473 in GSK3β-S9 phosphorylation, We have shown that pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473 regulate the inhibition and phosphorylation of retinal GSK3β in opposite directions. This process acts in parallel with another AKT downstream effector, mTORC1, to regulate CNS axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, downstream effectors that are specific to mTORC2-pAKT-S473 but not to pAKT-T308 have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>), consistent with the notion that pAKT-S473 regulates β-cell proliferation whereas pAKT-T308 controls β-cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The balance between pro-regeneration pT308 and anti-regeneration pS473 forms of AKT appears to be critical. Our observation that <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion induces more potent axon regeneration with a smaller decrease in pS473 and pT308 than AKT3-S472A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) may indicate a better therapeutic strategy for manipulating AKT signaling to promote axon regeneration. It is also worth noting that, because <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion did not totally block AKT-S473 phosphorylation, other kinases in addition to mTORC2 may contribute in retina. Moreover, because other kinases have been suggested to phosphorylate GSK3β-S9 in addition to AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsujio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2001</xref>), it will be important to investigate whether these kinases are also regulated by mTORC2 in a similar way as AKT.

But we and others did not find that increased neuron survival was invariably linked to proportionately greater axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benowitz et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with findings in other systems. For example, most corticospinal neurons exhibit long term survival after transection in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nielson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2011</xref>), but they fail to regenerate axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldberg et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitch and Silver, 2008</xref>). The 20% of RGCs that normally survive ON crush in mice can be increased significantly by inhibition of apoptosis, deleting tumor suppressor genes or by manipulating ER stress pathways, but these manipulations do not necessarily induce ON regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldberg et al., 2002a</xref>). This observation indicates that axon regeneration requires neuronal intrinsic growth stimulators that are distinct from neuronal surviving factors. Thus we consistently found that, although manipulation of mTOR complexes and GSK3β significantly changed axon regeneration, RGC survival induced by AKT remained the same. We could not exclude the possibility that changing RGC survival contributed to a change in axon regeneration, but no convincing evidence proves a direct causative relationship between these two events. The available evidence, therefore, supports the idea that the intrinsic signaling events after AKT activation and the involvement of its upstream or downstream signaling effectors are directly related to intrinsic growth control of neurons, and that these signaling pathways are distinct from or overlap only partially, signaling necessary for survival. There are far fewer regenerating axons than surviving RGCs, however, suggesting that only a small percentage of RGCs are regenerating and different subtypes of RGCs have different regeneration abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2015</xref>). In-depth understanding of the mechanisms of this difference will be required to maximize RGC axon regeneration.</p><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the importance of localized protein synthesis in peripheral axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Willis and Twiss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry and Fainzilber, 2014</xref>). Intra-axonal translation has recently been demonstrated in mature mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baleriola et al., 2014</xref>) and, more intriguingly, certain mRNA species and additional components of translation machinery, including pS6 and 4E-BP1, have been detected in regenerating axons in rat spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalinski et al., 2015</xref>). Since we also observed that regeneration-promoting WT AKTs and AKT-S473A mutant were localized in ON whereas non-regeneration AKT mutants were excluded from ON, it will be very intriguing to investigate the significance of axonal AKT activation in CNS axon regeneration, especially its effect on axonal protein synthesis.</p><p>In summary, our genetic manipulations in RGCs have established that the activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of GSK3β are two critical pathways downstream of AKT that act in parallel and synergistically to promote CNS axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The opposite effects of mTORC1 and mTORC2 on axon regeneration suggest that a balancing mechanism exists downstream of the critical growth-promoting signal PI3K and that AKT integrates both positive and negative signals through phosphorylation of T308 and S473 and their specific roles in downstream effectors mTORC1 and GSK3β to control CNS axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, mTORC1/S6K also functions as feedback inhibition of PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>), which also balances AKT activation and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).

The supernatant was collected and incubated at 4°C for 4 hr with 10 µg mouse HA antibody, after which 400 μl Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies, Frederick, Maryland) were added and incubation continued at 4°C overnight. Dynabeads were washed three times for 10 min with high salt buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 300 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and 100 μg/ml Cyclohexamide in RNase-free H2O) before RNA extraction with RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). About 200ng total RNA generated from each group was used for RNA-seq, which was done at the University of Pennsylvania Next-Generation Sequencing Core. Briefly, Ribo-IP RNA samples from three biological replicates went through polyA selection before the generation of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total Kit and quality assessment with Agilent BioAnalyser and Kapa BioSystems Library Quant Kit. Pooled libraries that have been individually labeled were sequenced to 100 bp reads from one end of the insert using a HiSeq2000 sequencer. Each library acquired about 25 million reads and 93% of total reads aligned to unique genes in the mouse genome (UCSC mm9) by RUM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grant et al., 2011</xref>). The 'raw' data (reads per transcript) were quantile normalized within groups with quantile normalization (GCRMA) to remove non-biological variability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as means ± s.e.m and Student’s t-test was used for two-group comparisons and One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

The Reviewing Editor for your submission was Nahum Sonenberg and the Senior Editor was K VijayRaghavan. Please note the suggested changes indicated by reviewers #1 and 2 below. If you wish to make these changes, please let us know and we will be happy to consider a final version without returning the manuscript to the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have addressed the majority of my concerns. They include quantification of protein expression levels as well as quantification of axon regeneration with different manipulations. The new findings included with the RiboTag mice and the localization of Akt in the axon are interesting. Overall, the manuscript reads better in its revised form, and the observations are presented in a more convincing way.</p><p>One control that is important for the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> is to show the levels of these Akt isoforms/mutants in the cell bodies by western blotting of the corresponding retinas. It is essential to show that the absence of signal in the axon is not due to lower expression levels in the cell body.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is overall much improved from its original submission. The changes made in response to the reviewers’ comments have clarified a number of issues. I appreciate the authors including the RGC survival data throughout the work – I think that strengthens the manuscript quite a bit and supports the authors' conclusions for role of AKT3→Torc1 in regeneration. While there certainly are many instances where injured neurons survive but do not regenerate, I do not know of anywhere they regenerate in the absence of survival, Despite the improvement, I think there are a remaining few points of confusion and ambiguity in the data that the authors overlook in interpreting the work. Many of these could be addressed with text changes and some additional controls in the figures.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> there is a remarkable increase in pAKT2-S474 with the myr-AKT2 overexpression. One has to wonder if this is just different affinity between pS474 and pS473 antibodies? However, more concerning is that the authors indicate that transduced myr-AKT3 affords greater regeneration and the endogenous AKT3 is predominant over AKT2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that transduced myr-AKT2 provides as good or better regeneration activity than AKT3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> shows quite prominent ISH signals and immunoblotting signals for all three isoforms. Granted the RNA-seq data from RGCs shows different loading of AKT1-3 on ribosomes, but I do not think the authors can dismiss the data on regeneration with transduced myr-AKT2 and expression of endogenous AKT2 as they have. This does not detract from the manuscript's findings, but I think the authors should not be misrepresenting their data to the reader (e.g., sentence “The higher pT308 and pS6 levels and more potent axon regeneration induced by AKT3 suggest that its function in retina differs from those of AKT1 and AKT2” is not valid).</p><p>The increased regeneration of AKT-S472A vs. WT noted for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> only appears to be significant for 500 µm distance. Perhaps the authors should note that the remainder show a trend.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “mTORC1 and its downstream effectors are essential for AKT3-induced axon regeneration”, the authors describe the decreased AKT3 expression with S6K-DN and 4E-BP1-4A expression suggesting that the low level of AKT3 is sufficient for (survival) function in the retina. Decrease in AKT3 is also seen for RICTOR KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> but not described. For both of these situations, I think the authors need to be clear that they are referring to levels of the transduced AKT3 not endogenous. Also the authors should indicate that this could reflect a direct effect on protein synthesis as they imply in the aforementioned paragraph, but could also be secondary to altered levels of viral transduction. Both here and in the subsection “GSK3β deletion alone is sufficient for axon regeneration and also acts synergistically with mTORC1 and AKT”, the authors should clarify that they are referring to AKT3 executing a survival function in the cell body rather than distinguishing between soma and axon intrinsic actions of AKT3. Speculation on this difference is more appropriate for the Discussion as the authors have included in this revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have made a comprehensive response to each of the points raised by the reviewers. Most of the points have been fully addressed.</p><p>I do not have any further comments.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;mTORC1 Is Necessary But mTORC2 and GSK3β Are Inhibitory For AKT3-Induced CNS Axon Regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The authors investigated the signaling pathways playing a role in retinal axon regeneration. It was previously shown that PTEN deletion promotes axon regeneration. Here, the authors study Akt isoforms, mTOR complexes 1 and 2, and downstream S6K and 4EBP using the same in vivo assay. They conclude that Akt3 more than other Akt isoforms is sufficient for regeneration. Similarly, RAPTOR and mTOR are necessary and RICTOR is inhibitory for Akt3-mediated regeneration. Finally, GSK3β and mTORC1 appear to be parallel pathways contributing to retinal axon regeneration.</p><p>Overall, the experiments probe an important gap in our understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that mediate retinal axon regeneration. These intrinsic signaling mechanisms likely play a role not only downstream of PTEN deletion but possibly other regeneration-inducing treatments as well. We are turning this paper down because a thorough and complete addressing of the major concerns will take time, and, when done, will result in a substantively different manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Miao et al. investigate the signaling pathways playing a role in retinal axon regeneration.

The authors convincingly show that membrane targeted AKT proteins increase regeneration, with AKT2 and 3 driving higher levels of growth than AKT1. The differential effects of mTORC1 vs. mTORC2 are intriguing and, if true, have important implications for efforts in the field to augment CNS regeneration using activation of AKT→mTor pathway. Likewise, differential activity of AKT3PT305 vs. AKT3PS472 is a novel finding and a potential advance. Overall, the authors conclude that AKT3PT305→GSK3βPS9 and mTORC1→4EBP1/S6K support CNS axon regeneration while mTORC1→AKT3PS472 blocks or antagonizes axon regeneration. However, I am not convinced that the authors have proven these conclusions.</p><p>RGC death following axotomy is well established and the authors indicate that introduction of the AKTmyr isoforms increased RGC survival roughly two fold over non-transduced animals/eyes. The authors sporadically mention survival differences in the text, but show no other data beyond <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Looking over the post-crush retina images, there is quite variable Tuj1 staining in the supplemental figures. For example, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 shows markedly different numbers of Tuj1+ cells comparing AKT3 only vs. additional AKT3 + raptor KO, S6K-DN, 4EBP1S4A(?) &amp; mTOR KO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> similarly shows differences in RGC numbers with Tuj1 staining comparing the varying combinations. Considering that the authors only show naïve retina images for the AKT3 mutants and Rictor-KO, I have a very difficult time dissociating regeneration and survival based on the data presented. Obviously, the RGCs need to survive after axotomy to regenerate, but I have concern that some of the decreased regeneration here may relate to differences in survival with the AKT, mTOR, and GSK3β manipulations. The authors need to provide quantitative data for survival across these manipulations and offer clear evidence that effects are regeneration rather than RGC survival to support their conclusions. Going along with this, some of the supplemental data should likely be included in the regular figures for the manuscript.</p><p>Similar to the above issue with survival images, the immunoreactivity for pS6K and pGSK3β varies substantially across the same supplemental images and the authors seem to cherry-pick the relevance of these variations.</p><p>With the exception of Figure 1—figure supplement 1, the authors do not show any data on wild-type retina/optic nerve. Considering that <italic>eLife</italic> presumably targets a general readership (i.e., rather than selectively neuroscience), the authors need to include data on wild-type animal responses – or better yet, rodents transduced with a control AAV2.</p><p>The authors' conclusion that T305 and S472 phosphorylation have distinct outcomes for regeneration is quite intriguing. The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> suggests that mTORC2 has a more direct effect on attenuating axon regeneration than antagonizing phosphorylation of AKTT473. If this is the case, then why would the RICTOR KO have no effect on regeneration by itself? Also, when the authors claim that no axon regeneration was detected in mTOR KO, RAPTOR KO, RICTOR KO, against what are the comparisons being performed? It would be useful to see the quantitation of this growth compared to both control viral transduction and wild type AKT3 – likewise, quantitation of the axon growth with the varying AKT3 mutants should be shown.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the anti-phospho-AKTT308 does not recognize AKT3PT305, as I think that distinguishing an intramolecular inhibition of T305 phosphorylation vs. indirect mechanisms (including intermolecular between AKT proteins) is an important distinction to make. I do not think it is necessarily needed for the current manuscript, but it would be good to know what efforts the authors made to detect AKT3PT305 as positive data could strengthen the authors' case.</p><p>From the work here, as well as previous observations from this group, it is not clear if the effect of modulating the AKT→mTor pathway is mediated in the perikaryon, locally in the axons/growth cones, or both. With increasing evidence for localized protein synthesis in regenerating axons and recent work showing mRNAs and translational machinery (including the mTORC1 targets studied here) in regenerating CNS axons, the authors should acknowledge the possibility of localized effects. The images for HA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that AKTmyr isoforms are localizing into at least the proximal axons. Do these also extend to the distal regenerating axons? This also raises the question of whether the regenerating axons shown with CTB labeling are also HA positive (i.e., for those animals expressing AKT isoforms).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper looks at AKT and GSKβ effects on regeneration in the optic nerve, assigning roles to various components of the signaling pathway.</p><p>1) The authors state at the beginning that they achieved 90% transduction of ganglion cells, but do not appear to have measured this routinely in each case. 90% transduction over the whole retina is difficult to achieve. Moreover, some of the illustrations suggest that the transduction rate is rather more variable and somewhat lower in some of the animals.</p><p>2) The increased regeneration is similar to the increase in neuronal survival in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Is the increase in axon number a reflection of increase of ganglion cell numbers?</p><p>3) The combined effect of active AKT and GSKβknockout in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> appears to be a significant and robust effect, which is certainly interesting.</p><p>4) The effects of the various manipulations 2 and 3 are not large, and would be vulnerable to variable levels of transduction.</p><p>5) The reagents used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> have overall effects on protein synthesis.

We thank Reviewer 1 for bring up this insightful request, quantification of expression levels of HA-tagged AKT isoforms/mutants and quantification of cell signaling alterations. We now provide this information, which we believe has substantially improved the manuscript. We realized that immunostaining of flat-mount retina is not sufficient to evaluate subtle differences in expression and alterations in signaling and that this technique will only detect an effect that is very dramatic (all or none). Therefore, we performed Western blots of retina lysates for all the conditions that we studied and quantified the HA-tag levels of AKT isoforms/mutants and signaling (phosphorylation levels of AKT-T308, S473, S6 and GSK3β-S9). We will provide more detail in our responses to individual questions below, but our overall conclusion is that the effects on axon regeneration are indeed due to gene manipulations and corresponding signaling alterations, rather than to different levels of expression of exogenous constructs. Consistent with Reviewer 1’s prediction, these additional Western blot studies significantly enhanced the reliability of our results and therefore the impact of our study. More importantly, the new experiments revealed several new findings. The most significant of these is that: pAKT-T308 and mTORC2-pAKT-S473 differentially regulate GSK3β-S9 phosphorylation, through which axon regeneration is oppositely controlled by pAKT-T308 and mTORC2-pAKT-S473.</p><p><italic>1) If the authors are going to refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> in the Introduction, I suggest that they move it to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is best not to have a model figure in the middle of the paper and we no longer refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> in the Introduction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> now stands by itself as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and serves as a summary/model in the last part of the paper, as is customary for most reports.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: The authors need to quantify expression levels of HA-tagged AKt isoforms.

In addition, because anti-pAKT-T308 antibody works well in Western blot, whereas it worked poorly in immunostaining, we were able to find that pAKT-T308 and pS6 are higher in AKT3-retina than AKT1-retina; immunostaining had not definitively revealed this difference before. However, because neither anti-pAKT-T308 nor anti-pAKT-S473 antibodies do not recognize AKT2 well in Western blots, it is difficult to compare AKT2 phosphorylation levels with AKT1 and AKT3. We thank Reviewer 1 for recommending a more reliable antibody for pS6; we repeated all the immunostaining and Western blots of pS6 with phospho-S6 S240/244 antibody, as Reviewer 1 suggested.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: same criticism as above. Needs quantification of Akt mutants and phospho-S6 at Ser 240-244.</italic></p><p>We performed Western blots to show comparable expression levels of HA-tagged AKT3 WT and AKT3 mutants in retina and decreased levels of pS6 in the AKT3 mutants (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: It is especially important in this figure to know what the expression levels of Akt3 exogenous construct is in each of these conditions.

As Reviewer 1 predicted, mTORC1 inhibition (RAPTOR or mTOR deletion, S6K1-DN or 4E-BP1-4A over-expression) did decrease AKT3 expression as shown by HA levels in Western blot. However, we argue that the decreased AKT3 may not be the reason for decreased axon regeneration, or at least not the sole reason, because the decreased AKT3 did not affect its function in RGC survival, indicating that the level of AKT3 is enough to execute its neuronal function in RGC. Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that the decreased AKT3 contributes to the decreased axon regeneration, we consider the significant decrease in mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis to be the main reason for the inhibition of axon regeneration. Consistent with this notion, there are other circumstances in which even though the AKT3 level is downregulated (AKT3 in RICTOR KO or GSK3β KO mice), axon regeneration is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). These findings also support the idea that the level of AKT3 that can induce axon regeneration is not extremely high.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: similar concerns as above. The authors need to show and quantify the expression levels of Akt3 expression constructs in 4B, E and F.</italic>The original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and we include the quantification of AKT3 expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also observed decreased HA-AKT3 expression after co-expression of GSK3β-S9A mutant or deletion of GSK3β. We don’t know the explanation of this inhibition; it may be due to the mixed-injection of two kinds of AAVs. Again, the decreased AKT3 did not affect RGC survival and showed opposite effects on axon regeneration, depending on activation or inhibition of GSK3β. Thus we conclude that the effects on axon regeneration are due to the signaling alterations, rather than to the level of AKT expression per se.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: In this short research report, Miao et al. focus on differential regulation of AKT→mTor pathways for CNS axon regeneration using an optic nerve crush model. The authors convincingly show that membrane targeted AKT proteins increase regeneration, with AKT2 and 3 driving higher levels of growth than AKT1. The differential effects of mTORC1 vs. mTORC2 are intriguing and, if true, have important implications for efforts in the field to augment CNS regeneration using activation of AKT→mTor pathway. Likewise, differential activity of AKT3PT305 vs. AKT3PS472 is a novel finding and a potential advance. Overall, the authors conclude that AKT3PT305→GSK3βPS9 and mTORC1→4EBP1/S6K support CNS axon regeneration while mTORC1→AKT3PS472 blocks or antagonizes axon regeneration. However, I am not convinced that the authors have proven these conclusions.</italic>We appreciate Reviewer 2’s recognition that the findings are “intriguing” and the potential “important implications” of the “novel finding”.

We had collected all the RGC survival data in every condition that we tested for axon regeneration, but we did not present it in the previous version, because we wanted to save space and because we do not consider RGC survival to be a decisive factor for axon regeneration, based on our previous experience and the available literature. We now present all the quantitative RGC survival data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We regret the confusing Tuj1 staining in the original figures.

However, the level of RGC survival does not seem to correlate with the degree of axon regeneration in many of the conditions that we studied. We now include a paragraph in the Discussion which reads:</p><p>“Apparently, neuronal survival is a prerequisite for axon regeneration. But we and others did not find that increased neuron survival was invariably linked with proportionately greater axon regeneration (Benowitz et al. 2015). […] There are far fewer regenerating axons than surviving RGCs, however, suggesting that only a small percentage of RGCs are regenerating and different subtypes of RGCs have different regeneration abilities (Duan et al. 2015). In-depth understanding of the mechanisms of this difference will be required to maximize RGC axon regeneration.”</p><p><italic>Similar to the above issue with survival images, the immunoreactivity for pS6K and pGSK3β varies substantially across the same supplemental images and the authors seem to cherry-pick the relevance of these variations.</italic></p><p>We agree with Reviewer 2’s opinion about the inadequacies of immunostaining experiments and we have included Western blot quantification data, which are more convincing and relevant.

It would be useful to see the quantitation of this growth compared to both control viral transduction and wild type AKT3 – likewise, quantitation of the axon growth with the varying AKT3 mutants should be shown.</italic>We regret not making it clear that we consider that there is no axon regeneration when the phenotype is similar to WT mice. We now provide data, including WT optic nerve after crush injury in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, to show the no axon regeneration phenotype of AKT3 mutants and mTOR/RAPTOR/RICTOR deletion and the quantification data.</p><p><italic>It is unfortunate that the anti-phospho-AKTT308 does not recognize AKT3PT305, as I think that distinguishing an intramolecular inhibition of T305 phosphorylation vs. indirect mechanisms (including intermolecular between AKT proteins) is an important distinction to make. I do not think it is necessarily needed for the current manuscript, but it would be good to know what efforts the authors made to detect AKT3PT305 as positive data could strengthen the authors' case.</italic></p><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the suggestion to test anti-phospho-AKT-T308 antibody, which indeed works in Western blot. As Reviewer 2 predicted, we confirmed the activation of AKT by overexpression of constitutively active WT AKTs and the inhibition of AKT3 by the AKT3 mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 5. More importantly, we determined that pS473 inhibition by AKT3-S472A mutant or RICTOR KO decreases pT308. These results provide additional confirmation of our hypothesis that the increased axon regeneration induced by blocking S473 phosphorylation is not due to the increase of pT308, but to different downstream effectors or differentially regulated downstream effectors of AKT. Surprisingly, but excitingly, we found that phosphorylation of GSK3β is oppositely regulated by pT308 and pS473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This finding is extremely important, but was missed from our original manuscript. We therefore greatly appreciate that both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 insisted that we should explore signaling events with Western blots.</p><p><italic>From the work here, as well as previous observations from this group, it is not clear if the effect of modulating the AKT→mTor pathway is mediated in the perikaryon, locally in the axons/growth cones, or both. With increasing evidence for localized protein synthesis in regenerating axons and recent work showing mRNAs and translational machinery (including the mTORC1 targets studied here) in regenerating CNS axons, the authors should acknowledge the possibility of localized effects. The images for HA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that AKTmyr isoforms are localizing into at least the proximal axons. Do these also extend to the distal regenerating axons? This also raises the question of whether the regenerating axons shown with CTB labeling are also HA positive (i.e., for those animals expressing AKT isoforms).</italic>This is another case in which Reviewer 2’s suggestion deserves our thanks. As Reviewer 2 suggested, we investigated the translocation of AKT in optic nerve and discovered another surprising distinct phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>): pro-axon regeneration WT AKT isoforms and AKT3-S472A are distributed in optic nerve whereas no-axon regeneration AKT3-KD, AA and T305A mutants are significantly blocked from optic nerve. The mechanism for this difference and the relationship to axon regeneration are presently unclear. However, this important finding, which otherwise would be missed without Reviewer 2’s thoughtful input, together with the confirmation of localization of WT AKT in regenerating axons, open a new avenue to explore in CNS axon regeneration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The paper looks at AKT and GSKβ effects on regeneration in the optic nerve, assigning roles to various components of the signaling pathway.</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The authors state at the beginning that they achieved 90% transduction of ganglion cells, but do not appear to have measured this routinely in each case. 90% transduction over the whole retina is difficult to achieve. Moreover, some of the illustrations suggest that the transduction rate is rather more variable and somewhat lower in some of the animals.</italic></p><p>We have used a mutant AAV capsid plasmid to produce AAV2 that can achieve very high transducing efficiency for RGCs. We previously explained this strategy in the Methods section, and we now also note it in Results. We also now include quantification of percentages of Tuj1+ RGCs expressing HA-tagged AKTs (&gt; 80%). The original claim of 90% is indeed achievable but not always. We agree with Reviewer 3 that there will be variation in in vivo studies. We used the same batch of virus and the same titers across the lines to minimize the variation sufficiently for us to be confident with our results.</p><p><italic>2) The increased regeneration is similar to the increase in neuronal survival in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Is the increase in axon number a reflection of increase of ganglion cell numbers?</italic></p><p>The regenerating axons are far fewer than the surviving RGCs, and we do not think that the variation in RGC survival is the main reason for the change in axon regeneration, although we cannot totally exclude this possibility. We have explained this in detail in our response to Reviewer 2’s similar comment and discuss it in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The combined effect of active AKT and GSKβ knockout in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> appears to be a significant and robust effect, which is certainly interesting.</italic></p><p>We appreciate Reviewer 3’s recognition of the significance of this finding. In the revised manuscript we further provide an explanation and exciting evidence, the less complete phosphorylation/inhibition of GSK3β by WT AKT.</p><p><italic>4) The effects of the various manipulations 2 and 3 are not large, and would be vulnerable to variable levels of transduction.</italic></p><p>We are not sure what “manipulations 2 and 3” refer to. The expression levels for all the manipulations are now documented by Western blot analysis and hopefully our responses to other questions answered this question as well.</p><p><italic>5) The reagents used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> have overall effects on protein synthesis. To what extent do the authors ascribe their results to specific effects on axon growth rather than through effects on synthesis?</italic></p><p>This is a good question; we addressed a similar question in our response to Reviewer 1’s comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
