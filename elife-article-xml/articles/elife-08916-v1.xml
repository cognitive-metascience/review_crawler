initiates the synthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans. However, it is not known where in the secretory pathway GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1, nor whether GnT1IP-L inhibits other N-glycan branching N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases of the medial Golgi. We show here that the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L contains its inhibitory activity. Retention of GnT1IP-L in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the N-terminal region of human invariant chain p33, with or without C-terminal KDEL, markedly reduced inhibitory activity. Dynamic fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed homomeric interactions for GnT1IP-L in the ER, and heteromeric interactions with MGAT1 in the Golgi. GnT1IP-L did not generate a FRET signal with MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 medial Golgi GlcNAc-tranferases. GnT1IP/<italic>Mgat4d</italic> transcripts are expressed predominantly in spermatocytes and spermatids in mouse, and are reduced in men with impaired spermatogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08916.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08916.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08916.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional shapes and many are assembled in a cell compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum. From here, these new proteins move to another compartment called the Golgi, where they may be further modified before they are transported to their final destination in the cell.</p><p>One way that proteins may be modified is known as glycosylation, in which sugar molecules are attached to specific amino acids. Some sugar molecules can act as labels that ensure the new proteins are transported to the correct destination in the cell. For proteins that are delivered to the surface of the cell, the sugar molecules can also play important roles in communication with other cells.</p><p>A simple sugar molecule, or a complex arrangement of many sugar molecules, may be attached to an amino acid by glycosylation. An enzyme called MGAT1 controls the synthesis of sugars called complex N-glycans in the Golgi. In 2010, researchers reported that a glycoprotein called GnT1IP-L binds to MGAT1 and inhibits its activity, thereby blocking the production of complex N-glycans. GnT1IP-L was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, but it was not clear how it inhibits MGAT1.</p><p>Huang et al.—including some of the researchers from the 2010 study—have now investigated the activity of GnT1IP-L in cells grown in the laboratory using several biochemical techniques. The experiments show that GnT1IP-L only binds to MGAT1 when both proteins are in the Golgi. There are three sections (or ‘domains’) in GnT1IP-L, but Huang et al. found that only the domain that is on the inside of the Golgi is involved in this interaction.</p><p>Previous work indicated that GnT1IP-L may be involved in the formation of sperm in mice. Huang et al. have now analyzed previously published data on samples of testis tissue from human patients and found that the gene that encodes GnT1IP-L is present in very low amounts in patients whose sperm do not develop properly.</p><p>Huang et al.'s findings suggest that GnT1IP-L may inhibit MGAT1 to control the glycosylation of proteins in the Golgi of developing sperm. The next step is to test this hypothesis by generating mutant mice that lack GnT1IP-L, or to make GnT1P-L in other cells in which it is not normally made, to find out if this affects the production of sperm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08916.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08916.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>GnT1IP-L</kwd><kwd>MGAT1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>complex N-glycans</kwd><kwd>Golgi interaction</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM105399, RO1 CA36434, PO1 CA13330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Pamela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004756</institution-id><institution>Emil Aaltosen Säätiö (Emil Aaltonen Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassinen</surname><given-names>Antti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sp72¼-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spiess</surname><given-names>Andrej-Nikolai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GnT1IP-L is a membrane bound glycoprotein that interacts with MGAT1 in the Golgi, but not in the endoplasmic reticulum, to regulate complex N-glycan synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase MGAT1 (GlcNAc-TI or GnT-1) catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>Asn of glycoproteins in the medial Golgi to initiate the synthesis of complex and hybrid N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robertson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tabas et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>). In experiments to identify the activity of murine cDNA 41334120<italic>Rik</italic>, two transcripts were characterized in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). The longer transcript encodes a membrane-bound protein that inhibits MGAT1 in transfected cells, and is termed <underline>G</underline>lc<underline>N</underline>Ac<underline>T-I</underline> <underline>I</underline>nhibitory <underline>P</underline>rotein, <underline>L</underline>ong form, GnT1IP-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). GnT1IP-L is a Type II membrane glycoprotein with sequence homology to glycosyltransferase genes in family 54 in the CaZY database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>). A rat testis membrane-bound form has been termed GL54D but its activity has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au et al., 2015</xref>). The mouse homologue of GL54D is the shorter transcript, previously termed GnT1IP-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>), and recently designated MGAT4D by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee. When the N-terminus of GnT1IP-S is extended by a Myc or HA tag, it becomes membrane-bound and inhibits MGAT1 in cultured cells, similar to GnT1IP-L. In male germ cells mouse GnT1IP-S is probably membrane-bound like its rat homologue GL54D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au et al., 2015</xref>). The sequence of GnT1IP-L (Genbank accession HM067443) is identical to GnT1IP-S with an additional 44 N-terminal amino acids.</p><p>Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>) showed that transfection of a cDNA encoding GnT1IP-L inhibits endogenous or co-transfected MGAT1 activity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, cell lysates of GnT1IP-L transfectants with low MGAT1 activity exhibit normal levels of B4GALT1 and MGAT3 activities (the latter in LEC10 CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell and Stanley, 1984</xref>]). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that GnT1IP-L interacts physically with MGAT1, but does not interact with trans Golgi B4GALT1, nor the trans Golgi network sialyltransferase, ST8SIA2. Deletion mutagenesis experiments showed that removal of 39 amino acids from the C-terminus of membrane-bound Myc-GnT1IP-S, or removal of the stem domain from Myc-GnT1IP-L, abrogates MGAT1 inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we investigate whether GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1 via its luminal or cytoplasmic and transmembrane (TM) domain, and whether GnT1IP-L retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can inhibit MGAT1. The specificity of GnT1IP-L for MGAT1 compared to related medial Golgi GlcNAc-transferases, and the interactions of GnT1IP-L in the ER and Golgi, were investigated by dynamic fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments that previously identified homomeric and heteromeric interactions between Golgi glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rivinoja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassinen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</xref>). The combined results show that GnT1IP-L inhibitory activity lies in its luminal domain, that it forms homomers in the ER, and in the Golgi it forms heteromers specifically with MGAT1. Interestingly, data extracted from published RNA-seq and microarray experiments reveal differential and complementary expression of mouse <italic>Mgat1</italic> and GnT1IP/<italic>Mgat4d</italic> genes in male Sertoli and germ cells, and show that transcripts of human GnT1IP/<italic>MGAT4D</italic> are markedly reduced in testis biopsies of men with impaired spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1 via its luminal domain</title><p>To investigate whether the TM or luminal domain of GnT1IP-L is important for inhibition of MGAT1 in CHO cells, different mutant and chimeric expression plasmids were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Constructs were transfected into CHO cells and stable populations selected for hygromycin resistance were examined for resistance to the toxicity of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> leukoagglutinin (L-PHA), and/or binding of the lectin <italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin (GNA). Resistance to L-PHA, accompanied by increased expression of cell surface oligomannose N-glycans detected by GNA, are hallmarks of inhibition of MGAT1 activity in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Stanley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). The subcellular localization of each construct was investigated by transient transfection of HeLa cells and analysis of immunofluorescence using antibodies to Myc or HA, Golgi α-mannosidase II (MAN2A1), or GM130, or ER protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). In initial experiments, five Phe residues in the GnT1IP-L TM domain were all replaced with either Leu (similar hydrophobicity index to Phe) or Ala (hydrophobicity reduced ∼50% compared to Phe or Leu). Transfectants expressing GnT1IP-L(F/L) or GnT1IP-L(F/A) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) at similar levels based on western analysis, had an increased ability to bind GNA, and exhibited resistance to the toxicity of L-PHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and data not shown). Thus, replacement of five Phe residues with Ala in the TM domain of GnT1IP-L did not markedly reduce its MGAT1 inhibitory activity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08916.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression constructs.</title><p>Mouse GnT1IP-L (417 aa) contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 48 aa, a transmembrane (TM) domain of 21 aa (shaded), and a luminal domain of 348 amino acids.

The L-PHA resistance assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows transfectants or control cells that were stained by methylene blue after ∼3 days of growth from 2000 cells plated in the presence of increasing concentrations of L-PHA. Plates were stained when wells incubated in medium alone (no L-PHA) had become confluent. The variability seen in the proportion of transfectants highly resistant to L-PHA in populations expressing GnT1IP-L mutant or chimeric proteins is due to variable expression levels of cDNAs and is also observed with wild-type GnT1IP-L (see Figure 5B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). The important parameter is the proportion of cells in a transfectant population that consistently resist the toxicity of L-PHA. Homogenous mutant Lec1 CHO cells that completely lack MGAT1, or cells selected for high expression of GnT1IP-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>), are uniformly resistant to L-PHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>When a C-terminal KDEL retention sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancino et al., 2013</xref>) was added to the MGAT1/GnT1IP-L-Myc chimera, resistance to L-PHA was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with reduced localization to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result suggests that the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L is responsible for its ability to inhibit MGAT1. An important control was to examine the reverse chimera—the cytoplasmic and TM domains of GnT1IP-L linked to the luminal domain of MGAT1, termed GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This chimera did not cause stable transfectants to become resistant to L-PHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and did not induce hypersensitivity to Con A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in two independent clones with equivalent expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, the activity of MGAT1 in the GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc transfectant lysates was 6.1 or 15.5 nmol/mg protein/hr, respectively, compared to 7.7 nmol/mg/hr in a CHO cell lysate and 0.5 nmol/mg protein/hr in a Lec1 lysate. The activity of B4GALT1 in the same lysates was equivalent (16–21 nmol/mg protein/hr). A separate experiment with the same extracts gave qualitatively similar results. The fact that one GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc transfectant did not have increased MGAT1 activity may reflect the efficiency of active enzyme formation when the chimeric protein was overexpressed. Nevertheless, it is clear that GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc does not significantly inhibit MGAT1 activity whereas MGAT1/GnT1IP-L is inhibitory. Thus, the GnT1IP-L luminal domain is active when localized by the MGAT1 cytoplasmic and TM domain, and the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L is necessary to inhibit MGAT1 activity.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08916.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The TM and cytoplasmic domain of GnT1IP-L does not inhibit MGAT1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lectin-resistance test of cloned CHO cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc compared to CHO cells and Lec1 CHO cells that lack MGAT1 (n = 2).

Previous assays of glycosyltransferases tagged at the C-terminus by monomeric cerulean (mCer) or monomeric venus (mVen) determined FRET interactions by flow cytometry and showed that numerous glycosyltransferases of the N- and O-glycan pathways form homomers in the ER and heteromers in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rivinoja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassinen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rivinoja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</xref>). The latter heteromeric interactions occur between glycosyltransferases that act sequentially in the same glycan pathway and in the same compartment of the Golgi. Interactions between GnT1IP-L and medial Golgi GlcNAc-transferases MGAT1 to MGAT5 were investigated by the same methods via transient transfection into COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L, or transient co-transfection of GnT1IP-L cDNA with an individual MGAT cDNA. Mouse GnT1IP-L-mVen was investigated for interactions with mouse or human MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B and MGAT5. First, it was shown by fluorescence microscopy that each of the human GlcNAc-transferases tagged with mChe localized correctly to the Golgi when transfected into COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L-mVen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and data not shown). Measurements of FRET efficiencies revealed that GnT1IP-L interacted with MGAT1 but not with MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 in COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells which lack endogenous MGAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Stanley, 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The same results were obtained with the mouse GlcNAc-transferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The lower FRET efficiencies of mouse enzymes may reflect species differences as lower expression of all mouse MGAT constructs was observed. If the data are expressed as a percentage of the MGAT1/GnT1IP-L interaction, no differences are evident between mouse and human interactions. These data also show that GnT1IP-L forms homomers with itself as well as heteromers with MGAT1. The specificity of the FRET signal between GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 was further demonstrated by inhibition of complex formation by overexpression of either GnT1IP-L-HA or MGAT1-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Thus, mutations in the TM domain from Phe to Leu or Ala, or swapping the cytoplasmic and TM domain with that of MGAT1, do not significantly reduce GnT1IP-L inhibitor activity. The requirement for the luminal domain is consistent with our previous findings that removal of the C-terminal 39 aa of membrane-bound GnT1IP-S, or the stem domain of GnT1IP-L, abrogate inhibitor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). The specificity of GnT1IP-L for MGAT1 vs other GlcNAc-transferases of the medial Golgi was investigated here using BiFC and a dynamic FRET assay. These experiments showed no significant FRET activity between GnT1IP-L and MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5. The only substantial FRET signal was obtained between GnT1IP-L and MGAT1, and this signal could only be inhibited by overexpression of either GnT1IP-L or MGAT1. As this result implies, and as shown previously for MGAT1, GnT1IP-L forms homomers with itself, as well as heteromers with MGAT1. These interactions were further defined using BiFC and FRET experiments following treatment with nocodazole or chloroquine. The combined data show that GnT1IP-L preferentially forms homomers in cells treated with nocodazole when it is confined to the ER, and heteromers with MGAT1 following nocodazole removal and a recovery period when it moves to the Golgi. GnT1IP-L homomers are also formed preferentially when the Golgi pH is elevated by treatment with chloroquine. Therefore, GnT1IP-L behaves like the glycosyltransferases previously studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</xref>), interacting with itself in the ER and primarily with MGAT1 in the Golgi. It is interesting that GnT1IP-L showed no FRET interaction with MGAT2 which is predicted to be in a ‘kin recognition’ complex with MGAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nilsson et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1994</xref>), and which has been shown to form heteromers with MGAT1 using the dynamic FRET assay used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassinen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</xref>). GnT1IP-L also did not inhibit or disrupt the formation of MGAT1/MGAT2 heteromers in a competition assay. Therefore, it may be concluded that when GnT1IP-L is in a complex with MGAT1, MGAT2 is not excluded from that complex, and that GnT1IP-L binds to a different site on MGAT1 than MGAT2. In addition, our data show that overexpression of MGAT2 did not disrupt GnT1IP-L/MGAT1 heteromers. The same lack of competition was observed for overexpression of MGAT3, MGAT4B and MGAT5.</p><p>A recent study of rat testis identified GL54D, the rat homologue of mouse GnT1IP-S, as the most abundant species amongst membrane proteins in Golgi preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au et al., 2015</xref>). Immunohistochemistry showed that rat GL54D is confined to spermatocytes and spermatids, consistent with the expression pattern of GnT1IP transcripts in purified mouse germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Soumillon et al., 2013a</xref>]). Thus, while the GL54D homologue GnT1IP-S is secreted from CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>), it is likely to be membrane-bound in mouse germ cells, similar to GL54D in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While it is possible that GnT1IP may also have a glycosyltransferase activity, as suggested by its recent designation as MGAT4D, we have observed no evidence of such an activity in transfected cells. In characterizing the CHO N-glycans generated following expression of membrane-bound GnT1IP, no complex N-glycans that might reflect GlcNAc transfer were identified by mass spectrometry, but rather a great increase in the abundance of the Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> substrate of MGAT1 was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). In addition, we have shown that GnT1IP-L induces increased binding of GNA reflecting enhanced expression of oligomannose N-glycans, increased resistance to lectins that bind complex N-glycans, and/or inhibition of MGAT1 activity, in a variety of cell lines including CHO, COS-7, HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>; this work) and PC3 cells (unpublished observations). Of course, a glycan, protein or lipid substrate may be present in only very low quantities or not expressed in CHO cells. Thus it cannot be ruled out that GnT1IP-L has an activity other than its ability to specifically inhibit MGAT1. Importantly however, another example of a gene that has homology to, and the protein domain structure of a glycosyltransferase, but an activity that is distinct, is C1GALT1C1, originally called COSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). This protein is a specific chaperone dedicated to the Gal-transferase C1GALT1, and essential for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, although GnT1IP-L (or MGAT4D) has homology to family 54 glycosyltransferases, the only activity yet identified for membrane-bound GnT1IP is as a specific inhibitor of MGAT1.</p><p>A functional role for GnT1IP-L has been proposed in testis based on the following: the gene encoding GnT1IP-L is most highly expressed in testis compared to other mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Djureinovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>), the expression of the transcript encoding GnT1IP-L is developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>); GnT1IP is well expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids but not in spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalmel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>); and cells expressing GnT1IP-L and oligomannose N-glycans bind more tightly to TM4 Sertoli cells than cells expressing MGAT1 and complex N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). Most interestingly, the gene encoding MGAT1 is expressed in a complementary manner to GnT1IP-L in male germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalmel et al., 2007</xref>]). We are currently investigating the hypothesis that membrane-bound GnT1IP functions to down-regulate MGAT1 activity in spermatocytes and potentially spermatids, thereby enhancing their ability to bind to Sertoli cells. It is therefore of interest that men with impaired spermatogenesis exhibit greatly reduced expression of GnT1IP in microarray studies of testis biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The degree of reduction appears to reflect the proportion of the remaining population of germ cells. Interestingly, MGAT1 transcripts were not reduced but were slightly increased reflecting robust expression of <italic>MGAT1</italic> in Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalmel et al., 2007</xref>).

For FRET and BiFC experiments, cells cultured for 1 day were transfected using 0.5 µg of each plasmid cDNA and FuGENE 6 according to the supplier's protocol (Promega Corp). After 24 hr, cells were processed either for fluorescence microscopy, BiFC or FRET measurements (see below). Where noted, chloroquine (CQ) from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) was added to the culture medium at 40 µM, or nocodazole (1 µg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) was added at different times as described in ‘Results’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For FRET and BiFC experiments, COS-7 and CHO cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassinen et al., 2010</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor), and three reviewers, one of whom, Reid Gilmore, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is John Hanover.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from Huang et al. examines the mechanism of MGAT1 inhibition by the GnT1P-L, a protein that appears to be a member of the MGAT gene family based upon homology. Previous research form the Stanley lab demonstrated that overexpression of GnT1P-L does not increase transfer of GlcNAc to N-glycans, but instead reduces MGAT1 activity. The current manuscript follows up on these earlier findings by testing whether GnT1P-L can inhibit other MGATs. The authors use FRET and BiFC experiments to characterize the homomeric and heteromeric interactions of GnT1P-L and MGAT1. Importantly, GnT1P-L does not inhibit MGAT2-MGAT5, and does not interact with these other GlcNAc-transferases. Heteromeric interactions between GnT1P-L and MGAT1 occur in the Golgi and are dependent upon the slightly acidic environment of the Golgi lumen. Analysis of MGAT1 and GnT11P-L expression in spermatocyte progenitor cells point to an important role for GnT1P-L during spermatogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the first experiment in the manuscript tests the effect of replacing phenylalanine residues in the TM span with leucine or alanine residues. The rationale for mutating these residues is not that clear since F, A and L residues are all typical amino acids for TM spans. The lack of a wild type GnT1P-L control (Myc or HA tagged) in panel C is another weakness of this figure. The reader can't tell whether the (F/L) or (F/A) mutants are as effective as the parental construct. Oddly enough, the HA-tagged constructs are less effective than the Myc-tagged constructs. The authors don't comment on this tag-induced activity difference, as the next experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) shows that both the cytosolic domain and the TM span of GnT1P-L can be replaced with the corresponding segments of MGAT1. Deletion of this figure would improve the manuscript since the results don't make a significant contribution after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is shown. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> should be modified to eliminate the diagrams for the F/A and F/L constructs.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the authors should explain the lectin growth inhibition assay better. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> would be improved by inclusion of wild type GnT1P-L and Lec1 cells. The main text needs to indicate that cell colonies are detected by staining with methylene blue. The text should also indicate that GnT1P-L expressing cells are not expected to show the same level of resistance as Lec1 cells, since MGAT1 activity is reduced, not eliminated.</p><p>3) The authors should comment on the roughly 2-fold difference in observed FRET efficiency for the same donor/acceptor pair in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. Is this explained by a difference in MGAT1 expression? The authors should consider changing the lettering for panel D to stress that the constructs tested (e.g., +MGAT1) are HA tagged, and are being tested as competitive inhibitors.</p><p>4) Previous publications from Hassinen et al. have described Golgi-localized MGAT1-MGAT2 heteromers. The authors should test whether GnT1IP-L expression reduces MGAT1-MGAT2 heteromer formation using FRET and/or BiFC. This would provide insight into whether GnT1IP-L dissociates MGAT1 from MGAT2-MGAT1 heteromers, or instead exerts inhibitory activity within the context of pre-existing MGAT1-MGAT2 complexes. I believe the authors have the necessary cell lines and expression constructs to conduct this experiment.</p><p>5) The final section of the manuscript makes an abrupt change to transcript profiling of GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 transcripts in mouse germ cells and male testis biopsies. This latter section of the manuscript was based on mining of previous microarray and RNA-Seq data sets for GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 transcript levels, but the data presentation and description of methods employed are cryptic or entirely missing. No descriptions of the informatics approaches for transcript profiling are presented in the Methods section and only literature references to the original data sets are listed in the figure legends. In addition, the descriptions in the figure legends and labeling of the figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and 11) were incomplete or misleading. It is not clear from the figure or legend that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is RNA-Seq data and the plot is labeled as “log2 fluorescence,” when it is likely supposed to be labeled “log 2 FPKM.” FPKM needs to be defined. A much more explicit description of the methods is required for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and the axes need to be labeled in a comprehensible manner. The data in Figure 11 is also cryptically presented and it is not clear until the last line of the legend that the authors are describing a RNA microarray experiment. The connection between the transcript profiling and the remainder of the manuscript seems rather tenuous, but an effort is made to link protein expression with glycan phenotypes with glycan structure phenotypes in the respective cell types and human pathology of defects in spermatogenesis. This link from transcript levels to the glycan structures in the respective cell types needs to be more clearly presented so that it is clear what the take home message is for the gene expression data. Observations are made that GnT1IP-L expression is elevated in postmeiotic germ cells consistent with data in Figure 11 on human testis biopsies from men with impaired spermatogenesis. The authors hypothesize that blockage in glycan maturation is critical for germ cell interaction with Sertoli cells.</p><p>6) In the Discussion, the authors indicate that the previous paper (Huang et al., 2010) showed that the stem deletion mutant (delta-stem-GNT1IP-L) and the C-terminal deletion mutant of GNT1IP-L-CD1 still interact with MGAT1 but do not cause inhibition. For GNT1IP-L-CD1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> of Huang et al. showed that the C-terminal deletion mutant is mainly retained in the ER, so formation of GNT1IP-L-CD1-MGAT1 heteromers should be reduced based upon the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of the current manuscript. Unless I have overlooked something, interaction between a C-terminal GNT1IP deletion mutant and MGAT1 has only been tested in the context of the short form (GNT1IP-S-CD2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since the short form (GNT1IP-S) is not a MGAT1 inhibitor, one has to be concerned that ER retention of the truncation mutant is a contributing factor in lack of inhibitory activity. Since the current manuscript does not use BiFC or FRET to characterize formation of heteromers between MGAT1 and these inactive GNT1IP-L mutants, it seems premature to conclude that specific sub-regions of the lumenal domain are required for GNT1IP-L inhibitory activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08916.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: the first experiment in the manuscript tests the effect of replacing phenylalanine residues in the TM span with leucine or alanine residues.

The most important parameter reflecting GnT1IP-L activity is whether a consistent proportion of transfectants survive high concentrations of L-PHA. Transfectant populations sorted for high GnT1IP-L expression or oligomannose expression show uniform resistance to L-PHA, as shown in our previous paper. We have now included an explanation in the text. Our previous paper also rigorously tested different tags on GnT1IP-L and found no consistent difference in HA versus Myc with respect to GnT1IP-L inhibitory activity.

We have also revised Figures 10 and 11 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig10">Figures 9 and 10</xref>) and their legends, added information to the Materials and methods section and rephrased the Results. Materials and methods now includes two sections: “Analysis of mouse RNA sequencing data” and “Analysis of human microarray data”, in which we describe in detail how datasets were downloaded, which Reads/Probesets were extracted, and how they were visualized with respect to germ cell subtypes and testicular phenotypes. The legends have been updated so that the legend title now contains data origin (RNA-Seq or Microarray). The x-axis of the histogram now has the correct label “log2 FPKM” (thanks for alerting us).

Our previous paper showed that adding an N-terminal tag (Myc or HA) to GnT1IP-S converts it to a membrane-bound form that inhibits MGAT1 in transfected cells, indistinguishable from GnT1IP-L. The sequence of GnT1IP-L from aa 45 to 417 is identical to GnT1IP-S and differs only in that it has a 44 aa N-terminal extension. Some mutant constructs were made with Tag-GnT1IP-S which inhibits MGAT1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>), and mislocalizes co-expressed MGAT1 to the ER more severely than Myc-GnT1IP-S-CD1 (C-terminal 39 aa deletion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Stanley, 2010</xref>). Tag-GnT1IP-S-CD1 does not induce resistance to L-PHA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), nor inhibit MGAT1 activity. Thus, it is appropriate to say that loss of the 39 C-terminal amino acids inactivates inhibition of MGAT1 by membrane-bound GnT1IP. Co-immunoprecipitation with MGAT1 was observed with a 121 aa C-terminal deletion, which suggests that the 39 aa deletion mutant would also interact with MGAT1. We have modified the revised text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
