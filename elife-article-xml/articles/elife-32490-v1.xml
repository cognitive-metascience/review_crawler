However, the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination in distant metastasis remain incompletely understood. We show here that exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells, but not singly invasive Bowes cells, to lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant organ metastasis in mice. To dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, we established LEC co-cultures with different melanoma cells originating from primary tumors or metastases. Notably, the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix that was dependent on MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. Moreover, MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. This study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The death rates for many types of cancer have dropped, but melanoma remains a serious concern. This type of skin cancer is especially aggressive because it can spread to distant organs. Melanoma often spreads via the lymphatic system, a network of vessels that extends throughout the body to drain fluid from the body’s tissues. The lymphatic system also includes structures – called lymph nodes – that filter bacteria from this fluid; this helps to defend against infection.</p><p>When melanoma spreads to lymph nodes and distant organs, clinicians diagnose it as Stage IV melanoma. For patients at this stage, the outcome is often poor. It is clear that melanoma exploits lymph vessels to spread throughout the body. But researchers also suspect that vessel cells interact with the cancer cells, helping the melanoma invade distant organs. Understanding exactly how lymph vessels promote the spread of melanoma will lead to better options for treating this aggressive cancer.</p><p>Pekkonen, Alve et al. investigated whether exposing human melanoma cells to cells from the walls of human lymph vessels would make the cancer cells more aggressive. Indeed, after growing the two cell types together in the laboratory, the melanoma cells became more invasive. When transplanted into mice, these cancer cells spread to and invaded the rodents’ distant organs.</p><p>Pekkonen, Alve et al. conducted a series of experiments to identify specific proteins in the melanoma cellsthat were responsible for making the cancer more invasive after it interacted with the lymph vessel cells. These experiments identified proteins called MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin as critical to the invasive spread of melanoma cells. When melanoma cells with less MMP14 or Notch3 were implanted into zebrafish, the cancer cells spread less efficiently. These findings may represent new leads that clinicians can test to see if they are markers of cancers that are most likely to spread and that the pharmaceutical industry can pursue to treat melanoma patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>lymphatic endothelial

metastasis requires that the tumor cells gain access into the hematogenous circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>). The metastatic dissemination of cancer cells is expedited by molecular changes promoting the ability of cancer cells to invade across the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECM) and into the lumen of lymphatic or blood vessels. In order to survive in circulation as well as extravasate and colonize the distant organ sites the cancer cells need to survive a variety of stresses such as hemodynamic shear forces, trapping to vascular beds and ROS, and gain the ability to invasively grow at the new tissue microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Strilic and Offermanns, 2017</xref>). Many of these activities have been found to be enhanced in tumor cell clusters relative to singly invading tumor cells.</p><p>The local microenvironment including the ECM and cell-non-autonomous interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells play a vital role in metastasis. In addition to providing a direct route for dissemination, the tumor lymphatics have been proposed to directly modulate the metastatic cascade through mechanisms that have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alitalo and Detmar, 2012</xref>). Clinical observations of satellite melanoma tumors growing between the primary tumor and draining lymph nodes have suggested that the surrounding lymphatic endothelium serves as a protective microenvironment for the survival of incipient metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meier et al., 2002</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, over the last few years it has become increasingly clear that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in fact actively interact with the surrounding cells in the tissue, thus regulating both physiological and pathological processes including tumor progression and metastasis. Both paracrine communication and direct cell-cell interactions between tumor cells and the associated lymphatics have been shown to drive tumor progression and dissemination. For example, chemokine receptor-ligand interactions between melanoma and LECs drive chemotaxis of tumor cells towards the lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cabioglu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shields et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, tumor cells secrete factors like lipoxygenase, which can induce downregulation of the endothelial surface molecules and loosening of the LEC junctions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kerjaschki et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we set to investigate how the LECs in the tumor microenvironment affect the metastatic melanoma cell phenotype. To this end, we implemented 2D- and 3D melanoma-LEC co-culture models, which enable a systematic analysis of the molecular crosstalk between the tumor cells and the lymphatic endothelium. We found that the interaction of melanoma cells with LECs induced matrix-metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP) -dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation in the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells, leading to invasive sprouting of cells in 3D matrices. Importantly, the interaction of these melanoma cells with LECs led to significantly increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3. Thus, the crosstalk with LECs promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch to invasively sprouting melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three-dimensional co-culture model recapitulates the melanoma interaction with lymphatic vasculature</title><p>To study the interaction of LECs with melanoma cells in vitro, we utilized a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture method, where LEC spheroids were embedded together with single, GFP-expressing or fluorescent tracer labeled, melanoma cells into a cross-linked 3D matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Korff and Augustin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatti et al., 2015</xref>). We chose to use fibrin as 3D matrix since it is frequently deposited within tumor tissues and perivascular spaces in vivo. After 72 hr incubation, the LEC control spheroids (labeled with the endothelial marker PECAM) showed moderate outgrowth (LEC sprouting) from the spheroid body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, leftmost panel). Co-culturing the LEC spheroids with cells isolated from a melanoma skin metastasis (WM852) or from a superficially spreading melanoma (Bowes), resulted in melanoma attraction and invasion into the LEC spheroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle and rightmost panels). Especially the WM852 cells (and Bowes to a lesser extent) appeared to disrupt the spheroid structure at the melanoma cell-LEC contact sites, as shown by the loss of the endothelial adhesion molecule PECAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, enlarged inserts of the middle and rightmost panels). Thus, our 3D co-culture model qualitatively recapitulates attraction, migration and invasion of melanoma cells into lymphatic endothelial structures.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-culture of melanoma cells and LECs reveals melanoma invasion into the LEC 3D structures and increases the metastatic potential of WM852 cells in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the experimental pipeline.

Since we and others have previously shown that MMP14 transcription and protein expression are induced by Notch signaling in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Funahashi et al., 2011</xref>), we next assessed if MMP14 and Notch3 were co-regulated in WM852*.

To study the co-regulation further, we treated the co-cultures of LEC and WM852 with a MMP14 specific inhibitor (NSC 405020), after which the WM852 cells were separated for further analysis.

We therefore decided to address the role of integrins, one of the major cell-matrix adhesion molecule families, in the LEC induced changes in metastatic melanoma cells. Since several reports support association of β1-integrin expression with melanoma progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Natali et al., 1993</xref>), we investigated the expression and activation state of β1-integrin in the ±LEC co-cultured WM852, WM165, WM793, and Bowes cell lines using antibodies for the total and active β1-integrin (12G10). Interestingly, WM852* showed a higher signal for the active β1-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), which was further confirmed by staining with another antibody against active β1-integrin, 9EG7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We also attempted to confirm the integrin activation in WM852* by FACS analysis using antibodies against active β1-integrin (12G10 and 9EG7). However, we did not detect the increase in active β1-integrin levels in the FACS of WM852* (data not shown) perhaps because the activation may either require the constant contact of melanoma cells to LECs or to 3D fibrin, and be sensitive to the cell detachment process. Also WM165* cells displayed an increase in the active β1-integrin signal intensity, which however did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In contrast, no changes in the active β1-integrin levels were observed with the WM793 and Bowes cell lines ± LECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). When we analysed total β1-integrin by IFA, no detectable differences in distribution or signal intensity in any of the cell lines ± LEC by IFA were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). Intriguingly, total β1-integrin, detected by immunoblotting, was decreased markedly in the LEC co-cultured WM852* cells (by 43%), and about 25% (although non-significant) for WM165* and Bowes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). In addition, the LEC co-culture altered the proportion of mature β1-integrin in WM852* and WM165* cells since the upper β1-integrin specific band (mature form of the integrin) decreased and a faster migrating, probably representing newly synthesized, immature β1-integrin appeared. Notably, the electrophoretic pattern of β1-integrin was similar in WM852 and WM793 cells before and after the interaction with LEC especially when compared to the pattern in Bowes cells, possibly reflecting differences in the processing and trafficking of β1-integrin. The discrepancy between the IFA and immunoblotting data may be due to different accessability of antibody-epitopes, and the potential shift in integrin processing suggested by the immunblot warrants further investigation in future studies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Change in the 3D growth phenotype of the LEC primed melanoma cells is β1-integrin dependent.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative confocal images of active β1-integrin (12G10) staining (red) in the indicated melanoma cell lines (GFP positive cells (white) in the inset) in the presence (*, upper panels) or absence (bottom panels) of LECs.

In addition, clinical data correlating metastatic spread with lymphatic infiltration suggest that melanoma-LEC interactions could contribute to the tumor progression and metastasis. Here we investigated the consequences of such interactions by coupling unique 2D and 3D LEC-melanoma co-culture models to in vivo mouse tumor model, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay.</p><p>In the xenograft mouse model, dissemination of the metastatic WM852 cell line to distant organs was increased by LEC priming. Furthermore, in vitro molecular and functional studies revealed that the direct contact of LECs with metastatic melanoma cell lines triggered changes particularly in the localization of MMP14, an important protease for cancer-cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Turunen et al., 2017</xref>), which in turn induced expression and activation of Notch3 and activation of β1-integrin leading to a significant change in the 3D growth phenotype of the melanoma cells. The interaction with LECs did not, however, induce metastasis or change the 3D growth phenotype of non-metastatic Bowes cells. Although Bowes have active MMP14 and an invasive, single cell 3D sprouting phenotype in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tatti et al., 2011</xref>), these intrinsic properties were not sufficient to support distant organ metastatic colonization in vivo. Moreover, ectopic expression of MMP14 or NICD3 did not induce any change in their 3D growth phenotype. Similar to Bowes, LEC priming did not markedly alter the 3D phenotype of another non-metastatic melanoma cell line WM793, that, despite of MMP14 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tatti et al., 2011</xref>), continued to grow expansively in 3D as indicated by the sphere-like growth in 3D fibrin. However, these cells switched to the invasively sprouting growth upon introduction of NICD3, and the sprouting was dependent on β1-integrin. Another possible contributor to this change could be theβ1-integrin processing and trafficking, which appears quite different in Bowes as compared to WM793 and WM852. Based on our results, it is plausible that the capacity for expansive growth is a property required for the NICD3 dependent change in the 3D growth. Fittingly, WM852 cells with strong intrinsic capacity to grow expansively, switched to the invasively sprouting growth phenotype after the LEC-mediated transient activation of the MMP14-Notch3-β1-integrin axis, which resulted in increased MMP14 and Notch3 dependent metastasis in vivo. The LEC contact likewise switched the metastatic, expansively growing WM165 cells to invasive sprouting via activation of MMP14-Notch3-β1-integrin axis. Supporting the importance of this signaling axis, neither Bowes nor WM793 responded to the LEC contact by activating these key effectors needed for the metastatic phenotype.</p><p>Melanoma cell invasion into the deeper layers of the skin and distant sites is associated with molecular changes such as increased activation of the tissue degrading proteases including the MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villanueva and Herlyn, 2008</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the LEC contact increased MMP14 on the melanoma cell plasma membrane and cell-cell contacts in the metastatic melanoma cell lines. This was accompanied with an MMP14-dependent increase in Notch3 expression by a yet unidentified mechanism. MMP14 was recently shown to interact with and activate Notch1 at the cell membrane of melanoma cells, which supported melanoma cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Although Notch receptors 1 and 3 are highly activated in melanoma with clear pro-tumorigenic functions, no Notch-activating mutations have been identified in melanoma. Therefore, the herein identified MMP14 dependent Notch3 upregulation may prove important in metastatic melanoma progression.</p><p>Our results also revealed that LEC contact induced β1-integrin activation in the metastatic WM852 and WM165 cells, which was required for the 3D sprouting of WM852* cells. β1-integrin activation was dependent on MMP14 as its depletion by siRNA abolished the β1-integrin activation and slightly, but non-significantly, reduced total β1-integrin protein levels These findings concur with previous studies demonstrating MMP14 incorporation into β1-integrin rich adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woskowicz et al., 2013</xref>) and MMP14 binding to β1-integrin upon mammary branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mori et al., 2013</xref>) as well as its role in controlling the 3D cell-shape of stem cells through activation of β1-integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, melanoma metastases express more activated β1-integrin than the primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Our current results add to this concept by demonstrating that endothelial cell contact activates integrins in melanoma cells, thus providing a putative mechanism for the contribution of the stromal lymphatic microenvironment to melanoma metastasis.</p><p>Negative regulator of β1-integrin, ICAP-1, has been shown to act as a potent inducer of Notch1-signaling by transcriptionally upregulating Notch ligands <italic>DLL1</italic> and <italic>DLL4</italic> and the downstream transcription factors <italic>HEY1, HEY2</italic>, and <italic>HES5</italic> in blood endothelial cells and thereby restrict the sprouting angiogenesis of the ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brütsch et al., 2010</xref>). However, as our transcriptomic data of the LEC-primed melanoma cells did not reveal changes in <italic>ICAP-1</italic> expression upon LEC-priming it probably does not play a significant role in the Notch3-dependent invasive sprouting of metastatic melanoma cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that β1-integrin functions downstream of Notch3 in the LEC-primed melanomas.</p><p>Although melanoma cells at the primary tumor site predominantly disseminate through the lymphatic vascular route, the distant organ metastasis requires cells entering blood circulation and colonization in the distant organ tissue. MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin are all proteins linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma cell metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), supporting the idea that the metastatic WM852* and WM165* melanoma cells have also undergone a transient transition into a more mesenchymally invasive state that can promote hematogenous dissemination. However, since the Bowes cells with high MMP14 levels did not metastasize, MMP14 activity by itself is apparently not enough for efficient distant organ metastasis. In the absence of strong cancer cell-cell interactions, constitutively high MMP14 activity can facilitate single cell invasion, thereby compromising the adhesive and expansive growth potential essential for efficient tissue colonization of the tumor cells. We therefore propose that the capacity for transiently induced 3D invasive sprouting coupled to expansive growth behavior are required for the most aggressive melanoma cells to enter and survive in the blood circulation, as well as to efficiently colonize the distant organs.</p><p>Melanoma progression is suggested to be driven by reversible and functional reprogramming of different signaling routes, known as reversible phenotypic plasticity of cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vandamme and Berx, 2014</xref>). Changes and interactions in the tumor microenvironment are believed to direct this phenotype-switching, but the detailed mechanisms are largely unknown. Our current results support the role of reversible phenotype-switching in melanoma progression and identifies the stromal lymphatic endothelium as one of the key triggers for the process to support both hematogenous dissemination and tissue colonization at the distant organs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Sourcor reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Danio Rerio casper strain (<italic>roy</italic>-/-; <italic>mitfa</italic>-/-)</td><td valign="top"/><td>PMID: 18371439</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mus Musculus C.B-17/IcrHanTMHSD</td><td valign="top"/><td>Harlan, <underline>Indianapolis, IN, USA</underline></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Human primary juvenile foreskin lymphatic endothelial cells</td><td valign="top"/><td>Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adult Dermal lymphatic endothelial cells</td><td valign="top"/><td>Lonza,<underline>Basel, Switzerland</underline></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>WM852</td><td valign="top"/><td>Wistar Institute Philadelphia</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_6804">CVCL_6804</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>WM165</td><td valign="top"/><td>Wistar Institute Philadelphia</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_L033">CVCL_L033</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Bowes</td><td valign="top"/><td>D.B.

Primary antibodies were incubated 1 hr at room temperature followed by incubation in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature (goat-anti mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG, Millipore, <underline>Burlington, MA</underline>). Bands were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL solution (WesternBright Sirius, Advansta, <underline>Menlo Park, CA</underline>) and visualized by Chemi-Doc (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were detached using hyclone HyQtase (Thermo Fisher), washed once with full medium and once with PBS. Cells were then fixed in 2%PFA for 15 min RT and washed in tyrodes buffer (10 mM Hepes-NaOH pH7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 2,68 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1,7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.9 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM glucose, 0.1%BSA). Subsequently 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells / condition were stained with anti-MMP14 (Chemicon, MAB3328) antibody for 1 hr at 4°C under rotation, washed once in tyrodes buffer and incubated with Alexa647-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at 4°C under rotation. Cells were then washed once in tyrodes buffer and GFP positive (melanoma) cells were analysed for Alexa647 intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vivo tumorigenicity and metastasis assay</title><p>To study the tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity of the melanoma cells from monotypic cultures or after LEC priming, the GFP-luc reporter containing melanoma cells were first cultured with or without the LECs in the 3D fibrin matrix as described above. After 72 hr of co-culture, the proteinase inhibitor approtinin was removed from the culture media and melanoma cells were allowed to digest the matrix. After 48–72 hr, the cells were collected, and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected subcutaneously into C.B-17/IcrHanTMHSD-Prkdc Scid mice (Harlan). The mice and tumor size were followed weekly for up to 70 days, after which the tumor volumes and weights were also measured. After the follow-up period, mice were sacrificed, the tumors were collected for further analyses by immunohistochemical stainings, and the metastasis was analysed by measuring the luciferase activity in the isolated organs using the Caliper IVIS Kinetic imaging system. In addition, the metastatic human cells were detected from mouse lung genomic DNA by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) against human Alu sequences, and using mouse genomic DNA as normalization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Zebrafish xenograft and metastasis assay</title><p>Adult zebrafish (Danio Rerio) of casper strain (<italic>roy-/-; mitfa-/-)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">White et al., 2008</xref>) were maintained according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nuesslein-Volhard and Dahm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Westerfield and Zon, 2009</xref>) and embryos were collected after natural spawning. Experimentation with zebrafish was performed under licence ESAVI/9339/04.10.07/2016. The zebrafish embryos were cultured in E3-medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) supplemented with 0.2 mM phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich) at 33°C. Two days post-fertilization, the embryos were anesthesized with MS-222 (200 mg/l, Sigma-Aldrich) and mounted into low-melting point agarose for tumor transplantation. Prior to transplantation, the co-cultured and siRNA-treated WM852-GFP melanoma cells were prepared and separated from LECs as described above. Approximately 5–10 nl of melanoma cell suspension was microinjected into pericardial cavity of the embryo using CellTramVario (Eppendorf), Injectman Ni2 (Eppendorf) micromanipulator and borosilicate glass needles pulled from glass capillaries (TW100-4, World Precision Instruments Ltd., <underline>Sarasota, FL</underline>) using micropipette puller (PB-7, Narishige, <underline>Tokyo, Japan</underline>). After transplantation, the embryos were released from the agarose and cultured in E3-PTU at 33°C. On the following day, the successfully xenografed healthy embryos were selected to the experiment and placed into 12-well plates (1 embryo per well). At 6 dpf (4 days post-injection) the embryos were anaesthesized with MS-222 and imaged in lateral orientation with Zeiss StereoLumar V12 fluorescence microscope.</p><p>The circularity and area of the primary tumor was measured manually using FIJI software (ImageJ version 1.49 k) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). In cases where embryo carried more than one primary tumor, the largest nodule was considered as primary tumor and measured, or in cases where equally sized nodules existed, all of them were measured. The number of invaded cells were counted manually based on GFP-fluorescence. Only invading cells outside the pericardial cavity were counted. Invading cells above the yolk sac or in the lens were not also counted as these sites tend to have prominent autofluorescence. Samples having significant malformations and images where embryo was not laterally oriented were excluded from the analysis. Samples were not blinded for imaging and subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The mouse tumors were stained with antibodies against MMP14 (Chemicon), Lyve-1 (Reliatec) and Notch3 (Santa Cruz) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). The antibody stainings were visualized using Alexa594 and Alexa647 fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies for MMP14 and LYVE-1 and anti-rabbit HRP and DAB as a substrate for detection of Notch3. The images were acquired with 3DHistech Panoramic 250 FLASH II digital slide scanner or Zeiss LSM780 confocal imaging system.</p><p>Notch3 staining was scored as low, medium, or high according to intensity. Scoring was performed by three independent investigators (SA, SG, PMO) without knowledge of the sample origin. Differing scores were discussed and consensus scores were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For quantification of the assay in 3D-fibrin gels, confocal stacks where analysed with the open source software Bioimage XD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioimagexd.net/">http://www.bioimagexd.net/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kankaanpää et al., 2012</xref>) using the 'skeleton' tool in the 3D modules of the software. Cell clusters were identified by thresholding the intensity of melanoma GFP fluorescence. The skeleton function of Bioimage XD shrunk the 3D object from all directions until a central segment (the skeleton of the object) was obtained. The sum of the length of all the segments within a 3D object were considered as a measure of sprouting of the melanoma cells in 3D. This value was calculated for all objects in each image (typically around 50 objects per image). The mean and SD of all these values from at least three images per condition was given as the final value of sprouting in each experiment.</p><p>For quantification of the intensity of fluorescent stainings, mean intensity and respective SD in melanoma (GFP expressing) cells was measured using CellProfiler pipeline. At least four images were quantified in each different condition. Experiments were repeated at least two times, p-values was calculated with a one-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.</p><p>For quantification of western blotting, band intensities were measured in two independent experiments using Image Lab quantification program. For each sample, the intensities were first normalized to the corresponding loading control, then the average intensity was calculated. The mean intensity and SD were calculated from two experiments.</p><p>For statistical analysis of the qRT-PCR data, logarithmic values were converted to ddCt values (linear log2 scale values) and p-values were calculated with a one-tailed unpaired Student's t test. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p><p>Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn´s multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism 6.05, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA,) was used in the analyses of zebrafish data. Each condition was compared siCTRL-LEC co-culture. In each graph, median and interquartile range has been plotted. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Veronika Rezov, Jenny Bärlund and Sari Tynkkynen for excellent technical assistance, and Kari Alitalo for critical comments and provided reagents.

What is meant with this sentence?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Lymphatic endothelium stimulates melanoma metastasis and invasion via MMP14-dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Reinhard Fässler, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>It is shown that the LEC-induced metastatic melanoma 3D growth phenotype is Notch3- and β1 integrin-dependent. Despite the evidence showing that MMP14 is upstream of Notch3 and β1 integrin, the authors do not provide convincing experimental data for a MMP14-Notch3- β1 integrin axis, as claimed in the second paragraph of the Discussion. It is demonstrated that β1 integrin is needed for dissemination once Notch3 is activated. However, evidence for a direct effect of Notch3 on β1 integrin activity is missing. Instead, the findings shown in the manuscript suggest that MMP14 acts separately on Notch3 and β1 integrin. This issue requires clarification. In addition, the statistics are incomplete and the quality of some images requires improvement.</p><p>1) Statistics have to be provided for all graphs. This is essential.</p><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 2: the lack of significance in panel G, which shows an increase of Notch3 mRNA in WM165 cells after LEC interaction, needs to be recalculated. The findings look significant to the reviewers and therefore, the authors should carefully check whether the statistics have been carried out correctly. The Notch3 mRNA increase is in good agreement with the increase of Notch3 staining shown in Figure 2 and its quantification in panel F of Figure 2—figure supplement 2?</p><p>3) Figure 4D: the Results section states that Notch3 mRNA is decreased upon MMP14 depletion. There is a decrease that is, however, not significant. The text should be corrected accordingly.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 2: panel B is unclear: were cells treated with siRNA against Notch3 to investigate the effect on MMP14 mRNA (is the increase significant or not? statistics missing?) or were cells treated with MMP14 siRNA to show the effect on Notch3, as said in the figure headline &quot;MMP14 regulates Notch3&quot;? Please clarify.</p><p>The actin blot in panel D displays unclear deformations. Is this a re-probing of the upper blot? It should be improved.</p><p>4) Figure 5: the increase of 12G10 staining in LEC-cocultured WM852 and WM167 cells (5A) as well as the decrease of sprouting after AIIB2 treatment (5B) are convincing. Therefore, it is sufficient to mention in the manuscript that FACS analysis for β1 integrin is not possible for the reasons expressed in the rebuttal letter.</p><p>The colocalization of the 12G10 and MMP14 signals is not convincing (5C). Please replace with a better image.</p><p>Although the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of MMP14 on the decrease of 12G10 is convincing, the authors claim no change of total β1 integrin despite a decrease in β1 staining in 5F, which is not confirmed by the quantification shown in figure 5E. Is it possible that Figure 5F is not representative? Please clarify this discrepancy?</p><p>5) Figure 5—figure supplemental 2: the headline of the figure is inappropriate. Since this figure does not show experiments of NCID-mediated β1 integrin activation or sprouting, it would be better to change the headline to &quot;β1 integrin activity does not affect MMP14 and Notch3 expression&quot;.</p><p>6) Figure 6D: the authors investigate WM793 cells (originally non-sprouting cells upon LEC co-culture). Treatment with NCID increases the invasive phenotype, whereas blocking β1 integrin curbs invasion indicating that β1 integrin is required for the invasive phenotype induced by active Notch3 (NCID). MMP14 inhibition does not block the invasive phenotype indicating that MMP14 is probably upstream.</p><p>Therefore, it would be more appropriate to change the title of Figure 6D to: “NCID overexpression provokes a β1 integrin-dependent 3D sprouting in WM793 cells&quot;.</p><p>Why did the authors use WM793 and not Bowe cells? Is this due to the Golgi-retained MMP14?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>: the authors show that MMP14 or NCID is sufficient to induce invasive phenotype in WM cells. Why does neither MMP14 nor NCID overexpression in Bowe cells induce the invasive phenotype? Does it mean that it is not possible to induce an invasive phenotype after overexpression of MMP14 or NCID? The absent effect of MMP14 overexpression in Bowe cells is explained by the Golgi retention of MMP14 indicating that MMP14 cell surface localisation is needed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Therefore, overexpression of NCID should be sufficient if NCID is downstream to MMP14. What is missing? The reviewers suspect that β1 integrin needs to be rendered competent by MMP14 at the cell surface. The electrophoretic pattern of β1 integrin is similar in WM852 and WM793 cells before and after interaction with LEC, whereas the electrophoretic pattern of β1 integrin is different in Bowe cells as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. The authors should discuss this conundrum in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The link between MMP14, Notch3 and β1 integrin is not worked out well.

This data is now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>However, despite three independent repetitions of the FACS analysis we were unfortunately not able to detect the increase in active β1-integrin levels in the WM852* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). As the activity of β1-integrin may be (depending on the activation mechanisms involved) linked to retained adhesion the LEC-induced increase in β1-integrin activation detected in the co-cultured cells by IFA could be sensitive to the cell detachment process (for which we used trypsinization, HyQtase or EDTA), whereas the MMP14 increase was retained during this process and allowed detection by FACS.</p><p>To further test this hypothesis we immunostained the magnetically separated WM852 and WM852* cells with both active β1-integrin antibodies 12G10, 9EG7 and MMP14 specific antibody and compared the staining patterns with cells grown in monotypic culture or LEC cocultured on coverlips, and obtained results similar to FACS (this experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), i.e. no increase in active β1-integrin was observed in the WM852* after detachment from co-culture, magnetic separation and replating on glass coverslips. However, if the cells were embedded into 3D fibrin right after separation, the increase in active β1-integrin signal form 12G10 antibody was retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>) suggesting that the 3D fibrin enabled to sustain the activation state of the integrin. This also explains the sensitivity of the LEC-induced 3D sprouting phenotype to AIIB2 treatment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>a</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of active b1-integrin levels in WM852 and WM852* using 12G10 (upper) and 9EG7 (lower) antibodies.</title><p>(<bold>b</bold>) Confocal images of WM852* replated after separation on coverslips for 24h (left panels), WM852 +LEC co-culture (not subjected to magnetic separation; middle panels) and monotypic WM852 (right panels).

What does the perinuclear location mean?</p></disp-quote><p>The cells in Figure 4 and c indeed show perinuclear localization of MMP14, especially prominent in the Bowes cell line. To study the location of the perinuclear MMP14, we have costained Bowes and WM852 cells with antibodies targeting MMP14 and TGN46 which defines the location of trans-Golgi network. As now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, the perinuclear signal of MMP14 co-localized with TGN46, especially in Bowes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The corresponding Western blot for Figure 5—figure supplement 1C should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we performed Western blot analysis for total β1-integrin of mono/co-cultured melanoma cell lines. Since the P5D2 antibody, used for the IFA staining in Figure 5C, does not work in Western blotting, we had to use the Abcam mouse monoclonal antibody 52971. The Western blot is included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1E (and an independent repetition shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), and reveals that LEC-co-culture induces in WM852*, WM165* and WM793* a decrease in the upper β1-integrin specific band (mature form of the integrin), and an increase in a faster migrating band, probably representing newly synthesized, immature β1-integrin. This was particularly pronounced in WM852* compared to WM852.</p><p>However, neither a decrease nor a change in β1-integrin localization were observed in the IFA analyses (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D).Therefore, to understand this discrepancy and assess the total β1-integrin levels, we analysed the levels of total β1-integrin in WM852 and WM852* by flow cytometry using two different antibodies; P5D2 (already used in IFA) and K20 antibodies (since the Abcam 52971 used for Western blot it is not suitable for FACS). As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref> we could not observe any change in the total β1-integrin levels with the P5D2 antibody (thus confirming the IFA data obtained with this same antibody) whereas with the K20 antibody we could detect about 29% decrease. Given these results, we cannot exclude that upon co-culture, especially in WM852*, the total β1-integrin level and/or maturation and trafficking processes might be altered. However, further studies would be needed to clarify this issue.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32490.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(<bold>a</bold>) Left panel: immunoblot of indicated cells lines cultured with or without LECs and separated by magnetic separation and stained with indicated antibodies.</title><p>Right panel: quantification of relative β1-integrin band intensities from two independent experiments as shown in left panel.

In agreement with the 12G10 antibody staining, we observed a significant increase in the 9EG7 signal intensity in WM852* cells. These results have been included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.

We also show the pathways altered in both cell lines after LEC priming and the pathways and genes specific for WM852 or Bowes cells (New panels in Figure 2A-C).

These treatments were followed by the 3D sprouting assay in fibrin for 96 h.</p><p>Unexpectedly, ectopic expression of MMP14 was toxic and induced cell death in WM793 already in 2D and we could not proceed for the 3D sprouting assay. However, cell viability was not affected by NICD3 expression using the same transfection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref> and Figure 6B), and the subsequent 3D fibrin assay revealed an increase in the sprouting phenotype upon NICD3 ectopic expression (new Figure 6B). In contrast, no change in the 3D growth phenotype was observed upon b1-integrin activation by 12G10 treatment (new Figure 6B-C). To further investigate the role of MMP14 and β1-integrin in the NICD3induced sprouting we treated the NICD3-expressing WM793 with the MMP14 specific inhibitor NSC405020 and a b1-integrin blocking antibody AIIB2. While the former had no effect on the sprouting phenotype, thus confirming MMP14 to be upstream of Notch3 activation, the b1integrin blocking antibody inhibited the sprouting (new Figure 6D). These new data are presented in lines (subsection “NICD3 ectopic expression is sufficient to induce 3D sprouting in non-metastatic WM793 cells”).</p><p>In Bowes cells, ectopic expression of MMP14 and NICD3 did not affect the viability of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref>). However, the singly invading Bowes cells did not change their mode of invasion upon expression of MMP14 or NICD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3C</xref>).

The zebrafish xenograft experiments and analyses were conducted in collaboration with and supervision by Dr. Ilkka Paatero, the head of zebrafish core at the Turku Centre for Biotechnology (University of Turku, Finland), and he is therefore included as a new co-author in the manuscript.

What is meant with this sentence?</p></disp-quote><p>We have further analysed our transcriptomic data which revealed intriguing differences in the genes enriched in WM852 and Bowes following LEC co-culture. We did not observe a classical cadherin or adhesion receptor switch, but did uncover significant differences between the WM852* and Bowes* cells in the genes functioning in the ECM-receptor interaction. Moreover, we also found genes enriched only in Bowes cells that are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, like focal adhesion, TGF-b signalling and tight junction pathways. These changes are now highlighted and shown in Figure 2A-C and as new panels in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B). We have also clarified the text saying that &quot;global gene expression revealed change in ECM-receptor interaction&quot;.

Despite the evidence showing that MMP14 is upstream of Notch3 and β1 integrin, the authors do not provide convincing experimental data for a MMP14-Notch3- β1 integrin axis, as claimed in the second paragraph of the Discussion. It is demonstrated that β1 integrin is needed for dissemination once Notch3 is activated. However, evidence for a direct effect of Notch3 on β1 integrin activity is missing. Instead, the findings shown in the manuscript suggest that MMP14 acts separately on Notch3 and β1 integrin. This issue requires clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the some of our text in the original, revised manuscript file was misleading, and we have therefore rephrased and tried to explain better what the results are showing (see subsection “NICD3 ectopic expression is sufficient to induce 3D sprouting in non-metastatic WM793 cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the statistics are incomplete and the quality of some images requires improvement.</p></disp-quote><p>See below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Statistics have to be provided for all graphs. This is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the required statistics for all graphs as requested.

The findings look significant to the reviewers and therefore, the authors should carefully check whether the statistics have been carried out correctly. The Notch3 mRNA increase is in good agreement with the increase of Notch3 staining shown in Figure 2 and its quantification in panel F of Figure 2—figure supplement 2?</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics for Figure 2—figure supplement 2G has now been checked carefully. The quantification represents an average of four independent experiments. Although each experiment showed an increase in the <italic>NOTCH3</italic> mRNA levels in the LEC primed WM165* compared to the WM165 from monotypic cultures, the level of increase has varied markedly between the experiments, and therefore significance was not achieved (p=0.1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4D: the Results section states that Notch3 mRNA is decreased upon MMP14 depletion.

Since this figure does not show experiments of NCID-mediated β1 integrin activation or sprouting, it would be better to change the headline to &quot;β1 integrin activity does not affect MMP14 and Notch3 expression&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this unfortunate mistake and have corrected the headline as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6D: the authors investigate WM793 cells (originally non-sprouting cells upon LEC co-culture). Treatment with NCID increases the invasive phenotype, whereas blocking β1 integrin curbs invasion indicating that β1 integrin is required for the invasive phenotype induced by active Notch3 (NCID). MMP14 inhibition does not block the invasive phenotype indicating that MMP14 is probably upstream.</p><p>Therefore, it would be more appropriate to change the title of Figure 6D to: “NCID overexpression provokes a β1 integrin-dependent 3D sprouting in WM793 cells&quot;.</p><p>Why did the authors use WM793 and not Bowe cells? Is this due to the Golgi-retained MMP14?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting a more appropriate title for Figure 6, which is now changed to the figure legends. The experiments were actually done with both WM793 and Bowes cells; however, exogenous expression of NICD3 or MMP14 did not induce a change in the 3D growth phenotype of Bowes cells. The lack of phenotype in Bowes cells was described in the original, revised manuscript in the Results section (subsection “NICD3 ectopic expression is sufficient to induce 3D sprouting in non-metastatic WM793 cells”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>: the authors show that MMP14 or NCID is sufficient to induce invasive phenotype in WM cells. Why does neither MMP14 nor NCID overexpression in Bowe cells induce the invasive phenotype? Does it mean that it is not possible to induce an invasive phenotype after overexpression of MMP14 or NCID? The absent effect of MMP14 overexpression in Bowe cells is explained by the Golgi retention of MMP14 indicating that MMP14 cell surface localisation is needed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Therefore, overexpression of NCID should be sufficient if NCID is downstream to MMP14. What is missing? The reviewers suspect that β1 integrin needs to be rendered competent by MMP14 at the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the Discussion of the previous, revised version of the manuscript the Bowes cells already have an invasive, single cell 3D sprouting phenotype, but do not grow as expansive cell colonies as WM793, WM852 and WM165. Therefore, it is possible that Bowes cannot be induced to this collective-type invasive phenotype, as it may require the expansive growth mode as a prerequisite for the LEC-mediated Notch3 dependent change in the 3D growth. However, we do not think that the lack of phenotype change in Bowes would be due to MMP14 not trafficking onto the plasma membrane, as we can see MMP14 plasma membrane localization upon its ectopic expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref> from our previous Response to Reviewers).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The electrophoretic pattern of β1 integrin is similar in WM852 and WM793 cells before and after interaction with LEC, whereas the electrophoretic pattern of β1 integrin is different in Bowe cells as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. The authors should discuss this conundrum in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The resemblance of the electrophoretic pattern of integrin β1 in WM852 and WM793 if compared to the Bowes cells may indeed indicate differences in integrin β1 processing and trafficking in Bowes and WM852/793. Thus, this could partially explain why ectopic expression of NICD3 was sufficient to induce invasive phenotype in WM793 but not in Bowes. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now discussed this conundrum in the Results section (subsection “Change in the 3D growth of LEC primed melanoma cells is integrin dependent”, first paragraph) and also in Discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>Note: One of the co-authors, Krista Ojala, just recently (as of March 12) changed her last name due to personal reasons from Ojala to Tuohinto.
