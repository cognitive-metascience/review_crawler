Centriole duplication occurs once per cell cycle and is regulated by Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4). Although significant progress has been made in understanding centriole composition, we have limited knowledge of how PLK4 activity controls specific steps in centriole formation. Here, we show that PLK4 phosphorylates its centriole substrate STIL on a conserved site, S428, to promote STIL binding to CPAP. This phospho-dependent binding interaction is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and facilitates the stable incorporation of both STIL and CPAP into the centriole. We propose that procentriole assembly requires PLK4 to phosphorylate STIL in two different regions: phosphorylation of residues in the STAN motif allow STIL to bind SAS6 and initiate cartwheel assembly, while phosphorylation of S428 promotes the binding of STIL to CPAP, linking the cartwheel to microtubules of the centriole wall.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46054.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A cell’s DNA is the chemical instruction manual for everything it does. Each cell in our bodies contains over two meters of DNA, which is divided into 46 packages of information called chromosomes. When the body needs to make more cells, for example during growth or repair, existing cells divide in two in order to replicate themselves. This means that they also need to copy all of their DNA and then deliver identical sets of chromosomes to each new cell.</p><p>Animal cells use structures called centrioles to help them divide their sets of chromosomes accurately. When cells are about to divide, they make a new set of centrioles by assembling a variety of proteins. This assembly process must be carefully controlled; if too many or too few centrioles are built, cell division errors can occur that lead to the generation of new cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes.</p><p>The enzyme PLK4 helps to assemble centrioles, but its exact role in the construction process has remained largely unknown. For example, how it might modify different components of the centriole, and why this matters, is poorly understood.</p><p>By performing cell biological and biochemical experiments using human cells, Moyer and Holland show that PLK4 interacts with a protein called STIL that is found in the central part of the centriole. The modification of STIL at a specific location by PLK4 was needed to link it to another protein in the outer wall of the centriole, and was also necessary for the cells to build new centrioles. Cells in which PLK4 was unable to modify STIL had too few centrioles when they were beginning to divide.</p><p>Testing the activity of PLK4 in fruit flies revealed that it plays a similar role as in human cells. This suggests that the modification of STIL by PLK4 is important for normal cell division across different species.</p><p>The results presented by Moyer and Holland help us to understand how dividing cells build the complex machinery that enables them to pass on their genetic material accurately. Future work that builds on these findings could provide insight into human diseases, such as brain development disorders and cancer, where centrioles are either defective or present in the wrong number.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Centriole</kwd><kwd>Centrosome</kwd><kwd>Mitosis</kwd><kwd>Microtubule</kwd><kwd>Aneuploidy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Andrew Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-16-156-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Andrew Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moyer</surname><given-names>Tyler Chistopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell biological, biochemical, and genetic analyses reveal that PLK4 controls two different phospho-dependent binding interactions that act together to promote procentriole assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrioles are microtubule-based structures that recruit a surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM) to form the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gönczy, 2012</xref>). Centrosomes nucleate the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton in interphase cells and form the poles of the mitotic spindle during cell division. In quiescent cells, centrioles dock at the plasma membrane and act as basal bodies that template the formation of cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>). Cycling cells tightly couple centriole biogenesis with cell cycle progression. Centriole duplication begins at the G1-S phase transition when a new procentriole grows perpendicularly from a single site at the proximal end of each of the two parent centrioles. In late G2 phase, the two centriole pairs separate and increase PCM recruitment to promote the formation of the mitotic spindle. At the end of mitosis, the centrosomes are equally partitioned so that each daughter cell inherits a pair of centrioles. Defects in centriole biogenesis can result in the formation of supernumerary centrosomes which promote mitotic errors that can contribute to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levine and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>).

In mammalian cells, PLK4 is recruited to the centriole during G1 phase through binding to its centriole receptors CEP152 and CEP192, which encircle the proximal end of the parent centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>). At G1-S phase transition, PLK4 transforms from a ring-like localization to a single focus on the wall of the parent centriole that marks the site of procentriole formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dzhindzhev et al., 2017</xref>).

The C-terminal TCP domain of CPAP directly binds to a highly conserved PRP motif in STIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>), while the N-terminal domain of CPAP interacts with α/β-tubulin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hung et al., 2004</xref>). These interactions allow CPAP to act as a molecular link between the cartwheel and the triplet microtubule blades of the centriole wall. Importantly, an MCPH mutation in the CPAP TCP domain weakens the STIL-CPAP interaction, highlighting the importance of this complex in centriole assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond et al., 2005</xref>). CPAP positively regulates centriolar microtubule growth and, consequently, overexpression of CPAP leads to the formation of overly long centrioles in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to its role in controlling microtubule growth, CPAP also functions in recruiting PCM, either through the direct tethering of PCM proteins or by recruiting Plk1/Polo which is critical in promoting PCM assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Novak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>At present, the binding of SAS6 to the STAN motif of STIL is the only interaction known to be controlled by PLK4 kinase activity. While the regulation of this assembly step is conserved in humans and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>), it is unclear whether this takes place in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where ZYG-1/PLK4 directly binds and recruits SAS6 to promote cartwheel assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lettman et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, although phosphomimetic mutations in the crucial PLK4 phosphorylation sites in the STAN motif of STIL are functional, they cannot support centriole duplication in the absence of PLK4 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that PLK4 must phosphorylate STIL, or other substrates, at additional sites to promote centriole assembly. Indeed, recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified additional PLK4 phosphorylation sites required for centriole biogenesis in the N-terminus of Ana2/STIL, but exactly how these phosphorylation events contribute to centriole formation remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dzhindzhev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McLamarrah et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this manuscript, we identify a conserved PLK4 phosphorylation site on STIL that promotes binding to CPAP in vitro and in vivo.

To determine whether phosphorylation of STIL by PLK4 might affect the interaction of STIL with other components of the centriole duplication machinery, we tested the ability of Myc-GFP-STIL to interact with its known centriolar binding partners in the presence of kinase active (PLK4<sup>WT</sup>) or kinase dead (PLK4<sup>KD</sup>) PLK4. Active PLK4 triggers its own degradation and thus, we used a PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutant that stabilizes the active kinase by preventing PLK4-induced autodestruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holland et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of kinase active PLK4<sup>∆24</sup>-mCherry increased the binding of STIL to SAS6 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but did not increase binding to the STIL-interacting partners RTTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) or CEP85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).

Recombinant full-length GST-STIL was phosphorylated with the His-PLK4 kinase domain in vitro. Of the 84 in vitro phosphorylation sites we identified on STIL, S428 was of particular interest as it is highly conserved, matches the PLK4 consensus phosphorylation sequence and is positioned close to the known CPAP binding region on STIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kettenbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</xref>).

The expression of kinase active PLK4 promoted a &gt; 7 fold increase in the amount of CPAP bound to WT STIL, but this increased binding was not observed with STIL S428A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test if this phospho-regulated binding interaction can be reconstituted with purified components, we performed GST-pull down experiments on recombinant WT or S428A GST-STIL that had been phosphorylated with the His-PLK4 kinase domain and then incubated with a recombinant Flag-CPAP TCP domain. Phosphorylation of WT GST-STIL with PLK4 increased binding to the Flag-TCP domain by ~2.5 fold, but this increased binding was not observed with STIL S428A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The use of the CPAP TCP domain rather than full-length protein may explain the more modest increase in CPAP binding to STIL in vitro compared to in vivo.

Expression of Myc-STIL S1116A did not increase GFP-CPAP turnover, indicating that the increase in GFP-CPAP turnover in a Myc-STIL S428A background reflects a specific defect in the STIL/CPAP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, GFP-CPAP, Myc-STIL S1116A background, R% = 55%). These data suggest that STIL binding allows a more stable incorporation of CPAP into the centrosome, possibly by facilitating interactions with CPAP at the procentriole. However, since the depletion of STIL resulted in a higher level of CPAP turnover than specifically disrupting the STIL/CPAP interaction, it is likely STIL recruits additional proteins that collectively act to stabilize the incorporation of CPAP into the centrosome. Together, our data show that the interaction of CPAP with STIL allows both proteins to incorporate more stably into the centrosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mutations in the CPAP TCP domain cause less stable CPAP incorporation into the centrosome</title><p>To better understand the requirement of the STIL/CPAP interaction in centriole duplication, we constructed an RNAi-replacement system in DLD-1 cells where endogenous CPAP was depleted by siRNA and replaced with near physiological levels (~2–3 fold higher) of an siRNA-resistant Myc-GFP-CPAP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, we have a limited understanding of which assembly steps are controlled by PLK4 to maintain the number of centrioles in cycling cells. Our data now establish that PLK4 phosphorylates its centriole substrate STIL on a conserved site close to the PRP motif to promote STIL binding to CPAP in vitro and in vivo. The STIL/CPAP complex is only the second binding interaction shown to be controlled by PLK4 and highlights a new regulated step in centriole assembly.</p><p>Our data lead us to propose a model whereby active PLK4 phosphorylates STIL at the site of procentriole assembly in two different regions with distinct functional consequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): phosphorylation of multiple residues in the STAN motif, most notably S1116, allows STIL binding to SAS6 to promote cartwheel assembly. Second, phosphorylation of S428 promotes the binding of the STIL PRP motif to CPAP, thereby linking the growing cartwheel to the triplet microtubules of the centriole wall. This model is consistent with our analysis of de novo centriole assembly, which showed that phosphorylation of the STIL STAN motif is required to recruit SAS6 to the site of procentriole assembly while phosphorylation of STIL S428 is required at a later stage to recruit CPAP to the cartwheel. Moreover, super-resolution imaging of <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrioles has revealed that the C-terminal region of Ana2/STIL containing the STAN motif is located closer to the cartwheel hub, while the N-terminal region containing the PRP motif is positioned close to the C-terminus of Sas-4/CPAP at the periphery of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gartenmann et al., 2017</xref>).

In the absence of STIL S428 phosphorylation, STIL is able to recruit SAS6 and promote cartwheel assembly. However, STIL S428A fails to recruit CPAP and link the cartwheel to the microtubule wall, leading to a failure of de novo centriole assembly.

We envisage two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, although sharing obvious similarities, de novo centriole assembly may have some distinct requirements compared with canonical centriole biogenesis. For example, the presence of a parent centriole may help direct CPAP recruitment to the site of procentriole assembly; CPAP localized in the PCM could be recruited to the procentriole by some of CPAP’s other interacting partners in the absence of STIL S428 phosphorylation. A second possibility is that multiple pools of CPAP at the centrosome (parent centriole, procentriole and PCM associated) may obscure the ability to accurately monitor the role of STIL phosphorylation in CPAP recruitment at the nascent procentriole. In any case, it is clear that even if the STIL-CPAP interaction is not strictly necessary for the recruitment of either protein to canonically duplicating centrioles, it does allow for the more stable integration of these proteins into the centrosome.</p><p>A previous study solved the structure of the CPAP TCP domain bound to a short STIL peptide (residues 395–416) containing the PRP motif but lacking the S428 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>). A central question that now emerges is how phosphorylation of S428, which is positioned ~20 amino acids downstream of the core PRP interaction motif in STIL, promotes binding to CPAP in cells. We envisage two, non-mutually exclusive possibilities. First, phosphorylation creates an extended binding interface that increases the affinity of STIL to CPAP. Indeed, sequence conservation in the CPAP TCP domain is not confined to the region that directly interacts with the PRP motif of STIL, but extends further along the surface of the TCP domain beta sheet, suggesting that additional contacts with STIL may occur in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, there is high conservation around the S428 phosphorylation site on STIL, and this conserved motif was proposed to be well positioned to form an extended interaction interface with conserved residues in the CPAP TCP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation of STIL S428 could, therefore, seed the binding of this conserved region and cooperatively enhance the binding of STIL to CPAP.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that S428 phosphorylation generates a conformational change that unmasks the PRP motif in STIL and exposes it for binding to CPAP. In support of this model, work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that phosphorylation of the homologous site (S38) on Ana2/STIL leads to a dramatic mobility shift in an SDS page gel that is likely to reflect a significant conformational change in Ana2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dzhindzhev et al., 2017</xref>). It is notable that <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAS-5/STIL lacks an obvious PRP motif, but directly binds to SAS-4/CPAP through a disordered region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the SAS-4/CPAP TCP domain is required for the incorporation of SAS-4 into the centriole in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. SAS-5 has also been shown to bind to microtubules through a region that overlaps with the SAS-4 binding domain, suggesting that the interaction of SAS-5 with microtubules and SAS-4 may be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PLK4 promotes centriole duplication by phosphorylating STIL to link the procentriole cartwheel to the microtubule wall&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jordan W Raff (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Moyer and Holland provide compelling evidence that PLK4 phosphorylates STIL to promote its interaction with CPAP and so to promote centriole assembly. Although a similar phosphorylation event has previously been characterised by the Glover and Rogers groups for the fly homologue of STIL (Ana2), the reviewers agreed that the consequences of this phosphorylation described here were of sufficient novelty and general interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers raised a number of important concerns, however, that will need to be addressed prior to acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relative level of expression of all the proteins tested here should be compared to the endogenous levels of expression. This information was provided in some experiments, but not in others.</p><p>2) The reasons for using the PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutation, and for using a form of PLK4 lacking the Polo boxes (potentially altering substrate specificity) for the in vitro kinase assays need to be stated more clearly. It would also help to put the results in Supplementary file 1 into a fuller context by reporting how many of the identified phosphorylation sites match the PLK4 consensus, and how many serines and threonines were not phosphorylated (and how many of these are conserved and/or conform to the consensus).</p><p>3) Statistical analysis of the data was inconsistent and was often lacking. This led to some confusion as to what you describe as &quot;significant&quot;. In particular your statement that &quot;the phosphorylation of STIL S428 in human cells does not play a significant role in the centrioles recruitment of STIL&quot; seems too strong in light of the data shown in Figure 3C (although the lack of statistics make it difficult to be sure). Statistics should be applied to all the relevant data (and the methods used fully explained in each figure legend).</p><p>4) You point out towards the end of the paper that STIL is present on only the procentriole, whereas CPAP is present on both the mother centriole and the procentriole. This is potentially important for the interpretation of some of the localisation and FRAP experiments and should be stated much earlier in the manuscript. This leads to some potential confusion. For example, you conclude that the recruitment of the majority of CPAP present at the centrosome does not require STIL. At a first glance, this might seem to overturn the conventional wisdom that STIL recruits CPAP to the assembling daughter centriole, when, in fact, your data is largely consistent with this possibility (see, for example, Figure 3F, where it seems that CPAP is localised at the older centriole normally, but is not recruited to the new centriole in the presence of the S428A mutation). Thus, your quantification of total centrosome fluorescence, rather than individual centriole fluorescence, may be somewhat misleading to readers not paying careful attention. It seems you believe that STIL is recruiting CPAP to the procentriole, but is not required to maintain CPAP at mother centrioles that have already formed (presumably prior to the depletion of STIL) – but your thinking on this only becomes clear in the Discussion. These points need to be presented more clearly. We think it would be helpful if you can provide simple schematics that illustrate your interpretation of what is occurring in the localisation and FRAP studies where this is an issue. This may require some thought.</p><p>5) The centrinone washout experiment is a good attempt to get at the requirement for STIL phosphorylation in a simplified system where new centrioles form free of a mother centriole. However, in the absence of EM evidence, we think you need to be more cautious about the nature of the various foci that are observed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PLK4 promotes centriole duplication by phosphorylating STIL to link the procentriole cartwheel to the microtubule wall&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. We decided there was no need to go back to the original reviewers as we feel that there are only a small number of remaining issues that will need to be addressed prior to acceptance, outlined below:</p><p>1) You now show the levels of expression relative to the endogenous proteins for all your transgenically expressed proteins, but we think it important to state in the main text that you estimate that these are over expressed by ~2-3 fold and your arguments as to why this is not a problem.</p><p>2) You should state why the DmPLK4<sup>SBM</sup> protein is stabilised and what SBM stands for.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46054.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relative level of expression of all the proteins tested here should be compared to the endogenous levels of expression.

The expression of the Myc-GFP-STIL transgenes are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B and is ~ 2-3-fold above that of endogenous STIL. In addition, in Figure 5B we show that the expression of the Myc-GFP-CPAP transgene is ~2-3-fold above that of endogenous CPAP. Although both the Myc-GFP-STIL and Myc-GFP-CPAP transgenes are overexpressed, expression of either transgene efficiently rescued centriole duplication failure after depletion of the respective endogenous protein and resulted in minimal centriole overduplication (Figure 3A and 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reasons for using the PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutation, and for using a form of PLK4 lacking the Polo boxes (potentially altering substrate specificity) for the in vitro kinase assays need to be stated more clearly.

Consequently, kinase active PLK4 is extremely unstable and difficult to express in cells. We therefore used a PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutant that lacks the phosphorylation sites required for self-destruction. The PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutant also accumulates to the same level independent of kinase activity, which avoids the complication of having different levels of expression for kinase active and inactive PLK4. We have added the following sentence to the text to clarify this point: “Active PLK4 triggers its own degradation and thus, we used a PLK4<sup>∆24</sup> mutant that stabilizes the kinase by preventing PLK4-induced autodestruction.”</p><p>As the reviewers correctly pointed out, the in vitro kinase assays and pull-down experiments were carried out with a His-PLK4 kinase domain and not full-length recombinant PLK4. The reason for this is technical. First, full-length PLK4 is difficult to express and purify recombinantly. While we have succeeded in doing this in the past, the full-length GST-PLK4 protein is low-yield and less active than the kinase domain alone. Second, we have only succeeded in expressing PLK4 with the large solubility tag GST and in the in vitro pull-down experiments GST was used to pull-down on STIL. It was therefore more convenient to use a different affinity tag for PLK4 in this assay and we already had recombinant His-PLK4 kinase domain at hand. Finally, kinases in vitro are considered to be relatively promiscuous and therefore these assays should be treated with caution. Our interpretation is only that PLK4 <italic>can</italic> phosphorylate the residues we identify on STIL, but we are careful not to propose that PLK4 phosphorylates all of these sites in vivo. We have added the following sentence to the Results section to make it clear that our in vitro kinase assay used the PLK4 kinase domain and not the full-length protein: “Recombinant full-length GST-STIL was phosphorylated with the His-PLK4 kinase domain in vitro.” We also more clearly highlight that the sites we identified are considered in vitro phosphorylation sites. “Of the 84 in vitro phosphorylation sites we identified on STIL, S428 was of particular interest as it is highly conserved, matches the PLK4 consensus phosphorylation sequence and is positioned close to the known CPAP binding region on STIL…”</p><p>Finally, we have added information to Supplementary file 1 to clarify how many serine and threonine residues were not phosphorylated by His-PLK4 kinase domain and how many of these sites matched the PLK4 consensus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical analysis of the data was inconsistent and was often lacking.

Thus, your quantification of total centrosome fluorescence, rather than individual centriole fluorescence, may be somewhat misleading to readers not paying careful attention. It seems you believe that STIL is recruiting CPAP to the procentriole, but is not required to maintain CPAP at mother centrioles that have already formed (presumably prior to the depletion of STIL) – but your thinking on this only becomes clear in the Discussion. These points need to be presented more clearly. We think it would be helpful if you can provide simple schematics that illustrate your interpretation of what is occurring in the localisation and FRAP studies where this is an issue. This may require some thought.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our presentation of these data was not optimal. We have now modified the text to more clearly present our interpretation of this data, while at the same time being careful to not to overinterpret our findings. We have also reordered the presentation of the results and added a more detailed discussion of these experiments immediately after the data is presented. In summary, our data suggests that the CPAP-STIL interaction is required for the stable incorporation of both proteins at the centrosome, but specifically disrupting this interaction doesn’t have a major impact on the degree to which either protein accumulates at the centrosome. Nevertheless, depletion of STIL does significantly increase the turnover of CPAP and decreases CPAP localization to the centrosome. This suggests that STIL recruits additional proteins that collectively act to stabilize the incorporation of CPAP into the centrosome.</p><p>To clarify our interpretation, we have added the following discussion of the CPAP turnover data: “While STIL is uniquely localized to the procentriole, CPAP is present at both the parent centriole and procentriole. […] Nevertheless, given STIL localizes exclusively to the procentriole, one interpretation of our data is that STIL is required for the stable incorporation of CPAP at the procentriole, while the parental centriole and PCM pool of CPAP are dynamic and display a transient association with the centrosome.”</p><p>We also state, “These data suggest that STIL binding allows a more stable incorporation of CPAP into the centrosome, possibly by facilitating interactions with CPAP at the procentriole. However, since the depletion of STIL resulted in a higher level of CPAP turnover than specifically disrupting the STIL/CPAP interaction, it is likely that STIL recruits additional proteins that collectively act to stabilize the incorporation of CPAP into the centrosome.”</p><p>Later in the Results, we state: “This suggests a model in which CPAP is localized to the parent centriole independently of STIL, while procentriole localized CPAP requires STIL for stable binding. […] We conclude that the recruitment of the majority of CPAP present at the centrosome does not require CPAP binding to STIL.”</p><p>Although the CPAP-STIL interaction is not required for the bulk of CPAP recruitment to the centrosome, our analysis of de novo formed centrioles shows that STIL binding to CPAP is required for the recruitment of CPAP to the site of de novo centriole formation. We present two possible explanations for this discrepancy in the Discussion: “Although recruitment of CPAP to assembling de novo centrioles requires STIL S428 phosphorylation, this modification is not required for recruiting the bulk of CPAP to the centrosome. […] In any case, it is clear that even if the STIL-CPAP interaction is not strictly necessary for the recruitment of either protein to canonically duplicating centrioles, it does allow for the more stable integration of these proteins into the centrosome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The centrinone washout experiment is a good attempt to get at the requirement for STIL phosphorylation in a simplified system where new centrioles form free of a mother centriole. However, in the absence of EM evidence, we think you need to be more cautious about the nature of the various foci that are observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important consideration. We considered carrying out EM to confirm that the various STIL foci we observed were centrioles (for WT STIL), or centriole cartwheels (for STIL S428A). However, after consulting with an expert in the EM field, we came to the conclusion that we would not be able to detect free-standing cartwheel structures formed with the STIL S428A mutant using EM. Identifying centriole cartwheels using EM is exceedingly challenging and requires the presence of an existing centriole to direct the search area. Since we do not have EM to support our claims that the STIL foci we are observing are bone fide centrioles or free-standing cartwheels, we modified the text to state the recruitment of proteins to “STIL foci” as opposed to sites of “de novo centriole assembly”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) You now show the levels of expression relative to the endogenous proteins for all your transgenically expressed proteins, but we think it important to state in the main text that you estimate that these are over expressed by ~2-3 fold and your arguments as to why this is not a problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your suggestion.
