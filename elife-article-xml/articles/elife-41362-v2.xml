for animals in adapting to variable environments. The migratory locust exhibits body color polyphenism between solitary and gregarious individuals, with the former displaying a uniform green coloration and the latter having a prominent pattern of black dorsal and brown ventral surface. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the density-dependent body color changes of conspecific locusts remain largely unknown. Here, we found that upregulation of β-carotene-binding protein promotes the accumulation of red pigment, which added to the green color palette present in solitary locusts changes it from green to black, and that downregulation of this protein led to the reverse, changing the color of gregarious locusts from black to green. Our results provide insight that color changes of locusts are dependent on variation in the red β-carotene pigment binding to βCBP. This finding of animal coloration corresponds with trichromatic theory of color vision.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Locusta migratoria</italic></kwd><kwd>body color change</kwd><kwd>β-carotene-binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31430023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31472051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Meiling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31672364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jianzhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Meiling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31802018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Graduate Student Education Innovation Project of Shanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016BY017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program - XDB11010200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Plan for Scientific Research and Development of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1200603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Meiling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Plan for Scientific Research and Development of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFD0200406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Meiling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Body color change of locusts reveals a new 'palette effect' mechanism by which the red βCBP–β-carotene pigment complex acts as a switch to coordinate between black and green coloration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Body color change is a ubiquitous but highly diverse phenomenon of adaptive significance to animals under exposure to illnesses, environmental changes, predation, and sexual signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burmeister et al., 2005</xref>;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teyssier et al., 2015</xref>). Seasonal switching between color phases in response to extrinsic environmental factors is common in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Futahashi and Fujiwara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Futahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moran and Jarvik, 2010</xref>). However, rapid and reversible color change is a rare trait regulated by endogenous and exogenous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuthill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubbard et al., 2010</xref>). This type of phenotypic plasticity has not been well investigated.</p><p>Rapid body color changes in arthropods such as aphids, locusts and grasshoppers, lepidopteran caterpillars, and spider mites are influenced by environmental changes, especially by changes in population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tabadkani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valverde and Schielzeth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). Locust body color changes are of particular interest because conspecific color change coincides with changes in population density as well as behavioral changes; specifically, dramatic individual color change from green to black occurs when locusts form agriculturally destructive swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to that of other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuthill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2017</xref>), the coloration of locusts serves as a dynamic form of population information.</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity in the migratory locust <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> underlies the transition between the gregarious and solitary phases, which are dependent on population density changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to behavioral differences between the two phases of locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), remarkable body color changes between gregarious and solitary locusts occur. Solitary locusts found at low population densities have a uniform green coloration, whereas gregarious locusts develop a striking color pattern of a black back with a contrasting brown ventral color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pener, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The black-brown pattern of gregarious locusts is recognized as mainly being induced under high-density crowding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pener, 1991</xref>). Regarding the regulatory mechanism, juvenile hormones reportedly induce solitary green cuticular coloration in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Applebaum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tanaka, 1993</xref>). However, the regulatory function of these hormones in body coloration during phase change remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>). The neuropeptide [His7]-corazonin induces a dark coloration of the whole body in locusts but does not regulate the phase-related black–brown color pattern in gregarious locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kang, 2014</xref>). Silencing the <italic>ebony</italic> and <italic>pale</italic> genes in the dopamine pathway that leads to the synthesis of dopamine melanin can result in partial fading of the black color in gregarious locusts, but the exogenous injection of dopamine does not completely lead to the black pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the body color pattern of gregarious locusts is not the result of pure melanization.</p><p>The green color of solitary locusts is likely due to the presence of a combination of yellow and blue pigments that facilitate the camouflage of low-density locusts in the background of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pener and Simpson, 2009</xref>). In the present study, we investigated whether the black coloration of gregarious locusts results from the addition of pigments to the solitary green background.</p><p>We used strand-specific high-throughput RNA sequencing to monitor genome-wide transcriptional expression profiles and verify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) correlated with color polymorphism. We found a key DEG that encodes β-carotene-binding protein (βCBP), which promotes body color change associated with phase-related coloration. The manipulation of the gene expression by RNAi and feeding of β-carotene led to the reverse of body color of the locusts. The results of our study reveal that the black–brown coloration pattern in gregarious locusts is formed by the presence of the red color β-carotene pigment–βCBP protein complex in the green-colored background of solitary locusts. This work provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of body color changes in response to population density changes in accordance with the corresponding environmental changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gregarious and solitary locusts have different expression levels of βCBP</title><p>Gregarious and solitary locusts were reared either in crowded conditions or in solitude as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>).

To delineate gene activity changes potentially associated with the regulation of phase-dependent body color traits, we performed transcriptome sequencing on pronotum integuments of gregarious and solitary locusts. We identified a total of 1653 DEGs between the gregarious and solitary locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and 26% (430) of these DEGs were protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of these 430 protein-coding DEGs indicated that many of them encode cuticle metabolism-related proteins involved in chitin metabolic, melatonin metabolic, transport, and catecholamine catabolic activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Sixty-eight of the 430 protein-coding DEGs are involved in pathways associated with animal coloration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The top 17 DEGs (Log FC &gt; 2.8, FDR &lt; 1e-5) of these 68 genes were used to validate the differential expression patterns between the gregarious and solitary locusts via qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Nine of the 17 genes showed higher transcriptional levels in the pronotum integuments of the gregarious locusts than in those of the solitary locusts, and the transcriptional levels of 6 of the 17 genes were significantly lower in the gregarious locusts than in the solitary locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results are consistent with the transcriptome data. Among the 17 genes, we investigated the top 8 DEGs (the difference fold of gene expression between gregarious and solitary locusts &gt; 3), among which six had higher expression in the gregarious locusts and two had higher expression in the solitary locusts, to screen the key candidate genes involved in the color change.</p><p>To explore whether these eight genes regulate body color plasticity during locust phase transition, we carried out transcript knockdown analyses of these genes in the gregarious and solitary locusts. Out of the eight genes, only <italic>βCBP</italic> showed a significant effect on the regulation of body color transition although the other seven genes show a very significant decreased expression when they were silenced respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After molting, the dark pattern in the pronotum decreased markedly in 60% of the gregarious locusts after <italic>βCBP</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data imply that <italic>CBP</italic> serves as a key gene involved in body color change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phase-related characteristics of the <italic>βCBP</italic> gene in integument</title><p>To investigate the correlation of βCBP expression level with the degree of black body coloration of the locust integument, we performed quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) and found that <italic>βCBP</italic> was predominantly expressed in the locust integument tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The change of body color occurs as an adaptive response to population density change. In high density, the gregarious locusts adopt the black-brown color pattern as alarm coloration against the predation by natural enemies, because they inevitably expose themselves to the environment. The green solitary locusts can hide themselves through the color confusion with the background of plants. The black–brown pattern in the gregarious locusts resulted from the superposition or balancing effect of a red pigment on the green background of solitary locusts rather than complete melanogenesis. Crowding treatment increased the βCBP levels in the integuments and caused body color change in the solitary locusts by the binding of βCBP with β-carotenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The βCBP expression in solitary locusts was not induced by merely feeding with β-carotene without crowding treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the body color changes of solitary locusts that were induced to form gregarious-like body coloration must rely on crowding treatment and feeding the β-carotene, because only crowding treatment can promote the βCBP expression for βCBP–β-carotene complex production. Thus, population density of locusts acts as necessary and sufficient condition to drive the changes of body coloration. Generally, body color changes are driven by gene changes to adapt with a broad range of environments. For instance, the melanocortin-1 receptor gene regulates melanin production associated with black hair and skin in human and mouse pigmentation responsed to ultraviolet-light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Orazio et al., 2006</xref>). The major honest signaling of red carotenoids in Zebrafinch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mundy et al., 2016</xref>) is thought to be the beak, colored in orange thanks to the ketolase activity encoded by the cytochrome P450 gene which was recruited from an ancestral function in retinal oil droplets. Although several studies have investigated the role of gene-environment in animal coloration, convergent phenotypes commonly arise from a single pigment-mediated independent change. Our study reveals a different mechanism in which βCBP, as a red signaling, has an integrative and palette effect on black and green body color change depending on the population density in locusts.</p><p>In our study, single βCBP or β-carotene cannot produce pigment deposition in the black tergum integuments of the locusts. βCBP only combine β-carotene to form red pigment complex for producing the black pattern of gregarious locusts. Previous studies in other species indicated that pigment-binding protein can uptake and bind pigment to affect coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakudoh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakudoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). In the silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, the yellow cocoon color is determined by the carotenoid-binding protein gene, which controls the uptake of carotenoids in the silk gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakudoh et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Carotenoid-binding protein</italic> mutation produces colorless hemolymph and white cocoons, indicating that carotenoid-binding protein plays a central role in cocoon color pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakudoh et al., 2007</xref>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014a</xref></italic>). Mammals often obtain carotenoids by eating plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avalos and Carmen Limón, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toews et al., 2017</xref>). Once absorbed, carotenoids are transported by lipoproteins, which are homologs of CBP in insects, through the bloodstream to the target tissues. In this process, the abundance and nature of lipoproteins limit the capacity to obtain carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGraw, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, β-carotene-binding protein, as a key mediator of body color production, controls β-carotene content and absorption to produce red color, which is superposed on the background color of gregarious locus to yield the black pattern. In our present study, transcriptome analysis did not enrich the expression differentiation of catecholamine biosynthesis genes, which are considered involvement in the phase changes of the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate the discrepancy mainly due to the different tissues sampling. In fact, they sampled the heads of the locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), and our samples are from the pronotum of the locusts.</p><p>Our results show that the black pattern of gregarious locusts is caused by the interaction and mixture of different pigments. This pigment interaction has a colored palette effect that results in black coloration due to the accumulation of red color β-carotene pigments in the presence of blue and yellow pigments. The disappearance of the red pigment in the gregarious locusts led to the emergence of green color, which is the typical body color of solitary locusts. By elucidating the mechanism by which different types of pigments interact to create transitions among color polyphenism, this study provides new information that could be useful for analyzing color transitions in other organisms. In <italic>Heliconius erato</italic> and <italic>Agraulis vanillae</italic>, optix is required for the red color pattern and coordinates between the ommochrome (orange and red) and melanin (black and gray) pigment types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Parrots acquire their colors through regulatory changes that drive the high expression of MuPKS in feather epithelia, which appear green when the blue and yellow pigments are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooke et al., 2017</xref>). The green color of the integument in two species of locusts, the migratory locust and desert locust (<italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>) is obtained from a mixture of blue biliverdin pigment and yellow carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodwin, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodwin and Srisukh, 1951</xref>). One of carotenoid binding proteins can bind with yellow pigments. For example, carotenoid binding protein plays a key role in the yellow cocoon pigmentation by binding with yellow carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tabunoki et al., 2004</xref>). As expected, the expression levels of a <italic>biliverdin-binding protein</italic> and a <italic>carotenoid-binding protein</italic> in the pronotum integument were not significantly different between the gregarious and solitary locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the contents of blue biliverdin and yellow carotenoid are the same in gregarious and solitary locusts. Thus, our results suggest a colored palette mechanism of body color change, with the change from typical gregarious-phased coloration (black) to solitary-phased coloration (green) is dependent on the extent of red β-carotene bound to βCBP.</p><p>The color polyphenism of gregarious and solitary locusts reflects an adaptive strategy to respond to changes in population density and the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simões et al., 2016</xref>), which is consistent with the strategies of other animals when encountering different selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuthill et al., 2017</xref>). The multi-coloured pattern of black back with a contrasting brown ventral color in gregarious locusts functioned as effective warning coloration signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sword et al., 2000</xref>), providing mutual recognition to conspecifics and warning signal against predators in swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sword, 1999</xref>). Potential predators, such as birds or and frogs (with tetrachromatic vision or trichromatic vision) could distinguish aposematic color visual signals as indicators of unpalatability and move on without an attempted attack. This phenomenon is consistent with other studies, showing that vertebrate predators more readily learn to avoid conspicuous prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guilford and Cuthill, 1991</xref>). Therefore, the expression of density-dependent warning coloration can result in a substantial decrease in predation on locusts in high-density population. This destabilization of predator-prey interactions could facilitate further population growth and gregarization which can ultimately lead to outbreaks. In addition, crowding stimuli, including the stress of a high population density and emission of an aggregative pheromone, may induce group migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sword, 2002</xref>). By contrast, the uniform cryptic color of solitary locusts may reduce the likelihood of detection and risk of predation, similar to the role of crypsis in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hemmi et al., 2006</xref>). Animal coloration is a prominent phenotypical feature that serves multiple important functions, including social signaling, antipredator defense, parasitic exploitation, thermoregulation, and protection from ultraviolet light, microbes, and abrasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuthill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms of color variation are highly conserved and can offer insights into the adaptive evolution of gene regulation. Our study shows a new ‘palette effect’ mechanism by which the red βCBP–β-carotene pigment complex can act as a switch to coordinate between black and green coloration. This mechanism of color pattern change may be evolutionarily conserved among multiple species, although additional functional work is needed to assess this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p>All insects used in the experiments were reared in the same locust colonies at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Red and black: A β-carotene-binding protein carrying a red pigment regulates body-color transition in locusts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Shannon Olsson as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by K. VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Michel Gibert (Reviewer #2); Uwe Irion (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The proximate and ultimate mechanisms of coloration in the animal kingdom are of core interest to a large number of fields, from developmental biology to animal behavior. The striking coloration change of locusts while shifting to their gregarious phase has been a key attribute to identify their associated behavioral changes. As such, identifying the genetic and biochemical source of this coloration is of great interest and relevance.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here, the authors identify a specific β-carotene binding protein that becomes elevated in certain body parts during solitary-gregarious phase change. This binding protein, when complexed to β-carotene, produces a red pigment that on the standing green cuticular background becomes dark brown/black, giving gregarious locusts their unique patterning. The authors first performed a transcriptome analysis of the two morphs and identified 68 genes involved in animal coloration whose expression was modulated between morphs. They chose the top 17 of these genes for RT-qPCR validation and focus later on one of these genes: the gene encoding Β-carotene binding protein. The authors show convincingly using RNAi experiments, controlled diets, crowding/isolation conditions, immuno-staining and electron microscopy, that β-carotene and β-carotene binding protein act jointly for the deposition of β-carotene in the integument of the gregarious morphs. The authors find that expression of the gene encoding βCBP is significantly up-regulated in gregarious v. solitary locusts coinciding with a colour change to black/brown from green. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the β-carotene binding protein actually binds carotene and that knock-down of the gene leads to a (partial) body colour change back to green.</p><p>In general, the experiments are well performed, discussed, and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers have some important considerations to improve the clarity and accuracy of the results and conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Two-part titles and/or punctuation are to be avoided:</p><p>In the interests of style and clarity, the titles of <italic>eLife</italic> research papers should not use colons, dashes, exclamation marks, or brackets (unless needed for scientific reasons). Two-part titles should also be avoided (though some exceptions can be made for Tools and Resources). Please revise your title with this advice in mind.</p><p>2) RT-qPCR analyses:</p><p>First, only one gene (Β-actin) is used as an internal control. Standards require several genes to be used as internal controls. Furthermore, it is not explained how the relative expression levels are quantified. Precise methods using the calculated efficiency of the primers such as the Pfaffl method should be used. Kindly refer to Bustin et al., 2009 (The MIQEGuidelines: Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments). The authors are advised to perform additional RT-qPCR on at least one more control gene and explain how expression levels were calculated for all RT-qPCR experiments.</p><p>Also, RT-qPCR primers are given in Supplementary file 1 for βCBP, and actin but not for the other 16 genes whose expression was quantified in Figure 1C. The primers used to measure the expression of biliverdin-binding protein gene and carotenoid-binding protein in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 are also missing. The sequences of missing primers should be provided.</p><p>3) Source of Pigmentation:</p><p>While the role of β-CBP is well supported, it may not be the only source of coloration. It would be good for the authors to acknowledge and clarify the role of other proteins. For example, The authors state that they carried out transcript knock-down analyses of the top 8 DEGs and found that only βCBP showed a significant effect. Please clarify what is meant by &quot;Top 8&quot;, and clarify their criteria for inclusion of DEGs. The data for the knock-down efficiency should be provided for all transcripts; e.g. Phenoloxidase shows a very significant differential expression, but the knock-down has no effect on colouration. Importantly, the authors also state that they &quot;…show that the black pattern of gregarious locusts is not caused by an increase in melanin…&quot;. If they want to uphold this statement they should determine whether melanin is present in the gregarious locusts, or if the black colour is indeed produced solely by the combination of yellow, blue and red pigments.</p><p>4) Previous studies:</p><p>There seems to be a discrepancy between the data in this current manuscript and those published by Ma et al., 2011, where catecholamine biosynthesis genes were found to be up-regulated in gregarious locusts. Here, it appears that in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 up-regulation of catecholamine catabolic, catechol-containing catabolic and dopamine catabolic GOs are reported.</p><p>5) Statistics:</p><p>Please provide more details for the statistics, including assumptions on normality and homoscedasticity, p-values, F, SS, SSmean and degrees of freedom for all cases. Please also indicate in figures which test was used (e.g. Figure 2 column H used Tukey post hoc tests). Furthermore, no statistical tests are performed to analyze some of the experiments, while terms such as &quot;significant effect&quot; are provided in the text (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Figure 4A, B and C). Please clarify this with appropriate tests or correct wording.</p><p>6) Isolation experiments:</p><p>Please clarify the coupled injection of RNAi against BetaCBP and isolation of the injected individuals in experiments corresponding to Figure 4A and 4C. As both of these treatments should separately decrease the expression of βCBP gene, it is unclear why they are coupled.</p><p>7) Trichromatic Rule:</p><p>The trichromatic rule support is interesting, particularly when insects are not trichromatic. The authors should discuss this in relation to the potential role of this pigmentation to locust fitness. The authors note: &quot;The contrasting body coloration of gregarious locusts may allow mutual recognition and warning against predators in swarms.&quot;. Since insects are not trichromatic, it would be good to acknowledge this and also discuss how these patterns might be seen by various animals (and why).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A β-carotene-binding protein carrying a red pigment regulates body-color transition between green and black in locusts&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor. And 2 reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved and all reviewers agree that it provides a significant contribution to the field. However, there remain some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) For RT-qPCR, the authors tested RP49 and GAPDH in addition to Β-actin for normalization. They write that Β-actin is the most stable gene because its M value is 0.488 and chose to use only this gene for normalization. However, the authors should report the M value all tested genes, and use the geometric mean of the expression of the two most stable control genes (or of the three control genes if these M values are not too distant from one another) as advised in Vandesompele et al., 2002. Furthermore, to calculate the relative expression it is recommended to use the Pfaffl method (Pfaffl, 2001) (cited in Bustin et al., 2009) as the method used in the manuscript (2-ΔΔCT) is known not to be reliable.</p><p>2) While the authors did address several of the criticisms presented in the initial review, these are clarified only in the rebuttal letter and not the text. All data and calculations should be also mentioned in the manuscript text (Results and/or Materials and methods) as well, e.g.: a) Add M values for all tested genes and calculations of expression (Rebuttal Letter Point 2).</p><p>b) Add explanation of discrepancy with Ma et al., 2011 (Rebuttal Letter Point 4).</p><p>c) Add explanation of coupled injection of RNAi against ΒCBP and isolation of injected individuals (Rebuttal Letter Point 6).</p><p>d) Please clarify what &quot;warning&quot; (i.e. which locust defense systems) the &quot;warning coloration&quot; provides a signal for with references (Rebuttal Letter Point 7).</p><p>3) We appreciate the authors attention to English, but there remain several small typos in the text, e.g.:</p><p>a) &quot;…the other seven genes show a very significant…&quot;</p><p>b) &quot;significantly reduced&quot; where is the statistical test here? Otherwise, remove the term significant.</p><p>c) – &quot;…locusts adopt the black-brown color pattern as alarm coloration against the predation by natural enemies, because they inevitably expose themselves to the environment…&quot;</p><p>d) &quot;third instar nymph stage&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41362.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Two-part titles and/or punctuation are to be avoided:</p><p>In the interests of style and clarity, the titles of eLife research papers should not use colons, dashes, exclamation marks, or brackets (unless needed for scientific reasons).

We assessed three reference genes (<italic>β-actin, RP49, GAPDH</italic>) for their suitability in the locusts. Specificities of primers were confirmed by the presence of a single peak in melting curve analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The PCR efficiency of these candidate reference genes and βCBP ranged from 97%-103%, and the correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) ranged from 0.991 to 0.998, which were within the commonly reported range of qRT-PCR, according to the method described by Bustin et al. (Bustin et al., 2009). We compared the expression levels of these genes in different nymph stage of gregarious and solitary locusts. The expression stability of these genes was evaluated using geNorm algorithms (Vandesompele et al., 2002). All candidate genes were ranked based on the average expression stability values (M) values. By comparison, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, gene expression stability, the most stable genes were <italic>β-actin</italic> (M = 0.488).

The <italic>genes</italic>are<italic>expressed</italic>ina<italic>tissue-specific pattern</italic>. In the paper by Ma et al., 2011, the head tissues of gregarious and solitary locusts were used for microarray analysis due to the <italic>tissue</italic>-<italic>specific</italic> high level of key genes involved in catecholamine metabolic pathway. They found that the genes pale and henna were expressed at a higher level in gregarious head tissues than in solitary head tissues by qRT-PCR.

Consequently, this data are not discrepancy compared to the result in the paper by Ma et al., 2011. On the other hand, our previous study (Ma et al., 2011) indicated that the silences of the genes in dopamine pathway can make the black pallescent, do not result in body color change from black to green.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statistics:</p><p>Please provide more details for the statistics, including assumptions on normality and homoscedasticity, p-values, F, SS, SSmean and degrees of freedom for all cases.

Population density of locusts acts as necessary and sufficient condition to drive the changes of body coloration. The black pattern in the pronotum of gregarious locusts decreased in 60% of the gregarious locusts only after <italic>βCBP</italic> knockdown without isolation treatment (Figure 1D). However, the silencing effect of <italic>dsβCBP</italic>–RNA coupled with isolation resulted in an 80% decrease in the signal intensity of βCBP in the pronotum integuments of gregarious locusts relative to the corresponding intensity in the <italic>dsGFP</italic>–RNA injected and isolated controls (Figure 4A). If not isolation, crowding will offset the low expression level of CBP after RNAi in gregarious locusts. Thus, the dramatic body color changes of gregarious locusts that were induced to form solitary-like body coloration in short time must rely on isolation treatment and RNAi CBP manipulation, because isolation treatment can always maintain the low expression level of <italic>CBP</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Trichromatic Rule:</p><p>The trichromatic rule support is interesting, particularly when insects are not trichromatic.

The green solitary locusts can hide themselves through the color confusion with the background of plants.”</p><p>“Potential predators, such as birds or and frogs (with tetrachromatic vision or trichromatic vision) could distinguish aposematic color visual signals as indicators of unpalatability and move on without an attempted attack. […] This destabilization of predator-prey interactions could facilitate further population growth and gregarization which can ultimately lead to outbreaks.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved and all reviewers agree that it provides a significant contribution to the field.

The mathematical model method and utilization of the reference genes are cited in the Materials and methods (subsection “Assays of quantitative PCR for genes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Add explanation of discrepancy with Ma et al., 2011 (Rebuttal Letter Point 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the explanation of discrepancy in Discussion as the following:</p><p>“In our present study, transcriptome analysis did not enrich the expression differentiation of catecholamine biosynthesis genes, which are considered involvement in the phase changes of the locust (Ma et al., 2011). We speculate the discrepancy mainly due to the different tissues sampling. In fact, they sampled the heads of the locusts (Ma et al., 2011), and our samples are from the pronotum of the locusts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Add explanation of coupled injection of RNAi against Β CBP and isolation of injected individuals (Rebuttal Letter Point 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the explanation of coupled injection of RNAi against β-CBP and isolation of injected individuals as the following:</p><p>“To more quickly detect the changes of body coloration, we injected the double-strain RNA of <italic>βCBP</italic> into the locusts and isolated the locusts. […] Because each injection of RNAi in general suppress effectively the target gene for several days, the isolation treatment can prevent the recovery expression of <italic>βCBP</italic>. In parallel, we fed with β-carotene for solitary locusts and crowded them.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Please clarify what &quot;warning&quot; (i.e. which locust defense systems) the &quot;warning coloration&quot; provides a signal for with references (Rebuttal Letter Point 7).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the explanation as the following:</p><p>“The multi-coloured pattern of black back with a contrasting brown ventral color in gregarious locusts functioned as effective warning coloration signal (Sword et al., 2000), providing mutual recognition to conspecifics and warning signal against predators in swarms (Sword, 1999).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We appreciate the authors attention to English, but there remain several small typos in the text, e.g.:</p><p>a) &quot;…the other seven genes show a very significant…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Revised as required (subsection “Gregarious and solitary locusts have different expression levels of βCBP”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) &quot;significantly reduced&quot; where is the statistical test here?
