In acute inflammation, SAA plasma levels increase ~1,000 fold, suggesting that this protein family has a vital beneficial role. SAA increases simultaneously with secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (sPLA<sub>2</sub>), compelling us to determine how SAA influences sPLA<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis of lipoproteins. SAA solubilized phospholipid bilayers to form lipoproteins that provided substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, SAA sequestered free fatty acids and lysophospholipids to form stable proteolysis-resistant complexes. Unlike albumin, SAA effectively removed free fatty acids under acidic conditions, which characterize inflammation sites. Therefore, SAA solubilized lipid bilayers to generate substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub> and removed its bioactive products. Consequently, SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> can act synergistically to remove cellular membrane debris from injured sites, which is a prerequisite for tissue healing. We postulate that the removal of lipids and their degradation products constitutes a vital primordial role of SAA in innate immunity; this role remains to be tested in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46630.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell boundaries are made up of fatty substances known as lipids. When cells get severely damaged, their lipid membranes break apart. These broken fragments of membrane become highly toxic, and must be removed as soon as possible to allow the tissue to heal. A small protein called serum amyloid A, SAA for short, was recently proposed to play a pivotal role in this process. In humans, SAA levels in the blood rapidly spike to over a thousand times their normal level following inflammation, injury or infection. Combined with the fact SAA has been conserved for over 500 million years, this suggests that SAA must be important for survival. But, it is not entirely clear how this protein works.</p><p>One clue for how SAA works is its relationship to another ancient protein called secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. This protein, also known as sPLA<sub>2</sub>, is part of a big family of enzymes that break down lipids in the cell membrane. Notably, sPLA<sub>2</sub> levels rise at the same time and place as SAA during inflammation. This led Jayaraman et al. to ask whether SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> might be working together to clean up the cell membrane debris.</p><p>To find out, Jayaraman et al. mixed mouse SAA with vesicles of membrane lipids, and then added sPLA<sub>2</sub>. This revealed that SAA reshapes the lipid membrane into smaller ‘nanoparticles’ with tightly curved surfaces that are easier for sPLA<sub>2</sub> to break down. As the sPLA<sub>2</sub> breaks up these particles, SAA then gathers up and gets rid of the leftover toxic fragments. This suggests that SAA has two roles: helping sPLA<sub>2</sub> break down the membrane, and removing any toxic debris.</p><p>Clearing debris after injury is essential for proper healing. So, understanding how it works is crucial to find new ways to treat inflammation. Further work to understand SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> could improve our understanding of how to treat acute and chronic inflammation and its life-threatening complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acute phase reactants</kwd><kwd>free fatty acids</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>lysophospholipids</kwd><kwd>lipid surface curvature</kwd><kwd>lipolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayaraman</surname><given-names>Shobini</given-names></name><name><surname>Gursky</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA456/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fändrich</surname><given-names>Marcus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stewart Amyloidosis Endowment Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gursky</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders provide resource to study design, data collection and submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SAA removes toxic products of lipolysis of the cell membrane by sPLA<sub>2</sub>, indicating that SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> act synergistically to clear debris from injured sites, as required for tissue healing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The serum amyloid A (SAA) family consists of 12-kDa proteins that have been highly evolutionally conserved at least since the Cambrian period, from sea cucumber to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uhlar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). SAA is an enigmatic biomarker of inflammation that is better known as a protein precursor of systemic amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation, than for its beneficial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Westermark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Papa and Lachmann, 2018</xref>). Inducible human SAA is produced mainly by the liver under the control of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is secreted into blood, and binds its major plasma carrier, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benditt and Eriksen, 1977</xref>). SAA is also secreted locally at inflammation sites and is implicated in cytokine production and immune cell recruitment to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eklund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye and Sun, 2015</xref>). During the acute-phase response, which is a complex systemic response to severe inflammation, infection or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>), human SAA isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999</xref>), while isoform 4 is constitutively expressed at much lower levels (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Buck et al., 2016</xref>). Plasma levels of inducible SAA are elevated in infections such as tuberculosis, in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Crohn’s disease, and in certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eklund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye and Sun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sack, 2018</xref>). Although chronically elevated SAA is deleterious as a protein precursor of amyloidosis and as a causal risk factor for atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eklund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Getz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>), the beneficial action of SAA is less clear. In fact, SAA has been reported to be pro- or anti-inflammatory in various studies, and its functions in acute and chronic inflammation remain enigmatic (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eklund et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye and Sun, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sack, 2018</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kisilevsky and Manley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, in acute inflammation, during infection, after injury or following surgery, plasma levels of SAA increase swiftly more than 1,000-fold, reaching up to 3 mg/ml in 24–48 hr, and then the levels drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sack, 2018</xref>). The advantage for survival of this dramatic but transient increase is unclear. However, high sequence conservation in this ancient protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uhlar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>) and a major and rapid commitment of liver and local tissues to SAA biosynthesis suggest that SAA is vital for survival.</p><p>One potential beneficial role of SAA is its ability to mobilize HDL cholesterol for cell repair. In the acute-phase response, SAA becomes a major HDL protein that can reroute the transport of HDL cholesterol by interacting with several cellular scavenger receptors that bind SAA-modified HDL (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kisilevsky and Manley, 2012</xref>). However, HDL undergoes additional modifications during the acute-phase response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jahangiri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2015</xref>), and the role of SAA in the homeostasis of these modified HDLs can be relatively minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Beer et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, rerouting HDL cholesterol transport cannot explain rapid and massive secretion of SAA over a period of hours following the onset of acute inflammation in various organisms, including those lacking HDL. Hence, the key primordial function of SAA must be different from HDL homeostasis.</p><p>Although most circulating SAA is bound to HDL, like other HDL proteins, SAA is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that can transiently dissociate in a labile ‘free’ form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>). Free SAA can bind a range of other apolar ligands, including cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 1996</xref>), retinol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derebe et al., 2014</xref>), phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and free fatty acids (FFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takase et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaraman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayaraman et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>). Our in vitro studies showed that SAA binds various phospholipid vesicles and spontaneously solubilizes them to form HDL-sized particles de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>). We proposed that this ability hinges upon the binding of diverse apolar ligands at a large concave apolar face of the SAA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>). This face, formed by two amphipathic α-helices, was observed in the atomic-resolution x-ray crystal structures of human SAA1.1 and murine SAA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derebe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). The shape of this apolar face, whose key features are conserved in the SAA family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>), helps to explain the preferential binding of SAA to highly curved apolar surfaces, a property that is essential for HDL binding and lipid sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>). These findings compelled us to propose that SAA’s ability to solubilize phospholipid bilayers and to form lipoprotein nanoparticles de novo reflects the primordial role of this Cambrian protein in the removal of cell membrane debris from injured sites, a function that pre-dates SAA binding to HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we consider a functional link between SAA and another ancient lipophilic plasma protein, phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>). PLA<sub>2</sub> is a superfamily of diverse enzymes that hydrolyze phospholipids in the sn2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke and Dennis, 2009</xref>). The reaction products, lysophospholipids and FFA, are bioactive lipids that are precursors of signaling molecules in many vital processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke and Dennis, 2009</xref>). Secretory PLA<sub>2</sub> (sPLA<sub>2</sub>) is a family of pro-inflammatory enzymes that are involved in the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyanovsky and Webb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murakami et al., 2016</xref>), which is especially relevant to SAA. For example, sPLA<sub>2</sub> group-IIa (sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa) is an antimicrobial acute-phase reactant whose concentration in plasma and at inflammation sites can increase several hundred-fold simultaneously with that of SAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pruzanski et al., 1993</xref>). Notably, sPLA<sub>2</sub> is co-expressed with SAA and is induced by the same group of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vadas et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, SAA stimulates smooth muscle cells to express sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>). Clinical studies have reported a direct link between the plasma levels of SAA and the enhanced activity of sPLA<sub>2</sub> during the early stages of inflammation, whereas in vitro studies have shown that SAA enhances the remodeling of sPLA<sub>2</sub>-induced lipoproteins via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pruzanski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pruzanski et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, sPLA<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzes highly curved micelle-like surfaces in lipoproteins such as HDL (diameter 8–12 nm), but not intact planar bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Høyrup et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halperin and Mouritsen, 2005</xref>), whereas SAA preferentially binds to such highly curved surfaces or forms them de novo by solubilizing lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these findings compel us to postulate not only a spatiotemporal overlap between SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> at inflammation sites in vivo, but also their potential synergy in lipid clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>). This study explores this synergy and its mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SAA augments the lipolysis of both model and plasma lipoproteins by sPLA<sub>2</sub></title><p>The murine and human SAA isoform 1.1 (mSAA1.1 and hSAA1.1) proteins used in this study are major isoforms that bind HDL and form amyloid in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Westermark et al., 2015</xref>). Recombinant mSAA1.1 (hereafter termed SAA for brevity) was used in most experiments. To determine whether and how SAA influences phospholipid hydrolysis by sPLA<sub>2</sub>, model and plasma lipoproteins that differed in size and composition were used as substrates for either sPLA<sub>2</sub> group-III (sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III), which preferentially hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine (PC), or sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa, which preferentially hydrolyses phosphatidylethanolamine but also acts on PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke and Dennis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyanovsky and Webb, 2009</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, both sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III and sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa enzymes are collectively termed sPLA<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We first probed how the lipid surface curvature imposed by SAA influences the sPLA<sub>2</sub> reaction. SAA was incubated with multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of a model phospholipid palmitoyl-oleoyl-PC (POPC). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that SAA solubilized POPC MLV (diameter circa 200 nm) to form smaller SAA-POPC complexes (~8 nm). The time course of this microsolubilization was monitored by turbidity, and its products were observed by non-denaturing PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Increasing the SAA to POPC molar ratio from 1:100 to 1:10 increased the rate of solubilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and resulted in the generation of slightly smaller SAA-POPC particles; for all ratios explored, the particle size was 7.5–8.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These small particles, along with POPC MLV, were used as substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub>, whose enzymatic activity was assessed by measuring free fatty acid products. In the absence of sPLA<sub>2,</sub> no significant hydrolysis of SAA-POPC particles was detected, but in the presence of sPLA<sub>2</sub>, extensive hydrolysis of the SAA-POPC particles was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, MLV were not hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub>: the levels of FFA were below the detection limit of our assay, and thin-layer chromatography showed only the presence of PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consequently, SAA readily solubilizes model phospholipid bilayers such as POPC MLV and converts them into small HDL-size particles that provide excellent substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub>. This ability distinguishes SAA from other major HDL proteins, such as apoA-I and apoA-II, which cannot spontaneously solubilize POPC MLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46630.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SAA remodels phospholipid bilayers into small particles that form substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) POPC MLV (~200 nm) were incubated with SAA at 25°C, and the time course of MLV remodeling into smaller particles was monitored by turbidty at 350 nm.

In contrast to free SAA, which was largely fragmented within 5 min of incubation with trypsin at 22°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the ~7 nm complexes and their SAA-POPC precursor particles resisted proteolysis, and they underwent no major fragmentation even after 12 hr of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results agree with the CD data showing more helical structure and increased stability in lipid-bound SAA when compared with free SAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).</p><p>Together, the results showed that SAA forms ~7 nm complexes with the hydrolytic products of sPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although these complexes migrate in the same size range as free SAA on the non-denaturing gel, their structure is distinct from that of either free SAA or the SAA-POPC precursor particles. Unlike free SAA, which shows unfolded secondary structure when examined by CD and is rapidly degraded by trypsin at ambient temperatures, SAA in the ~7 nm complexes is ~40% helical and resists proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), thereby resembling the SAA-POPC precursors. In contrast to precursors, these ~7 nm complexes: i) contain large amounts of FFA and lysoPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); ii) have smaller size (6.5–7.5 nm) and higher density (1.17–1.20 g/mL) indicative of a higher protein to lipid ratio; and iii) undergo a more thermodynamically reversible thermal unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The latter is consistent with the kinetically accessible character of these product complexes suggested by their similarity, regardless of the order of SAA binding and sPLA<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The complexes released from the hydrolyzed SAA-HDL contained both SAA and apoA-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Owing to difficulties in dissecting the contributions from individual proteins, these complexes were not explored in detail. Instead, we focused on the ~7 nm complexes released from hydrolyzed LDL in the presence of SAA. Such complexes contained SAA as their sole protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), facilitating a direct comparison with a model SAA-POPC system.</p><p>Parent LDL was hydrolyzed with sPLA<sub>2</sub> and incubated with SAA, leading to the formation of 7–7.5 nm SAA-only complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that were isolated by density at 1.17–1.20 g/ml. Far-UV CD spectra of these complexes revealed a ~ 40% α-helical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), similar to that seen in the ~7 nm complexes released upon lipolysis of SAA-POPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Finally, limited proteolysis ascertained the high conformational stability of SAA in these complexes, which resisted fragmentation upon incubation with trypsin at 22°C for up to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that SAA sequesters the hydrolytic products of sPLA<sub>2</sub> from model and plasma lipoproteins and forms stable ~7 nm complexes with these products. These complexes migrate in the same size range on the non-denaturing gel as free self-associated mSAA1.1. However, unlike free SAA that is structurally labile, the protein in these complexes acquires a stable highly α-helical proteolysis-resistant conformation at ambient temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SAA forms stable binary complexes with FFA and with lysoPC</title><p>Hydrolysis of POPC by sPLA<sub>2</sub> generates equimolar amounts of oleic acid (OA) and lysoPC.

Here, we explored the formation and properties of binary complexes of SAA with lysoPC. The complexes were formed as described in the 'Materials and methods' by incubating SAA with lysoPC at 1:10 protein to lipid molar ratio; similar experiments with POPC were used as a control. Non-denaturing PAGE showed SAA-lysoPC particles of ~8 nm in size, similar to those of SAA-POPC formed at 1:10 molar ratio of protein to lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Far-UV CD spectra showed substantial α-helical content in SAA-lysoPC particles, slightly lower than that in SAA-POPC particles (35% versus 40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thermal unfolding of SAA-lysoPC particles was observed with T<sub>m</sub> = 45°C, slightly lower than 50°C seen in SAA-POPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Unlike SAA-POPC particles, SAA-lysoPC particles showed little hysteresis during thermal unfolding and refolding. Moreover, similar to other SAA-lipid complexes, SAA-lysoPC complexes resisted tryptic digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Together, our results showed that SAA forms binary complexes with OA and with lysoPC. The protein in these complexes is 35–40% α-helical and resists proteolysis at ambient temperatures; the thermal unfolding is centered at T<sub>m</sub> = 45–48°C and is largely thermodynamically reversible. In this regard, these binary complexes of SAA-OA and SAA-lysoPC resemble the quaternary complexes containing SAA, OA, lysoPC and POPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Clearly, SAA can sequester POPC and its hydrolytic products, either separately or together, to form highly α-helical proteolysis-resistant complexes that are thermodynamically stable at ambient temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Relevance to disease and comparison with FFA removal by albumin</title><p>Next, we tested whether SAA can sequester the naturally occurring hydrolytic products from human lipoproteins. Our focus was on the FFA that are elevated in diabetes, inflammation and other diseases. LDL was isolated from the pooled plasma of subjects who were either normolipidemic or had diabetes mellitus, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jayaraman et al., 2017b</xref>). The content of endogenous FFA in these diabetic LDL was 20% higher than that in normolipidemic LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jayaraman et al., 2017b</xref>). SAA was incubated with LDL using 1:1 weight ratio of SAA to apoB. Non-denaturing PAGE showed that the SAA-containing ~7.5 nm complexes were released from diabetic as well as normolipidemic LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), similar to those released from LDL upon hydrolysis by sPLA<sub>2</sub> in the presence of SAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result suggests that SAA sequesters exogenous and endogenous FAA from lipoproteins to form similar-size complexes.</p><p>Under normal in vivo conditions, FFA and lysoPC are transported in plasma mainly by serum albumin. In acute inflammation, plasma levels of albumin and its ability to sequester FFA and lysoPC decrease, while the levels of sPLA<sub>2</sub> and SAA increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pruzanski and Vadas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fichtlscherer et al., 2004</xref>). Is it possible for SAA to assume albumin’s function under these conditions? To explore this, we compared the ability of SAA and albumin to remove endogenous FFA from plasma LDL. LDL from diabetic and healthy normolipidemic subjects (0.2 mg/ml apoB) was incubated at pH 7.5, 37°C, for 6 hr with 0.2 mg/ml SAA (2% w/v). A similar LDL incubation was carried out with 2% w/v human serum albumin. As a control, LDL was incubated under similar conditions without any added proteins. LDL was isolated by SEC and the FFA content was determined. The results showed that both albumin and SAA removed a large portion of endogenous FFA from diabetic as well as normolipidemic LDL, and that albumin was slightly more efficient than SAA at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding suggests that SAA can potentially contribute to FFA removal at plasma pH, albeit less efficiently than albumin.</p><p>Next, we tested whether SAA can remove FFA at acidic pH, which severely impairs albumin’s function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lähdesmäki et al., 2009</xref>). Previously, we showed that the SAA structure, stability and ability to remodel POPC MLV remain invariant at pH 7.5–5.5 but are altered at near-lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayaraman et al., 2017a</xref>). Here, we explored how pH influences the ability of SAA to remove FFA from human lipoproteins. Single-donor LDLs were hydrolyzed with sPLA<sub>2</sub> and incubated either with SAA, with albumin, or alone (control) for 6 hr at pH ranging from 4.5 to 7.5. Thereafter, LDL was isolated by density gradient centrifugation and the FFA content was measured. As expected, albumin was less efficient at removing FFA at acidic pH than at pH 7.5; this was evident from the higher residual content of FFA detected in LDL at pH 4.5–6.5 versus that at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, LDL + albumin). By contrast, SAA’s ability to remove FFA remained invariant at pH 4.5–7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, LDL + SAA). Importantly, at acidic pH, when the activity of albumin but not SAA was impaired, SAA removed more FFA than albumin per gram of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, LDL + SAA and LDL + albumin compared). This finding strongly supports the role of SAA in FFA removal in vivo and suggests that this role becomes particularly important at the acidic pH that are typical ofinflammation sites. This role is expected to be important in inflammation and in other conditions in which SAA level increases while albumin level and activity declines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46630.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>FFA removal by SAA and by albumin as a function of pH.</title><p>Single-donor LDL were hydrolyzed with sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III and incubated at pH 4.5–7.5 either alone (control), with albumin (LDL + albumin) or with SAA (LDL + SAA). Next, LDL were re-isolated by density gradient centrifugation and their residual FFA content was determined.

The increased lipolytic activity of sPLA<sub>2</sub> on HDL upon the addition of SAA was previously reported but the mechanism was unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pruzanski et al., 1995</xref>). The current study shows that SAA enhances the lipolysis by sPLA<sub>2</sub> of diverse lipid assemblies, including model phospholipid vesicles as well as human HDL and LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), and that the mechanism involves direct SAA-mediated enhancement of sPLA<sub>2</sub> activity. We show that SAA augments the sPLA<sub>2</sub> reaction both by generating highly curved substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and by removing its reaction products, FFA and lysophospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The latter may well be particularly important because product removal determines the reaction rate of many lipases including sPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carman et al., 1995</xref>). Together, these findings expand the previously postulated housekeeping roles of SAA in solubilizing and clearing cellular membrane phospholipids from injured sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>) and in providing an anti-oxidant for lipoproteins by sequestering lipid peroxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that sequestration of membrane lipids and their degradation products by SAA and the safe removal of these bioactive products from the injured sites, which is a prerequisite for tissue healing, represents a vital role of this Cambrian protein.</p><p>Unlike SAA, several other acute–phase reactants either have no effect on sPLA<sub>2</sub> activity or inhibit it, which perhaps helps to control the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pruzanski et al., 1996</xref>). To our knowledge, SAA is the only acute-phase protein that enhances the activity of sPLA<sub>2</sub>. The in vivo synergy between SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> is probably facilitated by the simultaneous secretion of these proteins systemically as well as locally at the inflammation sites. Furthermore, both proteins show preference for highly curved lipid surfaces that can be generated by SAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>) and are required for the activation of sPLA<sub>2</sub>. This is expected to lead to spatiotemporal overlap between SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub>, facilitating their synergy at the inflammation sites.</p><p>We propose that the ability of SAA to sequester diverse phospholipids and their degradation products, which was demonstrated in the current and previous studies by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takase et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>), underlies several beneficial effects. First, SAA can spontaneously solubilize diverse phospholipid bilayers in vitro <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">(Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>), and perhaps in vivo, which is particularly relevant with respect to dead cells whose normal lipid efflux to HDL via ATP-driven transporters is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, lipid sequestration by SAA is energy-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting stable nanoparticles are hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>) and/or perhaps are internalized by macrophages through scavenger receptors such as CD36 or SR-BI that bind SAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eklund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref> and references therein). Second, SAA solubilizes lysoPC and FFA and sequesters them into small particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that are stable, substantially α-helical, and resist proteolysis at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This sequestration augments the sPLA<sub>2</sub> reaction; it is also expected to facilitate the safe removal of toxic lipolytic products by SAA while protecting free SAA from unfolding and rapid degradation. Third, consistent with these findings, previous studies showed that SAA protects human lipoproteins from oxidation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato et al., 2016</xref>). This anti-oxidant effect is mediated mainly by free (rather than HDL-bound) SAA that probably sequesters lipid hydroperoxides and safely removes them from lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>). in a manner similar to the SAA-mediated removal of FFA and lysoPC described in the current study. Together, these findings suggest that during inflammation, when oxidative stress and lipolysis are increased, SAA augments the action of serum albumin by removing FFA, lysoPC, lipid peroxides and, potentially, other products of lipid degradation. We speculate that free SAA, like albumin, serves as a lipid scavenger that sequesters diverse lipophilic molecules. Unlike albumin, SAA forms oligomers to sequester lipids. Although the structure of these oligomers is unknown, lipids are expected to bind in a hydrophobic cavity formed by concave apolar faces of amphipathic helices from several protein molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frame et al., 2017</xref>). The high stability of SAA complexes with lipids and their hydrolytic products contrasts with the marginal in vitro stability of lipid-free SAA oligomers at pH above pH 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayaraman et al., 2017a</xref> and references therein). We speculate that these marginally stabile protein oligomers are primed for interaction with lipids to form stable complexes like those reported in the current study.</p><p>Normally, serum albumin removes a major fraction of sPLA<sub>2</sub> products. However, albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant whose plasma levels drop sharply in inflammation, with a concomitant steep increase in positive reactants, such as SAA and sPLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>). In addition, albumin’s ability to remove FFA is compromised upon the protein’s post-translational modifications in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Wu, 2015</xref>). Moreover, albumin’s capacity to remove FFA decreases under acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which are characteristic of inflammation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lähdesmäki et al., 2009</xref>). All together, these effects are expected to cause an imbalance between the massive generation of FFA and lysoPC at inflammation sites and the impaired removal of these molecules by albumin. Our finding that, per gram of protein, SAA is more efficient than albumin in removing FFA from plasma lipoproteins at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that SAA acts locally at the sites of inflammation to compensate for the impaired albumin activity, and helps to remove excess lipids and the products of their hydrolysis and oxidation. We propose that the ability to sequester diverse lipids and their degradation products, which is rooted in the unique structure of SAA with its concave hydrophobic surface that has been highly conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame and Gursky, 2016</xref>), constitutes a previously unknown vital role of SAA in the immune response. This role remains to be tested in future cell-based and in vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins and lipids</title><p>Recombinant murine SAA isoform 1.1 (103 amino acids, 11.6 kDa) was used throughout this study; it is termed mSAA1.1, or SAA for brevity.

Essentially fatty acid-free human serum albumin (cat. # A1887) was from Sigma. Lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC; C16:0, C18:1) and lysoPC (16:0) were 97% + pure from Avanti Polar Lipids. Trypsin from bovine pancreas (cat. # T1426), group-III sPLA<sub>2</sub> (sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III, cat. # P9279), lipoprotein lipase (cat. # L2254), sphingomyelinase from <italic>Bacillus cerus</italic> (cat. # S9396), and sodium oleate (cat # O7501) were from Sigma. Human recombinant group-IIa sPLA<sub>2</sub> (sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa, cat. # RD172054100) was from Biovendor. Enzychrom free fatty acid assay kit (cat. # EFFA-100) and Enzychrom phospholipid assay kit (cat. # EPLP-100) were from Fisher Scientific. Ultrapure sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 (BB-148) was from Boston Bioproducts. All other chemicals were of the highest purity analytical grade.</p><p>SAA stock solutions were prepared daily by dissolving lyophilized protein at 1 mg/ml in water and dialyzing it overnight against the standard buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). SAA stock solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min prior to each experiment to remove protein aggregates. Recombinant hSAA1 was reconstituted according to the manufacturer's recommendations and was immediately diluted in standard buffer, followed by overnight dialysis in standard buffer prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Human plasma lipoproteins</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, single-donor human lipoproteins from three healthy volunteers were used throughout this study. Plasma from anonymous healthy donors was obtained commercially from the local blood bank according to the rules of the institutional review board. Single-donor lipoproteins were isolated following published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schumaker and Puppione, 1986</xref>) from fresh EDTA-treated plasma by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation in the density range 0.94–1.006 g/mL for VLDL, 1.019–1.063 g/mL for LDL, and 1.063–1.21 g/mL for HDL. Lipoproteins from each class migrated as a single band on the agarose and non-denaturing gels. Lipoprotein stock solutions were prepared by extensive dialysis against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.5, degassed, and stored in the dark at 4°C. Each stock solution was used within two weeks during which no protein degradation was detected by SDS PAGE and no changes in the lipoprotein electrophoretic mobility were observed by agarose PAGE.</p><p>To obtain HDL enriched with exogenous SAA (termed SAA-HDL), single-donor HDL were isolated from healthy subjects and were incubated with SAA at 37°C for 6 hr in standard buffer. The molar ratio of SAA to apoA-I varied from 0:1 (SAA-free control) to 4:1. Free (uncomplexed) proteins, which contained excess SAA as well as apoA-I that was displaced from HDL by SAA, were removed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaraman et al., 2015</xref>). The total incubation mixture before purification is termed SAA-HDL(total) and the SEC-purified lipoprotein fraction is termed SEC Fr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). As a control, HDL were incubated without SAA under otherwise identical conditions; no changes in the particle size, composition or stability were detected upon such incubation. Total protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay, and individual apolipoprotein content was determined as a weight fraction of the total protein by quantifying SDS gel bands using image J software, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaraman et al., 2015</xref>). Intact non-modified HDL contained 75% apoA-I and 25% apoA-II; SAA-HDL (1:1 mol:mol SAA:apoA-I, SEC fr) contained 65% apoA-I, 23% apoA-II and 12% SAA; and SAA-HDL (4:1, SEC fr) contained 56% apoA-I, 17% apoA-II and 27% SAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To explore the effects of SAA on LDL, SAA (1 mg/ml) was incubated with single-donor nomolipidemic plasma LDL (1 mg/ml apoB) in standard buffer at 37°C for 3 hr. The mixture was analyzed by SEC and non-denaturing PAGE to ascertain that SAA did not bind LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To compare human LDLs that vary in endogenous FFA levels, plasma was pooled from 25 patients diagnosed with type-2 diabetes mellitus and from 25 healthy normolipidemic subjects, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jayaraman et al., 2017b</xref>). Plasma was obtained at the Lipid Laboratory of Hospital de Saint Pau and LDL were isolated by density gradient centrifugation in the laboratory of Dr. Jose Luís Sanchez-Quesada at the Hospital de Saint Pau (Barcelona, Spain); these studies were done with the written informed consent of the patients and upon approval by the institutional ethics committee, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jayaraman et al., 2017b</xref>). The FFA content, which was quantified by an enzymatic assay described below, was 20% higher in diabetic than in normolipidemic LDL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reconstituted lipoproteins</title><p>Lipoproteins were reconstituted using a thin film evaporation method. POPC was dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v), the organic solvent was evaporated under nitrogen stream, and the samples were dried under vacuum overnight at 4°C. MLVs were prepared by dispersing the lipid film in standard buffer followed by vortexing. SUVs (diameter ~22 nm) were prepared by sonication of MLVs and were used within one day.</p><p>SAA-containing lipoproteins of controled size were prepared by incubating SAA with POPC SUV at 25°C for 3 hr using an SAA to POPC molar ratio of either 1:100 (to prepare SAA-containing SUVs of ~22 nm in size) or 1:10 (to prepare SAA-POPC complexes of 8 nm in size). Excess lipid was removed by centrifugation and excess protein was removed by SEC. The protein to lipid weight ratio in the final preparations was 1:42 (for 1:100 mol:mol initial ratio) or 1:28 (for 1:10 mol:mol initial ratio).</p><p>SAA complexes with oleic acid were reconstituted as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaraman et al. (2018)</xref>. To reconstitute SAA complexes with lysoPC, SAA was incubated with freshly prepared lysoPC at 37°C for 1 hr at protein:lipid molar ratios varying from 1:1 to 1:100. This range encompassed lysoPC concentrations below and above its critical micelle concentration (4–8.3 mM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lipid clearance </title><p>MLV clearance by SAA at room temperature was monitored by turbidity at 325 nm using a Varian Cary-300 UV-vis spectrophotometer. SAA (20 µg/ml) was rapidly mixed with MLV suspension in standard buffer (40 µg/ml lipid), and the time course of turbidity changes was recorded as micron-size MLVs were converted into smaller lipoprotein nanoparticles. MLVs alone were used as controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Enzymatic lipolysis</title><p>SAA-POPC complexes (10 µM lipid), as well as human plasma HDL and LDL (0.5–1.0 mg/ml total protein), were used as substrates for sPLA<sub>2</sub>. First, the lipoproteins were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris buffer saline at pH 7.5. Phospholipid lipolysis was performed using 50 nm human recombinant sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa or bee-venom sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III in TBS at pH 7.4 in the presence or absence of 2% w/v of fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. After a 3 hr incubation at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA (final concentration 20 mM). To assess the spontaneous lipolysis of phospholipids, control experiments were carried out under identical conditions without sPLA<sub>2</sub>. Hydrolysis of POPC SUV by sPLA<sub>2</sub> without SAA was also quantified as a control. The extent of hydrolysis was assessed by measuring the FFA products using an enzymatic assay kit (Wako Chemicals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lipid assays</title><p>FFA and total phospholipids were quantified using kits from Bioassay Systems (EnzycrhomTM free fatty assay kit EFFA-100, and EnzychromTM phospholipid assay kit EPLP-100), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>Lipoprotein lipids were assayed by thin layer chromatography using samples containing 0.5 mg/ml protein. The lipids were extracted following published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Folch et al., 1957</xref>), the organic solvent was dried, and the lipids were spotted on the plate (glass backed, plain silica gel). The tank was first saturated with a chloroform:methanol:water (32.5:12.5:2 v/v/v) solvent system. The plate was developed for 1 hr. The spots were identified by charring with sulfuric acid spray.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Circular dichroism spectroscopy</title><p>CD data were recorded using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter to monitor protein secondary structure and thermal stability. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 190–250 nm from solutions containing 0.1 mg/ml SAA in standard buffer. Melting data were recorded at 222 nm to monitor changes in the α-helical structure during sample heating and cooling at a constant rate of either 70 °C/h or 10 °C/h. The data at these scan rates closely overlapped, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaraman et al., 2015</xref>). Buffer baselines were subtracted from the data; the results were normalized to the protein concentration and reported as molar residue ellipticity, [Θ]. Helical content was estimated on the basis of the value of [Θ]<sub>222</sub>, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao and Wallace, 1984</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography</title><p>For non-denaturing PAGE, Novex 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were loaded with 6 μg protein per lane and run to termination at 1500 V·h under non-denaturing conditions in Tris-glycine buffer. For SDS PAGE, Novex 16% or 18% Tris-glycine gels were loaded with 5 μg protein per lane and run at 200 V for 1 hr under denaturing conditions in SDS-Tris-glycine buffer. The gels were stained with Denville Blue protein stain (Denville Scientific).</p><p>SEC was performed with a Superose 6 10/300 GL column controlled by an ÄKTA UPC 10 FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Elution by 10 mM PBS at pH 7.5 was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein cross-linking</title><p>SAA oligomerization in SAA-POPC complexes before and after their hydrolysis with sPLA<sub>2</sub> was assessed using glutaraldehyde, which can cross-link free NH<sub>2</sub> groups that are separated by up to 12 Å. SAA-POPC (0.5 mg/ml protein) was incubated for 30 min at 24°C with glutaraldehyde (0.01–0.08%), the reaction was quenched by adding 100 mM Tris, and the samples were analyzed by SDS PAGE. The results were obtained using standard buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), which yielded less non-specific aggregation. The exact cross-linking pattern varied depending on the salt concentration, and more non-specific higher order oligomers were observed in a low-salt buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry</title><p>SAA, either in lipid-free form or in complexes with lipids, was incubated with trypsin at 1:1500 mg:mg enzyme:substrate ratio in standard buffer at room temperature. Tryptic digestion was quenched using 2 mM of a serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction was quenched after 5 min for lipid-free SAA, which was rapidly digested, and after 1 hr for lipid-bound SAA, which was digested much more slowly. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization – time of flight mass spectrometry.</p><p>For mass spectrometry, the spectra were recorded on a Reflex-IV spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. The instrument was operated in the positive-ion reflection mode at 20 kV accelerating voltage with time-lag focusing enabled. Calibration was performed in linear mode using a standard calibration mixture containing the oxidized B-chain of bovine insulin, equine cytochrome C, equine apomyoglobin, and bovine serum albumin. The matrix, cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (alpha cyano, Mw = 189 g/mol), was prepared as a saturated solution in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Mass spectrometry results were reported as an average of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Removal of free fatty acids</title><p>To compare the ability of SAA and albumin to remove FFA from LDL in a broad range of physiologically relevant pH, samples of single-donor human LDL containing 1 mg/ml apoB were hydrolyzed using 50 nM sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III at 37°C for 3 hr at pH 7.5, 6.5, 5.5 or 4.5. The hydrolysis was performed either sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III alone, sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III with 2% (w/v) FFA-free human serum albumin, or sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III with 2% (w/v) SAA. After incubation, LDL were re-isolated by density gradient centrifugation, and their FFA content was quantified by an enzymatic assay.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synergy between serum amyloid A and secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> suggests a key role of ancient protein in lipid clearance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew A Mitsche (Reviewer #1); Vladimir N Uversky (Reviewer #2); Wilfredo Colon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting study reports on how serum amyloid A (SAA) and secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (sPLA<sub>2</sub>) act in concert to clear cell membrane debris from injury sites. The authors show that SAA solubilizes lipid bilayers and converts them into lipoprotein particles that are then acted on and hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub>. All three reviewers thought that the experiments were well-executed and that the results suggested a compelling model for lipid clearance at sites of inflammation. They agreed that the findings were significant, but also raised some concerns about the purely in vitro nature of this study. They welcomed a revised submission where the following points have been addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major component of the author's model is the pH dependence of this process. However, this point is not rigorously developed (Figure 6 shows that SAA can remove FFA at acidic pH, but it does not show and pH dependence of SAA). Further examination of the pH dependence of SAA dependent remodeling of MLV would strengthen their hypothesis.</p><p>2) Are the 7 nm particles micelles or lamellar structures? EM structural analysis would be very informative. It is not clear why the 7 nm particle would be a better vehicle for retrieving cell debris than either an emulsion like LDL/vLDL/HDL or lamellar HDL. Addressing this by experiments or in the Discussion would increase the impact of their model.</p><p>3) Based on the large particle size, what would be the oligomeric state of mouse and human SAA in these structures, how does it compare to the oligomeric structures seen for mouse and human SAA in vitro? Are these potentially the oligomeric structures alluded to in the following statement: &quot;Unlike albumin, SAA forms oligomers to sequester lipids. Although the structure of these oligomers is unknown, lipids are expected to bind in a hydrophobic cavity formed by concave apolar faces of amphipathic helices from several protein molecules (Frame and Gursky, 2016; Frame et al., 2017).&quot;</p><p>4) The authors state that MLVs are not hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub> in the absence of SAA. Data should be provided to support this statement.</p><p>5) The authors state that PLA<sub>2</sub> incubation with SUVs leads to hydrolysis of 40-50% of POPC, how does this compare to SAA-treated MLVs in terms of percentage. In other words, in Figure 1C, what percentage of total oleic acid does that represent?</p><p>6) Between the first and second section of the Results the authors switch from MLVs to SUVs. This should be discussed or justified. Otherwise it is difficult to relate the first portion of the manuscript to the subsequent analysis.</p><p>7) The studies of isolated HDL and LDL would be clarified by comparison to model membranes that more closely resemble the particles, for example ApoA-1 mimetic nano-particles and emulsion particles.</p><p>8) The blots in Figure 3 are difficult to see. Please provide a longer exposure, or increased contrast?</p><p>9) The formation of hyperstable complexes between SAA and lipid hydrolysis products is opposite to the known marginal stability of SAA oligomers in vitro. It seems worthwhile to address this contrast. For example, the marginal stability of apoSAA oligomers may make them just stable enough to not aggregate in vivo but primed for interacting with lipids to form stable complexes like the ones shown in this study.</p><p>10) Typographical errors and formatting requests:</p><p>In Figure 5B, please label the heating and cooling curves clearly.</p><p>The following sentence has a grammar issue: &quot;…while SAA preferentially binds to such highly curved surfaces of forms them de novo by solubilizing lipid bilayers (Jayaraman et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014).&quot; It seems like &quot;of forms&quot; should be &quot;or forms&quot;.</p><p>11) Do the authors mean &quot;oligomers&quot; or &quot;aggregates&quot; or are they being used interchangeably? For example: &quot;hSAA1.1 is less water-soluble in lipid-free state and forms larger ~9 nm aggregates seen on the non-denaturing PAGE (hSAA, Figure 6—figure supplement 2A) as compared to ~7.5 nm aggregates formed by free mSAA1.1&quot;. Later in the Discussion (third paragraph), there is mention of SAA oligomers.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Synergy between serum amyloid A and secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> suggests a key role of ancient protein in lipid clearance&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All the technical points have been adequately addressed. However, a major concern lingers about the relevance of these findings in a biological setting. The authors do point out this shortcoming in their rebuttal letter – &quot;In our view, a more detailed discussion of these and other functional properties of SAA-only particles compared to classical lipoproteins is premature until SAA-only particles are found in vivo or in a cell-based system&quot;.

Further examination of the pH dependence of SAA dependent remodeling of MLV would strengthen their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The pH dependence of the lipid remodeling by SAA is, indeed, an important point that has been explored in detail in our previous work (Jayaraman et al., 2017). This point is now briefly addressed in the revised Results as follows:</p><p>“Previously we showed that the SAA structure, stability and ability to remodel POPC MLV remain invariant at pH 7.5-5.5 but are altered at near-lysosomal pH (Jayaraman et al., 2017). Here, we explored how pH influences the ability of SAA to remove FFA from human lipoproteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are the 7 nm particles micelles or lamellar structures? EM structural analysis would be very informative. It is not clear why the 7 nm particle would be a better vehicle for retrieving cell debris than either an emulsion like LDL/vLDL/HDL or lamellar HDL. Addressing this by experiments or in the Discussion would increase the impact of their model.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, the 7 nm particles must be micellar since they contain FFA and lysoPC, which are micelle- and bicelle-forming lipids. Unfortunately, the EM analysis of these particles was not as informative as suggested by the reviewer. This was due, in part, to the small particle size (similarly, 7-8 nm HDL are also not well-resolved by negative-stain EM). The problem was confounded by the particle aggregation and by our empirical observation that SAA does not stain quite as well as other apolipopoteins. A detailed structural analysis of these particles is subject of our ongoing studies by other methods and will be described elsewhere</p><p>Secondly, we emphasize that the 7 nm SAA-only particle is not a classical lipoprotein but a protein-rich complex. We are not claiming that such 7 nm SAA-containing particles are better at lipid removal than HDL, LDL, VLDL. However, as stated throughout the manuscript (e.g. Discussion), SAA has several advantages over larger apolipoproteins found on HDL, LDL and VLDL:</p><p>i) SAA is dramatically upregulated in inflammation, both systemically and locally at the sites of injury; in contrast, plasma levels of other apolipoproteins and albumin drop. Therefore, lipid removal by SAA in inflammation is governed, in part, by the <underline>mass action law</underline>;</p><p>ii) As shown in Figure 1A, SAA spontaneously solubilizes lipids in an energy-independent process. In contrast, formation of HDL, LDL and VLDL requires a complex molecular machinery and ATP hydrolysis, which does not function in dead cells at the sites of inflammation and injury (please see the Discussion).</p><p>Moreover, internalization of SAA-only lipoproteins by cells proceeds via different receptors and different biochemical mechanisms than selective uptake of HDL lipids by hepatocytes via SR-BI receptor. We also note that LDL and VLDL do not remove lipids from peripheral cells in vivo. In our view, a more detailed discussion of these and other functional properties of SAA-only particles compared to classical lipoproteins is premature until SAA-only particles are found in vivo or in a cell-based system.</p><p><italic>3) Based on the large particle size, what would be the oligomeric state of mouse and human SAA in these structures, how does it compare to the oligomeric structures seen for mouse and human SAA</italic> in vitro<italic>? Are these potentially the oligomeric structures alluded to in the following statement: &quot;Unlike albumin, SAA forms oligomers to sequester lipids. Although the structure of these oligomers is unknown, lipids are expected to bind in a hydrophobic cavity formed by concave apolar faces of amphipathic helices from several protein molecules (Frame and Gursky, 2016; Frame et al., 2017).&quot;</italic> </p><p>In an attempt to determine the oligomeric state of SAA in lipid complexes, we have now included cross-linking data of SAA-POPC complexes in new panels D, E in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The revised Results section reads:</p><p>“To assess the number of SAA molecules per model particle, SAA-POPC were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. SDS PAGE of intact SAA-POPC showed sharp bands corresponding to protein monomer, dimer and trimer, while hydrolyzed SAA-POPC showed a prominent hexamer band (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D), suggesting that each particle contained at least six protein molecules.”</p><p>Based on the published data on SAA1.1 and SAA2 work from Dr. Colon’s group (e.g. PMID: 21439938, 24706838 and references therein), the oligomeric form of SAA in 7 nm particle resembles the hexamer found in solution and in one crystal structure (PMID: 24706838). However, please note that the results of cross-linking alone are insufficient to determine the exact oligomeric state of the protein. Therefore, we opted not to discuss this point in detail in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that MLVs are not hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub> in the absence of SAA. Data should be provided to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and provide such data in Figure 1 where a new panel D has been added in revision. Revised Figure 1 legend reads:</p><p>“(D) Thin-layer chromatography analysis of POPC MLV before (intact) or after their incubation with sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III (+ sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III). The PC band is indicated; the absence of the lyso-PC band underneath the PC band indicates the absence of significant hydrolysis.”</p><p>Revised Results section reads:</p><p>“In contrast, MLV were not hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub>: the levels of FFA were below the detection limit of our assay, and thin-layer chromatography showed only the presence of PC (Figure 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that PLA<sub>2</sub> incubation with SUVs leads to hydrolysis of 40-50% of POPC, how does this compare to SAA-treated MLVs in terms of percentage. In other words, in Figure 1C, what percentage of total oleic acid does that represent?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is now addressed in revised legend to Figure 1C as follows:</p><p>“In SAA-POPC particles, approximately 70% of the total lipid was hydrolyzed by sPLA<sub>2</sub>-III and 60% by sPLA<sub>2</sub>-IIa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Between the first and second section of the Results the authors switch from MLVs to SUVs. This should be discussed or justified. Otherwise it is difficult to relate the first portion of the manuscript to the subsequent analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and address this point in the revised Results:</p><p>“The ~8 nm SAA-POPC complexes formed upon spontaneous solubilization of MLV using 1:10 to 1:100 protein:lipid molar ratio were nearly invariant in size (Figure 1C). […] Therefore, in the current study, we used POPC SUV to test the effect of the particle size on the lipolysis by sPLA<sub>2</sub>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The studies of isolated HDL and LDL would be clarified by comparison to model membranes that more closely resemble the particles, for example ApoA-1 mimetic nano-particles and emulsion particles.</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, SAA in vivo associates with mature lipoproteins, mainly HDL but also LDL and VLDL, but not with nascent “discoidal” HDL such as nanoparticles containing apoA-I or apoA-I mimetics. Therefore, comparison with such nanoparticles would not add physiologic relevance to our work. Similarly, we believe that using emulsion-like model particles does not provide any additional advantage over human plasma lipoproteins.</p><p>Please note that previously we and others showed that SAA can solubilize a wide range of lipids varying in molecular shape and charge, e.g. PCs, PE, PG, lysoPC, FFA, cholesterol and their mixtures (Jayaraman et al., 2017 and references therein). Therefore, as stated in Jayaraman et al., 2018, and in the current manuscript, we propose that SAA provides a scavenger for a wide range of lipids regardless of their exact composition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The blots in Figure 3 are difficult to see. Please provide a longer exposure, or increased contrast?</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that Figure 3 shows native PAGE stained with a protein stain; these are not blots. The contrast in this figure is typical of that seen in our other native gels, at least on our computer. To comply with the strict journal’s policy on image presentation, we opted not to manipulate the original data. However, if the manuscript is accepted, we will work with the editorial office to modify the figures and improve the contrast according to their instructions.</p><p> <italic>9) The formation of hyperstable complexes between SAA and lipid hydrolysis products is opposite to the known marginal stability of SAA oligomers</italic> in vitro<italic>.

We speculate that these marginally stabile protein oligomers are primed for interacting with lipids to form stable complexes like those reported in the current study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Typographical errors and formatting requests:</p><p>In Figure 5B, please label the heating and cooling curves clearly.</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>The following sentence has a grammar issue: &quot;…while SAA preferentially binds to such highly curved surfaces of forms them</italic> de novo <italic>by solubilizing lipid bilayers (Jayaraman et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014).&quot; It seems like &quot;of forms&quot; should be &quot;or forms&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Thank you – the heating and cooling data in the figures have been clearly labeled and the typo in the text has been corrected in revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Do the authors mean &quot;oligomers&quot; or &quot;aggregates&quot; or are they being used interchangeably?
