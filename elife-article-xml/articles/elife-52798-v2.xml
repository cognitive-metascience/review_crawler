However, little is known on the mechanisms that guide formation and refinement of intrinsic connections between amygdaloid nuclei. We demonstrate that in rodents the glutamatergic connection from basolateral to central amygdala (BLA-CeA) develops rapidly during the first 10 postnatal days, before external inputs underlying amygdala-dependent behaviors emerge. During this restricted period of synaptic development, kainate-type of ionotropic glutamate receptors (KARs) are highly expressed in the BLA and tonically activated to regulate glutamate release via a G-protein-dependent mechanism.

While physiological roles for KARs in modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission have been described in the mature neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>), increasing evidence suggests predominant functions for KARs in the developing circuitry. KARs modulate formation of glutamatergic contacts by regulating neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ibarretxe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joseph et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques et al., 2013</xref>), filopodial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and De Camilli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tashiro et al., 2003</xref>) and synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marchal and Mulle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakha et al., 2016</xref>). At immature hippocampal synapses, KARs control efficacy and short-term dynamics of transmission by tonically regulating glutamate release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lauri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauri et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, many of the developmental functions of KARs are mediated by non-canonical G-protein-dependent signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tashiro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of the early KAR activity, development of the glutamatergic connectivity in the hippocampus is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vesikansa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orav et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the existing data indicate KARs as key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity during the critical window of synapse development in the hippocampus. However, the applicability of these mechanisms to other areas of the developing brain remains largely unknown.</p><p>Amygdala is part of the limbic system involved in memory, emotion and autonomic function. Basic architecture of the mammalian amygdala is present at birth, but similar to hippocampus, it undergoes structural and functional change across extended developmental period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tottenham and Sheridan, 2009</xref>). External inputs to basolateral amygdala (BLA) develop postnatally, the thalamic inputs being detectable around P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouwmeester et al., 2002</xref>), while cortical innervation emerges gradually between P10 and P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda-Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>). Both lateral (LA) and basal amygdala (BA) nuclei have strong glutamatergic projections to the central amygdala (CeA), where the principal cells are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>). However, practically nothing is known on the development of the intrinsic connections in the amygdala.</p><p>Here, we show that KAR subunits GluK1,2 and 5 are strongly expressed in the amygdala during early postnatal development, temporally coinciding with rapid development of functional glutamatergic synapses. In the newborn BLA, KARs are physiologically activated to regulate glutamate release probability via a G-protein-dependent mechanisms. Knockdown or overexpression of GluK1 expression locally in the newborn LA perturbed development of glutamatergic input to CeA, suggesting that endogenous KAR activity is critical for development of the LA-CeA connections. Interestingly, it was recently shown that enhanced activity of KARs in the adult amygdala, generated via GluK4 overexpression, leads to severe changes in the circuit excitability and amygdala dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these data thus identify tonic KAR activity as a mechanism modulating behaviorally relevant synaptic circuitry in the amygdala.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kainate receptors are highly expressed in the BLA during the first postnatal week</title><p>Based on the existing literature, at least subunits GluK1, GluK2 and GluK5 are expressed in the adult rat BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2001</xref>) where they have been implicated in regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2010</xref>).

To understand the physiological roles of KARs in the developing circuit, we mapped functional ionotropic KARs in the neonatal amygdala using agonist application during voltage clamp recordings. Surprisingly, application of kainate (KA, 2 µM) in the presence of selective antagonists for AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptors (2 µM NBQX, 50 µM APV and 100 µM PiTX, respectively) induced no or only a very small current (LA: 6 ± 1 pA; BA: 8 ± 1 pA) in the BLA neurons during the first postnatal week (P4-P7), while a marked inward current was observed later on in development (P14-P16) (LA: 81 ± 19 pA, BA 37 ± 5 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

Since kainate might cause rapid desensitization of the receptors, we also used another KAR agonist, domoate to confirm the result in the first postnatal week (P4-P7).

Thus, the high expression of the KAR subunits in the newborn LA does not correlate with ionotropic function of KARs, which emerges after the second postnatal week.

Consistently, we found that spine density at BLA neurons increased gradually during the first 3 postnatal weeks while the density of functional inputs, assessed by mEPSC frequency, stabilized after the second postnatal week. Interestingly, glutamatergic inputs to the CeA reached maturity earlier as compared to BLA, the mEPSC frequency stabilizing already at P10-11 and spine density at around P14-16. Based on tracing studies, the external inputs to amygdala develop gradually from P7 onwards, most cortical inputs arriving only after the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouwmeester et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda-Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>).

These data support that the local circuit in the amygdala is wired before the cortical inputs underlying behavior actuate.</p><p>Kainate receptors are highly expressed in the adult amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2001</xref>). However, no previous data on the expression and function of KARs during amygdala development exists. Our data show that the low-affinity subunits GluK1 and GluK2 and the high-affinity subunit GluK5 are strongly expressed in the BLA during the first postnatal week, when the glutamatergic synapses are rapidly developing. Early in development, all the subunits were also detected in the central amygdala. The expression pattern of various KAR subunits in the newborn amygdala showed no evident cell-type specificity, thus giving little insight into their functions in the neonatal BLA circuitry. Yet, the finding that GluK1 expression was strongly downregulated during development, in parallel with maturation of synaptic connectivity, is reminiscent to hippocampus where this subunit has central role in regulating synaptic plasticity and formation of CA3-CA1 synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vesikansa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orav et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, during the first postnatal week corresponding to the developmental peak in expression of most KAR subunits, ionotropic activity of KARs was weak in the BLA. Contrary to the declining mRNA expression profile, KAR-mediated inward currents were significantly increased during development in all amygdala nuclei studied. Instead, we found that tonic G-protein-coupled signaling via GluK1 subunit containing KARs regulated glutamate release in a developmentally restricted manner. Our data thus supports that G-protein-coupled ‘non-canonical’ signaling is a predominant mode of KAR activity during the time of intense synaptogenesis, while the emergence of ionotropic KARs correlates with circuit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marchal and Mulle, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In adult BLA, KAR activity facilitates glutamate release (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2018</xref>) indicating that presynaptic KARs are present in adult but are functionally distinct from the immature-type GluK1 subunit containing receptors that tonically inhibit glutamate release in the BA. In the CeA, tonic KAR-dependent facilitation of glutamate release was detected during the first postnatal week of life. According to our results, presynaptic KARs are not endogenously active in the juvenile (P14-16) amygdala; however, previous studies using KAR antagonists with a broader subunit specificity (UBP302, UBP310) have detected endogenous KAR activity also in the adult BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2018</xref>). During first weeks of life, concentration of ambient glutamate is high (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>) and sufficient to activate high-affinity KARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Segerstråle et al., 2010</xref>). The developmental increase in glial glutamate uptake thus provides a plausible mechanism for the decline in the tonic KAR activity. Parallel changes in KAR subunit composition affecting subcellular localization and affinity of the receptors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vesikansa et al., 2012</xref>) likely contribute to the switch from immature to adult type KAR activity. The previous findings showing coupling of GluK1 to G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rutkowska-Wlodarczyk et al., 2015</xref>) and recapitulation of immature-type synaptic signaling by GluK1c overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vesikansa et al., 2012</xref>; present data) support the view that expression of GluK1 and in particular, the GluK1c splice variant, is central to the early metabotropic KAR activity. In addition, the high agonist affinity, permitting the tonic activation, depends on availability of subunits GluK4/5 as well as the auxiliary subunits NETO1/2 reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lerma and Marques (2013)</xref>.</p><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that overexpression of KAR subunit GluK4 enhances tonic KAR activity in the adult amygdala and leads to profound changes in the circuit excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2018</xref>). Since the immature-type tonic KAR activity temporally coincided with rapid development of functional glutamatergic synapses in the amygdala, we presumed that the physiological role of this activity is to modulate development of the amygdala circuitry. Consistently, local GluK1 knockdown in the LA during the time of rapid development of the BLA-CeA connectivity, but not later on in life, significantly impaired glutamatergic transmission from LA to CeA. Loss of GluK1 expression had no effect on glutamatergic inputs to the LA neurons themselves, which supports the idea that circuit development is predominantly modulated by presynaptic/axonal GluK1 KARs at the LA-CeLA projections.</p><p>Weakening of glutamatergic transmission at the LA-CeLA projections following GluK1 inactivation was associated with changes in dendritic morphology in the CeLA target neurons, involving reduction in both, the spine density as well as size of the dendritic tree. Likewise, prolonging the developmental KAR activity via GluK1 overexpression resulted in an expansion of the dendritic tree of CeA neurons, consistent with the idea that KAR activity promotes both functional and morphological maturation of the amygdala neuronal networks. The changes in dendritic morphology likely contribute to the observed changes in glutamatergic drive. However, our data does not indicate whether presynaptic KARs directly influence dendritic development of the CeA neurons via some transsynaptic signaling pathway or whether the morphological alterations resulted secondarily from the KAR dependent changes in glutamatergic transmission early in life.</p><p>The endogenous KAR activity particularly affected glutamatergic inputs to the subpopulation of late firing neurons in the CeLA, which displayed significantly lower frequency of sEPSCs in preparations where GluK1 activity was knocked out. Since there were no parallel changes in PPR of evoked responses, loss of ongoing KAR dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release is unlikely to explain the functional phenotype in GluK1-deficient amygdala in juvenile/adult stage. Rather, all the available data supports the view that loss of glutamatergic input to the LF neurons is a result of perturbed development of glutamatergic synapses in the absence of GluK1. Excitability of the LF (PKC-δ+) neurons in the CeA controls anxiety –like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting that impaired early KAR activity, leading to altered excitatory drive to LF CeA neurons, might be a causative factor in developmentally originating anxiety disorders.</p><p>In summary, we have here characterized a physiological KAR mechanism regulating formation of the glutamatergic synaptic circuitry in the amygdala. The endogenous KAR signaling operates during the time of intense synaptogenesis, before the onset of amygdala-dependent behaviors and emergence of the cortical inputs. KARs have been implicated in CNS disorders related to dysfunction of the limbic areas, including mood and anxiety disorders, autism, schizophrenia, as well as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jane et al., 2009</xref>).

Our data indicate that the KAR-dependent circuit remodeling physiologically operates in the developing brain, and support the idea that KAR malfunction during circuit development might predispose to neurological disorders later on in life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female Wistar rats (P4-P21) were used in most experiments.

For post-hoc morphological analysis, biocytin (0.4%) was included in the intracellular solution in some of the recordings. Spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of TTX (1 μM), and PiTX (100 μM) at a holding membrane potential of −70 mV. mEPSCs were analyzed with MiniAnalysis 6.0.3 program (Synaptosoft Inc). Events were verified visually, and events with amplitude less than three times the baseline rms noise level were rejected. For time-course plots, detected events were calculated in 120 s bins.

For AMPA-NMDA ratio, evoked EPSCs were recorded in the presence of PiTX at −70 and +40 mV. The AMPAR–related component was calculated as the peak of the response at −70 mV, and NMDAR-mediated current was isolated by calculating the average amplitude of the response recorded at +40 mV 50–60 ms after stimulation.

Dendritic trees and dendritic spines were imaged using a LSM Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss Plan Neofluar 20x/0.50 and alpha Plan146 Apochromat 63x/1.46 OilKorr M27 objectives). Dendritic trees were imaged with resolution of 2.3 pixels/μm and Z-stack interval of 1 μm. Spines were imaged with resolution of 15.17 pixels/μm and Z-stack interval of 0.5 μm. Spine density was evaluated on the primary dendrites for P7-11 and on the secondary for P14-21. Actual spine detection was done using the NeuronStudio software to quantify spines in a Z-stack image. Verification of the spine detection was done manually. Values of spine density per cell were used for statistical analysis. Sholl analysis was performed on 2D maximal intensity images acquired from Z-stacks, using the Fiji ImageJ plugin.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.

The paper investigates mRNA expression, agonist-induced currents, and antagonist effects on synaptic facilitation in projection cell populations in the lateral, basal and centrolateral nuclei during early postnatal development (4-21 days old). Further, they perform viral genetic manipulations of GluK1 expression, targeted to the basal and lateral nuclei, to determine the impact on dendritic morphology and spontaneous synaptic activity of centrolateral spiny neurons. The findings will be of interest to synaptic physiologists and support a model in which developmental refinement of kainate responses shapes amygdalar function. However, there are potential issues with experimental rigor, the findings are rather disparate in terms of how they can be interrelated at the circuit level, and the conclusion that early postnatal kainate receptors in the lateral amygdala are necessary for development of intrinsic (LA→CeA) synaptic connections is not directly tested.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the description of cell-type expression of GluK receptors in the first part of the Results is anecdotal, and the relevant points about cell specific expression should be either directly shown (figures or tables) or not reported.</p><p>2) It is difficult to be confident that Cre expression was restricted to the basolateral amygdala, especially with neonatal injections. Figure 6A seems to contain a lot of punctate signal beyond the BLA, including within the CeA. This weakens the claim that the developmental effects of GluK1 knockout on CeA morphology and electrophysiology can be attributed entirely to presynaptic kainate receptor activity in the BLA. It is critical to the conclusions of the paper that Cre, shRNA and GluK1 overexpression be carefully documented with a series of confocal micrographs and/or cell counts, and criteria for exclusion should be explicitly described. This is of particular concern given the technical challenges with precise stereotaxic injections into deep neonatal brain structures.</p><p>3) The title of Figure 6 is &quot;Local inactivation of GluK1 in the BLA in a cKO model perturbs development of glutamatergic projections to CeA&quot;, but the figure actually contains no analysis of BLA projections or BLA-specific synaptic responses. Instead, the analysis focuses on spontaneous synaptic transmission, dendritic properties and spine density in CeA neurons. Although these parameters were affected, whether BLA→CeA synaptic connections were specifically involved remains unaddressed.</p><p>4) It remains unclear whether some observed effects of GluK1 knockout, knockdown and overexpression could be due to modulation of glutamate release probability rather than changes in synapse density. This issue is compounded in part through some inconsistencies in the authors' presentation. For example, on the second Results page they state &quot;the mean mEPSC frequency, reflecting the density of functional glutamatergic inputs to the recorded neuron…&quot;, but then in the very next paragraph they counter their own argument with &quot;..the mean mEPSC frequency might be affected by factors other than synapse number…&quot;. Overall, it is not clear whether a presynaptic mechanism is involved or how BLA synaptic connections were specifically affected since directly evoked responses were not examined.</p><p>5) Although the results indicate that morphology and synaptic properties of CeA neurons can be bidirectionally regulated by genetic manipulations of GluK1, an unanswered question is whether these effects are specific to this early developmental period and to what extent these effects can be attributed to disruption of a normative developmental process. For example, how does CeA dendritic morphology and spine density normally change during the period when genetic manipulations were performed?</p><p>6) Effects of GluK1 genetic manipulations on BLA neurons, where these genetic constructs were expressed, should be examined. Do these manipulations affect dendritic complexity, spine density or synaptic transmission in BLA neurons and, if so, are these effects restricted to transfected cells (i.e. cell autonomous)?</p><p>7) Statistical support for results is incomplete. In particular, many effects are reported as% change from early postnatal periods (e.g.% change from P4 levels). However P4 levels were typically quite heterogenous, and the statistical analysis of developmental differences should take this baseline variability into account, and it is not clear that this was done. Overall, it would probably be better to just report raw values, not normalized to a particular time point, given the underlying variability.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kainate-type of glutamate receptors regulate wiring of intrinsic glutamatergic connectivity in the rodent amygdala&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have been very responsive to previous concerns, in particular with their inclusion of new analysis and experimental results. The major conclusions now enjoy sufficient support.</p><p>Based in part on new results, the authors should revise the text, including the title, to more accurately reflect the experimental results. Throughout the paper and in the title, the results are described as indicating that kainate receptors regulate &quot;intrinsic wiring&quot; of the amygdala. However, the data really do not address very well whether wiring is affected per se, since this would require some analysis of axons, boutons, connection probability, etc. Rather, the data provide evidence only that input/output relation and AMPA:NMDA ratios are affected by kainate receptor expression at the LA→CeA pathway. The best evidence therefore is that kainate receptors regulate postsynaptic efficacy, rather than wiring. Although some morphological changes were described, these were never localized to intrinsic versus extrinsic connections and so their relevance to the LA→CeA pathway remains unclear. The authors should therefore revise their Introduction, Results and Discussion to more accurately reflect what is shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52798.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the description of cell-type expression of GluK receptors in the first part of the results is anecdotal, and the relevant points about cell specific expression should be either directly shown (figures or tables) or not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text accordingly and removed all statements that are not directly supported by data shown in the Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is difficult to be confident that Cre expression was restricted to the basolateral amygdala, especially with neonatal injections.

Specifically, we investigated the input/output relationship, paired pulse ratio and AMPA/NMDA ratio of EPSCs, recorded from CeA in response to LA stimulation. We find significant differences in the input-output ratio and AMPA/NMDA ratio of the EPSCs between AAV CRE – injected GluK1 cKO mice and GFP injected controls.

Our data indicates that in AAV CRE injected GluK1 cKOs, AMPA/NMDA ratio is lower as compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in the PPR. These data suggest that an increase in the proportion of silent synapses might contribute to the loss of mEPSCs in addition to lower density of synapses (revealed by morphological characterization).

Also, raw data are shown in the figures. In the text, to make it easier to the reader, data are given as% difference with the variability indicated ( ± sem).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have been very responsive to previous concerns, in particular with their inclusion of new analysis and experimental results.
