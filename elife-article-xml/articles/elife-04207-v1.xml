In this study, we explore the targets of FOXL2 and five nuclear receptors in murine primary follicular cells. We found that FOXL2 is required for normal gene regulation by steroid receptors, and we show that estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) is the main vector of estradiol signaling in these cells. Moreover, we found that FOXL2 directly modulates <italic>Esr2</italic> expression through a newly identified intronic element. Interestingly, we found that FOXL2 repressed the testis-determining gene <italic>Sox9</italic> both independently of estrogen signaling and through the activation of ESR2 expression. Altogether, we show that FOXL2 mobilizes estrogen signaling to establish a coherent feed-forward loop repressing <italic>Sox9</italic>. This sheds a new light on the role of FOXL2 in ovarian maintenance and function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04207.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04207.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04207.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In female mammals, granulosa cells in the ovaries help egg cells to grow and develop by secreting nutrients and estrogens—the female sex hormones. A protein called FOXL2 helps granulosa cells to develop and functions by binding to the DNA of the cells to switch certain genes either on or off.</p><p>In humans, mutations in the gene that codes for the FOXL2 protein are associated with granulosa cell tumors and with a loss of female fertility in early adulthood. In addition, if the amount of FOXL2 is artificially reduced in granulosa cells in female mice, the cells take on many of the characteristics of supporting cells found in the testes of males.</p><p>To investigate in more detail how FOXL2 works, Georges et al. grew mouse granulosa cells in the laboratory to identify the DNA sequences where FOXL2 will bind, and to uncover how this binding affects gene expression. Georges et al. conclude that FOXL2 orchestrates a network involving many different proteins that allows estrogen to be produced and used by granulosa cells; and in doing so these cells maintain their identity as ovarian cells. FOXL2 was also shown to work closely with the receptor proteins that detect the sex hormones, and which help to control whether particular sex-specific genes are switched on or off.</p><p>One particularly important role of FOXL2 in granulosa cells is that it represses a gene called <italic>Sox9</italic>. By repressing <italic>Sox9</italic>, the granulosa cells do not transform into their counterparts normally found in testes. Although FOXL2 was previously reported to directly regulate the <italic>Sox9</italic> gene, Georges et al. find that it also acts through other molecules, and that there are alternative ways in which it can do so.</p><p>Although Georges et al. have established some of the ways that FOXL2 functions, this protein can work via other pathways; these will require further investigation to be fully understood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04207.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04207.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>cell identity</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>FOXL2</kwd><kwd>estrogen</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veitia</surname><given-names>Reiner A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veitia</surname><given-names>Reiner A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universite Paris VII</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zider</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><name><surname>Veitia</surname><given-names>Reiner A</given-names></name><name><surname>L’Hôte</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Todeschini</surname><given-names>Anne Laure</given-names></name><name><surname>Auguste</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name><name><surname>Legois</surname><given-names>Bérengère</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Georges</surname><given-names>Adrien</given-names></name><name><surname>L'Hôte</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Todeschini</surname><given-names>Anne Laure</given-names></name><name><surname>Auguste</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name><name><surname>Legois</surname><given-names>Bérangère</given-names></name><name><surname>Zider</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><name><surname>Veitia</surname><given-names>Reiner A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FOXL2 maintenance of ovarian identity is not solely due to a simple direct repression of Sox9 but to the mobilization of estrogen signalling by FOXL2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>FOXL2 is a key transcriptional regulator of the differentiation and maintenance of granulosa cells, those supporting oocyte maturation and growth during folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmidt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Georges et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, mature granulosa cells are absent in <italic>Foxl2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice because pre-granulosa cells remain blocked and do not undergo further differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmidt et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, depletion of <italic>Foxl2</italic> in already mature granulosa cells in mice results in their (molecular) transdifferentiation and in the upregulation of markers of Sertoli cells, the male counterpart of granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, FOXL2 heterozygous mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), characterized by facial malformations often associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crisponi et al., 2001</xref>). Recent works have shown that FOXL2 mutations impairing its DNA binding and/or transcriptional activity are responsible for POI occurrence in BPES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dipietromaria et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Todeschini et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a specific somatic mutation of FOXL2 has been identified in more than 95% of adult-type granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) confirming the strong association of FOXL2 with granulosa cell fate and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jamieson and Fuller, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite this accumulating wealth of knowledge, the mechanisms by which FOXL2 regulates granulosa cell differentiation are not well understood. This is in particular due to the difficulty to study the pre-granulosa-to-granulosa cell transition. FOXL2 transcriptional targets have been studied using various models such as GCT-derived cell lines or ovaries from constitutive knockout mice, preventing thus far to fully understand the function of FOXL2 in healthy granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Georges et al., 2014</xref>). However, there are some well established facts such as the cooperation between FOXL2 and SMAD3 on several enhancers, in particular one driving the expression of follistatin, a key factor of ovarian function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tran et al., 2011</xref>, 3). FOXL2 has also been described to interact with the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in mouse ovaries to repress the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic>, an essential transcriptional regulator of Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, mice depleted of both estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) display a transdifferentiation of granulosa cells apparently similar to that observed when <italic>Foxl2</italic> is depleted in mature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Couse et al., 1999</xref>). FOXL2 interacts with many other transcription factors of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, such as NR5A1 (also known as Steroidogenic factor 1, SF-1), an orphan NR critical for gonadal development; NR2C1, another orphan NR whose paralog NR2C2 is involved in folliculogenesis, and the progesterone receptor PGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">L’hôte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghochani et al., 2012</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that FOXL2 might be involved in coordinating NR activity in granulosa cells.</p><p>Here, we explore the transcriptional targets of FOXL2 and its impact on target gene regulation by five NRs (ESR1, ESR2, AR, NR5A1, and NR2C1). This work was performed in murine primary follicular cells using a knockdown approach coupled to high-throughput genomic technologies. These analyses allowed us to uncover a thorough core of FOXL2 transcriptional targets in preantral-small antral follicles, which includes many key genes of ovarian function. A ChIP-Seq analysis of FOXL2 genomic binding sites in these cells suggests that it mainly binds to regions located in the introns of its targets, and provides a resource of potential regulatory elements. We find that FOXL2 strongly influences gene regulation by estrogen and androgen receptors. Moreover, we show that FOXL2 is required for normal expression of <italic>Esr2</italic> through a newly identified <italic>Esr2</italic> intronic regulatory element and that ESR2 is the main effector of 17β-estradiol (E2) signaling in these cells. FOXL2 is also required for the expression of <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, which encodes the limiting enzyme in estrogen production, and FOXL2, ESR2 and estradiol all participate in SOX9 repression. Our data show that FOXL2 expression establishes a coherent subnetwork allowing estrogen production and signaling in granulosa cells as well as the maintenance of granulosa identity through an indirect repression of SOX9.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic effects of the depletion of FOXL2 and various NRs</title><p>To determine the transcriptional targets of FOXL2, we set up a model of murine primary granulosa cells for performing knockdown and transcriptomic analyses. Specifically, we purified preantral-small antral follicles from the ovaries of 8-week-old female Swiss mice. After an overnight culture, the follicles were dispersed using trypsin and cells were grown for a maximum of 8 days. Follicular cells are known to progressively (trans)differentiate in culture, by upregulating markers of Sertoli cells or by luteinizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nekola and Nalbandov, 1971</xref>). We therefore verified by immunofluorescence that the expression of FOXL2, which is absent in luteinized cells, was maintained throughout culture and that SOX9 was not substantially upregulated. We observed a similar level of FOXL2 expression in follicles cultured for one night as in 9-day cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SOX9 upregulation was observed in about 20% of the cells. However, we could check that the known FOXL2-mediated repression of <italic>Sox9</italic> was still operant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, upregulation of SOX9 could be detected as soon as 24 hr after treating the cells with a commercial siRNA pool targeting FOXL2, and its expression continued to increase 48 hr after treatment. This stresses the importance of limiting the interval between knockdown and RNA analysis to assess the direct and indirect targets of FOXL2, as transcriptional changes can also occur because of SOX9 upregulation. We also verified that we could detect the expression of six NRs of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that <italic>Ar, Esr2</italic> and <italic>Nr5a1</italic> were the most expressed NRs, and in particular that <italic>Esr2</italic> was at least four times more expressed than <italic>Esr1</italic> in these cells, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lenie and Smitz, 2008</xref>). Since progesterone receptor was very poorly expressed, we removed it from the analysis. We focused instead on the targets of the androgen receptor, which is required for terminal folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Walters et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04207.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FOXL2 and nuclear receptor transcriptional targets in primary follicular cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis by immunofluorescence of FOXL2 and SOX9 expression in primary murine granulosa cells cultured for either 1 day or 9 days.

Specifically, we treated cells on the one hand with control or FOXL2-targeting siRNAs and on the other hand with control siRNAs or siRNAs targeting each of the NRs. This experimental design gave us six different conditions in which we could study the transcriptional targets of FOXL2 independently of the action of the NRs. We thus used a paired <italic>Significance Analysis of Microarrays</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tusher et al., 2001</xref>). This analysis detected 863 genes whose expression was modified by FOXL2 with a median false discovery rate &lt;0.1%. Among them, we selected the genes undergoing an expression fold-change of at least 1.5. We thus obtained a list of 224 FOXL2-activated targets (i.e., with decreased expression in the absence of FOXL2) and 139 repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). Out of 345 FOXL2 target genes also present in the data set of Uhlenhaut et al., 71 were similarly affected following <italic>Foxl2</italic> deletion in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These notably included the critical factors for folliculogenesis <italic>Fst</italic>, <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, <italic>Esr2</italic>, <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Gja1</italic>, and <italic>Bmpr1b</italic>, which required FOXL2 for their expression, as well as the testis-determining or testis-specific factors <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Sox8</italic>, and <italic>Dhh,</italic> which were repressed by FOXL2. FOXL2 ablation in granulosa cells results in a loss of their identity and in the appearance of testis-like structures, making difficult to evaluate which genes are first affected by the loss of FOXL2. These common targets may thus represent the early responders to FOXL2 deletion and play a critical role in the maintenance of granulosa cell identity, whereas other differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of mutant mice may be affected following the transdifferentiation of granulosa cells. GO term enrichment of the former genes reveals in particular their role in the <italic>regulation of hormone levels</italic> (p = 2.10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The intersection of both data sets provides strong candidates for in vivo FOXL2 targets in murine ovaries.</p><p>We then explored the transcriptional changes owing to the knockdowns of each of the five NRs. To ensure a good reliability of the potential targets obtained, we focused on genes whose expression displayed a twofold change or more (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We found that NR5A1, ESR2, and AR were the NRs had the highest numbers of potential direct and indirect targets (according to our inclusion criteria), whereas ESR1 and NR2C1 had very few targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that the knockdown of either <italic>Esr1</italic> or <italic>Nr2c1</italic> may be compensated by their respective paralogs <italic>Esr2</italic> and <italic>Nr2c2</italic>, which are more strongly expressed in follicular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ESR2 only had activated targets, whereas AR and NR5A1 had as many activated as repressed targets.</p><p>We used the same strategy to explore how the absence of FOXL2 modified the expression of the targets of the NRs defined above. Interestingly, ESR2 and AR kept very few targets in the absence of FOXL2, whereas NR5A1 conserved a similar number of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistently, the absence of FOXL2 led to halving the average transcriptional effect of ESR2 and AR on their target genes, whereas target modulation by NR5A1 underwent only a slight decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that FOXL2 is required directly or indirectly for efficient target regulation by ESR2 and AR, but not by NR5A1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome-wide identification of potential regulatory elements recognized by FOXL2</title><p>To better understand how FOXL2 regulates its direct transcriptional targets, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (anti-FOXL2 ChIP-seq) in primary follicular cells. Using MACS as the peak detection algorithm, we detected about 14,000 peaks suggestive of FOXL2 binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The analysis of these peaks revealed a highly enriched sequence corresponding to the characteristic motif of <italic>forkhead</italic> factors (5′-G/A-T-A-A-A-C/T-A-3′), with a very narrow enrichment window centered at the peak summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We analyzed the positions of FOXL2 peaks with respect to the annotated loci on the genome and found that transcription start sites (TSSs) were strongly enriched in FOXL2 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). They were especially present within −300 bp and +100 bp around the TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, to our surprise, when we correlated the presence of FOXL2 peaks with the transcriptional effects of the <italic>Foxl2</italic> knockdown, we observed that the former were not over-represented near the TSSs (or the promoter regions) of its transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, we detected a strong enrichment of FOXL2 peaks in the regions containing the transcription units (TUs, extending from the TSS to the annotated polyA signal) of FOXL2-activated targets, but not in the TUs of the repressed ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This observation was even more striking considering only the 71 ‘in vivo’ FOXL2 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since the TUs of protein coding genes are largely composed of introns (in terms of sequence length), this suggests that FOXL2 acts mainly through intronic regulatory elements (as previously described for <italic>Fst</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, a majority of FOXL2-activated targets had FOXL2 peaks in their introns (examples in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggestive of the existence of potential regulatory elements recognized by FOXL2, although some target genes had no peak within their TUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The enrichment of FOXL2 peaks in the TSSs may thus be a consequence of the decondensed chromatin state of these regions (i.e., nonfunctional binding). This observation is worth noting because the presence of ChIP peaks for transcription factors at TSSs is widely used as a criterion suggesting active transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ouyang et al., 2009</xref>), although as shown here for FOXL2, it may not always be the case. Interestingly, FOXL2-repressed genes were not enriched in FOXL2 peaks, in or at the proximity (50 kb) of their TUs. This notably included the testis determining genes <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Sox8</italic>, and <italic>Dhh</italic>, suggesting that their repression by FOXL2 may be mostly indirect, at least in these cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04207.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide analysis of FOXL2 binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Logo representing two motifs over-represented in FOXL2 peaks and corresponding to forkhead motifs.

A sequence analysis of these elements showed that peak 3 contained a 20-bp DNA sequence composed of contiguous FOXL2, GATA, and SMAD elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and that peak 2 contained several potential FOXL2 elements. Conversely, peak 1 contained no obvious sequences corresponding to FOXL2 or SMAD3 motifs. To test whether these peaks could be regulatory elements, we cloned each of them upstream of a minimal SV40 promoter driving the expression of the luciferase gene. Next, we co-transfected these constructs with plasmids driving the expression of FOXL2 and SMAD3 in COV434 cells, human granulosa-derived cells, which are advantageous in this case as they do not express FOXL2 and very poorly express SMAD3. These cells were then treated with Activin A or a control solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We found that neither FOXL2 nor SMAD3 could activate the expression of luciferase through the peak 1 sequence, whereas only FOXL2 could activate luciferase expression through the peak 2 sequence. Interestingly, FOXL2 and SMAD3 synergistically activated luciferase expression through the peak 3 sequence (located in the 8<sup>th</sup> intron of <italic>Esr2</italic>), and this effect was enhanced when the cells were treated with Activin A. This observation was confirmed when we expressed a constitutively active Activin receptor (TGFBR1-T204D), suggesting that the observed effect is mediated by the canonical TGF-β pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This is coherent with the presence of a FOXL2/SMAD3 composite element in the peak 3 sequence. We therefore created constructs where we mutated either the FOXL2 or the SMAD3 site in the composite element, and a construct in which the whole element was removed. As expected, we observed a strong reduction of luciferase expression when the SMAD3 or FOXL2 elements were mutated or when the whole composite element was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, ‘full peak 3’ series). However, a weaker synergistic activation of luciferase expression by FOXL2 and SMAD3 remained even in the absence of FOXL2 and SMAD3 elements, suggesting that other non-canonical DNA elements or interactions may account for part of FOXL2/SMAD3 synergy.</p><p>We observed that a canonical estrogen receptor-binding site was present nearby FOXL2 and SMAD3 sites in the peak 3 sequence. We therefore tested whether ESR2 could activate its own expression, alone or in combination with FOXL2 and TGFβ/SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the overexpression of ESR2 alone or in combination with SMAD3 and TGFBR1 (T204D) had little effect on luciferase activity. However, ESR2 was able to slightly induce luciferase in the presence of FOXL2 and more strongly in the presence of FOXL2, SMAD3, and TGFBR1 (T204D). Therefore, this experiment suggests that the induction of <italic>Esr2</italic> expression due to FOXL2 and TGFβ signals may be amplified by ESR2 action on its own enhancer, although ESR2 itself may not be able to stabilize alone its own expression. This further supports the idea that FOXL2 is required to establish a robust ESR2 expression in the ovary. Several observations corroborate this finding. Indeed, the transcriptional effect of <italic>Foxl2</italic> knockdown is well correlated with the one of ESR2 on its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thirteen out of the 20 ESR2 target genes detected here are also (direct and indirect) targets of FOXL2. These shared targets represent slightly more than 10% of FOXL2 targets, confirming that FOXL2 acts upstream of ESR2. In line with this, a hierarchical clustering of FOXL2-activated targets yields two main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first cluster is mainly characterized by a strong effect of <italic>Esr2</italic> knockdown and includes ESR2 transcriptional targets, whereas no particular signature was observed for the second cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results show that gene regulation via, or along with, ESR2 may represent an important part of the transcriptional effects of FOXL2. Moreover, a third of the ESR2 targets in cultured cells, and <italic>Esr2</italic> itself, had a decreased expression in the <italic>Foxl2</italic> conditional-knockout ovaries, suggesting that FOXL2 regulates ESR2 (and its targets) in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Finally, it is interesting to note that although FOXL2 has a strong positive transcriptional effect on ESR2 targets in control conditions, it has in average no effect on the same genes when <italic>Esr2</italic> is knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). FOXL2 still activates a few genes, such as <italic>Fam84a</italic>, although to lower extents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that the overall positive effect of FOXL2 on ESR2 targets is indeed due to the activation by FOXL2 of ESR2 expression, although FOXL2 may also have some positive or negative effects on individual ESR2 targets through independent pathways.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04207.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Analysis of estradiol-dependent transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of the FOXL2-activated target genes in our arrays.

We therefore analyzed the transcriptomic changes following a 10 hr 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment of primary granulosa cells pre-treated for 24 hr with either anti-FOXL2 or control siRNAs. We considered as potential targets those genes in the microarrays whose expression displayed a fold-change &gt;2 in the presence of E2. We found 41 genes responding to estradiol according to our inclusion threshold, 39 of which were activated and only 2 were repressed. This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that ERs are mainly transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kininis et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The E2-activated targets comprised granulosa markers such as <italic>Hsd11b2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), but also some genes involved in cancer such as <italic>Tacc1, Angpt2,</italic> or <italic>Cbs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghayad et al., 2009</xref>, 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with previous works, E2 also repressed, at a lower level (&lt;2-fold), the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic>, involved in testis development.</p><p>We next compared the effect of E2 with the effect of <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Esr2</italic> knockdowns on the same genes, as determined in our previous experiments. We found that the response to E2 was strongly correlated with the transcriptomic effect of <italic>Esr2</italic> knockdown, but not to that of <italic>Esr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This result suggests that ESR2, which is more expressed than ESR1 in these cells, is the main vector of estrogen signaling.</p><p>We then determined the number of genes affected by E2 treatment in the absence of FOXL2 and we observed a strong reduction of E2 effect in this case. Indeed, only 27 genes were E2 targets in the absence of FOXL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In average, E2-dependent gene activation (in terms of mRNA levels) was reduced by about 35% in the absence of FOXL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This supports the idea that FOXL2 is required for normal E2 signaling in follicular cells.</p><p>To have a broader view of the effect of FOXL2 on E2-induced transcriptional changes, we conducted an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of genes modified by &gt;1.5-fold in the presence of E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This analysis yielded three main groups of E2-activated genes and two groups of E2-repressed genes. These clusters were mainly characterized by the effect of the <italic>Foxl2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, the average effect of E2 in the presence or absence of FOXL2 was remarkably similar between the groups. Indeed, E2 effect was reduced as much (≈40%) for FOXL2-repressed genes than for FOXL2-activated ones. This suggests an indirect effect of FOXL2 on E2-dependent transcriptional changes, that is, that FOXL2 is required for the expression of a mediator of E2-dependent transcriptional regulation. However, a direct cooperation or antagonism between FOXL2 and ERs may occur on some genes.</p><p>Next, we selected 27 E2-activated genes among those having relatively high basal expression levels and tested by qPCR whether E2 could elicit their activation in the absence of ESR1, ESR2, or FOXL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4 fig4s5">Figures 4—figure supplement 4 and 5</xref>). Not surprisingly, E2 activation was mostly maintained in the absence of ESR1, but it was strongly decreased upon <italic>Esr2</italic> knockdown. This is coherent with the correlation of the effect of E2 with only the effect of ESR2 and confirms that ESR2 is the main effector of estradiol signaling in these primary cells. The same experiment in the presence of anti-FOXL2 siRNAs showed a 40% reduction of E2-dependent gene activation, similar to what was observed on microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

As expected considering our transcriptomic analyses, we observed that SOX9 expression was upregulated in the absence of either FOXL2 or ESR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). SOX9 expression was much higher in the absence of both ESR2 and FOXL2. This confirms that estrogen receptors and FOXL2 co-regulate SOX9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, our transcriptomic analyses indicate that FOXL2 is required for the expression of <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in estradiol production) both in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and in the absence of hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, FOXL2 may allow both estradiol production and enable estrogen signaling in the same cells.

We therefore deprived follicular cells of hormones for 24 hr before treating them with siRNA pools for 24 hr, and finally with E2 for 10 hr before lysis. We observed that E2 treatment induced a repression of SOX9 expression, in coherence with our transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>Esr1</italic> knockdown, on the other hand, had no clear effect on SOX9 expression or on the efficiency of SOX9 repression following E2 treatment. However, we observed that ESR2 knockdown resulted in an increase of SOX9 expression even in the virtual absence of hormones and that E2-induced repression was reduced in the absence of ESR2. Finally, SOX9 expression was much increased in the absence of FOXL2, but E2 was still efficient in repressing <italic>SOX9</italic> in this case. Altogether, our data show that FOXL2 and ESR2/E2 repress somewhat independently SOX9 expression in follicular cells. It has previously been suggested that FOXL2 and ESR1 bind together to a Testis-specific enhancer of <italic>Sox9</italic> to repress its expression. Here, we have detected no binding of FOXL2 to this sequence or to any other close sequence in our ChIP-Seq analysis. It is possible that the binding was lost during cell culture or that it occurs at a different stage of follicular development. However, the fact that FOXL2/E2 repression of SOX9 is still operant in our case suggests that several pathways orchestrated by FOXL2 cooperate to repress SOX9 expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results provide a considerable number of direct and indirect targets of FOXL2 and of various NRs in follicular cells, but shows above all how FOXL2 may establish estrogen signaling in the ovary. Indeed, we show that FOXL2 is essential for Activin-dependent up-regulation of <italic>Esr2</italic> in follicular cells. This involves synergistic interactions between FOXL2 and SMAD3 on a regulatory element located within the 8<sup>th</sup> intron of the <italic>Esr2</italic> gene. Furthermore, we were able to show that ESR2 is the main vector of estradiol signaling in cells from preantral follicles, which is coherent with the fact that <italic>Esr2</italic> is much more expressed than <italic>Esr1</italic> in such growing follicles. Previous studies also suggested that ESR1 is poorly expressed in granulosa cells of growing follicles whereas ESR2 was often described as the main estrogen receptor in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lenie and Smitz, 2008</xref>). We provide evidence that FOXL2 has a major indirect impact on estradiol signaling through its direct regulation of <italic>Esr2</italic>. This role of FOXL2 on ESR2 signaling is also likely to exist in vivo (i.e., in the ovary) and expands its already known role in estrogen production through the regulation of aromatase expression, confirmed here. This suggests the existence of a coherent feed-forward loop in which FOXL2 stimulates both E2 production and receptivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to maintain granulosa cell identity, as FOXL2, ESR2 and E2 all participate in SOX9 repression. This model is complementary of a previously proposed mechanism in which FOXL2 and ESR1 directly cooperated to repress <italic>Sox9</italic> expression though the TESCO enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). We could not detect any binding of FOXL2 nor ESR1 to this region in our cells (data not shown), whereas the ability of FOXL2 and estrogens to repress <italic>Sox9</italic> was still present. Moreover, this repression acted both through ESR2/E2 and independently of estrogens. This shows that FOXL2 represses <italic>Sox9</italic> and maintains ovarian identity through multiple pathways, some of them yet to be discovered. Our results are fully coherent with a recent study showing that <italic>Foxl2</italic> deletion almost fully abolishes testis feminization due to <italic>Dmrt1</italic> deletion, while <italic>Esr2</italic> deletion only partially affects feminization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Minkina et al. 2014</xref>). Further work will be necessary to fully characterize this repression and to identify other signaling pathways implicated in granulosa cell differentiation. We are aware that our in vitro system is sub-optimal and that follicular cells can undergo some degree of trans-differentiation over the course of the culture period. Thus, our results will benefit from validation in vivo as methods to work with small amounts of material improve in the future.</p><p>It is worth noting that FOXL2 regulates the expression of many factors involved in several signaling pathways of utmost importance in the ovary, such as TGF-β/BMP signaling factors (<italic>Fst, Bmp2, Bmpr1b</italic>), the MAP-kinase cascade (<italic>Adora1, Map3k5, Gadd45b</italic>), steroid signaling (<italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, <italic>Hsd11b2</italic>, <italic>Hsd17b1</italic>, <italic>Esr2</italic>), PPAR signaling (<italic>Pparg, Slc27a6, Fabp3</italic>), or PI3K/Akt signaling (<italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Angpt1</italic>, <italic>Angpt2)</italic>, which mediates part of FSH action in the ovary. Disruption of each of these pathways in the ovary is a cause of POI and their malfunction is commonly associated with oncogenesis and cancer progression. In this context, our finding that FOXL2 is required of proper estradiol signaling in the ovary may thus be an initial step towards a better molecular appraisal of the role of FOXL2 in global granulosa cell signaling response and its implication in tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and constructs</title><p>The rabbit anti-FOXL2 antibody has previously been described.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the three reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well thought-out, well designed study investigating the role of FOXL2 in regulating the normal biology of ovarian granulosa cells. By using primary granulosa cell cultures, the authors have overcome some of the limitations of cell numbers involved in studying <italic>in vivo</italic> ovarian function. Consistent with findings from previous publications, the authors have shown that FOXL2 activates genes that are crucial for normal granulosa cell function (folliculogenesis and ovulation), and represses genes that are involved in testis development (male-determining transcription factor SOX9) and thus the maintenance of granulosa cell identity. Additionally, the results from ChIP-seq have provided further insights on how FOXL2 regulate its transcriptional targets. By correlating the ChIP-seq data with the gene expression knockdown data, the authors have demonstrated that FOXL2 acts predominantly through intronic regulatory elements, particularly for FOXL2-activated targets. Moreover, the authors were also able to show that FOXL2 directly modulates ESR2 expression via a previously uncharacterized intronic element to regulate estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. Lastly, the authors proposed a feed-forward mechanism by which FOXL2 increases estrogen production (through CYP19A gene induction) and activates ESR2 expression to reinforce its repressive effects on SOX9 expression. This manuscript is a nice addition to the current literature on FOXL2 and its role in normal ovarian function.</p><p>The reviewers did raise some concerns that need to be addressed before we can consider the manuscript for publication.</p><p>1) Use of an <italic>in vitro</italic> system is sub-obtimal because of the potential loss of cell identity over time. First, it is reasonable to question whether this <italic>in vitro</italic> system is a good reflection of the <italic>in vivo</italic> cell environment. Although the authors show that the explanted cells can maintain FOXL2 expression (and repress SOX9 expression) for 9 days in culture, we should be cautious about how cell culture affects all aspects of the study, as loss of granulosa identity is likely a gradual process beginning soon after explant. The time between cell explant and transcriptome/ChIP measurements is not clear in the methods.</p><p>2) Another concern is that these investigators did not detect binding of FOXL2 (or ESR1) to the TESCO element upstream of SOX9 which has been mapped <italic>in vivo</italic> in adult granulosa cells. This suggests that this study may not accurately reflect FOXL2 binding sites <italic>in vivo</italic> in all cases.</p><p>3) The study derives several key conclusions based upon knockdown experiments. The manuscript, however, does not provide some important experimental details and information on controls. It is evident from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> that specific and selective knockdown has been achieved by each of the siRNAs. The author, however, fail to explain what is used as &quot;control&quot;. Ideally, the control cells should express non-specific siRNA and effects of a control siRNA should be validated. In the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> the authors state the following: &quot;levels were normalized by the expression levels of Actb and Sdha&quot;. The authors should choose one internal control and specify which was used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04207.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Use of an in vitro system is sub-obtimal because of the potential loss of cell identity over time.

However, this is the best solution we could implement to perform our molecular studies as close to &quot;<italic>in vivo&quot;</italic> as possible. To limit the problem of progressive transdifferentiation, we designed all the experiments to end the culture precisely at 9 days after follicle harvesting. The ‘Materials and methods’ section mentions that we passaged the cells at days 5 and 7. After the last passage, cells were either directly seeded for transfection (performed at day 8 and lysis at day 9) or kept in standard culture conditions until day 9 (for ChIP). This was clarified in the ‘Materials and methods’ section.</p><p><italic>2) Another concern is that these investigators did not detect binding of FOXL2 (or ESR1) to the TESCO element upstream of SOX9 which has been mapped in vivo in adult granulosa cells. This suggests that this study may not accurately reflect FOXL2 binding sites in vivo in all cases</italic>.</p><p>This was a concern for us too. Several hypotheses can be envisioned. One is that binding of FOXL2 to some of its target sites is indeed lost during cell culture. This is a possibility, as cells progressively change during cell culture and it has previously been shown in other fields that regulatory elements may become more or less accessible during this process. FOXL2 binding to the TESCO element was detected in whole ovaries, so it is also possible that the observed binding occurs in granulosa or theca cells not enriched in our culture system. A possible approach would be to carry ChIP on purified follicles at different stages, and ideally on purified theca and granulosa, which can be technically complex. However, the interesting point here is that we still observe that FOXL2 and estrogens/ESR2 do repress SOX9, even if we do not identify the regulatory element(s) mediating this repression. Thus, our data show that several pathways (and/or elements) are mobilized in this process.</p><p><italic>3) The study derives several key conclusions based upon knockdown experiments.

As for the internal control, the formula we used was unclear. Our internal control is the average relative expression level of Actb and Sdha (corrected in the text). We thought that using several internal controls would add robustness and improve the precision of the baseline. Choosing a control gene is to some extent arbitrary, so we thought picking an average of two generally accepted controls would reduce the level of arbitrariness.</p></body></sub-article></article>
