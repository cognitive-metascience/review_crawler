Therefore, uncovering the underlying molecular, cellular and tissue mechanisms is an important challenge. Schematically, tissue elongation relies on at least three determinants. First, the elongation axis must be defined by a directional cue that usually leads to the planar cell polarization (pcp) of the elongating tissue. Second, a force producing machinery must drive the elongation, and this force can be generated intrinsically by the cells within the elongating tissue and/or extrinsically by the surrounding tissues. Finally, such force induces tissue elongation via different cellular behaviors, such as cell intercalation, cell shape modification, cell migration or oriented cell division. This is exemplified by germband extension in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos where Toll receptors induce Myosin II planar polarization, which drives cell rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paré et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber development has emerged as a powerful model to study tissue elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilder and Haigo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>). Each egg chamber (or follicle) consists of a germline cyst that includes the oocyte, surrounded by the follicular epithelium (FE), a monolayer of somatic cells. The FE apical domain faces the germ cells, while the basal domain is in contact with the basement membrane. Initially, a follicle is a small sphere that progressively elongates along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, which becomes 2.5 times longer than the mediolateral axis (aspect ratio [AR] = 2.5), prefiguring the shape of the fly embryo.</p><p>All the available data indicate that follicle elongation relies on the FE. Specifically, along the FE basal domain, F-actin filaments and microtubules become oriented perpendicularly to the follicle AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutzeit, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>). The cytoskeleton planar polarization depends on the atypical cadherin Fat2, which acts via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Viktorinová et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Fat2 is also required for a dynamic process of collective cell migration of all the follicle cells around the AP axis until stage 8 of follicle development. This rotation reinforces F-actin planar polarization and triggers the polarized deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrils perpendicular to the AP axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lerner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurich and Dahmann, 2016</xref>). These fibrils have been proposed to act as a molecular corset, mechanically constraining follicle growth along the AP axis during follicle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). In addition, Fat2 is required for the establishment of a gradient of basement membrane (BM) stiffness at both poles at stage 7–8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>). This gradient also depends on the morphogen-like activity of the JAK-STAT pathway, and softer BM near the poles would allow anisotropic tissue expansion along the A-P axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>). After the end of follicle rotation, F-actin remains polarized in the AP plane during stages 9–11 and follicular cells (FCs) undergo oriented basal oscillations that are generated by the contractile activity of stress fibers attached to the basement membrane ECM via integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delon and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, in agreement with recently published observations, we noticed that a first phase of follicle elongation does not require <italic>fat2</italic> and the planar polarization of the basal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurich and Dahmann, 2016</xref>). We therefore focused on this phase, addressing main three questions which are: how the follicle elongation axis is defined, what the molecular motor triggering elongation in a specific axis is, and how FCs behave during this phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polar cells define the axis of early elongation</title><p>We analyzed the follicle elongation kinetics in <italic>fat2<sup>58D</sup></italic> mutants, which block rotation and show a strong round-egg phenotype.

The <italic>Pak</italic> gene encodes a Pak family serine/threonine kinase that localizes at the FE basal domain. <italic>Pak</italic> mutants also show many other abnormalities, such as the presence of more than one germline cyst and abnormal interfollicular filaments ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vlachos et al., 2015</xref>] and not shown). Interfollicular cells derive from prepolar cells that also give rise to the polar cells, which prompted us to analyze the distribution of the latter using the specific marker FasIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastock and St Johnston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005</xref>). Polar cells are pairs of cells that differentiate very early and are initially required for germline cyst encapsulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grammont and Irvine, 2001</xref>). They also have a role as an organizing center for the differentiation of FC sub-populations during mid-oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xi et al., 2003</xref>). In WT follicles, polar cells are localized at the follicle AP axis extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Conversely, in <italic>Pak</italic> mutants, we observed a single polar cell cluster or two clusters close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Pak</italic> is required for polar cell positioning, although a role in the specification or survival of these cells cannot be excluded, which in turn could play a role in defining the elongation axis. Some dominant suppressors of the <italic>Pak</italic> elongation defect have been identified, including PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr), although the reason for this suppression is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vlachos and Harden, 2011</xref>). By using flies that are heterozygous for a <italic>Pvr</italic> allele and mutant for <italic>Pak</italic>, we observed that the normal positioning of polar cells is frequently but not always restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We quantitatively compared the elongation of those two situations, normal or abnormal polar cells, by plotting the long axis as a function of the short axis for previtellogenic stages (before stage 8) and determined the corresponding regression line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We defined an elongation coefficient that corresponds to the slope of this line and for which a value of 1 means no elongation. This method allows us to quantify elongation independently of any bias that could be introduced by stage determination approximation due to aberrant follicle shape or differentiation. Moreover, focusing on previtellogenic stages allows the exclusion of genotypes that affect only the late elongation phase. It is exemplified by a <italic>fat2</italic> mutant that does not induce significant defects if we include only stage 3–7 follicles (previtellogenic), but does show a difference if we include stage 8 follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The statistical comparison of the elongation coefficients clearly shows that restoring polar cell position by removing one copy of <italic>Pvr</italic> in <italic>Pak</italic> mutants strongly rescues follicle elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>).</p><p>Although not been fully demonstrated in this context, Pak often works as part of the integrin signaling network, and mosaic follicles containing FC clones that are mutant for <italic>myospheroid</italic> (<italic>mys</italic>), which encodes the main fly β-integrin subunit, also show a round follicle phenotype at early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). We noticed that in some follicles containing <italic>mys</italic> mutant clones, polar cells are mispositioned, a defect generally observed when at least one polar cell is mutant. As in <italic>Pak</italic> mutants, the two polar cell clusters are not diametrically opposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>), or a single cluster is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Importantly, the polar cell positioning defect is associated with the round follicle phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Conversely, in mosaic follicles in which polar cell positioning was not affected, the round egg phenotype is never observed at early stages, even with large mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In agreement, the elongation coefficient of mosaic follicles that have normal polar cell positioning is much higher than that for those with abnormal polar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Thus, together, these results indicate that <italic>pak</italic> and <italic>mys</italic> mutants are not required for the early phase of elongation once polar cells are well-placed and thus affect this phase indirectly. The results also strongly suggest that polar cells are required to define the follicle elongation axis.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-32943-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Full z-stack of a follicle with a <italic>mys</italic> mutant clone that affects polar cells.</title></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-32943-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.005</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Full z-stack of a follicle with a <italic>mys</italic> mutant clone that does not affect polar cells.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A JAK-STAT gradient from the poles is the cue for early elongation</title><p>Once the follicle is formed, polar cells are important for the differentiation of the surrounding FCs. From stage 9 of oogenesis, FCs change their morphology upon activation by Unpaired (Upd), a ligand for the JAK-STAT pathway, which is exclusively produced by polar cells throughout oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Silver and Montell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGregor et al., 2002</xref>).

During the early stages of oogenesis, the pathway is active in all the main body FCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Moreover, we observed differences in GFP expression level (and thus STAT activity) between the poles and the mediolateral region, starting at about stage 3, concomitantly with the beginning of elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,h</xref>). At later stages (5–7), these expression differences lead to the formation of a gradient of STAT activity, as indicated by strong GFP expression at each pole and very weak or no signal in the large mediolateral part of each follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,h</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Therefore, we knocked-down by RNAi the ligand <italic>upd</italic> and the most downstream element of the cascade, the transcription factor <italic>Stat92E</italic>, both efficiently decreasing the activity of the pathway in the follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c,d,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Upd</italic> knockdown was performed using either upd:GAL4 that is specifically expressed in the polar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khammari et al., 2011</xref>) or tj:GAL4 that is expressed in all FCs, and then analyzed only in follicles that contained one germline cyst and correctly placed polar cells. During the early stages, with both drivers, such follicles are significantly rounder than control follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This indicates a role for JAK-STAT pathway in early elongation and confirms the causal link between polar cells and early elongation. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>Stat92E</italic> using a driver that is specifically expressed at the poles (Fru:GAL4) also affects early elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), suggesting a transcriptional control of elongation by JAK-STAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borensztejn et al., 2013</xref>). These results are the first examples of loss of function with an effect only on early elongation and independent of polar cells position, and indicate that both Upd secreted by the polar cells and JAK-STAT activation in FCs arerequired for follicle elongation. Moreover, clonal ectopic <italic>upd</italic> overexpression completely blocks follicle elongation, without affecting polar cell positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), demonstrating that Upd is not only a prerequisite for the elongation but the signal that defines its axis (n = 20). Similarly, general expression of Hop<sup>Tum</sup>, a gain-of-function mutation of fly JAK, that disrupts the pattern of JAK-SAT activation also affects follicle elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Thus, spatial control of JAK-STAT pathway activation is required for follicle elongation. Altogether, these results show that Upd secretion by polar cells and the subsequent gradient of JAK-STAT activation act as developmental cues that define the follicle elongation axis during the early stages of oogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MyosinII activity drives apical pulses and early elongation</title><p>Once the signal for elongation had been identified, we aimed to determine the molecular motor driving this elongation, which in many morphogenetic contexts is MyosinII (MyoII)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>). The knockdown in all FCs of <italic>spaghetti squash</italic> (s<italic>qh</italic>), the MyoII regulatory subunit, leads to a significant decrease in the elongation coefficient and in follicle AR from stage 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>), indicating that MyoII is the motor of early elongation. We have shown that the rotation and the planar polarization of the basal actomyosin is not involved in early elongation. Moreover, at these stages, MyoII is strongly enriched at the apical cortex, suggesting that its main activity is on this domain of the FCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref> and Figure 5c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>). We therefore looked at MyoII on living follicles, focusing on the apical side, and found that it is highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, transitory medio-apical recruitment of actomyosin usually drives apical pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, using a GFP trap line for Bazooka (Baz-GFP), which concentrates at the <italic>zonula adherens</italic> and marks the periphery of the apical domain, we observed that the transient accumulation of MyoII is associated with a contraction of this domain, which is followed by a relaxation when the MyoII signal decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Although we did not find a clear period because cells can pause for a variable time between two contractions, the approximate duration of a pulse was about three minutes. Cross-correlation analysis on many cells from several follicles (n = 86) confirms the association between MyoII and pulses, and reveals that Sqh accumulation slightly precedes the reduction of the apical surface, arguing that it is the motor responsible for these contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Inhibiting the activity of Rho kinase (rok), the main regulator of MyoII, using Y-27632, reduces follicle cells' surface variation by ~30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Thus, MyoII drives apical pulsing during early stages. Consequently, we asked whether and how apical pulses could induce elongation. From stage 9, basal pulses, which are important for the second phase of elongation, have been shown to be anisotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2010</xref>). However, quantification of axis length variations showed that the apical pulses were isotropic, both in the mediolateral and polar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Tissue elongation is often associated with tissue planar cell polarization, we therefore investigated whether Myosin II and Baz showed exclusive cortical planar polarization, as demonstrated for instance during germband extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>). Consistent with the isotropic nature of the pulses, we failed to detect any oriented enrichment of these proteins, indicating the absence of noticeable apical planar cell polarization of the motor that generates early elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i,j</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that MyoII induces apical pulses and early elongation. Nonetheless, neither the isotropic nature of the pulses nor MyoII localization explains how the pulses could induce elongation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Myosin II is required for early elongation and apical pulses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) WT and (a′) <italic>sqh</italic> knockdown stage 7 follicles stained for F-actin (red) and FasIII (white).

On the basis of the JAK-STAT activity gradient, we hypothesized that cells in the mediolateral part of the follicles should progressively change their behavior during follicle growth. We therefore monitored the mediolateral region of stage 3 and 7 follicles. At stage 3, cells undergo contractions and relaxations asynchronously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). At stage 7, cells were much less active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). This difference was confirmed by monitoring the variation of the relative apical surface of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) or a whole population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) (40% of mean variation at stage 3 and only about 15% in the equatorial part at stage 7). Quantification of the average variation of the apical cell surface in a series of follicles indicates that the pulsing amplitude gradually decreases in the mediolateral region from stage 3 to stage 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This correlation between JAK-STAT activity and pulsing activity in the mediolateral region prompted us to develop a method to visualize the poles of living follicles, which has never been done before (see Materials and methods). We managed to image the poles of stage 3–4 and stage 7–8 follicles, and in both cases the pulse activity is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). Finally, the analysis of slightly tilted stage 7–8 follicles clearly revealed a gradient of pulse intensity emanating from the pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

We generated mutant clones for a null allele of <italic>sqh</italic> to analyze where MyoII is required for elongation. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>), such clones reach a limited size, probably explaining why it is rare to obtain a clone that covers poles, especially after stage 5. We focused on clones covering the anterior pole. To quantify the effect of mutant clones on semi-follicles, we measured extrapolated Aspect Ratio (eAR) of each semi-follicle, which means, the ratio of the corresponding full ellipse (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). For a WT follicle, the anterior eAR is equal or superior to the posterior eAR, as the anterior pole is normally more pointed than the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Analysis of the eAR of the poles containing such mutant clones indicates that Myosin II loss of function specifically affects the elongation of this pole, compared to the opposite WT posterior poles (n = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,i</xref>). Moreover, we never observed clones in the mediolateral regions inducing elongation defects (n = 35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).

Such clones have a weaker effect on cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>), but still affect elongation when situated at the pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,j</xref>). Thus, MyoII and Rok are required specifically at the poles to induce early elongation. These results strongly argue that the gradient of apical isotropic FC pulses is the force-generating mechanism that drives early elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Early elongation is associated with cell constriction and cell intercalation</title><p>Independently of the upstream events, we asked which cellular behavior was associated with early elongation. The simplest possibility would be that cells are stretched along the AP axis. However, cells are actually slightly elongated perpendicularly to the axis of elongation and this morphology did not change significantly over time, indicating that this parameter does not contribute to follicle elongation during early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). Tissue elongation can be also associated with oriented cell divisions. A movie of mitosis in the FE showed that this orientation is really variable through the different steps of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We therefore quantified the orientation of cytokinesis figures, which did not highlight any bias towards the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Finally, we asked whether early elongation could be associated with cell intercalation. Analysis of fluorescence video-microscopy images gave inconclusive results because such events are probably rare and slow, and because follicle rotation precludes their reproducible observation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>). We therefore used an indirect method. As follicle cells from stage 6 onwards stop dividing and their number remains constant, we counted the number of cells in the longest line of the AP axis (i.e., the follicle plane that includes the polar cells). This number significantly increases between stage 6 and 8, showing that cells intercalate in this line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–d</xref>). This number is also correlated with the follicle AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), indicating that follicle early elongation is associated with cell intercalation along the AP axis. Cell intercalation can be powered at a cellular scale by the polarized enrichment of Myosin II in the cells that rearrange their junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>). However, we have already shown that MyoII does not show such a pattern in FCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i,j</xref>). Alternatively, intercalation can be promoted at a tissue scale. For instance, apical cell constriction in the wing hinge induces cell intercalations in the pupal wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). We observed that the cell apical surface is lower at the poles than in more equatorial cells, and that this difference increases during the early elongation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f,g,h</xref>). Such a difference could be explained by cell shape changes or by a differential cell growth. Cell height is significantly larger at the poles, indicating that the changes in apical surface are linked to cell morphology, as previously shown during mesoderm invagination for instance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2014</xref>). However, cells at the poles have a lower volume than those in the mediolateral region at stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This difference of volume is nonetheless proportionally weaker than the change in apical surface, suggesting the cell shape changes induce the reduction of volume rather than the opposite. Thus, early elongation is associated with a moderate cell constriction in the polar regions. <italic>sqh</italic> mutant FCs are stretched by the tension coming from germline growth, a defect opposite to cell constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g,h</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, FCs that are mutant for <italic>Stat92E</italic> are also flattened, with a larger surface and a lower height, compared to WT surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j–m</xref>). Moreover, the apical cell surface at the poles of stages 7–8 is increased by the loss of function of Upd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Hence, these results link JAK-STAT and the morphology of the follicle cells in a coherent manner with an involvement of apical pulses for the cell constriction observed at the poles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Localized apical cell constriction and oriented cell intercalation occur during early elongation.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) AR and number of cells along the polar cell plane in representative (<bold>a</bold>) stage 6, (<bold>b</bold>) stage 7 and (<bold>c</bold>) stage 8 follicles stained for DE-Cad. (d–e) Number of follicular cells in the plane of polar cells based on DE-Cad staining of stage 6–8 follicles depending on (d) the stage and (e) the aspect ratio of the follicle.

This is reminiscent of germband extension where different elongation mechanisms have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of the follicle, it is still not clear how overlapping and interconnected these different mechanisms are.</p><p>Fat2 has no role in early elongation. Nevertheless, Fat2 is required as early as the germarium for the correct planar polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and for follicle rotation, which takes place during the early elongation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The rotation reinforces the basal pcp of the F-actin during stages 4–6, and thus probably participates in the late phase in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurich and Dahmann, 2016</xref>). Rotation is also necessary for the deposition of ECM fibrils, although their specific role in elongation has not been clearly elucidated yet. Another mechanism that participates in elongation is the ECM stiffness gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>). However, its contribution begins only at stage 7–8. This is in agreement with the fact that the ECM stiffness gradient depends on Fat2 and that <italic>vkg</italic> (ColIV) loss-of-function follicles elongate correctly up to stage 8, showing that the ECM is required only in the second elongation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crest et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). Thus, the setting up of the elements required for this second elongation phase fully overlaps with the first elongation phase, but these two phases are so far unrelated at the mechanistic level. Notably, the early elongation phase requires elements of the apical side of follicle cells, whereas the second phase involves the basal side. Mirroring our observations, a recent report nicely shows that the fly germband extension, which was thought to depend exclusively on the apical domain of the cells, also involves their basal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). As both Fat2 and the gradient of BM stiffness are involved in the elongation at stage 8 and as apical pulses are still observed at this stage, it appears that the apical and basal domain contributions may slightly overlap. Moreover, both the gradients of apical pulses and of BM stiffness are under the control of JAK-STAT, indicating that this pathway has a pleiotropic effect on follicle elongation.</p><p>We have also shown that integrin and Pak contribute to early elongation in an indirect manner through their impact on the positioning, the differentiation or the survival of the polar cells. In this respect, <italic>Pak</italic> and <italic>mys</italic> mutants belong to a new phenotypic class that could also comprise the Laminin β1 subunit (LanB1) and the receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase Lar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Díaz de la Loza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frydman and Spradling, 2001</xref>). We do not yet know how the A-P position of those cells is established and maintained. Interestingly, <italic>Pak</italic> mutants also have an altered germarium structure leading to abnormal follicle budding, suggesting that polar cell mispositioning might be linked to this primary defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vlachos et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is worth noticing that <italic>Pak</italic> mutant follicles do not elongate at all, whereas they still have a cluster of polar cells. Thus, <italic>Pak</italic> might also be required for early elongation in a more direct manner than polar cell positioning, downstream of or in parallel to the JAK-STAT pathway, but independently of basal planar polarization.</p><p>We found that polar cells define the elongation axis of each follicle during early elongation by secreting the Upd morphogen and by forming a gradient from each pole, which in turn induces apical pulses. The isotropic nature of these pulses does not provide an evident link with tissue elongation, unlike the oriented basal pulses going on in later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the absence of planar polarization of MyoII in apical regions, which is the driving force of early elongation, and the non-requirement for ‘basal pcp’ strongly argue against a control of this elongation phase by a planar cell polarity working at a local scale. Instead, several strong arguments propose that early elongation relies on pulses working at a tissue scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6n</xref>). First, the pulses are distributed in a gradient from the poles, suggesting that this distribution can orient the elongation in each hemisphere. Also, our data indicate that JAK-STAT does not directly regulate MyoII activity, and, thus, that they probably work in parallel to control pulses. The convergence of requirement for JAK-STAT and myosin II activities for both pulses and early elongation argues for a causal link between these two processes. To date, JAK-STAT has no other known morphogenetic function before stage 8. Similarly, the only other known function of MyoII is linked to the rotation, which is not involved in early elongation, and MyoII is very concentrated at the apical cortex, emphasizing the role of this domain. Moreover, though present all around the follicle, MyoII is required for early elongation at the poles. Thus, the apical localization and the spatiotemporal requirement of MyoII are coherent with the action of apical pulses as the driving force for early elongation.</p><p>JAK-STAT has already been implicated in the elongation of different tissues in flies and in vertebrates. For instance, Upd works as the elongation cue for the hindgut during fly embryogenesis, a process also associated with cell intercalation, although the underlying mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2003</xref>). Maybe more significantly, JAK-STAT is involved in the extension-convergence mechanism during zebrafish gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamashita et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, JAK-STAT also participates in other morphogenetic events, such as tissue folding in the fly gut and wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wells et al., 2013</xref>). All these roles are potentially linked to a control of apical cell pulses. As our results indicate that this control is not through MyoII activation, identifying the transcriptional targets of STAT that explain its impact on apical actomyosin will be relevant for many developmental contexts.</p><p>How the apical pulses precisely drive early elongation remains a question that will require further investigations. Nonetheless, we determined that early elongation is associated with apical cell constriction close to the poles and oriented cell intercalations. Cell constriction is probably a direct consequence of apical pulses, as has been shown in many other contexts, because both myosin II and JAK-STAT loss of function affect pulse and induce an increase of the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Riechmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). Thus, as during tissue invagination, cell constriction may accentuate the curvature at the poles and thus promote elongation. Intercalation can be induced at a tissue scale by long-range anisotropic tensions in the tissue, as exemplified by the development of pupal wings or mammalian limb bud ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lau et al., 2015</xref>). In the wing, elongation is due to contraction of the hinge, which corresponds to an apical constriction of the cells. Here, the apical pulses could act in a similar way via the constriction, acting as a pulling force at each pole. Thus, intercalations may correspond to a passive response, bringing plasticity to the tissue and hence stabilizing its elongation. Although the respective contribution of these two cell behaviors - apical constriction at the poles and cell intercalation along the AP axis – and their potential links remain to be determined, together they probably recapitulate at the cellular scale the elongation observed at the tissue scale. Importantly, such a mechanism does not require any planar cell polarization, in agreement with our observations. A gradient of randomly oriented cell migration contributes to vertebrate AP axis elongation and is, to our knowledge, the only other example of a tissue elongation mechanism instructed by a signaling cue and independent of pcp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>), in contrast to the many examples where pcp controls cell-movements that induce axis elongation in vertebrates. Our work proposes an alternative mechanism to explain how a morphogen gradient can induce elongation solely through transcription activation, and without any requirement for a polarization of receiving cells. This simple mechanism may apply to other tissues and other morphogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetics</title><p>All the fly stocks with their origin and reference are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Follicles were incubated with Y-27632 (Sigma) (diluted in PBS to 250 µM) for 10–30 min before image acquisition. To image the poles, glass beads were added into the well to form a monolayer (Sigma-Aldrich, G4649 for stage 6–8 or G1145 for earlier stages). Ovarioles were added on top of the beads and follicles falling vertically between the beads were imaged.</p><p>Cell pulse analysis was performed using the Imaris software and a MATLAB homemade script to segment and measure the cell surface on maximum intensity projections of 40 stacks taken every 15 s. The intensity of one cell pulsation corresponds to: (maximum surface of the cell – min surface)/(mean surface). The isotropy of one cell pulse is measured by dividing the AP and ML bounding box (best fit rectangle) axis length at cell maximal area by the AP and MP bounding box axis length, respectively, at the cell’s minimal area. For each follicle, at least 10 cells were analyzed.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Jak-Stat pathway induces <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle elongation by a gradient of apical contractility&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Both reviewers agreed that there is a lot of new, important information contained within the manuscript, particularly describing the new process of elongation at early stages of oogenesis, but that there is definitely more work to do to make the data presented more solid. We would welcome a substantially revised paper in the future, but the authors should address all of the reviewers' concerns before beginning a new submission.</p><p>Additionally:</p><p>In the Abstract the authors write that elongation occurs &quot;without planar cell polarity requirement&quot;. However, they showed lack of planar polarization just for MyoII and Baz (subsection “MyosinII activity drives apical pulses and early elongation”).</p><p>Subsection “Polar cells define the axis of early elongation”, second paragraph: In Pak mutants, the authors often observe a single polar cell cluster (it should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, not 1D) and conclude, that Pak is required for polar cell &quot;positioning&quot;. If it is just involved in positioning, I would expect two follicle cell clusters in each case. For me it looks that Pak is required either for polar cell specification or for polar cell survival.</p><p>I also had some difficulties to find the link between the JAK-STAT activity gradient and the morphogenetic behavior (intercalation, stretching) described in the second part.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Alegot et al. focuses the elongation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle. Previous work established that this morphogenesis depends on a whole-tissue rotation; however, this paper reports that the follicle completes the earliest phase of elongation when rotation is blocked. The authors use two conditions in which the follicle remains spherical (loss of Pak and Mys) to show that the early elongation defect correlates with defects in the positioning of the polar cells. They then perform several experiments that suggest that an Upd signal from the polar cells is required for early elongation. Finally, they present data and propose a model suggesting that a gradient of myosin-based apical contraction emanating from the poles causes a convergence and extension type process in the epithelium.</p><p>The ovarian follicle has emerged as a powerful system to identify and study novel mechanisms contributing to tissue elongation. As such, the introduction of a new mechanism that feeds into this process represents an important contribution to this field. Moreover, if the follicle cells really are intercalating with one another in a directional manner in the absence of a planar polarized cue, this observation is likely to be of broad interest to the morphogenesis community. As it stands, however, I have concerns about some of the experiments and their interpretations.</p><p>Statistical analyses need to be reported for the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This will likely require increasing the n for many of the <italic>fat2</italic> measurements as some of them are currently very low (including one stage that is zero).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G and J</xref> report aspect ratios using a range of stages (4-8). The range is problematic. If one group has more stage 8 follicles and the other has more stage 4 follicles, it is possible to obtain a false positive result. These types of comparisons can only be made when all of the follicles are at a single stage.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> purports to show that the polar cells are mis-positioned because they are not adjacent to the stalk. However, the stalk moves away from the polar cells during mid-oogenesis, a phenomenon that can be seen in the oldest follicle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The oocyte appears to be mis-localized to the anterior in this follicle, but I am unconvinced that the polar cells are mis-positioned based on the criteria given. Also, the authors state that this follicle has a single small polar cell cluster that contained both WT and <italic>eya</italic> mutant cells. Are the authors saying that a clone of <italic>eya</italic> cells in one part of the epithelium eliminates the normal polar cells on the other side? I understand why the authors wanted to do the <italic>eya</italic> experiment, but given the confusing results, it might be better to remove these data from the paper.</p><p>The paper makes extensive use of RNAi transgenes without any controls or references showing the specificity and/or effectiveness of these reagents. At the very least, the authors should confirm that the jak/stat pathway RNAis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> reduce the expression of the 10xStatGFP reporter, and the extent to which their sqh RNAi reduces myosin levels via pSqh staining.</p><p>The authors mention a Gal4 driver that only drives expression at the follicle poles. In the text it is called Ft-Gal4, whereas in the figures it is called Fru-Gal4. Which notation is correct? Also the authors should either cite a reference showing that this driver is exclusive to the terminal domains or show it themselves with a UAS-GFP reporter.</p><p>The authors claim that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows a specific effect of a hop RNAi clone on the posterior half of the follicle. While the anterior is less round than the posterior by eAR analysis, it is far from normal, as the anterior typically has a sharp point at this stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The authors should tone down their claims here.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, the authors show that over-expressing Upd in the center of the epithelium disrupts follicle elongation. If over-expressing Upd using the Upd-Gal4 driver is sufficient to hyper-elongate the follicle, this result would provide even stronger support for the authors' model. This is an easy experiment that should be attempted.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> it looks as if there are gaps in the epithelium in the <italic>sqh</italic> clone, a phenotype that was previously documented by Wang and Riechmann (2007). If this is true, it makes it very difficult to interpret the results of this experiment. The authors should confirm that the epithelium is fully intact for all follicles assayed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors analyze the change in shape (elongation) that egg chambers experienced between the early stages (3-7). They also describe changes at the cell and tissue level that happen in that period, and try to understand the causal link between these cellular and tissue changes with the early elongation. It is an original and quite comprehensive study of morphological and molecular changes from stages 3-8, but there are some problems in the study and interpretation that make it difficult for me to believe that the causal link is actually established.</p><p>1) Most of the conclusions about the effects on elongation are based on the fact that stage 5-7 mutant egg chambers show a rounder shape than stage 5-7 wildtype egg chambers. Because of this, it is crucial that stage 5-7 are properly identified, especially in mutants, as a mis-identification of an early egg chamber (e.g., stage 4) for an older one (stage 6-7) would have a huge impact in the interpretation of the phenotypes. How are the stages defined? This point is important not only for the mutant egg chambers, but also for wildtype ones. How are the authors staging so precisely stage 3, stage 4, stage 5, and so on? It is not an easy task, as addressed in this paper Sci Rep. 2016 Jan 6;6:18850. doi: 10.1038/srep18850. Automatic stage identification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber based on DAPI images. Jia D et al.)</p><p>In several experiments, a mutant egg chamber is defined to be one precise stage, but I doubt that these stagings could have been achieved morphologically, as the mutant egg chambers would also present defects in cell numbers, cell shape, cell fate, egg chamber shape, etc..– that would strongly affect the staging. The authors need to clarify how the staging was done, and also need to characterize stages by molecular markers. I would suggest starting with markers of terminal fate, as well as PH3 stainings, as this would show the mitotic state of cells (follicle cells exit mitosis at stage 6); Staufen, which starts being localized to the posterior at stage 7-8, and maybe for other ideas see the paper I referred to above.</p><p>For example: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – this egg chamber is to me obviously younger that the control in A), as it can be seen by the shape of the oocyte anterior membrane (a V shape in C), while a straighter membrane in A)), but they are both defined as stage 7.</p><p>2) There is a clear correlation between polar cells (PCs) positioning and egg chamber early elongation, and this is an original thought, but I do not think the causal relationship has been proven, and I understand this to be a difficult task. Two of the best experiments for the possible causal link are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, and for this reason, it should be included a comprehensive description and quantification of the results: What percentage of clones show this phenotype and how many have been analyzed (this is specially missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>)?</p><p>3) Regarding the myo2 function in elongation: The authors do a nice job in characterizing actomyo behavior in the apical membrane, and relating this to apical surface changes. I especially liked the original approach to filming the poles. However, the link with elongation is again a hard one to establish: since reducing myo2 activity results in such a huge effect on cell numbers, it is very difficult to conclude that it is the lack of myo2 what is responsible for the defects in elongation. I think the authors need to manipulate the myo2 pathway by other means that might have less of an impact in cell number. For example, manipulating the activity of Rho, Rock, myo2 phosphatases, Myo2LC, etc., I would also like to suggest that the activities of these components of the pathway are both reduced (ag., mutants, dominant negatives), as well as increased (over-expression, dominant active forms, etc.), when possible.</p><p>4) Regarding Jak/stat: since the interpretation is that the jak/stat gradient impacts on myo2 and then on elongation, and since the gradient is present in both anterior and posterior poles, the same findings described for posterior pole should be analyzed in anterior poles. It would be ideal to get an idea of the volume and apical surface changes in the anterior pole, as well as on the myo2 behavior there. Also, when studying the effect of the Jak/Stat pathway on the stage 3-7 cellular changes, they need to include analysis not only at stage 7, but stage 3-7. In fact, the described defects at stage 7 do not show much of an effect, and further analysis is required. For example, reducing upd in polar cells or inactivating jak/stat in terminal follicle cells at stage 7 should eliminate the high surface variation in both poles and stage 7 poles should then be similar to stage 7ML. The authors need to check this.</p><p>Also, does the jak/stat pathway impact on the gradient of actomyosin contraction at the poles?

The authors need to eliminate, or at least reduce, upd in the PCs to answer this question. In the TjG4, updRNAi experiment, upd is reduced in all follicle cells, but I am not sure it is reduced on PCs, could this be described, please? And if the PCs are the source of upd, why is the reduction of upd in all other follicle cells giving a phenotype? And related to this, why would overexpression of upd in the follicle cells that are not the source, result in defects in elongation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] In the Abstract the authors write that elongation occurs &quot;without planar cell polarity requirement&quot;.

First, the elongation that we observed is independent of Fat2, which controls the only pcp pathway known the be active in this tissue. Second, apical MyoII is not planar polarized thought it is the motor of elongation. We prefer to maintain this sentence as it is in the Abstract because of the lack of space but we tried to give better explanations in the Discussion: “Moreover, the absence of planar polarization of MyoII in apical, the driving force of early elongation, and the nonrequirement for “basal pcp” strongly argues against a control of this elongation phase via a planar a cell polarity working at a local scale.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Polar cells define the axis of early elongation”, second paragraph: In Pak mutants, the authors often observe a single polar cell cluster (it should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, not 1D) and conclude, that Pak is required for polar cell &quot;positioning&quot;. If it is just involved in positioning, I would expect two follicle cell clusters in each case. For me it looks that Pak is required either for polar cell specification or for polar cell survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. We initially wrote that it “suggests that <italic>Pak</italic> is required for polar cell positioning” because our observation of this phenotype suggests that there are initially two clusters per follicle but that the persistence of stalk cells along follicles (and not only between) that contact the clusters induces somehow their convergence and fusion. However, it is indeed overstated at the level of description that we provide and we therefore modified the sentence accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also had some difficulties to find the link between the JAK-STAT activity gradient and the morphogenetic behavior (intercalation, stretching) described in the second part.</p></disp-quote><p>JAK-STAT induces a gradient of pulsing from the poles. These pulses induce an apical constriction at the poles, as shown by the reverse phenotype of STAT mutant (cell stretching) and in agreement with what happens in many tissues where pulses induce constriction. Then, the full understanding of the link between JAK-STAT and pulses will require to identify the transcriptional targets of STAT in this tissue and analyse their function. We will definitively try this in the future.</p><p>The link between JAK-STAT and intercalations is indeed more difficult to establish. We mentioned these intercalations because they probably explain why the cells are not stretched in the AP axis whereas the follicle elongates. However, there is no indication that they are instrumental for elongation, and they might rather reflect a passive response of the tissue to relax the tensions due to the elongation. Thus, we assume that demonstrating a link between JAK-STAT and intercalation is not essential for our work at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Statistical analyses need to be reported for the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

However, it is still impossible to plot these follicles according to their stages and performed a statistical test for each stage and each category. Rather, we plotted the long axis as a function of the short axis, a method that offers the advantage of no bias due to stage determination (see response to point #1 reviewer #2), and statistically compared the slope of the regression lines, which we defined as “elongation coefficient” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the stalk moves away from the polar cells during mid-oogenesis, a phenomenon that can be seen in the oldest follicle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The oocyte appears to be mis-localized to the anterior in this follicle, but I am unconvinced that the polar cells are mis-positioned based on the criteria given. Also, the authors state that this follicle has a single small polar cell cluster that contained both WT and eya mutant cells. Are the authors saying that a clone of eya cells in one part of the epithelium eliminates the normal polar cells on the other side? I understand why the authors wanted to do the eya experiment, but given the confusing results, it might be better to remove these data from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data on <italic>eya</italic> were much more complicated than expected, based on published description of the phenotype. We therefore also agree to remove these data. Also, we added the effect on elongation of Upd:gal4, Upd:RNAi, which, has a significant effect on early elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Upd:gal4 being only expressed in polar cells (Khammari et al., 2011), this result causally links polar cells and early elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper makes extensive use of RNAi transgenes without any controls or references showing the specificity and/or effectiveness of these reagents.

It is therefore unclear why this line induced the same kind of elongation and pulsing defects than STAT or Upd RNAi but has no effect on STAT-GFP. We therefore removed all the data obtained with Hop RNAi and replaced all with experiments with STAT92E and/or Upd RNAi, with the exception of the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>.

While the anterior is less round than the posterior by eAR analysis, it is far from normal, as the anterior typically has a sharp point at this stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The authors should tone down their claims here.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure corresponded to a flip-out experiment, in which the Hop knocked-down cells are marked by the GFP and are therefore at the anterior, and not the posterior of the follicle.

STAT has a cell-autonomous effect on apical surface, cell height and phospho-MyoII recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and MyoII is specifically required at each pole for elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, the authors show that over-expressing Upd in the center of the epithelium disrupts follicle elongation.

The authors should confirm that the epithelium is fully intact for all follicles assayed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gaps in the epithelium could be an issue. It was actually why, for this experiment, we stained for Dlg and not just F-actin.

This point is now specified in the methods.</p><p>Of notice, we now provide data obtained with <italic>rok</italic> mutant clones, in which the cells are less flatten and gaps are not observed, with the same effect on elongation than with <italic>sqh</italic> clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this study the authors analyze the change in shape (elongation) that egg chambers experienced between the early stages (3-7). They also describe changes at the cell and tissue level that happen in that period, and try to understand the causal link between these cellular and tissue changes with the early elongation. It is an original and quite comprehensive study of morphological and molecular changes from stages 3-8, but there are some problems in the study and interpretation that make it difficult for me to believe that the causal link is actually established.</p><p>1) Most of the conclusions about the effects on elongation are based on the fact that stage 5-7 mutant egg chambers show a rounder shape than stage 5-7 wildtype egg chambers. Because of this, it is crucial that stage 5-7 are properly identified, especially in mutants, as a mis-identification of an early egg chamber (e.g., stage 4) for an older one (stage 6-7) would have a huge impact in the interpretation of the phenotypes. How are the stages defined? This point is important not only for the mutant egg chambers, but also for wildtype ones. How are the authors staging so precisely stage 3, stage 4, stage 5, and so on? It is not an easy task, as addressed in this paper Sci Rep. 2016 Jan 6;6:18850. doi: 10.1038/srep18850. Automatic stage identification of Drosophila egg chamber based on DAPI images. Jia D et al.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed seen this very interesting method and we will try to use it in the future. The first figure of this article actually nicely sums up what was already described in Spradling, 1993 (based on King 1970) in which stage definitions is only based on white light (allowing seeing the presence of vitellus or not) and DAPI staining. We used the same criteria as indicated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In several experiments, a mutant egg chamber is defined to be one precise stage, but I doubt that these stagings could have been achieved morphologically, as the mutant egg chambers would also present defects in cell numbers, cell shape, cell fate, egg chamber shape, etc. – that would strongly affect the staging.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned previously, stage definition was assessed by criteria that are independent of cell number, cell shape or egg chamber shape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to clarify how the staging was done, and also need to characterize stages by molecular markers. I would suggest starting with markers of terminal fate, as well as PH3 stainings, as this would show the mitotic state of cells (follicle cells exit mitosis at stage 6); Staufen, which starts being localized to the posterior at stage 7-8, and maybe for other ideas see the paper I referred to above.</p></disp-quote><p>DAPI staining is sufficient to detect the arrest of cell division. Moreover, it would be impossible to define a combinatory of markers that allows the unambiguous determination of all the stages. Finally, as mentioned before, the original definition of the stages has been done without any markers excepted DAPI.</p><p>However, we understand your concern and we therefore conducted two simple tests:</p><p>1) We compared all the mutant genotypes at a stage n to stage n-1 wild-type follicles. Doing so, there is still a significant difference for most of tested genotypes, including actors of the JAK-STAT pathway and MyosinII. In other words, even though we had systematically underestimated the stage of mutant follicles and not the wild-type ones, which I am sure it is not the case, the main conclusions would not be affected.</p><p>2) More significantly, we plot the long axis as a function of the short axis for previtellogenic stages and make the regression line as shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We determined the slope of the lines which corresponds to what we defined as an “elongation coefficient”. Importantly, this method is independent of stage determination. We validated this method using <italic>fat2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Statistical comparison of the elongation coefficients confirmed our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – this egg chamber is to me obviously younger that the control in A), as it can be seen by the shape of the oocyte anterior membrane (a V shape in C), while a straighter membrane in A)), but they are both defined as stage 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We would have the same visual impression based on V shape versus straight membrane.

Two of the best experiments for the possible causal link are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, and for this reason, it should be included a comprehensive description and quantification of the results: What percentage of clones show this phenotype and how many have been analyzed (this is specially missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>)?</p></disp-quote><p>As proposed by reviewer #1, to avoid any confusion due to these results, <italic>eya</italic> data were removed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> was performed with Hop RNAi and was also therefore removed. We tried to reproduce such phenotype with STAT RNAi but for some reasons probably linked to the role of JAK-STAT during follicle budding, we could not defined proper conditions. However, thanks to a later suggestion, we now provided data that clearly link polar cells and elongation. Upd is only expressed in polar cells and Upd:Gal4 reproduces this pattern (Khammari et al., 2011). Knocking-down Upd with this driver affects early elongation and thus polar cells are required for early elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the myo2 function in elongation: The authors do a nice job in characterizing actomyo behavior in the apical membrane, and relating this to apical surface changes. I especially liked the original approach to filming the poles. However, the link with elongation is again a hard one to establish: since reducing myo2 activity results in such a huge effect on cell numbers, it is very difficult to conclude that it is the lack of myo2 what is responsible for the defects in elongation. I think the authors need to manipulate the myo2 pathway by other means that might have less of an impact in cell number. For example, manipulating the activity of Rho, Rock, myo2 phosphatases, Myo2LC, etc., I would also like to suggest that the activities of these components of the pathway are both reduced (ag., mutants, dominant negatives), as well as increased (over-expression, dominant active forms, etc.), when possible.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of the primary effect of MyoII on elongation is indeed really important. First of all, one could emphasize that we already affected MyoII by two different means:</p><p>- A drastic one with a null mutant, but in clones, which allows us to show a specific role of MyoII at the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is coherent with the proposed role of the pulses in these regions.</p><p>- A more subtitle one, with a RNAi in the whole epithelium, which only moderately affects cell shape but still shows an elongation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, as suggested, we also looked at the involvement of the Rho kinase using null mutant clones. These mutant clones recapitulate the effect on elongation observed with <italic>sqh</italic>, though the flattening of the mutant cells was weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, I</xref>). Thus, this result confirms both the involvement of the Rho pathway and the primary effect of this pathway on early elongation.</p><p>The MyoII gain of function was a very interesting suggestion. We tried by overexpression of the phosphomimetic form Sqh<sup>EE</sup> (and Sqh<sup>DD</sup>) in all the follicle cells, with tj:gal4, or at the poles, with Fru:gal4. In both cases we observed no effect on tissue elongation. These results are actually consistent with the fact the Sqh phosphorylation is homogenous along AP axis whereas pulses are not. Thus, the spatiotemporal control of the pulses by JAKSTAT is not at the level of Myosin II activation and it is therefore logical that Sqh phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient to modulate tissue elongation. Alternatively, the absence of effect could be due to the fact that these mutant forms of Sqh are not active as proper phosphorylated protein as it has been very recently shown (Vasquez et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016). Thus, such experiments appear inconclusive and we did not add them in the new version of the article, but it could be done upon request.</p><p>An alternative approach for a gain of function of MyoII would have been to use a mutant for the myosin phosphatase. However, it has been recently shown that such mutant follicle cells prematurely undergo basal polarized oscillations (Valencia-Expósito, Nat Com, 2016), which normally start at stage 9 and are likely the driving force for the second elongation phase (He et al., Nat Cell Biol 2010). Consistently, we observed that this mutation leads to a dramatic increase of pSqh staining at the basal domain but not at the apical one during early stages (see the two examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The effect on elongation of such mutant might be therefore confusing and was not analysed.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32943.032</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32943-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding Jak/stat: since the interpretation is that the jak/stat gradient impacts on myo2 and then on elongation, and since the gradient is present in both anterior and posterior poles, the same findings described for posterior pole should be analyzed in anterior poles. It would be ideal to get an idea of the volume and apical surface changes in the anterior pole, as well as on the myo2 behavior there.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be ideal but it turn out that the trick that we used to film the poles cannot be applied to the anterior pole for technical reasons. Each ovariole is initially in a muscle sheath that has to be removed for imaging. To do so, we pull on the anterior tip of an ovariole whereas we maintain the rest of the ovary. Either it leads to the complete removal of the ovariole from the muscle sheath, or it leads to a break of an interfollicular filament and we release only part of an ovariole, with the posterior pole of the last follicle that can be easily observed when it is placed between beads. However, such approach does not allow to obtain “free” anterior poles. The solution would be a mechanical dissection between follicles but it could be then almost impossible to confidently assess whether the poles would be damaged or not.</p><p>Therefore, the only new data that we can provide about the anterior pole is the height of the cells. It is also increased, compared to younger stages and to lateral cells, as observed at the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Since an increase in cell height is classically associated with cell constriction and since both JAK-STAT and MyoII affect cell height in the follicular cells, we assume that similar events are taking place at each poles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, when studying the effect of the Jak/Stat pathway on the stage 3-7 cellular changes, they need to include analysis not only at stage 7, but stage 3-7. In fact, the described defects at stage 7 do not show much of an effect, and further analysis is required. For example, reducing upd in polar cells or inactivating jak/stat in terminal follicle cells at stage 7 should eliminate the high surface variation in both poles and stage 7 poles should then be similar to stage 7ML. The authors need to check this.</p><p>Also, does the jak/stat pathway impact on the gradient of actomyosin contraction at the poles? If possible this needs to be checked, as the surface variation gradient, which may be affected by jak/stat gradient, is not necessarily a complete reflection of actomyo contraction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is an important point. We now provide data showing that Upd RNAi:</p><p>- reduces pulse intensity at the poles at stage 7-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>)</p><p>- increases cell surface at the poles at stage 7-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, no experiment shows that the production of upd by the PCs is required, as there is no experiment showing than when this secretion is affected, elongation is aberrant.

We now provided experiments with Upd:gal4 and we obtained similar phenotype.From our point of view, once we have shown that Upd is required for early elongation, the fact that its ectopic expression blocks elongation is actually the best argument that it needs to be expressed in a specific pattern and thus delivering a spatial cue for elongation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
