The NPC barrier in <italic>Xenopus</italic> relies primarily on the intrinsically disordered FG domain of Nup98. We now observed that Nup98 FG domains of mammals, lancelets, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates spontaneously and rapidly phase-separate from dilute (submicromolar) aqueous solutions into characteristic ‘FG particles’. This required neither sophisticated experimental conditions nor auxiliary eukaryotic factors. Instead, it occurred already during FG domain expression in bacteria. All Nup98 FG phases rejected inert macromolecules and yet allowed far larger NTR cargo complexes to rapidly enter. They even recapitulated the observations that large cargo-domains counteract NPC passage of NTR⋅cargo complexes, while cargo shielding and increased NTR⋅cargo surface-ratios override this inhibition. Their exquisite NPC-typical sorting selectivity and strong intrinsic assembly propensity suggest that Nup98 FG phases can form in authentic NPCs and indeed account for the permeability properties of the pore.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04251.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04251.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells of eukaryotic species—which include plants, animals, and fungi—have a nucleus that harbours the organism's genome. Two membrane layers surround the nucleus and separate its contents from the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. This separation is essential for a correct interpretation of the genetic information. Yet, various molecules, such as proteins, need to move into or out of the nucleus for the cell to work properly. This transit has to occur without an uncontrolled mixing of the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm happening.</p><p>Structures called nuclear pore complexes span the double membrane and allow material to be exchanged between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Small molecules can freely pass through these complexes, while larger molecules can only be transported when bound as “cargo” to so-called nuclear transport receptors. Nuclear pore complexes are large assemblies of proteins called nucleoporins. FG nucleoporins are special in that they contain regions with a repeating pattern of two amino acids, phenylalanine (‘F’) and glycine (‘G’). These regions are called FG domains. They bind to nuclear transport receptors and have been suspected to form a barrier that decides which molecules may pass through the nuclear pore complex. Exactly how this control is exerted has been a matter of debate.</p><p>Versions of a particular FG nucleoporin called Nup98 are found in all branches of eukaryotic life, i.e. in animals, fungi, plants, amoebas, and even in the evolutionarily most distant protozoans. When Schmidt and Görlich dispersed small amounts of Nup98 FG domains in an aqueous solution, the domains rapidly attracted each other to form ‘FG particles’, regardless of which species the proteins came from. These FG particles were so dense that they repelled ‘normal’ macromolecules, yet they allowed nuclear transport receptors, along with their bound cargoes, to rapidly enter. Taken together, the work of Schmidt and Görlich suggests that such FG particles form the transport barrier in nuclear pore complexes.</p><p>Based on these findings, Schmidt and Görlich refine a model where the FG domains form a mesh in the nuclear pore complexes that acts like a ‘smart sieve’. Smaller molecules can move through gaps in the meshwork, but larger molecules are hindered. Schmidt and Görlich suggest that nuclear transport receptors help large molecules to move through nuclear pore complexes by ‘melting’ the FG meshwork locally, creating a path for the molecule to move through. The reconstitution of these smart barriers in the laboratory will now allow researchers to analyse the process of receptor-mediated nuclear pore passage in unprecedented (mechanistic) detail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04251.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04251.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Tetrahymena</italic></kwd><kwd>importin</kwd><kwd>nucleoporin</kwd><kwd>nucleocytoplasmic transport</kwd><kwd>Nup100</kwd><kwd>Nup116</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Hermann Broder</given-names></name><name><surname>Görlich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>How nuclear pore complexes establish their permeability barrier has been a long-standing question; now, this process can be reconstituted by a surprisingly simple and rapid self-assembly of Nup98 FG domains into selective FG phases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell nuclei lack protein synthesis and therefore import required proteins from the cytoplasm. Nuclei, on the other hand, supply the cytoplasm with ribosomes, mRNAs, tRNAs, and other ‘nuclear products’. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) conduct this nucleocytoplasmic transport (Reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brohawn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hetzer and Wente, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothballer and Kutay, 2013</xref>). They are embedded into the nuclear envelope (NE) and equipped with a remarkable permeability barrier that suppresses an intermixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. This barrier is freely permeable for small molecules but becomes increasingly restrictive as the size of the diffusing species approaches a limit of ≈30 kDa in mass or ≈5 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>). Larger objects are essentially excluded from passage but may traverse the pore when bound to an appropriate nuclear transport receptor (NTR).</p><p>NTRs are in continuous circulation between nucleus and cytoplasm (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Görlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2007</xref>). They select cargo molecules on one side of the NE, traverse the NPC barrier in a facilitated manner, release cargo into the destination compartment, and return to the initial compartment for the next round of transport. There are several NTR categories. Importins and exportins use coupling to the RanGTPase system for active transport against concentration gradients. With molecular masses between 90 and 140 kDa, they are relatively large in size. NTF2, the import receptor for RanGDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribbeck et al., 1998</xref>), is smaller (≈30 kDa for the homodimer). It is structurally unrelated to importins/exportins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullock et al., 1996</xref>) but homologous to the Mex67p/Mtr2p heterodimer, which functions in RNA export (See e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strasser et al., 2000</xref>). Hikeshi represents yet another category. It mediates nuclear import of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kose et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The NPC barrier has a remarkably high capacity, supporting up to 1000 facilitated translocation events or a mass flow of 100 MDa per pore per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>). Facilitated NPC passage can be completed within a few milliseconds, at least when smaller cargoes are transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kubitscheck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tu and Musser, 2011</xref>). Facilitated translocation per se does not consume metabolic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwoebel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Englmeier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ribbeck et al., 1999</xref>). Instead, it is based on a higher permeability of NPCs for NTRs as compared to inert molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>). NPCs become active and highly efficient cargo pumps, when cargo-release from NTRs is enforced at destination, which is typically achieved by the RanGTPase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Görlich et al., 2003</xref>). The NPC barrier is, however, not just an obstacle to overcome. It is also essential for any active directional transport because it prevents a dissipation of the transport-driving RanGTP-gradient and retains already transported cargoes at destination.</p><p>Facilitated translocation is evident for objects of a wide range of sizes. NTF2 (diameter: ≈5 nm) exemplifies a small translocation species. It traverses NPCs 100 times faster than the equally sized GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>). 60S ribosomal subunits (diameter: ≈25 nm) are on the other end of the allowed size spectrum. Such large cargoes require multiple NTR molecules for efficient NPC passage. At least three shuttling NTRs (Xpo1/CRM1, Xpo5, and Gle2/ Rae1) contribute to nuclear export of human 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wild et al., 2010</xref>), while Xpo1/CRM1, the Mex67 Mtr2 dimer, Arx1, and Gle2 synergise in exporting <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Occhipinti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This NTR-cooperation effect is also evident for smaller cargoes. Nuclear import of an IBB-2xMBP-M3 fusion (88 kDa), for example, occurs ≈10 times faster if it is simultaneously bound by two importin molecules rather than just a single one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>). Likewise, single molecule tracking revealed that multiple importin molecules are required for transporting a ≈500 kDa M9-β-Gal tetramer through NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>FG nucleoporins (Nups) are critical for NPC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>). They comprise FG domains with often hundreds of residues and up to 50 FG (phenylalanine–glycine) dipeptide motifs. Vertebrate NPCs accommodate ≈11 different FG Nups, which together should contribute ≈13 MDa of FG domain mass and &gt;5000 FG motifs per pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Powers et al., 1997</xref>) is an FG Nup of special interest for this study. In its canonical form, it is initially produced as a fusion protein with the NPC scaffold component Nup96. An auto-proteolytic domain in Nup98 subsequently cleaves the fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosenblum and Blobel, 1999</xref>) and thereafter anchors Nup98 to the NPC scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffis et al., 2003</xref>). Mammalian Nup98 comprises an FG domain of about 500 residues, including a binding site for the mRNA export mediator Gle2/ Rae1 (GLEBS domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pritchard et al., 1999</xref>). Nup98 has been estimated to occur in ≈48 copies per NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori et al., 2013</xref>). The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> possesses three Nup98 paralogs, Nup145, Nup100, and Nup116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wente et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wente and Blobel, 1994</xref>), whereby only Nup145 is produced as a fusion protein and only Nup116 contains a GLEBS domain. The FG domains of Nup100 (570 residues) and Nup116 (740 residues) are considerably longer than that of Nup145N (200 residues).</p><p>FG domains are intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dosztanyi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denning and Rexach, 2007</xref>) and have therefore been appearing ‘featureless’ on high-resolution cryo-electron tomography averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, they engage in critical interactions. First, FG motifs are binding sites for NTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iovine et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rexach and Blobel, 1995</xref>) and this interaction is a prerequisite for any facilitated translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayliss et al., 1999</xref>). Second, certain FG domains also bind constituents of the NPC scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schrader et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Powers, 2013</xref>). ‘Cohesive’ interactions between FG repeats themselves represent a third category. They are multivalent and primarily driven by the hydrophobicity of the FG motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frey and Görlich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ader et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Powers, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that FG domains actually constitute the NPC permeability barrier. First, certain genetic deletions of FG domains relax the barrier of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the collapse of the permeability barrier during poliovirus infection coincides with a cleavage of FG domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Third, replacing Nup98 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> nuclei by a variant lacking the FG domain renders NPCs non-selectively permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). Additional striking evidence came from the observation that jellified FG domains show permeability properties very similar to those of authentic NPCs (See e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>, and below).</p><p>The perhaps greatest challenge in the field is to explain why interactions between an NTR and the stationary FG domains do no delay but instead greatly accelerate NPC passage in comparison to inert (i.e., non-FG-binding) reference molecules. Several solutions to this paradox have been proposed. The ‘virtual gate’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rout et al., 2003</xref>) regards FG domains as entropic brushes that repel inert material while NTRs overcome this entropic barrier by binding to them.</p><p>The selective phase model assumes that cohesive interactions between FG repeats cross-link them into a sieve-like FG hydrogel, whose mesh size sets an upper size limit for passive NPC passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>). It further assumes that repeat–repeat contacts disengage locally and transiently when a transport receptor binds the corresponding FG motifs. This should allow the receptor to ‘melt’ with its cargo through the gel. Several lines of evidence support this model: first, replacing the highly cohesive FG domain of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nup98 by non-cohesive (or by partially cohesive) ones resulted in non-selectively permeable NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). This held true even if the replacing non-cohesive FG domain was fully proficient in NTR-binding. Second, numerous FG domains can indeed form hydrogels that behave like the NPC's permeability barrier, i.e. they exclude inert macromolecules but allow rapid influx of NTRs and NTR⋅cargo complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milles and Lemke, 2011</xref>). A systematic analysis of <italic>Xenopus</italic> FG domains revealed that the Nup98 FG domain, which appears to be the most critical one for NPC function, also yielded the most selective FG hydrogel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A critical gap in the argument relates, however, to the facts that (i) gels with a true NPC-like permselectivity were obtained only if the FG domain concentration exceeded a certain ‘saturation limit’, typically around 200 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>) and (ii) that it was so far unclear if and how the relevant FG domains could possibly become sufficiently concentrated to form highly selective gels.</p><p>We now observed that Nup98 FG domains from animals, fungi, plants, amoebas, ciliates, and excavates (chosen to represent all major eukaryotic clades) indeed phase-separate spontaneously from aqueous solutions into FG hydrogels. Phase-separation was a matter of no more than seconds and occurred at critical concentrations ranging from 20 to 700 nM or 1 to 50 µg/ml FG domains, which corresponds to 1–35 µM FG motifs. These critical concentrations are exceeded by at least 2–3 orders of magnitude when the NPC scaffold initially recruits Nup98 molecules during NPC assembly. Notably, NTRs did not prevent the phase-separation of FG domains, even when present in larger excess than NPCs could possibly accommodate. The self-assembly process yielded micrometer-sized near-spherical FG particles with a preferred protein concentration of ≈250 mg/ml. Strikingly, these particles behaved like the predicted selective phase: they excluded inert macromolecules (such as the ≈25 kDa-sized mCherry) but at the same time allowed efficient NTR entry at rates that appeared mostly limited by mass transport within the surrounding buffer. NTRs diffused through these particles with a rate constant in the order of 0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e. fast enough to traverse a 40-nm thick NPC barrier made of the same material within ≈10 milliseconds. With remarkable clarity, the FG particles also recapitulated the effect that a larger cargo must recruit several NTR molecules in order to efficiently pass an NPC. The simplest explanation for these parallels is that the actual NPC barrier is formed by such phase-separated FG hydrogel material. Our data further suggest that a mere binding of a translocating species to FG domains is insufficient for facilitated passage. Instead, it is consistent with the notion that facilitated translocation involves an NTR-mediated melting of obstructing meshes and that this ‘melting’ is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the NTRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>One possible explanation for the observed permselectivity of NPCs is given by the hypothesis that the barrier-critical FG domains assemble into a sieve-like meshwork, whose contact points can be temporarily and locally resolved by translocating NTRs. Indeed, it was previously shown that several FG domains can jellify into hydrogel meshworks with such a ‘smart sieve behaviour’, i.e. they reject inert macromolecules above a certain size limit but let the same cargoes pass when bound to an appropriate NTR. However, only gels with a concentration of no less than 200 mg/ml FG domain (corresponding to 3–4 mM FG domain or 100–175 mM FG motifs) showed such selectivity. Compared to the ≈200 nM Nup98 present in a (pre-assembly) metaphase <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>), this would require a ≈20,000-fold increase in concentration. Hence, we wondered if and how such high local concentration could possibly be reached.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expected minimal FG domain concentrations in authentic NPCs</title><p>Clearly, the recruitment of FG Nups to the NPC scaffold already represents a first concentration step. A lower limit for the resulting FG concentration can thus be estimated based on three assumptions: (i) only Nup98-type FG domains participate in the barrier, (ii) these domains occur in 48 copies per NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori et al., 2013</xref>), and (iii) not only dwell inside the central channel (length: 80 nm; width: 40 nm) but reach 70 nm into the nuclear and cytoplasmic space. The latter value represents the farthest distance from the NPC plane at which epitopes of an FG Nup (Nup358) had previously been detected by immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walther et al., 2002</xref>). These numbers give an accessible volume of 1.5 × 10<sup>−18</sup> litres and concentrations of 50 µM (2.5 mg/ml) for the FG domain and 2 mM for the FG motifs. When considering non-Nup98 FG domains as well, the lower bound increases to 6 mM FG motifs.</p><p>However, this is still far lower than the above-mentioned threshold for hydrogel selectivity. An effective hydrogel-based barrier should therefore assemble within NPCs only if some mechanism increases the local FG domain concentration further by a factor of 10–100.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FG particle assembly by phase-separation from dilute aqueous solutions</title><p>In the simplest case, local concentrations can increase because the barrier-forming FG domains have an intrinsic propensity to self-concentrate and hence to phase-separate from aqueous solutions. However, even then the question still remains if the resulting protein-rich phase has an appropriate FG repeat concentration and structure to function as a barrier with NPC-like permselectivity. Given that these issues are central for our understanding of NPC function, we decided to address them systematically.</p><p>As an initial example, we chose the FG domain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Nup100, because it is a well-studied Nup98 homolog that can restore a functional barrier in FG Nup-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>), but it has not yet been tested if this domain is also sufficient for assembling a selective hydrogel in vitro. In the first series of experiments, we prepared a 1000 µM Nup100 FG domain stock solution, supplemented by 2 M guanidinium hydrochloride in order to initially keep the domain molecules in a non-interacting state. The solution was then rapidly diluted in 100 volumes of a neutral Tris/NaCl buffer, which lowered the protein concentration to 10 µM and the guanidinium ion concentration to negligible levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, the Nup100 FG domain solution turned instantaneously turbid, pointing to a very rapid phase-separation and formation of small particles or liquid droplets, which can be easily recovered by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We tried to record a time course of this reaction (by static light scattering) but had to realise that the reaction had already reached its endpoint before we could place samples into the instrument and start the measurement (after 10–30 s).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dilute Nup100 FG domain solutions spontaneously undergo phase-separation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the experimental design.

Correlating extra-particle Alexa488 signals (originating from MBP) with the known supplied MBP concentrations and matching them with the intra-particle Alexa488 signals (originating from 1/715th of the FG-domain molecules) suggests that an average particle contains ≈4.5 mM (≈275 mg/ml) FG-domain. This corresponds to ≈200 mM FG motifs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04251.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04251.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04251-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>When applying dynamic light scattering (DLS) to the 10 µM Nup100 FG domain sample, we observed a very prominent particle population with diameters ranging mostly between 2 and 8 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At a lower concentration (0.625 µM), we observed a broader main peak with 0.4–4 µm particles (accounting for ≈60% by mass), another peak with 25 nm assembly intermediates (10%) and residual monomers (30%). The remaining monomer concentration can be taken as an estimate for the critical concentration for this phase-separation, which hence should be in the range of ≈200 nM FG domain or ≈10 µM FG repeat units. Yet, already the anchorage of FG domains to the NPC scaffold should result in a ≥200 times higher local concentration (2 mM repeat units; see above). This ≥200-fold oversaturation should thus drive FG phase-separation to completion also in real NPCs. The rapid onset of the in vitro FG particle formation further supports this view, as it indicates that self-association of Nup100 FG domains is not impeded by a kinetic hurdle.</p><p>As a control, we analysed the regular and highly charged part of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Nsp1p FG domain (residues 274–601) and observed that it failed to form particles at 10 µM domain concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

For that we recorded the local fluorescent intensity of the added Alexa488 FG domain tracer, determined absolute fluorophore concentrations by calibration with a series of internal Alexa488-MBP standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), and used this number to derive an average intra-particle concentration of the Nup100 FG domain of 275 mg/ml (corresponding to 4.7 mM FG domain or 200 mM FG motifs). Further assuming a specific partial volume for the protein part of 0.73 ml/g, one can estimate that the polypeptide accounts for 20% and water (respectively buffer) for the remaining 80% of the particle volume. These numbers are well in line with the assumption that these particles indeed represent hydrogels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ScNup100 FG particles are highly selective FG phases</title><p>We subsequently used CLSM to assess how fluorescent permeation probes would partition into the self-assembled Nup100 FG particles.

This applied to NTF2, Importin β complexed with an Atto488-labelled IBB-domain or an IBB-GFP fusion, or even a 520 kDa octameric complex comprising four copies of Importin β and the IBB-ZsGreen homotetramer. The particles were imaged after just ≈3 min of NTR influx. Nevertheless, particle:buffer partition coefficients of ≈200 were observed, and the NTRs showed already a rather even distribution between the centres and peripheries of the 5–10 µm-sized particles. A comparison with computer simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the influx was so rapid that diffusion within the surrounding buffer, but not the actual particle-entry, must have become rate-limiting. The intra-particle NTR distributions are consistent with intra-particle diffusion coefficients of ≥0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, implying that it would take these transported species no more than 10 milliseconds to traverse a 40-nm thick NPC barrier made of the same material.

In order to nevertheless estimate kinetic parameters for particle-entry, we simulated the process and asked which parameter set would be consistent with the observed cargo distribution at the 3 min time point. These parameters included the partition coefficient (220) and 7 µm particle diameter (both measured directly), the diffusion coefficient in buffer (D<sub>buffer</sub> = 50 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, derived by the Stokes–Einstein equation from the radius of the Impβ•IBB-GFP complex and the viscosity of the buffer), as well as the intra-particle diffusion coefficient (D<sub>Particle</sub> = 0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s), which was the smallest that allowed an even intra-particle distribution of the cargo at the 3 min timepoint. ‘Capture efficiency’ describes the probability that a colliding NTR⋅cargo complex gets captured by the particle.

After bleaching the Atto390 fluorophore of labelled FG domains, we observed that bleached patterns within the Nup100 FG particles remained stable for some minutes at least. This indicates a solid state of the particles and stable interactions between FG domains. The simultaneously bleached NTR-signal was, however, far more dynamic. The particles' peripheries showed a clear signal recovery already within two seconds, indicating a very rapid exchange with the surrounding medium. This implies that this NTR-species can rapidly exit the particle—despite its very high partition coefficient. The fluorescent signal in the centre of a particle with a radius of ≈4 µm recovered with a half time of ≈40 s.

However, in order to suppress intermolecular contacts prior to this dilution step, we had to keep the concentrated protein solution in ≥2 M guanidinium hydrochloride.

To test if these sequence differences also translate into different contents of amyloid-like cross-β sheets, we stained the particles with ThioflavinT—a compound whose 480 nm fluorescence emission is enhanced upon binding to NQ-rich and other amyloid-like cross-β structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vassar and Culling, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khurana et al., 2005</xref>). Particles derived from the most NQ-rich FG domains, Nup100 (28%) and Nup116 (26%) showed indeed by far the strongest ThioflavinT signal, supporting that cross-β structures can occur not only in amyloid fibres, but also in self-assembled FG particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The NQ content alone is, however, not necessarily a reliable predictor for the presence of cross-β sheets.

The <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MacNup98A FG particles were essentially ThioflavinT-negative, perhaps because their high glycine content counteracts β-sheet formation and/or stability. FG particles from the other species also showed at most a weak ThioflavinT signature.

This held true for Nup98 FG domains from nine evolutionary very distant species—a clear indication for a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the underlying physicochemical properties. As an additional indication, we noticed extreme sequence conservation amongst vertebrates, covering ≈400 million years of evolution. The Nup98 FG domains from human and the fish <italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic>, for example, share ≈70% identical residues, which is close to the ≈75% identities between the corresponding globular autoproteolytic Nucleoporin 2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, most of the observed exchanges were just conservative permutations between T, S, A, and N within the spacers, while spacer lengths and the type of FG motif at a given position remained extremely conserved. The Nup98 FG domain is thus an exception from the rule that intrinsically disordered domains change rapidly during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denning and Rexach, 2007</xref>). In fact, this indicates that the Nup98 FG domain engages in critical interactions along its entire sequence and that deviations from this optimal sequence are not well tolerated.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.012</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>High sequence conservation of the Nup98 FG domain amongst vertebrates.</title><p>Nup98 from human (GI: 530395413), the frog <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (GI: 523580018) and the fish <italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic> (GI: 573879996) were aligned.

To achieve the best possible sampling, we performed exhaustive database searches and identified 666 sequences that matched several stringent criteria for representing Nup98 FG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Analysis of the sequences indeed revealed several features that appear conserved across all eukaryotic clades, namely: a rather constant number of FG dipeptide motifs per domain (median 43 ± 6), a similar FG motif density (one FG motif per 12.5 ± 0.7 residues) and domain-length (median 549 ± 87 residues per FG domain), as well as a very strong bias for G, T, S, A, N, Q, and P in the inter-FG spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.014</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Compilation and analysis of a Nup98 ortholog-derived FG domain database.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Nucleoporin2 domains of human Nup98/96 (GI: 56549643), <italic>Arabidopis thaliana</italic> Nup98A (GI: 22329468), and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> MicNup98B (GI: 289623519) were used as BLAST templates to identify further Nup98 homologues in the non-redundant NCBI protein database.

They have far fewer charged residues (median 2.5 ± 0.4%) than either average IDP regions (28 ± 7%) or globular proteins (24 ± 3%). They are clearly more hydrophobic than typical IDP regions and, in fact, comparably hydrophobic as globular proteins. Thus, the Nup98 FG domains should have a similar potential to bury hydrophobic side chains from water as globular proteins. In contrast to the latter however, this does not result in a globular fold, but in strong inter-FG repeat cohesion. Taken together, the strong selection against charges and maintenance of hydrophobicity is well in line with our observation that Nup98 FG domains experience water as a “poor solvent” and consequently phase-separate from even rather dilute solutions. The evolutionary conservation of the underlying sequence features suggests again a fundamental functional relevance.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.015</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Nup98 FG domains to intrinsically disordered and globular proteins in terms of charged residue contents and hydrophobicity.</title><p>Analysis was similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uversky et al.

For each protein sequence, the mean fraction of charged residues was determined by counting D, E, K, and R and dividing this sum by the sequence length.

It is therefore possible that their spontaneous opening is just too slow or energetically too costly to allow an efficient entry.</p><p>If this were true, then one would expect that an NTR⋅cargo complex with a smaller cargo should not experience this problem. To test this, we replaced the ≈28 kDa GFP moiety by a single Atto488 molecule. This shrunk the cargo to the ≈6 kDa IBB domain, which gets entirely enwrapped by the Importin β molecule leaving no cargo surface exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Görlich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cingolani et al., 1999</xref>). As expected, the Importin β⋅IBB-Atto488 complex did not remain stuck at the particles' surface but accumulated in their interiors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>). In parallel controls with the same batch of particles, we observed that the Importin β⋅IBB-MBP-GFP complex (≈170 kDa) with a further enlarged cargo domain got again firmly arrested at the surface. Much to our surprise, however, we observed that a far larger ≈530 kDa complex, namely a complex comprising four Importin β molecules and an IBB-ZsGreen tetramer, crossed the buffer-particle boundary efficiently and accumulated strongly inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">13—figure supplement 1</xref>). How can this be explained? ZsGreen/zFP506 is a tetrameric homolog of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pletneva et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the Importin β⋅IBB-GFP and Importin β⋅IBB⋅ZsGreen complexes have the same NTR:cargo mass ratios, but the tetramerisation buries much of the otherwise exposed cargo surface that counteracts entry into the FG phase. The tetramerisation should thus allow the Importin to dominate the surface properties of the entire complex, and hence to melt together with the cargo through the meshes of the gel.</p><p>At this point, one could still argue that ZsGreen and GFP are different proteins and that differences other than the fraction of exposed cargo surface account for the difference in Importin-mediated particle-entry. In a next step, we therefore used one and the same cargo (an IBB-MBP-GFP-M9 fusion), and just varied the number of bound NTRs. This cargo includes two orthogonal nuclear import signals, the IBB-domain recruiting Importin β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Görlich et al., 1996</xref>) and the M9-domain conferring nuclear import by Transportin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pollard et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref> shows that neither Importin β nor Transportin alone were sufficient to ferry the cargo across the buffer-particle boundary. Yet, when present together on the same cargo molecule, the two importins synergised and mediated efficient influx and strong accumulation of the cargo in the interior of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>).</p><p>Given that the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MacNup98A FG particles are particularly tight towards inert macromolecules, it is possible that they exaggerate the inhibitory effect of an exposed cargo domain on barrier-passage. This effect is, however, also evident (with somewhat shifted size limits) for particles from other Nup98 FG domains. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Nup116 FG particles, for example, brightly accumulate NTF2 and the Importin β⋅IBB-Atto488 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). The accumulation was already weaker for the Importin β⋅IBB-GFP complex, while an Importin β⋅IBB-MBP-GFP complex got stuck at the particles' surface. The larger Importin β⋅IBB-ZsGreen complex (with its minimized exposed cargo surface) could again overcome the boundary and accumulated inside. Likewise, the IBB-MBP-GFP-M9 fusion accumulated inside the particles only when Importin β and Transportin were simultaneously bound to this cargo molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.019</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Effect of cargo domains and NTR stoichiometry on entry into ScNup116 FG particles.</title><p>FG particles (with 5% Atto390-labeled tracer) were formed with 10 µM <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Nup116 FG domain.

In fact, the phenomenon of NTR-cooperation was originally observed with a very similar cargo, namely with an IBB-2xMBP-M9 fusion. This cargo bound well to NPCs in the presence of importin β alone, but rapidly traversed NPC only when both, Importin β as well as Transportin, had been recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tu et al., (2013)</xref> recently showed that a single Transportin molecule could confer efficient NPC targeting of a large M9-β-Gal fusion complex, but successful NPC barrier-passage required several Transportin molecules. These remarkable parallels indeed strongly suggest that the permselectivities of in vitro assembled Nup98 FG phases and authentic NPCs are governed by the same mechanistic principles and by functionally equivalent structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Perspectives</title><p>We found that Nup98 FG domains assemble from (even dilute) aqueous solutions into very protein-rich phases that reject inert molecules ≥25 kDa in size, but at the same time allow influx of far larger NTR-complexes. They even reproduce the multi-NTR requirement for larger cargoes and recapitulate the kinetics of NPC passage. The most straightforward interpretation of these data is that such phases also assemble inside authentic NPCs and account for the permselectivity of nuclear pores, as previously predicted by the selective phase model.</p><p>Yet, the concept of cohesive FG repeat interactions as the basis of NPC transport selectivity has been facing a remarkable resistance from the nuclear transport field over the past 13 years. In light of the available data however, it needs to be emphasised that all suggested alternatives to the cohesion concept appear far more complicated and tied to two rather unlikely assumptions. First, some still elusive process would have to suppress phase-separation and counteract cohesive inter-FG repeat interactions in authentic NPCs. Second, an alternative selectivity mechanism would then have to generate the same permselectivity as observed for self-assembled Nup98 FG phases.</p><p>The assembly of selective Nup98 FG phases within NPCs should a priori be a thermodynamically highly favoured process because the local FG motif concentration exceeds the critical concentration at least 100-fold and the system should thus be highly over-saturated with respect to an FG phase-separation. Any block of such an assembly would therefore require a masking of the sticky parts, i.e. of thousands of cohesive FG repeat units per NPC. If effective ‘cohesion suppressors’ existed, then they would have to be exceedingly abundant NPC ligands, which only leaves NTRs as possible candidates.</p><p>We tested this and observed that NTRs do not block Nup98 FG phase-separation even if present in 10-fold molar excess over FG domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). This is not surprising because (i) NTR⋅FG domain interactions are governed by an extreme multivalency (with ≈40 NTR-binding sites on the FG domain and ≈10 FG-binding sites on importin β; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</xref>), and (ii) such multivalency is prone to drive phase-separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2012</xref>)—at least for molar ratios that can be accommodated in the context of NPCs. The tested 10-fold molar excess is probably already far greater than what nuclear pores could possibly hold, because an NPC with 100 anchored FG domains would then be liganded with 1000 NTR molecules (which would at least double the observed mass of an NPC). We consider it, however, possible that NTRs can suppress ectopic FG phase-separation outside NPCs, because there, NTRs are present in an ≈100-fold molar excess over Nup98 FG domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Schlenstedt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.020</object-id><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Formation of FG particles in the presence of NTRs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NTRs do not suppress FG particle formation at molar ratios expected within NPCs.

As we discuss in the following, they lack, however, direct experimental evidence or even collide with experimental observations.</p><p>The ‘virtual gate’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rout et al., 2003</xref>), for example, regards FG domains as entropic brushes that repel inert material while NTRs overcome this entropic barrier by binding to them. This model implies that non-cohesive FG domains are sufficient to create a barrier. This is incompatible with the observation that <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPCs loose their selectivity if the highly cohesive Nup98 FG domain is replaced by non-cohesive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The reversible collapse model extended the virtual gate model by the assumptions that an initially highly extended FG brush collapses or contracts when an NTR binds and that this contraction moves the NTR⋅cargo complex towards the anchor point and eventually across the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). This model relied on an experiment interpreted such that Importin β collapses the Nup153 FG domain, with a half maximum effect occurring at 30 femtomolar Importin β. Considering that the cellular NTR concentration is 300 million times higher (≥10 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn and Schlenstedt, 2011</xref>), this interpretation, however, implies that those domains are collapsed at all times. More generally, this model is inconsistent with the observation that NPCs still exhibit superb permselectivity when saturated with NTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang and Musser, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, neither of the aforementioned alternative models would have predicted that NPC-like permselectivity can be reconstituted with FG domains alone, i.e. independently of any grafting to a channel's inner face. None of them can explain why the propensity of Nup98 FG domains for spontaneous phase-separation is so perfectly conserved in evolution. And neither can they explain why larger cargoes require multiple NTRs for efficient NPC passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The NTR-cooperation effect indeed emphasizes that a simple binding of a translocating species to FG domains is insufficient for facilitated passage, which in fact had been an explicit prediction from the selective phase model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>). As discussed in the following, the hydrogel model provides two complementary perspectives on this effect. In the first one, we consider the barrier as a ‘solvent’, into which NTRs, but not inert cargo domains, easily partition. An NTR would improve the cargo's solubility through its own FG affinity as well as by shielding the cargo domain. A complete NTR-assisted partitioning of the cargo into the FG phase would then be an essential stage during a successful NPC passage. Is the cargo, however, too large (in proportion to the NTR), then one would expect ‘arrested’ intermediates, in which the NTR has already partitioned into the FG phase, while the cargo domain is still excluded, because the energetic penalty is too high for rapidly immersing into the FG phase. Additional NTR molecules should minimise this penalty by further reducing the cargo's accessible surface area and by their own propensity to partition into the FG gel. Indeed, the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> visualise such behaviour with remarkable clarity.</p><p>The second perspective explicitly considers the inter-FG repeat contacts, which obstruct the passage for inert material, but transiently and locally melt when an NTR binds the corresponding FG motifs. This melting should be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the NTR and thus become inefficient at distant parts of a large cargo. A second NTR molecule acting at this location should then solve this problem.</p><p>Notably, the selective phase model per se does not make a prediction as to which cohesive FG domains conduce to barrier formation. Yet, the following observations suggest a prominent contribution of Nup98 FG domains: (i) their extreme propensity to form selective barriers on their own (this study), (ii) their IDP-untypical evolutionary conservation (this study), (iii) their high copy numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori et al., 2013</xref>), and (iv) their capacity to restore a selective permeability barrier in FG Nup-depleted NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). Other FG domains will, however, also contribute by supplying additional (cohesive or adhesive) FG mass, by forming distinct FG gel layers (of similar or distinct selectivity) and perhaps by forming composite gels with the Nup98 FG domains. Such interplay between distinct FG domains will probably improve the robustness of the system, and it might indeed be an efficient way to fine-tune permselectivity. In the case of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> we expect, for example, that such blending will relax the extremely tight TtMacNup98A FG hydrogel to a physiological optimum.</p><p>Moreover, a perfect control of transport through the NPC requires not only the presence of barrier-forming material, but also that these barrier-elements span the entire cross-section of the central channel and make a tight seal to the scaffold of the pore. This is apparently achieved not only by the direct anchorage of the FG domains, but also by additional interactions between FG repeats and scaffold Nucleoporins, such as yeast Nic96p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schrader et al., 2008</xref>), Nup188, Nup192 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>), or vertebrate Nup93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu and Powers, 2013</xref>). The resulting scaffold-FG contacts can thus be seen as a functionally important extension of the cohesive inter-FG meshwork.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>DNA constructs, protein expression, and purification</title><p>Every protein used in this study was expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains BLR or NEB Express.

Elution was performed with either imidazole or by on-column protease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frey and Görlich, 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2014b</xref>). The tags of all imidazole-eluted proteins were cleaved off in solution with TEV protease, proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 column equilibrated with 44 mM Tris pH 7.5, 290 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, and eventually snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after addition of 250 mM sucrose.</p><p>FG domains were purified using Ni(II) chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions (100 mM Tris pH 8, 8 M GuHCl, 10 mM DTT). Elution was with imidazole in 100 mM Tris pH 8, 20% formamide. If necessary, they were further purified by covalent chromatography, whereby an engineered C-terminal cysteine was allowed to form a disulfide bond with a 2-thiopyridine-activated SH-silica matrix (described below) and elution was achieved by reducing the disulfides with DTT. FG domains were finally re-buffered to 20% acetonitrile, 0.08% TFA and lyophilised. O-GlcNAc modification of FG domains was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The 2-thiopyridine-activated SH-silica matrix was produced by the following steps: (i) modifying macroporous silica (Davisil XWP 1000 Å 35–70 micron [Alltech Grom GmbH, Worms, Germany]) with 2% (vol/vol) 3-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (CAS#2530-83-8) in xylene o/n @ 60°C, (ii) washing in xylene, ethanol, and finally water, (iii) reaction with aqueous 0.5 M dithiothreitol buffered with 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 7.5, o/n, 40°C, under argon, (iv) thorough washing in oxygen-free water, transfer in degassed isopropanol:water (50:50) and reaction with 0.1 M 2,2' dithiodipyridine (CAS#2127-03-9), 0.05 M Tris/HCl pH 7.5 in degassed isopropanol:water (50:50) at 20°C under argon. The matrix was stored after washing in 100% degassed isopropanol at 4°C under argon and transferred to binding buffer immediately prior to use. Covalent chromatography was performed at room temperature. For regeneration, the procedure was repeated at step (iv).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Estimation of the critical concentrations for FG domain phase-separation</title><p>For estimation of the critical concentrations for phase-separation, FG particles were formed by diluting soluble, unfolded FG domain stocks in 2M GuHCl with TBS (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) to a range of FG domain concentrations (10 µM, 5 µM, 2.5 µM, 1.25 µM, 0.6 µM, 0.3 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.06 µM). As a first estimate for the saturation concentration, we used the lowest FG domain concentration that yielded detectable particles in the DLS setup (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This number was then refined by measuring the concentration of apparent monomers that co-existed with already formed particles.</p><p>Additional method details are given in the legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Steffen Frey for sharing plasmids and protein preparations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Karsten Weis, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript by Schmidt and Görlich analyzes the characteristics of Nup98 FG-domains purified from multiple species ranging from mammals to ciliates. The authors show that all Nup98 FG-domains tested undergo phase-separation in vitro at relatively low concentrations when diluted out of guanidinium hydrochloride. Furthermore, they also phase-separate spontaneously when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Importantly, the FG particles that are formed are highly selective and recapitulate key selectivity features of intact NPCs. Using FRAP, they further show that nuclear transport receptors (even with bound cargo) can rapidly diffuse in and out of these particles whereas the FG repeats themselves appear to be immobile.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this manuscript is exciting and contains several novel and important aspects characterizing the behavior and functionality of FG repeats. Therefore there was a consensus that this paper is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> after the following revisions.</p><p>1) The authors describe the formation of hydrogels from Nup98 monomers as a 'phase transition' but there was concern that this might not be so simple.</p><p>How reversible is the formation of the Nup98 hydrogel?</p><p>If it is stable, is it indeed due to a phase transition or is there a formation of some stable, for example, amyloid-like structure that provides a framework of stability for the hydrogels?</p><p>Do isolated FG bodies shrink with time when the monomer concentration is lowered? If hydrogel formation is irreversible, what stops them from growing further?</p><p>If this is due to low monomer concentration, addition of more monomers should lead to larger hydrogels.</p><p>Are the FG bodies dissolved by the addition of hexanediol, which was previously shown to inhibit NPC transport and interfere with homotypic FG interactions?</p><p>The authors should add some, more quantitative phase separation diagrams to measure at what concentration phase separation occurs.</p><p>Furthermore, they should calculate the mass of material as monomers and as hydrogels for a range of initial concentrations. If there is a critical concentration, the total monomer concentration should be constant.</p><p>The authors argue that transport receptors do not interfere with FG body assembly even at high concentration because of the multivalency of their interactions with FG repeats.</p><p>What about NTF2? The presence of NTRs should influence the critical concentration that is needed to phase separate and, for example, low-valence NTRs should interfere whereas multivalent NTRs should allow for separation at lower concentrations (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>If NTRs do not affect hydrogel formation wouldn't that argue that critical steps in the formation of the hydrogel do not rely on FG–FG interactions?</p><p>2) The authors should tone down the conclusion on the exclusive role of Nup98's FG repeat domain in selectivity. Clearly, there are other FG domains within the NPC that are functionally important and the 'perspective' section should include a broader discussion of the various types of FG domains. Do the authors think pure Nup98 hydrogels will form in the pore as well, by excluding FG domains of different origin? One would expect that at least the cohesive FGs would all interact with each other, if sterically allowed. Do the authors expect distinct FG-zones of distinct character within the NPC?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04251.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors describe the formation of hydrogels from Nup98 monomers as a 'phase transition' but there was concern that this might not be so simple</italic>.</p><p>We originally adopted the term “phase transition” from the RNA granule field, where it is widely used to describe a process that is, strictly speaking, a phase separation in a biological system or, more specifically, a liquid–liquid unmixing leading to the formation of RNA granules or RNA-protein or just protein-rich droplets. We agree that the term is problematic, in particular as it originates from physics with a different meaning: “A phase transition is the transformation of a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer”. In analogy to the biophysics of lipid bilayers, the process we studied would also be a phase separation and not a phase transition.</p><p>Given this potential for confusion, we replaced the term “phase transition” in our manuscript by “phase separation”, because this is what we meant and what is immediately obvious from the microscopic images showing protein-rich FG phases clearly separated from the surrounding buffer.</p><p><italic>How reversible is the formation of the Nup98 hydrogel?</italic></p><p>Again, here is a potential for confusion, because the term “reversibility” is used differently in classic thermodynamics and in biology. Thermodynamics considers changes to closed systems that can be reversible or irreversible. If we started with an oversaturated solution of FG domain protomers, and phase separation and the formation of FG particles occurred, then this would be thermodynamically irreversible, because there would be no spontaneous return to the initial state. However, biochemistry would nevertheless consider the endpoint to be a reversible steady state if protomers from the particles are in steady exchange with protomers in the surrounding buffer. Here, the classification as “reversible” or “irreversible” is also a pragmatic issue of considered time scales.</p><p>As far as we can tell, the formation of FG particles is reversible according to the biochemical perception. We include two additional experiments to support our view. In the first one, we formed FG particles with 1, 3, and 10 µM Nup116 FG domains. We observed that the amount of particulate FG domains increased with protomer concentration, while the concentration of remaining soluble FG domain stayed constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Author response image 1</xref>). This is the expected result if the distribution of the FG domain between protein-rich phase and buffer is governed by a reversible equilibrium state.<fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Formation of ScNup116 FG particles at different concentrations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04251-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In a second experiment, we first formed FG particles at 10 µM protomer concentration. One sample was subsequently left at 10 µM, while the others were diluted to 1 or 3 µM final protein concentration. After an extended incubation period (4 hr), we observed that the concentration of the soluble Nup116 FG domain was identical in all three samples, while the ratios of particulate: soluble matter dropped with decreasing protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 2</xref>). This is expected when the FG domain can indeed reversibly re-equilibrate between particles and bulk buffer.<fig id="fig17" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Reversibility of FG particle formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04251-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>It should be said though that a phase separation is not necessarily defined through reversibility. There are many examples where the separation is irreversible (for instance the unmixing of a melt during solidification).</p><p><italic>If it is stable, is it indeed due to a phase transition or is there a formation of some stable, for example, amyloid-like structure that provides a framework of stability for the hydrogels?</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we abandon the term “phase transition” because it is very prone to confusion when used to describe something that is actually an unmixing event.</p><p>Extending the question to “phase separation”, we see no contradiction between a structure being formed by a phase separation and the same structure being stable (kinetically and/or thermodynamically). Likewise, a structure can be stable over time and yet exchange constituents with the surrounding buffer.</p><p>Selective FG hydrogels may or may not contain amyloid-like, i.e. cross-beta sheet, structures. This is a major point in the present and two previous studies. The NQ-rich FG domains from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Nup100 or Nup116 form FG particles that stain positive with ThioflavinT and, by this criterion, contain such structures. Using solid-state NMR, we previously detected cross-β structures in FG hydrogels derived from the similarly NQ-rich N-terminus of Nsp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ader et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, other FG hydrogels appear to lack such structures, as e.g. judged from the very weak ThioflavinT-staining of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MacNup98A FG particles. Again, previous solid-state NMR data second this notion, as FG hydrogels derived from the fully GlcNAc-modified <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nup98 FG domains clearly lack cross-β structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Do isolated FG bodies shrink with time when the monomer concentration is lowered?</italic></p><p>Yes. They eventually disappear when we keep removing monomers from the equilibrium, for example by repeated steps of pelleting and resuspending in fresh buffer. We mention this as technical issue in the text, because an excessively thorough purification of FG inclusion bodies by too many centrifugation steps may lead to a complete loss of material, in particular for FG domains with a higher critical/ saturation concentration. This applies e.g. to the Nup116 FG domain (c ≈ 0.7 µM), but is less of an issue for the TtMac98A FG domain (c ≈ 0.02 µM). Please also refer to the aforementioned <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>If hydrogel formation is irreversible, what stops them from growing further? If this is due to low monomer concentration, addition of more monomers should lead to larger hydrogels</italic>.</p><p>Monomers become limiting (also in case of an irreversible assembly). Of course, one can play games like enlarging pre-existing FG particles, couple such enlargement with a switch in colors etc. But considering the length of the manuscript and the number of figures, we prefer to leave this for a future study.</p><p><italic>Are the FG bodies dissolved by the addition of hexanediol, which was previously shown to inhibit NPC transport and interfere with homotypic FG interactions?</italic></p><p>Indeed, our lab originally discovered that hexanediols renders HeLa NPCs non-selectively permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>). The Goldfarb lab later confirmed this for yeast NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shulga and Goldfarb, 2003</xref>). We have now tested the effect of trans-1, 2-cyclo-hexanediol and 1,6-n-hexanediol on FG particle formation and observed that these agents also interfere with FG phase formation in our in vitro system (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This finding is consistent with the original idea that hexanediols disrupt the FG–FG interactions within NPCs and thus increase their permeability. It moreover highlights the unique resemblance of the NPC barrier to the self-assembled FG phases that we report on.</p><p><italic>The authors should add some, more quantitative phase separation diagrams to measure at what concentration phase separation occurs</italic>.</p><p>It is unclear what the reviewers meant with “phase separation diagrams”. In classic thermodynamics, these are (typically two-dimensional) representations of phase transitions as functions of pressure and temperature; in the fields of detergents, this is often used to represent transitions between monomers, micelles, and inverted micelles as a function of temperature and ionic strength.</p><p>For all 10 FG domains discussed in this study, we tested entire series of domain concentrations to estimate the lowest one that would allow phase separation. These numbers are listed as “estimated critical concentrations” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. They are certainly accurate enough to support the argument that the expected local Nup98 FG domain concentration in assembled NPCs exceeds the critical concentrations for phase separation by a very large factor.</p><p>For these measurements, we used standardised conditions (21°C, physiological pH and ionic strength) and cannot see why filling phase diagrams with multidimensional titration data should be required for any argument we make.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, they should calculate the mass of material as monomers and as hydrogels for a range of initial concentrations. If there is a critical concentration, the total monomer concentration should be constant</italic>.</p><p>This is true, and indeed we did measure entire concentration series to derive the listed critical (saturation) concentrations. This is now written more clearly in the Methods.</p><p>In addition, we now included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16 fig17">Author response images 1 and 2</xref> to document for the Nup116 domain that FG particles are indeed in equilibrium with a constant monomer concentration (see above).</p><p><italic>The authors argue that transport receptors do not interfere with FG body assembly even at high concentration because of the multivalency of their interactions with FG repeats</italic>.</p><p>We write that a 10-fold molar excess of importin β does not block the FG body assembly. We now also include a direct solubility test to document this (new Figure panels 15C and 15D). At a ≥10-fold molar excess, a slight increase in solubility becomes evident. However, this would already mean 1000 NTR molecules being simultaneously bound to a single NPC, while ≈100 would be the expected order of magnitude. We extended the Discussion to make this even clearer.</p><p><italic>What about NTF2? The presence of NTRs should influence the critical concentration that is needed to phase separate and, for example, low-valence NTRs should interfere whereas multivalent NTRs should allow for separation at lower concentrations (see e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"><italic>Li et al 2012</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>NTF2 does not make the Mac98A FG domain more soluble, even when used at a 50-fold molar excess (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15D</xref>).</p><p><italic>If NTRs do not affect hydrogel formation wouldn't that argue that critical steps in the formation of the hydrogel do not rely on FG–FG interactions?</italic></p><p>We did not write that NTRs do not affect phase separation. They do not block the process at the stoichiometries that are allowed by the volume constraints of an NPC.</p><p>Moreover, previous data strongly argue for a critical contribution of FG–FG interactions: mutating FG to e.g. SG or AG motifs completely abolishes cohesive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frey and Görlich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ader et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors should tone down the conclusion on the exclusive role of Nup98's FG repeat domain in selectivity. Clearly, there are other FG domains within the NPC that are functionally important and the 'perspective' section should include a broader discussion of the various types of FG domains. Do the authors think pure Nup98 hydrogels will form in the pore as well, by excluding FG domains of different origin? One would expect that at least the cohesive FGs would all interact with each other, if sterically allowed. Do the authors expect distinct FG-zones of distinct character within the NPC?</italic></p><p>All experimental data in this study were obtained for Nup98 FG domains, so it is natural that these domains are the focus of any discussion. In addition, we extensively addressed and discussed the issue of distinct FG zones in an earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labokha et al., 2013</xref>). We feel that the arguments given there are still fully valid, but also that it is not an option to replicate an earlier Discussion section in a new publication. Instead, we now write:</p><p>“Notably, the selective phase model per se does not make a prediction as to which cohesive FG domains conduce to barrier formation. Yet, the following observations suggest a prominent contribution of Nup98 FG domains: (<italic>i</italic>) their extreme propensity to form selective barriers on their own (this study), (<italic>ii</italic>) their IDP-untypical evolutionary conservation (this study), (<italic>iii</italic>) their high copy numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori et al., 2013</xref>) and (<italic>iv</italic>) their capacity to restore a selective permeability barrier in FG Nup-depleted NPCs (Hülsmann et al., 2013). Other FG domains will, however, also contribute by supplying additional (cohesive or adhesive) FG mass, by forming distinct FG gel layers (of similar or distinct selectivity) and perhaps by forming composite gels with the Nup98 FG domains. Such interplay between distinct FG domains will probably improve the robustness of the system and it might indeed be an efficient way to fine-tune permselectivity. In the case of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> we expect, for example, that such blending will relax the extremely tight TtMacNup98A FG hydrogel to a physiological optimum.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
