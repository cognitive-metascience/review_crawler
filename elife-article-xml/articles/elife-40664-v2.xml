Divalent cation binding sites reside within the gating ring formed by two Regulator of Conductance of Potassium (RCK) domains per subunit. Using patch-clamp fluorometry, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the RCK1 domain triggers gating ring rearrangements that depend on transmembrane voltage. Because the gating ring is outside the electric field, this voltage sensitivity must originate from coupling to the voltage-dependent channel opening, the voltage sensor or both. Here we demonstrate that alterations of the voltage sensor, either by mutagenesis or regulation by auxiliary subunits, are paralleled by changes in the voltage dependence of the gating ring movements, whereas modifications of the relative open probability are not. These results strongly suggest that conformational changes of RCK1 domains are specifically coupled to the voltage sensor function during allosteric modulation of BK channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>allosteric modulation</kwd><kwd>BK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-NS002993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miranda</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmgren</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG-2014-648936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2013-50085-EXP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RyC-2012-11349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allosteric modulation of BK channels, vital for the physiology of nerve, muscle and endocrine cells, is determined by direct coupling between gating ring RCK1 domains and the voltage sensor function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The open probability of large conductance voltage-and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK or slo1) channels is regulated allosterically by voltage and intracellular concentration of divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moczydlowski and Latorre, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Latorre et al., 2017</xref>). This feature makes BK channels important regulators of physiological processes such as neurotransmission and muscular function, where they couple membrane voltage and the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robitaille and Charlton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raffaelli et al., 2004</xref>). The BK channel is formed in the membrane as tetramers of α subunits, encoded by the KCNMA1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quirk and Reinhart, 2001</xref>). Each α subunit contains seven transmembrane domains (S0 to S6), a small extracellular N-terminal domain and a large intracellular C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meera et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>) (Figure 2a). Similar to other voltage-gated channels, the voltage across the membrane is sensed by the voltage sensor domain (VSD), containing charged amino acids within transmembrane segments S2, S3 and S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Díaz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pantazis and Olcese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>). The sensor for divalent cations is at the C-terminal region and is formed by two Regulator of Conductance for K<sup>+</sup> domains (RCK1 and RCK2) per α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moss and Magleby, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In the tetramer, four RCK1-RCK2 tandems pack against each other in a large structure known as the gating ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giraldez and Rothberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Two high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are located in the RCK2 (also known as ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl’) and RCK1 domains, respectively. Additionally, a site with low affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is located at the interface between the VSD and the RCK1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi and Cui, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>) (Figure 2a). The high-affinity binding sites show structural dissimilarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>) and different affinity for divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). Apart from Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it has been described that Cd<sup>2+</sup> selectively binds to the RCK1 site, whereas Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> show higher affinity for the RCK2 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, intracellular concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> can shift the voltage dependence of BK activation towards more negative potentials. Using patch clamp fluorometry (PCF), we have shown that these cations trigger independent conformational changes of RCK1 and/or RCK2 within the gating ring, measured as large changes in the efficiency of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorophores introduced into specific sites in the BK tetramer. These rearrangements depend on the specific interaction of the divalent ions with their high-affinity binding sites, showing different dependences on cation concentration and membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>). To date, the proposed transduction mechanism by which divalent ion binding increases channel open probability was a conformational change of the gating ring that leads to a physical pulling of the channel gate, where the linker between the S6 transmembrane domain and the RCK1 region acts like a passive spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niu et al., 2004</xref>). Such a mechanism would be analogous to channel activation by ligand binding in glutamate receptor or cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, also tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">James et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous results do not support this as the sole mechanism underlying coupling of divalent ion binding to channel opening, since the gating ring conformational changes that we have recorded: 1) are not strictly coupled to the opening of the channel’s gate, and 2) show different voltage dependence for each divalent ion. In addition, the recent cryo-EM structure of the full slo1 channel of <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>) shows that the RCK1 domain of the gating ring is in contact with the VSD, predicting that changes in the voltage sensor position could be reflected in the voltage dependent gating ring reorganizations.</p><p>Understanding the nature of the voltage dependence associated with individual rearrangements produced by binding of divalent ions to the gating ring is essential to untangle the mechanism underlying the role of such rearrangements in BK channel gating. To this end, we have now performed PCF measurements with human BK channels heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, including a range of VSD mutations or co-expressed with different regulatory subunits. Here we provide evidence for a functional interaction between the gating ring and the voltage sensor in full-length, functional BK channels at the plasma membrane, in agreement with the structural data from <italic>Aplysia</italic> BK. Moreover, these data support a pathway that couples to divalent ion binding to channel opening through the voltage sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Voltage dependence of gating ring rearrangements is associated to activation of the RCK1 binding site</title><p>BK α subunits labeled with fluorescent proteins CFP and YFP in the linker between the RCK1 and RCK2 domains (position 667) retain the functional properties of wild-type BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>). This allowed us to use PCF to detect conformational rearrangements of the gating ring measured as changes in FRET efficiency (<italic>E</italic>) between the fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>). Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to both high-affinity binding sites (RCK1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl) produces an activation of BK channels, coincident with an increase in <italic>E</italic> from basal levels reaching saturating values at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In addition, we observed that the <italic>E</italic> signal has the remarkable property that in intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (from 4 µM to 55 µM) it shows voltage dependence besides its Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>), these changes in <italic>E</italic> with voltage are not conformational dynamics of the gating ring that simply follow the voltage dependence of VSD. For instance, at 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations movements of the VSD occurs between 0 and +300 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horrigan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, we do not observe changes in <italic>E</italic> between 0 and +240 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Similarly, at 100 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, charge movement takes place between −100 and +150 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015</xref>), while our FRET signals at 95 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> do not vary within this voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Independent activation of high-affinity binding sites by other divalent ions (Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, or Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>)) led us to postulate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation has a site-dependent relation to voltage. To further evaluate the effect of individual high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites on the voltage-dependent component of the gating ring conformational changes we first selectively mutated the binding sites. Mutations D362A and D367A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>) were introduced in the BK667CY construct (BK667CY<sup>D362A/D367A</sup>) to remove the high-affinity binding site located in the RCK1 domain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows the relative conductance and <italic>E</italic> values for the BK667CY<sup>D362A/D367A</sup> construct at different membrane voltages for various Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. As described previously, the G-V curves show a significantly reduced shift to more negative potentials when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased, as compared to the non-mutated BK667CY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, left panels). Specific activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl renders a smaller change in <italic>E</italic> values, which are not voltage-dependent within the voltage range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right panel). To test the effect of eliminating the RCK2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site -the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl- we mutated five aspartates to alanines (5D5A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2002</xref>). As expected, activation of only the RCK1 domain by Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent shift in the GV curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left panel). Even though the extent to which the <italic>E</italic> values changed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), there was a persistent voltage dependence equivalent to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> corresponding to the non-mutated channel (most appreciable at 12 µM and 22 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, right panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>). Further, at these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations the changes in <italic>E</italic> occurred within the same voltage range (+60–120 mV) in channels with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This effect seems not to be attributable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to unknown binding sites in the channel, since the double mutation of the RCK1 and RCK2 sites abolishes the change in the FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that the voltage-dependent component of the gating ring conformational changes triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the BK667CY construct depends on activation of the RCK1 binding site. Because the gating ring is not within the transmembrane region, it is not expected to be directly influenced by the transmembrane voltage. Therefore, the voltage-dependent FRET signals must be coupled to the dynamics of the gate region associated with the opening and closing of the channel and/or those of the voltage sensor domain.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40664.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Voltage dependence of gating ring rearrangements is associated to activation of the RCK1 binding site.</title><p>G-V (left panels) and <italic>E-</italic>V curves (right panels) obtained simultaneously at several Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations from (<bold>a</bold>) the BK667CY construct, (<bold>b</bold>) mutation of the RCK1 high-affinity site (D362A/D367A), (<bold>c</bold>) mutation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl (5D5A), or (<bold>d</bold>) both (D362A/D367A 5D5A).

We recapitulated this strategy. First, we co-expressed BK667CY α subunits with β3b and observed the expected inactivation of the ionic currents at positive potentials, yet with different blockade kinetics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingle et al., 2001</xref>). The relative open probability of this complex is like BK667CYα alone, except that at extreme positive potentials the values of relative conductance at the tails decrease due to inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>, left panel).

Altogether, these results indicate that the alteration of the voltage dependence of the voltage sensor induced by the amino terminal of β1within the β3bNβ1 chimera underlies the modification of the voltage dependence of the gating ring conformational changes, reinforcing the hypothesis that this voltage dependence is directly related to VSD function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40664.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Co-expression with β subunits.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) β1 subunits have been shown to directly regulate VSD function, shifting V<sub>h(j)</sub> to more negative values (<bold>b</bold>) Left panel, G-V curves obtained at several Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations after co-expression of BK667CY with the β1 subunit, which induces a leftward shift in the <italic>E</italic>-V curves obtained simultaneously (right).

Further, the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> on the <italic>E</italic> values showed a voltage-dependent component, for which we could not provide an explanation. Voltage dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced rearrangements seemed to be specifically related to RCK1 activation, since only the mutation of that binding site resulted in voltage-independent <italic>E</italic> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One possibility to explain this result is the existence of direct structural interactions of the RCK1 domain and the VSD. Interestingly, the recently obtained cryo-EM full BK structure from <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> revealed the existence of specific protein-protein interfaces formed by the amino terminal lobes of the RCK1 domains facing the transmembrane domain and the VSD/S4-S5 linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hite et al., 2017</xref>). According to the structural data obtained in saturating Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, gating of the channel by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to be mediated, at least partly, by displacement of these interfaces causing the VSD/S4-S5 linkers to move, contributing to pore opening ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tao et al., 2017</xref>); but see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>)). Our work provides functional data supporting this mechanism. Our data show that mutations altering the voltage dependence of BK VSD are reflected in the voltage dependence of the gating ring movements triggered by activation of the RCK1 binding site by Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Mutations altering VSD function by inducing large leftward shifts in the V<sub>h</sub>(j) values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) strongly correlate with negative shifts in the voltage dependence of the <italic>E</italic> signals. Likewise, mutations inducing positive shifts in the VSD voltage dependence of the voltage sensor function are reflected in <italic>E</italic>-V shifts towards more positive membrane voltages. Interestingly, we also observe a correlation between the changes in the slope of the G-V curves and that of the <italic>E</italic>-V curves (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting the existence of an interaction between the VSD and the gating ring. This idea is further supported by the effect of β1 which has been proposed to alter the voltage dependence of VSD function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox and Aldrich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nimigean and Magleby, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Cox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orio and Latorre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Contreras et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that β1 and β3bNβ1 induce a leftward shift in the <italic>E</italic>-V curves. Conversely, two experimental strategies known to influence the G-V curves without direct interference with the VSD did not affect the voltage dependence of <italic>E</italic>. The lack of effect on the <italic>E</italic>-V curves of the mutation F315A can be explained because the shift in the G-V curves arises from the influence of this mutation in the C↔O transition with minor effects on the voltage dependence of the gating currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015</xref>). Analogously, no change in the voltage dependence of <italic>E</italic> was observed after co-expression of BKα with the γ1 subunit, which shifts the voltage dependence of pore opening by enhancing its allosteric coupling with the voltage sensor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan and Aldrich, 2010</xref>). As with the mutation F315A, the presence of γ1 subunit produces a minor shift in the Q-V distributions, not paralleling the large shift in the G-V curves (Carrasquel-Ursulaez and Ramon Latorre, personal communication).</p><p>A puzzling result from our previous study was the observation that Ba<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl triggers voltage-dependent conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>). Even though we still do not know the mechanisms of this unique response to Ba<sup>2+</sup>, here we learned that it is not related to the dynamics of VSD, but rather influenced by perturbations affecting the opening and closing of the channel at the pore domain. Why Ba<sup>2+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>? A possible answer for this question is that Ba<sup>2+</sup> has the additional property of blocking the permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neyton and Miller, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), which could somehow be transmitted allosterically to the gating ring. If simply ion permeation blockade is what matters, then we might expect that blocking permeation with the high affinity quaternary ammonium derivative <italic>N</italic>-(4-[benzoyl]benzyl)-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-tributylammonium (bb-TBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2009</xref>) should produce a voltage dependent FRET signal with Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation. But, it does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Another possibility for the Ba<sup>2+</sup> effect could be a direct allosteric interaction between the intrinsic gating in the pore and the divalent binding site in RCK2, which needs to be tested further.</p><p>Irrespectively of the fluorescent construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>) or the divalent ion used to activate the BK channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>), we have consistently observed that the conformational changes monitored as changes in the FRET efficiency are not strictly coupled to the intrinsic gating of the channel. In this study, we have found that the consequences of the voltage dependence of the intrinsic gating by manipulations of the VSD and the pore region are paralleled by the FRET efficiencies. These results rule out the possibilities that FRET signals derive from conformational changes in an unknown Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site or that they are completely uncoupled to the intrinsic gating.</p><p>In conclusion, our functional data show a strong correlation between the VSD function and the RCK1 conformational changes, suggesting a transduction mechanism from ion binding to change the channel activation. This transduction mechanism is in agreement with the existence of structural interactions between the RCK1 domain and the VSD. The correlation between VSD function and the RCK1 conformational changes is not observed between RCK2 and VSD, suggesting the existence of a different transduction mechanism that may include an indirect mechanism through the RCK1 or RCK1-S6 linker.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology and heterologous expression of tagged channels</title><p>Fluorescent BK α subunits were labelled with CFP or YFP using a transposon-based insertion method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giraldez et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher J Lingle (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Modify the Title</p><p>Reviewers thought the title was vague and could be modified to better convey the message of the manuscript.

Reviewers also desired more guidance on how to interpret the quantitative relationship between VSD activation and the voltage-dependence of FRET as well as several interesting or puzzling features of the data including the effect of Ba<sup>2+</sup>, the remarkably steep Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of FRET, and the lack of voltage-dependence of FRET in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Mechanistic or quantitative interpretation is lacking, and ideally should be improved, if only to provide some framework for future evaluation and tests. Proposing a model (i.e. a kinetic scheme) to account for the major features of the relation between Ca<sup>2+</sup>, voltage, and FRET efficiency (i.e. lack of FRET in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> or high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and correlations observed in the different mutants) would greatly strengthen the conclusions and enhance the significance of the results. While developing a model to account for all features of the data may be beyond the scope of this study, the authors should at minimum indicate which features of the data can or cannot be accounted for by previously proposed models (i.e. Miranda 2013) and whether their data provide any new insight into mechanism that must be included in gating models. This should be possible to do without incorporating additional experiments.</p><p>4) Reconcile discrepancies and apparent inconsistencies in the data</p><p>The authors should address the apparent inconsistency between the effect of the γ1 subunit on FRET and its predicted effect on VSD activation, as well as discrepancies between some of the results and data previously published.</p><p>Results which seem to contradict earlier results include: a) GV shift magnitude of F315A in 100 Ca<sup>2+</sup>; b) Lack of a GV shift for the β3Nβ1 construct; c) Whether they have adequate expression of β3b.</p><p>Because the individual reviews include several important points they are included here for you reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Miranda et al. examines energetic coupling in BK channels between its modular domains that underlie voltage sensing and calcium sensing, using patch-clamp fluorometry. The authors show here that the FRET efficiency (E) depends strongly on the integrity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site in RCK1 (determined by D362/D367), and relatively much less on integrity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl site. It is further shown that movements in the gating ring that are tracked by the authors' FRET measurements are not directly linked to channel opening, but instead to voltage-sensor dynamics. The greater relative contribution of the RCK1 site to VSD coupling is corroborated by selective activation of the site by Cd<sup>2+</sup>. However (interestingly), selective activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl site by Ba<sup>2+</sup> also exhibits voltage-dependence in the FRET response, which is attributed energetic coupling with the movement of the gate. These results thus substantially extend previous work on preferential coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at the RCK1 site with voltage-sensor activation.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is written in a logical format and the data, as presented, are of high quality. This is an outstanding contribution to our understanding of BK channels, forming a bridge between structural and functional studies. I have only a few comments aimed at improving the presentation.</p><p>1) The title seems a little vague; maybe the authors could think of one that more strongly conveys the message of this paper, which appears to be that the coupling is preferential, or selective, among the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation sites.</p><p>2) Unfortunately the authors measurement of FRET efficiency is represented by &quot;E&quot;, and the allosteric coupling between the gating ring and voltage sensor from the Horrigan model is also &quot;E&quot;. This makes things a bit confusing, but I'm not sure what can be done about it.</p><p>3) In Discussion (paragraph 1):</p><p>• &quot;inducing additive rearrangements&quot; should probably read &quot;inducing energetically-additive rearrangements&quot;.</p><p>• &quot; Further, the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> on the <italic>E</italic> values showed a voltage-dependent component, for which we could not provide a structural basis.&quot; This statement seems a little misleading; there seems to be some structural basis for voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup> effects, because the RCK1 sight is physically somewhat close to the VSD (as the authors reason later on), and it is the Ba<sup>2+</sup> effect that is more puzzling.</p><p>4) It seems like the interpretation of the Ba<sup>2+</sup> effect may require more study, or more comment; if Ba<sup>2+</sup> really is acting solely through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl, then the E-V relation observed with Ba and the S4 mutants (Figure 6D and F) should resemble the E-V relations with an RCK1 site knockout (D362A/D367A) combined with S4 mutation. Is this the case? If not, then this might argue against Ba<sup>2</sup>+ acting solely through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl, and suggest the Ba<sup>2+</sup> is having other effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This team has for several years been probing conformational changes in the cytosolic gating ring of the BK channel using sets of genetic encoded fluorescent tags to generate FRET signals that change with conformational status. Previous results had revealed an unexplained result that the FRET-reported signals exhibited voltage-dependence, despite the fact that the gating ring is not within the electric field across the membrane. This tended to contradict a standard model of BK activation in which coupling between voltage-sensors (VSDs) and the cytosolic domain (CTD) was thought to be rather weak. Furthermore, previous results from this team indicated that the two high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in the gating ring may behave differently in regards to voltage-sensitivity. The present paper nicely extends these earlier results with a number of functional tests that lead to the conclusion that, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the status of the voltage-sensors (VSDs) can influence the conformational status of the gating ring. Furthermore, this largely involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligation at the RCK1 domain, but not the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bowl. In sum, the authors find that the previously reported voltage-dependent conformational change of the BK gating ring induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the RCK1 high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is strongly correlated with the activation of the BK VSD. Manipulations that shift the activation-voltage relationship of the BK VSD, including mutations of key residues in the BK VSD or co-expression with β-1 accessory subunits, also shift the fluorescence-voltage relationship of the BK gating ring toward same direction. Manipulations that change other aspect of BK channel gating, such as F315A mutation that reduces the intrinsic BK gating equilibrium constant, the coupling between the BK VSD and BK gate, and the coupling the BK VSD and BK gating ring, or co-expression with the γ-1 subunit that enhances the coupling between the BK VSD and BK gate, do not significantly change the fluorescence-voltage relationship of the BK gating ring.</p><p>Overall, the paper is interesting, addresses an important, unresolved question, and is clearly presented (albeit with some suggestions below). There are some details on particular experiments which may be somewhat inconsistent with some earlier results and may require clarification. This particularly applies to some of the β subunit tests.</p><p>Guidance regarding status of voltage sensors under different conditions. Some readers might also wonder about what the voltage-sensor status is under various manipulations for which GVs and EVs are generated. Although explicit measurements of gating currents would be too much to ask, there are situations where it might be useful for the readers to be reminded whether VSDs are likely to be entirely resting or mostly activated, for example. The authors are essentially assuming that the E/V measurements are a surrogate for VSD activation, but unfortunately this is largely an untested assumption, although not unreasonable. For the F315A construct, the earlier Carrasquel, 2015 paper does provide comparable Q/V curves for human F380A, which support the view that the VSD equilibrium is not altered by this mutation. However, the Vh for activation of the human F380A construct in that paper at 100 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is about 232 mV, much more positive than what is reported (less than +100 mV) in the present manuscript for mouse F315A. Reasons for this rather major discrepancy are not clear and not mentioned.</p><p>Are CTD and VSD totally uncoupled in absence of ligand? There is one aspect of the data that seems to pose an interesting limiting condition regarding the overall mechanism that the authors might consider discussing. Specifically, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, any conformational change involving VSDs and pore-gate-domain (PGD) activation seems entirely uncoupled from the gating ring. It seems impressive that for every construct that is examined, at 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, even when full activation is shifted to potentials negative to +100 mV (e.g., with γ1), there is never any detectable FRET signal. This seems to say that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for conformational coupling between VSD and CTD, or, to say it another way, that VSD movements do not couple to the CTD in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> is obligatory for VSD-CTD coupling.</p><p>Is there a way to compare Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of EV measurements to other approaches? Another interesting aspect of the data about which little is said is the rather astonishingly steep Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of FRET signal generation at any single voltage. This seems consistent across constructs, and is reduced in the single site constructs with Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup>. Maybe this fits with what we know about Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of activation, but it seems unusually steep. Although it may be difficult to extract from the E./V data, it seems like there is some information regarding apparent voltage-dependence of ligand affinity embedded in the data, that might be interesting to contrast to earlier results, e.g., from Sweet and Cox.</p><p>Various aspects of the β subunit experiments are confusing. First, in Figure 3D, the β3bNβ1 construct is producing no effect on GVs at all. Yet, in the Supplementary Information of Castillo et al., 2015, Vh is reported to shift negatively about 50 mV for presumably the same construct. Part of their argument was that the positive residues in the β1 N-terminus are responsible not only for the effect on voltage-sensors, but also the gating shift. Mutation of the K3K4 charged residues in the N-terminus abolishes the β1 gating shift, while mutation of K10R11 retained the gating shift.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Presumably the β3b construct is the human form, but this should be clarified, since the mouse form does not cause rapid inactivation. The results in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are only partially supportive of the idea that adequate expression of β3b has been achieved. The main argument the authors make is apparently the roll-over in the GV relationship seen at 12 and 22 microM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. But it is very odd that this roll-over is not seen at 95 and 4 microM. The Materials and methods state that all GVs were generated from tail currents. Because the β3b inactivation is very low affinity, it has been shown that recovery from block is essentially complete at the peak of the usual tail currents, so tail current GVs are not particularly affected by this block (Xia et al., 2000. Figure 6C vs. 6D.). Yet steady-state conductance with adequate β3b expression shows marked block, which is really not so readily apparent in the example traces in panel a. The β3 subunit, of all β subunits, is known to be a bit challenging to express and the results here are not convincing in that regards. This is critical, when the observed results are really not any different from BK667CY α alone. The fact that no gating shift was observed with the chimeric β3bNβ1 construct also raises some concern in that regard. Positive controls that these β subunit constructs are being adequately expressed are lacking.</p><p>The scale bars in panel A of Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are also likely to be in error. And the time base of these recordings really doesn't provide any chance of seeing the distinctive features of patches with β3b containing channels.</p><p>Resolution of the issues raised above would impact on the discussion about these experiments presented in the subsection “The dynamics of the VSD are directly reflected in the gating ring conformation”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study examines the interaction between transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BK channels by determining the effects of mutations in each domain, or co-assembly with regulatory subunits, on conformational changes in the cytoplasmic gating ring. The authors have previously demonstrated that gating ring conformation can be monitored by measuring FRET efficiency between CFP- and YFP-tagged Slo1 subunits. FRET efficiency is increased by the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other divalent cations to two previously identified high-affinity binding sites, and at intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations by membrane depolarization. The effect of voltage on FRET is consistent with the suggestion, most recently based on BK channel structure, that functional interactions occur between the RCK1 domain of the gating ring and VSD. Here, this hypothesis is supported by showing that (a) voltage-dependent FRET is abolished by mutating the RCK1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and (b) changes in voltage-dependent FRET induced by mutations or regulatory subunits are correlated with VSD activation rather than channel opening.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the data clearly described. However, the conclusions are not particularly novel and I have concerns about the lack of comparison to previous work, and the extent to which the results provide new insight.</p><p>The idea that functional interactions occur between the VSD and gating ring in BK channels has already been addressed by several previous studies such as Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002, Sweet and Cox, 2008, and Savalli et al., 2012. Only the first of these is referenced in the manuscript, and that one is mischaracterized. The authors seem to suggest that an interaction between VSD and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites was included in the Horrigan Aldrich model simply for completeness (i.e. because it couldn't be ruled out). In fact, that study observed clear evidence for an interaction based on the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on VSD activation (gating current). These results led to an estimate of the interaction energy between Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and V-sensors and the conclusion that the interaction was not altered by channel opening. In addition, Horrigan and Aldrich concluded that the interaction was weak, not because they couldn't measure it, but because the interaction energy was small compared to that between Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or V-sensors and channel opening. Sweet and Cox 2008 then tested a prediction that the interaction is bi-directional, by confirming that the apparent Kd for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding is reduced by altered by membrane depolarization. Furthermore, they concluded that the interaction occurred with RCK1 rather than RCK2, based on the effect of mutating the different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. Finally, Savalli et al., 2012 used patch clamp fluorometry (on the VSD) to confirm that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the gating ring alters VSD activation. Thus, while the detailed approach used in the manuscript is new, neither the conclusions or even the use of patch clamp fluorometry appear to be novel. That said, the results could be valuable if they provide new insight into the nature of the interaction or its properties. But here too I have doubts. As the authors point out, the results show a strong correlation between effects on voltage-sensor activation and changes in the voltage-dependence of FRET. However, the results are described in very qualitative terms that don't seem to provide much insight beyond the basic conclusion. At minimum, I think the authors need to discuss whether the results are consistent or inconsistent with previous results, and make clear what is new.</p><p>One specific concern is whether the lack of effect of the γ1 subunit on FRET efficiency in Figure 2F is indeed consistent with the hypothesis that voltage-dependent FRET reflects VSD activation. The authors typically reference the effect of various mutations and regulatory subunits on the half-activation voltage of the VSD, V<sub>h</sub>(j). Strictly speaking, V<sub>h</sub>(j) is the half-activation voltage when channels are closed, and for most of the experiments may be an appropriate parameter to look at since voltage-dependent FRET is being measured under condition where a large fraction of channels are closed. However, in the case of γ1, voltage-dependent FRET is occurring over a range where channels are open (i.e. rel. conduct. In Figure 2F is saturated). While the authors are correct that Yan and Aldrich, 2010 proposed that V<sub>h</sub>(j) is unaltered by γ1, their model predicts a large shift in VSD half activation voltage when channels are open (because when channels are open, VSD activation depends on VSD-gate coupling, which is enhance by γ1). Therefore, is seems like one should expect γ1 to shift v-dependent FRET to more negative voltages if it was simply detecting VSD activation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40664.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Modify the Title</p><p>Reviewers thought the title was vague and could be modified to better convey the message of the manuscript.

Our new results show that: 1) the <italic>E</italic>-V relations observed with Ba<sup>2+</sup> and the S4 mutants (Figure 6) resemble the <italic>E</italic>-V relations with the RCK1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site knockout (D362A D367A) containing S4 mutations (BK667CY<sup>D362A D367A R210E</sup> and BK667CY<sup>D362A D367A E219R</sup>). These observations confirm that the observed voltage-dependence of the Ba<sup>2+</sup> is not related to the RCK1 site.

Results are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and a new paragraph has been added to Discussion:</p><p>‘Why Ba<sup>2+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>? A possible answer for this question is that Ba<sup>2+</sup> has the additional property of blocking the permeation pathway (Miller, 1987; Neyton and Miller, 1988; Zhou et al., 2012), which could somehow be transmitted allosterically to the gating ring. If simply ion permeation blockade is what matters, then we might expect that blocking permeation with the high affinity quaternary ammonium derivative <italic>N</italic>-(4-[benzoyl]benzyl)-<italic>N,N,N</italic>-tributylammonium (bb-TBA) (Tang et al., 2009) should produce a voltage dependent FRET signal with Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation. But, it does not (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). Another possibility for the Ba<sup>2+</sup> effect could be a direct allosteric interaction between the intrinsic gating in the pore and the divalent binding site in RCK2, which needs to be tested further.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide more guidance for interpreting the results: The remarkably steep Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of FRET.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation. To better appreciate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the FRET signal, we have looked at the <italic>E</italic> and G/Gmax data as a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we have converted the data from Figure 1A-D to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dose-response curves.

Within this range, the steepness of the <italic>E</italic>-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curves is similar to that of the G/Gmax-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>] data.

[…] Similarly, at 100 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, charge movement takes place between -100 and +150 mV (Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015), while our FRET signals at 95 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> do not vary within this voltage range (Figure 1A).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide more guidance for interpreting the results: Mechanistic or quantitative interpretation is lacking, and ideally should be improved, if only to provide some framework for future evaluation and tests. Proposing a model (i.e. a kinetic scheme) to account for the major features of the relation between Ca<sup>2+</sup>, voltage, and FRET efficiency (i.e. lack of FRET in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> or high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and correlations observed in the different mutants) would greatly strengthen the conclusions and enhance the significance of the results. While developing a model to account for all features of the data may be beyond the scope of this study, the authors should at minimum indicate which features of the data can or cannot be accounted for by previously proposed models (i.e. Miranda 2013) and whether their data provide any new insight into mechanism that must be included in gating models. This should be possible to do without incorporating additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a model would provide some framework for future evaluation and tests. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful to adapt the HA model to describe the voltage dependencies of the <italic>E</italic> and G signals simultaneously. As described in Miranda et al., 2013, we explored a large number of modifications but all failed to describe the data. If we were to adopt a model, it should be reminiscent of, but simpler than, the one proposed by Savalli et al., 2012). In this model two different allosteric constants would account for the coupling of the gating ring to the PD, the VSD would only be allosterically coupled to the RCK1 (E’) and the RCK domains would be related by a new constant F. Notably, our data support E’ and C<sub>1</sub>’, but we have no information on C<sub>2</sub>’ or F. Given the premature nature of our understanding, we agree with the reviewers in that developing a model is beyond the scope of this study.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40664-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reconcile discrepancies and apparent inconsistencies in the data</p><p>The authors should address the apparent inconsistency between the effect of the γ1 subunit on FRET and its predicted effect on VSD activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this apparent inconsistency. We agree that it was not adequately discussed in the manuscript. It is correct that, in the simplest scenario of the HA allosteric model, “a large shift in VSD half activation voltage when channels are open” (reviewer #3) would be expected. However, we would argue that a precise understanding of the allosteric coupling between the VSD and the pore, defined by D, should arise from the gating currents and their charge distributions and how they relate to the G-Vs and the presence or absence of γ1. We have had access to unpublished data, kindly provided by Carrasquel-Ursulaez and Latorre, showing gating currents, Q-V and G-V distributions in the presence and absence of gamma 1 subunit. Their findings support our statement “Analogously, no change in the voltage dependence of <italic>E</italic> was observed after co-expression of BKα with the γ1 subunit, which shifts the voltage dependence of pore opening by enhancing its allosteric coupling with the voltage sensor activation (Yan and Aldrich, 2010). As with the mutation F315A, the presence of γ1 subunit produces a minor shift in the Q-V distributions, not paralleling the large shift in the G-V curves (Carrasquel-Ursulaez and Ramon Latorre, personal communication).”, which has been included in the revised manuscript version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As well as discrepancies between some of the results and data previously published.</p><p>Results which seem to contradict earlier results include: a) GV shift magnitude of F315A in 100 Ca<sup>2+</sup>;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our results show smaller G-V shifts than those previously reported. The mutation F315A used in our study was introduced in the background of a human BK channel (GenBank accession no. U11058) construct, and is equivalent to the F380A mutant described in the Carrasquel-Ursulaez article, 2015. The differences in the observed G-V curves may be due, at least in part, to the use of different electrophysiological protocols and conditions than those described in Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., specifically: 1) we use 300 ms long pulses instead of the 2 ms pulses used by Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al. 2) We use 40 mM symmetrical K<sup>+</sup> rather than 110 mM K<sup>+</sup> used by Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al. In addition, our construct has a fluorescent protein inserted. To what extent any of these differences contribute to a smaller shift in the GV, we do not know. We do not think this is a major issue, because we do observe large shifts (between ∆V<sub>half</sub> of +100 to +200 mV, depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations) in the mutant, which are not accompanied by a shift in the <italic>E</italic>-V, and that is what it is important for this work. We have added a note in the legend of Figure 2 to make the reader aware of this apparent discrepancy: ‘It should be noted that the extent of the shifts induced by the mutation are smaller than previously reported (Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015), which could arise from the different experimental conditions and/or our fluorescent construct.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Lack of a GV shift for the β3Nβ1 construct;</p></disp-quote><p>We are slightly puzzled by this comment. Data shown in Figure 3D indicate that β3Nβ1 induces a negative shift of the <italic>E</italic>-V curve. This is consistent with the Q-V data by Castillo et al., 2015; Figure 3 and Table S2, showing Q-V data for the different chimeras). To our knowledge, no G-V curves analysis data is shown in that paper. Why should we expect a shift in the G-Vs? Most amino acids of this chimera are from β3b, with just a few from the intracellular N-terminus of β1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Whether they have adequate expression of β3b.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation. First, we would like to state that we do have adequate expression of β3b. β3b RNA was always co-injected at molar ratios that were 25X larger that the BKa RNAs. This information is now provided in the Materials and methods section: ‘Auxiliary subunits (β3b, γ1 and chimera β3bNβ1) were co-injected with the BK667CFP/BK667YFP RNA mix at a 5:1 weight ratio, giving molar ratios above 20:1.’. To convince Dr, Lingle, we provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> comparing the ionic currents obtained after co-expressing β3b plus non-fluorescently labelled BKα subunits (WT BKα) and β3b plus the BK667CY construct. Each panel showing ionic currents corresponds to a different construct indicated at the top. In each panel, current trace in black represents the ionic current in response to the most positive voltage step (+240 mV). These data show that when β3b is co-expressed with WT BKα we observe no difference with the effect described in the literature (e.g., Xia et al., 2000). Note that there is not an effect of blockade on the tail currents (see also G-Vs on the right, in yellow). Once β3b is co-expressed with the BK667CY construct, the kinetics of inactivation changed. It appears as if the off rate of inactivation is largely increased at positive potentials. Note also that there is a substantial current reduction at the tails as blockade increased with very positive potentials (see also G-V in blue). We use this behavior as an indication of β3b expression. The simplest interpretation is that the insertion of the fluorescent protein interferes with the kinetics of blockade mediated by the β3b NH2-terminal region (Lingle et al., 2001). Understanding this discrepancy will require further study. In any event, we consider this issue not affecting our conclusions. In this context, we agree that the main text needed to be modified to: ‘First, we co-expressed BK667CY α subunits with β3b and observed the expected inactivation of the ionic currents at positive potentials, yet with different blockade kinetics (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1) (Uebele et al., 2000; Xia et al., 2000; Lingle et al., 2001). […] The simplest interpretation is that the insertion of the fluorescent protein interferes with the kinetics of blockade mediated by the β3b NH2-terminal region (Lingle et al., 2001). Understanding this discrepancy will require further study.’</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40664-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
