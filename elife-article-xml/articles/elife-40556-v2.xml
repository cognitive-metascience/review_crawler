While much is known about how lineage-specific genes are activated to generate distinct cell types, the mechanisms driving suppression of stemness are far less understood. To address this, we examined the regulation of the transcriptional network that maintains progenitor identity in avian neural crest cells. Our results show that a regulatory circuit formed by Wnt, <italic>Lin28a</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs controls the deployment and the subsequent silencing of the multipotency program in a position-dependent manner. Transition from multipotency to differentiation is determined by the topological relationship between the migratory cells and the dorsal neural tube, which acts as a Wnt-producing stem cell niche.

This requires the coordination of activating and repressive regulatory mechanisms, which act together to drive overarching changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson, 2009</xref>). In the past decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding how the activation of lineage-specific genes generates distinct cell types. In contrast, we know far less about how progenitor cell identity is silenced during cell fate commitment. Inhibitory mechanisms are crucial for terminal differentiation since silencing of multipotency networks precedes activation of lineage-specific factors and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalkan and Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moris et al., 2016</xref>). Repression also plays an essential role in adult tissue homeostasis. Anomalous reactivation of embryonic regulatory programs in somatic tissue has been shown to underlie tumorigenesis and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their importance in development and disease, the mechanisms that suppress stemness and multipotency remain elusive.</p><p>Here, we used the cranial neural crest as a model to examine how stem cell identity is regulated during differentiation. This multipotent cell population contributes to numerous tissues and organs in vertebrate embryos, including the craniofacial skeleton, peripheral nervous system, and pigmentation of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Douarin, 1982</xref>). Neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube to engage in extensive migration throughout the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). As these cells move away from the neural tube, they undergo drastic changes in their transcriptional identity, and transition from multipotent progenitors to committed cell types. The formation and differentiation of the neural crest is controlled by a complex gene regulatory network, composed by multiple signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meulemans and Bronner-Fraser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betancur et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of the early components of this network defines the neural crest stem cell population that resides within the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lignell et al., 2017</xref>). This set of genes, which includes neural crest markers and pluripotency factors, endows the neural crest stem cells with their unique features, such as multipotency and self-renewal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40556.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in <italic>Lin28a</italic> levels impact neural crest development in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Neural crest migration during avian development.

This circuit functions in a position-dependent manner, promoting multipotency in the early neural crest cells and controlling the transition to differentiation in the late-migrating cells. In the premigratory neural crest, canonical Wnt signaling directly activates <italic>Lin28a</italic> transcription, resulting in the inhibition of <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA activity. As neural crest cells migrate away from the Wnt source, <italic>let-7</italic> levels increase, and these miRNAs target and silence multiple components of the neural crest gene regulatory network. As a result, the early network collapses and stem cell identity is suppressed. Thus, we propose that the changes in the topological relationship between the neural crest and the dorsal neural tube drive the transition from multipotent stem cell to differentiated cell type. Our model integrates signaling, transcription and post-transcriptional regulation to clarify how positional information ultimately affects gene network topology and stem cell identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic expression of Lin28a during neural crest development</title><p>The developmental program controlling the formation of neural crest cells is encoded in a modular transcriptional gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meulemans and Bronner-Fraser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betancur et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), in which the early modules mediate neural crest induction and specification, while the later modules regulate their ability to migrate and differentiate into diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meulemans and Bronner-Fraser, 2004</xref>). A large part of the early gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) consists of factors that maintain neural crest cells in a multipotent state, such as <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>FoxD3, Ets1</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, and <italic>Sox5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Douarin and Dupin, 2016</xref>).

To examine how stem cell identity changes during cell commitment, we quantified the expression levels of these factors during different stages of embryonic development.

Neural crest cells transfected with a <italic>Lin28a</italic> expression vector were sorted through FACS, and their expression profile was compared to wild-type neural crest through RT-PCR. This analysis revealed that migratory cells constitutively expressing <italic>Lin28a</italic> maintained expression of neural crest stem cell factors even at stages when these genes would normally be downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We confirmed these results by performing immunohistochemistry for Pax7 and FoxD3 following <italic>Lin28a</italic> gain-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–h</xref>). This maintenance of early neural crest factors resulted in a delay in differentiation, as evidenced by a decrease in the expression of ectomesenchymal, neuronal and glial markers in late migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2i</xref>). This is consistent with the possibility that <italic>Lin28a</italic> acts to prevent the silencing of the multipotency network that precedes cell differentiation.</p><p>In the reciprocal experiment, we tested the effects of premature downregulation of <italic>Lin28a</italic> in neural crest stem cells. To this end, we performed bilateral electroporations to transfect embryos with a <italic>Lin28a</italic> translation-blocking morpholino on the right side (green), and a control morpholino (blue) on the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). This treatment resulted in a strong knockdown of <italic>Lin28a</italic> protein in the morpholino-transfected side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>). Loss of <italic>Lin28a</italic> resulted in decreased expression of neural crest markers <italic>FoxD3 and Sox10,</italic> as shown by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>) and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e–h</xref>). Immunohistochemistry for phospho-histone H3 and Caspase-3 confirmed that this phenotype was not due to changes in cell cycle exit or cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c,f–g</xref>). Microdissection of dorsal neural folds of targeted embryos allowed for the quantification of the phenotype with RT-PCR, which revealed a significant decrease in the expression of the neural crest markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To confirm this phenotype, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and RNA interference (using Dicer-substrate siRNAs, DsiRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2005</xref>) to disrupt <italic>Lin28a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3i–m</xref>).

Finally, DsiRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Lin28a</italic>, but not of <italic>Lin28b</italic>, resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>FoxD3</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3n–o</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate possible long-term consequences of <italic>Lin28a</italic> knockdown in neural crest derivatives, we employed electroporation of morpholinos combined with a cornish pasty culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagai et al., 2011</xref>), which allows for long-term incubation of electroporated embryos <italic>ex ovo</italic>. Bilaterally-injected morphant embryos were cultured until stage HH15 so that we could observe the formation of cranial ganglia. Immunohistochemistry with neuronal marker Tuj1 revealed that knockdown of <italic>Lin28a</italic> resulted in dispersed ganglia with abnormal condensation. In particular, we observed a marked reduction in the maxillomandibular lobe of the trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4j–o</xref>). This phenotype is consistent with previous studies that highlight the requirement of neural crest cells for timely ganglion condensation and accurate establishment of neuronal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shiau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamburger, 1961</xref>).

Our observation that Lin28a manipulation impacts the neural crest transcriptional network suggests that this factor may regulate some of the stem cell properties that characterize this cell population. To directly test if Lin28a promotes neural crest multipotency, we examined how manipulating its expression affects the developmental potential of individual progenitors, using single-cell lineage analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sieber-Blum and Cohen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trentin et al., 2004</xref>). Neural crest cells from quail embryos transfected with <italic>Lin28a</italic> (or the empty PCI-H2b:RFP vector) were cultured in sparse conditions, such that single progenitor could form clonal colonies of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). After a ten-day incubation period in a standard culture medium, individual cells gave rise to colonies that were composed of multiple differentiated derivatives, which were identified based on cell morphology and molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). The somatic cell types observed included the typical neural crest derivatives, such as neurons (N), glia (G), melanocytes (M), chondroblasts (C) and smooth muscle cells (S). Quantification of cell types in colonies from the control and experimental groups revealed a six-fold increase in multipotent (that generated four or more cell types) neural crest cells after transfection with a Lin28a expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Furthermore, while mock-transfected neural crest cells were biased towards a glial fate (60% of the total progeny), the experimental group had a more uniform distribution of derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Consistent with this, classification of neural crest progenitors according to their developmental potentials revealed a larger percentage of multipotent progenitors (like GCMS progenitors, which give rise to glia, chondroblasts, melanocytes and smooth muscles), when compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

The 3’ UTR reporters for <italic>FoxD3</italic>, <italic>Pax7</italic>, and <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i–j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,f</xref>), which have <italic>let-7</italic> target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), showed decreased activity when they were co-transfected with the <italic>let-7</italic> mimic. In contrast, the reporters for <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Sox8</italic> and Zic1 UTRs, which lack target sites for the microRNAs, were unaffected by the gain-of-function assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,d–e</xref>). To further test the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in the silencing of early neural crest genes, we compared endogenous FoxD3 protein expression with the activity of the enhancer that controls its expression in migratory cells (<italic>FoxD3NC2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simões-Costa et al., 2012</xref>). We found that FoxD3 protein expression rapidly decreased during migration, while enhancer activity did not significantly change between neural crest cells close to the neural tube and those that had further migrated out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g–j</xref>). This indicates that post-transcriptional regulation, which is absent from the enhancer construct, is necessary for timely silencing of components of the gene regulatory network.</p><p>To demonstrate the importance of <italic>let-7</italic> target sites for the endogenous regulation of neural crest genes, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. A Cas9/eGFP expression vector containing gRNAs targeted to <italic>let-7</italic> sites within the 3’UTR of <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>FoxD3</italic> where transfected in gastrula stage chick embryos with bilateral electroporation (the control side was transfected with Cas9/eGFP only. Transfected cells from the control and experimental sides of single embryos were isolated with FACS at HH12, and analyzed with RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1k</xref>). Targeting of individual <italic>let-7</italic> sites in both the <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>FoxD3</italic> loci resulted in a mild but consistent increase in the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), at the stages that they are normally downregulated; a control gRNA (gRNA4) targeting a region of the <italic>FoxD3</italic> UTR devoid of let-7 miRNAs sites had no effect on gene expression. These results indicate that <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs orchestrate the silencing of progenitor cell identity by directly repressing critical network nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). We speculate that these inhibitory interactions propagate in a domino-like fashion throughout the network, resulting in its collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Wnt signaling regulates multipotency in a position-dependent manner</title><p>The above results show that the dynamics of Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> activity regulate multiple targets of the early neural crest transcriptional network. To explore the upstream regulators of the Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> axis, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Lin28a</italic> in neural crest cells. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) performed in sorted neural crest cells revealed eleven non-coding regions of open chromatin in the <italic>Lin28a</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The sequence of this enhancer, which is conserved in amniotes, contains four TCF/LEF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting regulation by canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, Lin28a protein expression was strongest in the dorsal neural tube, a known source of Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hollyday et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>). To test whether Wnt-signaling directly regulates <italic>Lin28a</italic> in neural crest cells, we first mutated the four TCF/LEF binding sites in <italic>Lin28E1</italic>. This resulted in complete loss of enhancer activity specifically in neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>), and also prevented enhancer association with Wnt-effector Lef1 in enhancer pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Second, we conducted loss-of-function experiments by disrupting Wnt signaling using morpholinos targeting two Wnt ligands expressed in the dorsal neural folds, Wnt1 and Wnt4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>). This knockdown reduced expression of both endogenous <italic>Lin28a</italic> and <italic>Lin28E1</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Moreover, loss of Wnt signaling resulted in increased levels of mature <italic>let-7s</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that Lef1 and nuclear b-catenin (Ctnnb1) are associated with <italic>Lin28E1</italic> in neural crest cells, indicating that canonical Wnts are directly regulating <italic>Lin28a</italic>.

We hypothesize that a Wnt-mediated stem cell niche in the dorsal neural tube activates <italic>Lin28a</italic> expression in neural crest cells, thereby protecting the stem cell regulatory network from <italic>let-7</italic> mediated repression. If this assumption is correct, neural crest cells should exhibit a reduction in Wnt-activation and an increase in <italic>let-7</italic> activity as they migrate away from the neural tube. To test this, we measured nuclear β-catenin (<italic>Ctnnb1)</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> sensor fluorescence as a function of distance from the neural tube in single migratory neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). Consistent with our prediction, the analysis revealed a decrease in Wnt activity and increased <italic>let-7</italic> mediated repression during migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k–l</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that the topological relationship between a neural crest cell and the Wnt niche determines the balance of Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> activity, which in turn modulates the early transcriptional network. Thus, we expanded the Wnt niche beyond the dorsal neural tube by ectopically expressing Wnt1 in migratory neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>, increased <italic>Axin2</italic> transcript levels confirmed over-activation of the pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jho et al., 2002</xref>). As predicted, we found that migrating neural crest cells constitutively expressing Wnt1 have higher levels of <italic>Lin28a</italic> and lower <italic>let-7</italic> activity. The expansion of the Wnt niche also prevents silencing of early neural crest factors <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>FoxD3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m</xref>). Furthermore, this maintenance of stem identity resulted in suppression of differentiation, as Wnt gain-of-function resulted in lower expression levels of drivers of ectomenchymal differentiation <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Alx1</italic>, and <italic>Barx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>).

Hence, it is a powerful <italic>in vivo</italic> model to explore how environmental cues and transcriptional identity are integrated during cell state transitions. In this study, we examine neural crest development to characterize a mechanism linking positional information and the remodeling of gene regulatory networks that control multipotency. According to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5n</xref>), high levels of Wnt ligands produced by the dorsal neural tube activate <italic>Lin28a</italic> transcription in neural crest stem cells. The high levels of the <italic>Lin28a</italic> in turn inhibit <italic>let-7</italic> activity, protecting the neural crest transcriptional network from repression by these miRNAs. As neural crest cells migrate away from the Wnt source, <italic>Lin28a</italic> levels are significantly reduced, resulting in an increase of mature <italic>let-7</italic> levels and subsequent repression of multipotency factors. This inhibition of crucial network nodes results in silencing of the neural crest gene regulatory network and loss of stem cell identity.</p><p>Wnt is a major modulator of neural crest identity, acting reiteratively during the formation and differentiation of this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raible and Ragland, 2005</xref>). Our results indicate that canonical Wnt signaling acts via the Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> axis to promote neural crest multipotency. Our model elucidates how this sginaling system provides developing cells with spatial information during cell fate restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). As neural crest cells migrate away from the dorsal neural tube, we observe a gradual decrease in the activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>), which underlies silencing of neural crest progenitor identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These spatial dynamics suggest an interesting parallel to the classic niche models in stem cell biology, in which the microenvironment provides signals that endow progenitor cells with broad potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). Our results indicate that the dorsal neural tube is an important signaling center in the embryo, acting to maintain neural crest stem cells in a multipotent state. The Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> axis is a crucial component of this mechanism. Little was known about the role of <italic>Lin28a</italic> in neural crest development before our analysis; previous work showed that <italic>Lin28a</italic> and its paralog, <italic>Lin28b</italic>, are dynamically expressed during amniote embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yokoyama et al., 2008</xref>), and in vitro experiments suggest that these factors play a role in neurogliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balzer et al., 2010</xref>). Here we identify an essential function of <italic>Lin28a</italic> factor during the early stages neural crest development, which is consistent with its role as a regulator of pluripotency in stem cells and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shyh-Chang and Daley, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We postulate that this regulatory mechanism is independent of the role of Wnts in neural crest induction and specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Castro et al., 2002</xref>), and its later function as a driver of differentiation into melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorsky et al., 1998</xref>) and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Neural crest cells display specific responses to Wnt manipulations performed at distinct stages of development, both before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Castro et al., 2002</xref>) and after specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hari et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we believe our model is compatible with the previous studies that show a requirement of canonical Wnts in cell fate decisions. While we still have a limited understanding of the mechanisms that compartmentalize the distinct functions of the pathway, time-controlled studies have shown that timing of intracellular response is crucial for specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hari et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that Lin28 activation by Wnts is established very early in neural crest progenitors and that this interaction is lost as the response to the pathway is attenuated during migration. In birds, neural crest cells form two waves of migration, with the melanocytic subpopulation delaminating later than the chondrocytic and neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erickson and Goins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999</xref>). While we hypothesize that the Wnt-Lin28/<italic>let-7</italic> circuit operates in all neural crest cells, further experiments will be necessary to clarify how the Lin28/<italic>let-7</italic> axis operates in these subpopulations, which can differentiate at distinct positions relative to the dorsal neural tube.</p><p>Our findings also clarify how intricate regulatory programs can be rapidly silenced during cells state transitions. Studies in the neural crest gene network have revealed numerous positive interactions that act to stabilize progenitor cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>). Indeed, the presence of positive regulatory loops is a common feature of developmental regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson and Levine, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the identity of a progenitor cell is transient by definition, and thus the network has to collapse as cells differentiate. This rapid silencing of progenitor identity during differentiation is evident in our quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), which shows that the majority of the components of the network are only transiently expressed, being downregulated as the cells migrate away from the neural tube. Genes that are interlinked by positive interactions are still progressively lost as cells migrate ventrally. For instance <italic>Pax3/7</italic> has been shown to activate itself to stabilize and maintain neural crest identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plouhinec et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Tfap2a</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic> form a positive feedback loop in neural crest cells, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luo et al., 2003</xref>) which may explain the rapid increase in expression of these factors during neural crest specification. <italic>SoxE</italic> factors are also known to partake and auto-regulatory loops in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mead et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Donnell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honoré et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, there is a disconnect between the logic encoded in network architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>) and plasticity of cell identity observed in vivo.</p><p>We address this by identifying a post-transcriptional mechanism that is able to override positive regulatory interactions, silencing the neural crest gene regulatory network. Our experiments indicate that in the absence of <italic>Lin28a</italic>, the expression of mature <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–e</xref>), reaching levels that are sufficient to inhibit neural crest stem cell identity. This is due to the fact that the <italic>let-7</italic> target genes identified in our UTR-reporter assay represent critical nodes of the network that are involved in the regulation of multiple neural crest genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>). <italic>Pax3/7, FoxD3</italic> and <italic>cMyc</italic> are stem cell factors and <italic>bona fide</italic> markers of neural crest cells, which play central roles in induction and specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dottori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnakumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerosuo and Bronner, 2016</xref>). These factors are also part of a group of genes that define neural crest stem cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lignell et al., 2017</xref>) located within the Wnt niche. Our demonstration that a Wnt-Lin28a/<italic>let-7</italic> regulatory circuit is able to modulate this regulatory program highlights how gene networks can be extensively remodeled during cell state transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse Anti-Lin28a</td><td valign="top">DSHB Cat #

Embryos were incubated until stage HH9. After electroporation efficiency was confirmed, embryos were dissected in Ringer's solution (n = 4 embryos per sample). Nuclear protein extracts were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Lin28E1</italic>, and <italic>MUT Lin28E1</italic> were PCR amplified from pTK-eGFP vectors using a biotinylated forward primer (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’-AAAATAGGCTGTCCCCAGTG-3’</named-content>) and an untagged reverse primer (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’-ATATTTCTTCCGGGGACACC-3’</named-content>). Immobilization of nucleic acids was performed using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Invitrogen, #2023-11-30) following manufacturer’s protocol. For enhancer pull down, nuclear protein extracts were diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10% Glycerol, 0.25% NP-40 supplemented with 10 ug Poly(dI-dC) and incubated with biotinylated DNA coated Dynabeads for 90 min in rotation at 4°C. Magnetics beads were washed four times in with Washing Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.25% NP-40), and proteins eluted in RIPA modified buffer containing 1x Sample Reducing Agent and 1x LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen, #B0009 and #B0007) for 15 min at 80°C and 1400 rpm. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus mini gels (Invitrogen, #NW04120BOX), followed by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes using Monoclonal anti FLAG antibodies (Sigma, #A8592).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantification of wnt and let-7 activity in single neural crest cells</title><p>To measure levels of activation of the canonical Wnt pathway and <italic>let-7</italic> sensor activity in single neural crest cells, we conducted confocal microscopy of 5 µm embryo midbrain sections immunostained for β-catenin (Ctnnb1) and mCherry (<italic>let-7</italic> sensor). For image analysis, ImageJ software was used to quantify fluorescence intensity of individual neural crest cells within sections. To estimate <italic>let-7</italic> activity in neural crest cells, we measured mCherry intensity in <italic>Tfap2aE1</italic> positive cells. The perimeter of each neural crest cell was defined by expression of the enhancer. To quantify the activity of the canonical Wnt pathway, we measured the presence of β-catenin in nuclei of neural crest cells (DAPI was used to define the nucleus). The distance between each cell examined, and a fixed point on the dorsal neural tube was also measured. The distance from the dorsal neural tube was plotted linearly vs the fluorescence intensity of nuclear β-catenin or vs the <italic>let-7</italic> sensor intensity. A line of best fit was applied to the data to examine the correlation between migration and the levels of canonical Wnt and <italic>let-7</italic> activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Quantification of NC2-mCherry-PEST reporter activity and FoxD3 protein levels in migrating neural crest cells</title><p>For assessing the correlation between enhancer activity and protein levels of FoxD3, HH4 chick embryos were electroporated with a <italic>FoxD3- NC2</italic> enhancer driven mCherry-PEST reporter construct, which is active in cranial migratory NC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simões-Costa et al., 2012</xref>). These embryos were subsequently incubated until HH12, and whole embryo immunostaining was performed for FoxD3. The embryos were embedded and cryosectioned, and single cell measurement of enhancer reporter fluorescence and the FoxD3 antibody was performed with 5 µm embryo midbrain sections. Image analysis and quantification was performed using ImageJ as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>At least 10 embryos were analyzed in immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization assays performed downstream of genetic perturbations experiments. For 3’-UTR reporter assay and <italic>let-7</italic> sensor activity assay, five embryos were analyzed per reporter construct or per developmental stage, respectively. ChIP experiments were repeated three times, and the results of a representative experiment are shown in the figures. To assess the long term consequence of Lin28a knockdown, Cornish pasty culture and subsequent analysis of trigeminal ganglia formation was performed for atleast six embryos. Single-cell quantification of canonical Wnt and <italic>let-7</italic> activity was performed in ~100 cells in three embryos, with consistent results. The Nanostring experiments were performed with 3 replicates of the <italic>let-7</italic> gain-of-function (3 experimental and 3 controls) and 2 replicates of <italic>Lin28a</italic> loss-of-function experimental conditions (2 experimental and 2 controls). The <italic>n</italic> values and <italic>p</italic> values of all quantitative experiments are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Student’s t-test (one-tailed) was performed to calculate p-values and p&lt;0.05 were considered to be significant. Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate p-values for 3’-UTR reporter and <italic>let-7</italic> sensor activity assay, given the non-parametric and non-Gaussian distribution of intensity values of cells analyzed in the assays.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are indebted to Carol Bayles and Adam Paul Wojno for cell-sorting assistance at the BRC Flow Cytometry Cell Sorting Facility at Cornel University.

We agree with the reviewers that our results indicate that there is no functional redundancy between <italic>Lin28a</italic> and <italic>Lin28b</italic> in avian neural crest development. To investigate this, we quantified the expression of <italic>Lin28b</italic> in FACS-sorted avian neural crest cells from different stages of development. We found that <italic>Lin28b</italic> expression levels in neural crest cells are very low when compared to <italic>Lin28a</italic>, and that the former is not enriched in this cell population. Furthermore, unlike <italic>Lin28a, Lin28b</italic> expression levels do not change during the transition from multipotency to differentiation, remaining low throughout neural crest development.

Furthermore we now employ RNAi interference (DsiRNAs, IDT – Kim et al., 2005) as an additional strategy to knockdown <italic>Lin28a</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 3N). In these assays, we employed two distinct DsiRNAs to confirm that knockdown of <italic>Lin28a</italic> mRNA results in reduction of expression of neural crest markers. We also employed DsiRNA knockdown to demonstrate that <italic>Lin28b</italic> loss-of function does not hinder neural crest specification (Figure 1—figure supplement 3O), which is consistent with the scenario discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Neural crest TFs vs. differentiation markers after Lin28 knockdown</p><p>The authors use a subset of neural crest transcription factors for qRT-PCR analysis in Figure 1 that are all downregulated during neural crest development and sensitive to enforced Lin28 expression.

The results show that sustained expression of <italic>Lin28a</italic> inhibits the expression of several differentiation markers of chondrocytic (<italic>Runx2, Alx1</italic> and <italic>Barx2</italic>), neuronal (<italic>Tuj1, HuC,</italic> and <italic>Mash1)</italic> and glial differentiation (<italic>Fabp7</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic>). These results, which are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2I, are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Lin28a</italic> promotes multipotency at the expense of differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that Lin28 is also expressed in the neural tube, and previous data demonstrates it is required for neural progenitor proliferation and cell cycle exit, an alternative explanation for the loss of neural crest markers Foxd3 and Sox10 after morpholino knockdown is loss of neural tube progenitors through inhibiting proliferation, cell cycle arrest or increased cell death. Along the same lines, the forced expression of the let-7a mimic could impact the proliferation or survival of neural tube/neural crest progenitors that leads to decreased FoxD3 levels. The authors should assess proliferation and survival of neural tube and neural crest progenitors after these manipulations to determine if these features cause the loss of neural crest numbers at later stages.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we assessed cell proliferation (with an Anti-phospho-Histone H3 antibody) and cell death (with a Caspase-3 antibody) in the neural tube, following treatment with the <italic>Lin28a</italic> morpholino and the <italic>let-7a</italic> mimic. Our results show that there is no significant change in proliferation or cell death in the neural tube or neural crest cells following these manipulations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-I). This indicates that the neural crest specification phenotypes we observe following these treatments are cell-autonomous. We believe discrepancy between these results and the changes in neural progenitor proliferation in the mouse <italic>Lin28a</italic> knockout model may be due to our stage-controlled loss-of-function strategies vs. a genetic null allele.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are there any physiological consequences in neural crest derivatives after manipulating the Lin28/let-7 axis? The authors show data supporting an effect of Lin28 or let-7 on early neural crest markers, but does this actually translate to an impact of neural crest lineages at later time points, such as loss of cartilage elements and cranial ganglia?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To address the consequences of <italic>Lin28a</italic> knockdown in neural crest derivatives we employed the Cornish pasty culture system (Nagai et al., 2011). This allowed us to culture morphant embryos until later stages of development (HH15), when we could assess how disruption of <italic>Lin28a</italic> expression affects the formation of the cranial ganglia. We found that the targeted side of the embryo had disorganized, smaller trigeminal ganglia – which in many instances lacked the maxillary and mandibular branches. This is consistent with previous findings that highlight the requirement of neural crest cells for timely ganglion condensation and accurate establishment of neuronal connections (Gammill et al., 2007; Stark et al., 1997). We have included these results in Figure 1—figure supplement 4J-O.</p><p>References:</p><p>L. S. Gammill, C. Gonzalez, M.
