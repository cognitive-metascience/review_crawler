molecular pumps ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life. While their structures have been widely reported, the kinetics governing their transport cycles remain largely unexplored. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an ABC exporter that extrudes a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and native substrates. Previously, the structures of MRP1 were determined in an inward-facing (IF) or outward-facing (OF) conformation. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to track the conformational changes of bovine MRP1 (bMRP1) in real time. We also determined the structure of bMRP1 under active turnover conditions. Our results show that substrate stimulates ATP hydrolysis by accelerating the IF-to-OF transition. The rate-limiting step of the transport cycle is the dissociation of the nucleotide-binding-domain dimer, while ATP hydrolysis per se does not reset MRP1 to the resting state. The combination of structural and kinetic data illustrates how different conformations of MRP1 are temporally linked and how substrate and ATP alter protein dynamics to achieve active transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>MRP1</kwd><kwd>single-molecule FRET</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HG010510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigatorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012007</institution-id><institution>Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Women and Science postdoctoral fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012007</institution-id><institution>Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Anderson Cancer Center postdoctoral fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wasserman</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Zachary Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Monique Weill-Caulier Career Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011034</institution-id><institution>Sidney Kimmel Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kimmel Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SinsheimerScholar Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conformational dynamics of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) are tracked in real time by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, which elucidate the rate-limiting mechanism of MRP1's transport cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that harnesses the energy of ATP to extrude substrates from the cytosol to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole, 2014a</xref>).

Structures of bovine MRP1 (bMRP1) have been determined by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) in three functional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Chen, 2018</xref>): an apo form in the absence of substrate and ATP, a complex with the native substrate leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> (LTC<sub>4</sub>) in the absence of ATP, and a structure of the hydrolysis-deficient E1454Q mutant determined in the presence of both LTC<sub>4</sub> and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These structures, in accord with decades of functional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole, 2014a</xref>) bring about the following understanding of the transport cycle. In the absence of ATP, MRP1 adopts an inward-facing (IF) conformation, in which the two NBDs are widely separated and the translocation pathway is open to the cytoplasm. Binding of LTC<sub>4</sub> at the center of the membrane, between TMD1 and TMD2, brings the two halves of the transporter closer together. Upon binding of ATP, the transporter adopts its fully NBD-closed configuration concurrent with opening of the translocation pathway to the outside. Meanwhile, the LTC<sub>4</sub>-binding pocket becomes deformed, no longer competent to bind substrate. In this outward-facing (OF) conformation, two ATP molecules are occluded at the NBD dimer interface: one in the catalytically inactive, degenerate site and the other in the active consensus site, poised for hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure-guided smFRET design for probing MRP1 dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of bMRP1 captured in ligand-free (left), LTC<sub>4</sub>-bound (middle), and ATP-bound (right) conformations (PDB accession numbers: 5UJ9, 5UJA, and 6BHU).

On the other hand, single-molecule techniques are well suited for tracking dynamic processes and have been applied to study a number of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudsmits et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Husada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we took a combined single-molecule and structural approach to investigate the kinetic mechanism that governs the transport cycle of MRP1. Based on prior structural information, we designed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments to track the conformational changes of bMRP1 in real time. Guided by the smFRET results, we then used cryo-EM to capture the most abundant structural configuration of wild-type (WT) MRP1 during active turnover. The synergy between the smFRET and cryo-EM studies has enabled us to determine the rate-limiting mechanism of MRP1 and how substrate and ATP modulate the kinetics of this important drug transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>smFRET design</title><p>Cryo-EM structures indicate that in the MRP1 transport cycle the two NBDs undergo large motions of association and dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To monitor the conformational dynamics of bMRP1 at the single-molecule level, we introduced two fluorophore labeling sites at the distal ends of NBD1 and NBD2. A 12-residue S6 peptide replaced residues 868–879, and a 12-residue A1 peptide was added to the C-terminus following residue V1530. Cy3 (donor) and LD655 (acceptor) fluorophores were orthogonally conjugated to bMRP1 using Sfp and AcpS synthases, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, a His<sub>10</sub>-tag was added at the N-terminus of TMD0 for surface immobilization. In solution, the fluorescently labeled bMRP1 hydrolyzed ATP at rates virtually identical to those of the unmodified WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating that insertion of the peptide tags and incorporation of the fluorophores did not alter the kinetics of bMRP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conformational distributions of MRP1</title><p>Using total-internal-reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we measured the steady-state distribution of FRET efficiency (<italic>E</italic>) for WT bMRP1 under five different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Addition of ATP and LTC<sub>4</sub> together with orthovanadate (Vi), a hydrolysis transition-state analogue, further promoted the high FRET state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then used the same labeling strategy to attach the FRET dye pair to the catalytically inactive E1454Q mutant bMRP1.

It also spontaneously accesses the OF conformation, albeit with lower frequency and shorter lifetime in the absence of nucleotides. Similarly, a recent smFRET study showed that the <italic>E. coli</italic> peptide transporter McjD also samples an NBD-dimerized state without nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Husada et al., 2018</xref>). Whether all of these ground-state conformations are functionally important requires further investigation.</p><p>When ATP is present, as in physiological conditions, the MRP1 transport cycle is a nonequilibrium process coupled to ATP hydrolysis. ATP binding accelerates the IF-to-OF transition (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) and slows down the reverse OF-to-IF transition (<italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>) by stabilizing the OF conformation. Substrate, such as LTC<sub>4</sub>, stimulates the ATPase activity through acceleration of the IF-to-OF transition (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>), but not ATP hydrolysis (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) or the subsequent OF-to-IF transition (<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>). In this model, the same high FRET value (<italic>E</italic> = 0.92) is produced by two distinct NBD-dimerized states: the pre-hydrolytic state in which two ATP molecules are bound and an asymmetric post-hydrolytic state bound with one ATP and one ADP. Still, the lifetime distributions of the <italic>E</italic> = 0.92 state can be fit with single-exponential decay functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a single slow step governing the OF lifetime. This is probably because ATP hydrolysis (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) is a fast step followed by a comparatively slow NBD dissociation step (<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>). The cryo-EM data further support that at physiological ATP concentrations (1–10 mM), the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of the NBD dimer subsequent to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Recent studies of P-glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bársony et al., 2016</xref>), TmrAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>), and TM287/288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutter et al., 2019</xref>) also indicated that in their respective transport cycles, the OF-to-IF transition is rate limiting.</p><p>The cryo-EM structure of MRP1 shows that the ATP hydrolysis step per se does not induce any conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One might then ask, what is the role of ATP hydrolysis in the transport cycle? Thermodynamically, the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis is necessary for uphill substrate translocation. Without energy dissipation, the system can only reach equilibrium, in which the substrate concentration is equal on both sides of the membrane. Kinetically, ATP hydrolysis provides directionality to the transport cycle: because <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> is much greater than the reverse isomerization rate <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>, estimated from the E1454Q cycling traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), the majority of molecules proceed to ATP hydrolysis upon NBD dimerization, followed by isomerization back to the IF conformation with a rate of <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>. Although the E1454Q mutant is catalytically deficient, it displayed transitions between IF and OF conformations with kinetics similar to the WT transporter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This apparent paradox can be explained by our kinetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): WT MRP1 predominantly takes the irreversible, hydrolysis-driven route (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> → <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> → <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>), while the E1454Q mutant takes the reversible pathway (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> ↔ <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>) that does not involve hydrolysis. The relative IF/OF occupancy is similar between WT and E1454Q MRP1 because <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> share similar values, even though the E1454Q mutant cannot power uphill substrate transport.</p><p>When correlating smFRET and cryo-EM data, one must keep in mind that each technique has its own limitations and is carried out under very different experimental conditions. For example, multiple apo states were detected by smFRET but our previous cryo-EM study revealed only one ligand-free structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Chen, 2017</xref>). This discrepancy suggests that smFRET could be more sensitive in detecting sparsely populated species than cryo-EM. Furthermore, the FRET experiments were carried out at 23°C, whereas the cryo-EM structure was determined at cryogenic temperature. We do not fully understand how the conformational distribution of molecules on the EM grids might change upon rapid freezing. However, it seems possible that the occupancy of the lowest energy state may become more dominant as a result of a smaller <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T in the Boltzmann distribution.</p><p>The kinetics of another ABC protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), have been well characterized through functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Csanády et al., 2019</xref>). CFTR is closely related to MRP1 as both belong to the ABCC subfamily of ABC transporters. However, it functions as an ion channel instead of an active transporter and is thus considered to be a ‘broken’ ABC transporter. The gating cycle of CFTR is generally similar to the transport cycle of MRP1: ATP binding stabilizes an NBD-dimerized conformation in which the pore is open to allow ion conduction, and ATP hydrolysis is followed by NBD separation and channel closure. However, the kinetic properties of CFTR, characterized through single-channel recordings, are markedly different from those of MRP1. In the CFTR gating cycle, the rate-limiting step is the formation of the NBD-dimerized conformation (equivalent to <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and ATP hydrolysis occurs much slower than NBD dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>). Do these differences reflect the general distinction between an active transporter and a passive channel? The answer awaits detailed kinetic characterization of other ABC transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

A total of 3993 movies were collected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cryo-EM image processing, model building, and refinement</title><p>Movie frames were corrected for gain reference and binned by two to yield a pixel size of 1.03 Å/pixel. Sub-frame alignment was carried out using MotionCor2, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). From 3604 micrographs, 1,143,729 particles were selected using Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link>). 2D classification was carried out in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>), and the best class averages contained 644,840 particles. Nearly all 2D class averages appeared to be in the outward-facing, NBD-dimerized conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). 3D classification with four classes was performed in RELION using the OF bMRP1-E1454Q map low-pass-filtered to 60 Å as a reference model. All four classes appeared to contain a closed NBD dimer. The best class of 257,107 particles was then subjected to a two-stage masked 3D refinement (initiated with a mask that included the micelle and entire protein and continued with a mask that excluded the micelle and TMD0), yielding a map at 3.8 Å. Iterative cycles of CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and masked 3D refinement in RELION were then performed. After several cycles of this process, masked 3D classification without alignment (using the angles from the most recent 3D refinement) was performed, yielding a best class of 81,078 particles. This subset was further subjected to iterative cycles of CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and masked 3D refinement in RELION, yielding a final map at 3.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To generate a reconstruction using all 1,143,729 particles, refinement was performed in Frealign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigorieff, 2016</xref>) using the map generated in the first stage of RELION refinement as the reference model. A global search was first performed using information to 8 Å, followed by several rounds of local search.</p><p>Model building and refinement were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Chen, 2018</xref>). The OF E1454Q model (PDB 6BHU) was rigid-body fit into the map using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and real-space refined in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The model was then subjected to iterative cycles of refinement in Refmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2015</xref>) and manual rebuilding in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) was used to assess the quality of the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The final model contains residues 203–268, 311–635, 641–870, and 942–1530, as well as one molecule of ATP, one molecule of ADP, two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, and three partial cholesteryl hemisuccinate molecules. R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub> values were calculated by generating a mask from the model with 2 Å padding, applying it to each of the half maps, and running zero cycles of refinement in Refmac against the working map (half-map 1, R<sub>work</sub>) and the free map (half-map 2, R<sub>free</sub>). Figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera and PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Comparisons between conditions were made in GraphPad Prism seven using unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests unless specified otherwise.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including László Csanády as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Markus A Seeger (Reviewer #2); Gergely Szakacs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In recognition of the fact that revisions may take longer than we typically allow, until the research enterprise restarts in full, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a highly interesting study in which the authors use single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to track the conformational changes of the asymmetric ABC transporter bovine Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in real time. Using Bayesian methods they identify five distinct molecular conformations of the transporter, and quantitate the life times spent in each of these states, as well as their dependences on ATP and substrate concentrations. In addition, the authors obtain a cryo-EM structure of MRP1 under active turnover conditions, and find that the majority of the particles is in an outward-facing (OF) conformation, although the ATP molecule bound at the active catalytic site has been hydrolyzed. The study provides two major functional conclusions: (i) substrate stimulates ATP hydrolysis by accelerating the IF-to-OF transition, and (ii) the rate-limiting step of the transport cycle is the dissociation of the nucleotide-binding-domain dimer, not ATP hydrolysis per se, as has been generally assumed. The paper is of broad general interest to the entire ABC protein field, and a pioneering example of exploiting optical methods for real-time single-molecule biophysics.</p><p>The reviewers were all enthusiastic about the unique combination of approaches used, and the potential that these techniques offer for deciphering mechanistic details of a transporter cycle at a molecular level. On the other hand, several important concerns were raised regarding the choice of experimental conditions, and the interpretation of the data in terms of a kinetic model. These should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the cryo-EM structure was obtained under active turnover conditions. On the other hand, the Materials and methods section (subsection “Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection”) states that the protein was incubated with ATP and LTC<sub>4</sub> for 10 minutes on ice, before flash-freezing. Considering the turnover rate at room temperature (Figure 1C, temperature not specified, but we assume it was RT), 10 minutes on ice may not allow the completion of the cycle, hence, it is questionable whether &quot;active turnover conditions&quot; were met. Furthermore, since the functional (FRET and ATPase) measurements were done at RT, a direct comparison of the structural and functional data is problematic (the various kinetic steps in the cycle are likely to have different temperature dependences, thus, the fractional times spent in IF and OF states are also most likely temperature dependent). The authors should clarify this important technical caveat.</p><p>2) There are several major inconsistencies among the kinetic parameters extracted from the functional data. These require a major re-thinking of the quantitative analysis. We can envisage two possible acceptable outcomes: (i) construction of a kinetic scheme that at least semi-quantitatively accounts for both the presented structural (cryo-EM) and functional (FRET and ATPase) data, or (ii) toning down the mechanistic conclusions and clearly spelling out apparent inconsistencies between the various data sets, pointing out that clarification of these will require further work. Below are some of the inconsistencies noted:</p><p>2.1) Figure 2A: For E1454Q in the presence of ATP+LTC<sub>4</sub> the relative occupancy of the OF state (fractional area under the magenta peak) is only ~40%. This seems inconsistent with the fact that under the same conditions a cryo-EM study on this mutant (Johnson and Chen, 2018) revealed a single dominant population of molecules in the OF conformation. The ~40% fractional occupancy of the OF state for E1454Q (Figure 2A) is also not consistent with the life times of the IF and OF states for this mutant, listed in Table 1: with t(IF)=7.7 s and t(OF)=31.7 s the mutant should spend 80% of its time in OF (i.e., at any point in time 80% of the population should be in OF).</p><p>Along the same lines, under conditions that allow catalytic turnover, all MRP1 molecules should be trapped with vanadate, whereas the FRET histograms for Vi/ATP/LTC<sub>4</sub> in Figure 2A also indicate the presence of several IF states.</p><p>How do the authors explain the prevalence of IF conformations in these conditions (E1454Q and WT+ATP+Vi)? Can the authors rule out that (at least some of) the IF1-4 conformations shown in Figure 2A represent either artifacts (wobbling of attached fluorophores?), or protein conformations that are not part of the physiological catalytic cycle? E.g., several studies have shown that a nucleotide is stably bound to NBD1. Do the authors assume that MRP1 adopts the IF conformations devoid of ATP in a physiologically relevant setting?</p><p>2.2) Based on Table 1, for FRET-labeled WT MRP1 the cycle time in the presence of saturating ATP and LTC<sub>4</sub> is T(cycle)=t(IF)+t(OF)=4.7s + 30.8 s = 35.5 s, which translates into a kcat of ~1.7/min. How do the authors reconcile these data with the kcat of ~11/min reported under identical conditions for FRET-labeled WT in Figure 1C?</p><p>2.3) There is a discrepancy between the effects of LTC<sub>4</sub> on kcat (Figure 1C) and IF/OF dwell times (Table 1). Based on Table 1, for WT MRP1 the total cycle time (T(cycle)=t(IF)+t(OF)) is 44.9 s in saturating ATP, but 35.5 s in saturating ATP+LTC<sub>4</sub>. This predicts only ~1.26x stimulation of kcat by LTC<sub>4</sub>, whereas a &gt;2x increase is reported in Figure 1C. (And the absolute kcat values calculated from the cycle times are much smaller than those in Figure 1C, see comment 2.2., above.)</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the E1454Q mutant is described as hydrolysis-deficient. However, in Figure 1C the activity of the mutant is only ~3x slower than WT in the absence, and ~10x slower than WT in the presence, of LTC<sub>4</sub>. How do the authors interpret this background ATPase activity? Does it reflect residual activity of the mutant or a minute contamination by a highly active ATPase? Please discuss.</p><p>4) The transition patterns shown in all four panels of Figure 3B appear highly symmetrical with respect to the y=x diagonal, even for the panels with ATP and ATP+LTC<sub>4</sub>. This suggests that the conformational changes are at equilibrium: there is no observable time-asymmetry. On the other hand, one would expect pronounced time asymmetry for the conformational transitions of an active transporter undergoing a unidirectional, non-equilibrium cycle associated with ATP hydrolysis. One possibility is that – with the fluorophores inserted into their current positions – FRET efficiency does not differentiate between functionally distinct states (e.g., between ATP/ATP-bound IF (pre-OF) and ATP/ADP-bound IF (post-OF), or between ATP/ATP-bound OF (pre-hydrolysis) and ATP/ADP-bound OF (post-hydrolysis)). Would it be feasible to introduce the FRET labels into a pair of positions that track motions around the active ATPase site more sensitively, so that, e.g., pre- and posthydrolytic OF states could be resolved? Alternatively, as the fractional occupancy of an intermediate is inversely correlated with its free energy, some functionally relevant states might have such short life times that they are not resolved by the assay. Pointing out these issues would provide further depth to the Discussion.</p><p>5) Please cite some earlier studies on other ABC proteins, that have arrived at similar conclusions. The conclusion that in MRP1 ATP hydrolysis occurs much faster than NBD separation is reminiscent to earlier observations on the bacterial ABC exporter TM287/288 (Hutter et al., 2019, PMID: 31113958). The conclusion that under active turnover conditions MRP1 spends the majority of its time in OF (i.e., the IF-&gt;OF transition is not rate limiting) is reminiscent to earlier observations on PgP (Barsony et al., 2016, PMID: 27117502).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56451.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the cryo-EM structure was obtained under active turnover conditions.

Because of the inherent difference between the cryo-EM and smFRET experimental conditions, we refrained from making a quantitative assertion of the kinetic scheme.

The histograms presented in Figure 2A are from a mixture of active and inactive molecules. The lifetimes listed in Table 1 are calculated from active molecules only. In our initial submission, the existence of this inactive population was briefly described in the Materials and methods. In the revision, we now include detailed analysis of the active versus inactive molecules in the main text. Please see the second paragraph of the subsection “Determinants of IF-to-OF transitions” and the accompanying Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding the functional relevance of the four IF states identified from the smFRET data, we show that IF<sub>1</sub> and IF<sub>2</sub> can directly transition to the OF state (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) and that IF<sub>3</sub> and IF<sub>4</sub> are also visited by active molecules under ATP turnover conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). These multiple FRET states could reflect either global TMD movements or local NBD mobility. It is less likely that the FRET changes are due to wobbling of the attached fluorophores, because the rate of solvent-accessible fluorophore tumbling is orders of magnitude faster than our imaging time resolution and would thus be averaged out during each frame acquisition (PMID: 25368432). Therefore, we believe that these IF states correspond to authentic protein conformations sampled during active transport rather than artifacts. Whether each of these states – especially IF<sub>3</sub> and IF<sub>4</sub> – are functionally important requires further investigation. We now discuss this point in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) Based on Table 1, for FRET-labeled WT MRP1 the cycle time in the presence of saturating ATP and LTC<sub>4</sub> is T(cycle)=t(IF)+t(OF)=4.7s + 30.8 s = 35.5 s, which translates into a kcat of ~1.7/min. How do the authors reconcile these data with the kcat of ~11/min reported under identical conditions for FRET-labeled WT in Figure 1C?</p></disp-quote><p>There are several factors that could contribute to the discrepancy between the ATP turnover rate determined from the single-molecule vs. bulk assay, now discussed in the subsection “Determinants of OF-to-IF transitions”.</p><p>1) The bulk ATPase assay was performed at 30 °C, while the smFRET data were collected at 23 °C.</p><p>2) The tethering of the bMRP1 protein to the slide surface in the smFRET assay may affect its activity to some extent. It is not uncommon that surface immobilization has an effect on protein dynamics in single-molecule studies. Nevertheless, the sensitivity displayed by surface-tethered MRP1 to ATP and substrate titrations (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) argues that the protein is still in its functional form.</p><p>3) The finite time resolution of the smFRET assay entails that the fastest fraction of IF-OF transitions may escape detection, making the apparent total cycle time longer than the true value. However, given the 300-ms frame rate and the average IF/OF lifetime (4.7 s for IF and 30.8 s for OF with saturating ATP and LTC<sub>4</sub>), we expect this effect to be minor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) There is a discrepancy between the effects of LTC<sub>4</sub> on kcat (Figure 1C) and IF/OF dwell times (Table 1).

(And the absolute kcat values calculated from the cycle times are much smaller than those in Figure 1C, see comment 2.2., above.)</p></disp-quote><p>This discrepancy may be explained by the same factors listed above in response to point #2.2. We now discuss the discrepancy between the smFRET and bulk ATPase assays in the revised manuscript (in the subsection “Determinants of OF-to-IF transitions”). We also refrained from making quantitative conclusions on the kinetic scheme but focused on general characteristics of the transport cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the E1454Q mutant is described as hydrolysis-deficient.

How do the authors interpret this background ATPase activity? Does it reflect residual activity of the mutant or a minute contamination by a highly active ATPase? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the background ATPase activity seen for the E1454Q mutant did not respond to LTC<sub>4</sub> stimulation, we attribute it to spontaneous ATP hydrolysis – independent of bMRP1 activity – that is always observed in this type of assay from our experience. We have now added this clarification to the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The transition patterns shown in all four panels of Figure 3B appear highly symmetrical with respect to the y=x diagonal, even for the panels with ATP and ATP+LTC<sub>4</sub>.

The main purpose of the transition density plot (TDP) analysis was to validate the assignment of the four distinct IF states from the noisy single-molecule FRET traces: if the states are properly identified, they should appear as well-resolved peaks in the TDP and the transition pattern should be symmetrical with respect to the diagonal under equilibrium conditions (apo and +LTC<sub>4</sub>). This is the case as shown in the original Figure 3B, suggesting that the idealization of FRET traces appropriately resolved the discrete states. An additional benefit of the TDP analysis is that it yields the characteristic lifetimes of IF states.</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, ATP drives the system out of equilibrium and should produce time asymmetry if the state path of the IF-to-OF transition differs from that of the OF-to-IF transition. However, because of the short lifetime of each IF state, the vast majority of transitions in the presence of ATP were still those among IF states. These fast transitions may have well approached equilibrium before the IF-to-OF isomerization. Because of the limited observation window at 25-ms time resolution and the long-lived OF states, the potentially asymmetrical, nonequilibrium transitions between IF and OF conformations make up only a small fraction of total transitions. Therefore, the TDPs, dominated by IF-IF transitions, still appear largely symmetrical even in the presence of ATP. This is further confounded by the aforementioned inactive population, which did not respond to ATP and likely remained at equilibrium. Unfortunately, it was not possible to distinguish between active and inactive molecules without the perturbation experiments conducted at 300-ms time resolution, which on the other hand obscured the fast transitions among IF states, and thus were unsuitable for TDP analysis.</p><p>We also agree with the other plausible explanation proposed by the reviewers for the apparent symmetrical TDP under nonequilibrium conditions, i.e. the smFRET assay did not resolve certain functionally distinct states that would break the symmetry. It is a common challenge in the single-molecule field to directly visualize transitions between pre- and post-hydrolytic states, especially when the catalytic step does not induce large-scale conformational rearrangements in the enzyme, as is the case for MRP1 (Figure 6). It may be possible to develop fluorophores that are sensitive to the chemical environment of the ATPase site. But such a resource is not yet widely available to our knowledge and would be outside the scope of this study. Moreover, given the finite time resolution of the assay, certain short-lived intermediates may have been missed. The fastest frame rate used in this work is 25 milliseconds, which was chosen to balance time-resolving power, signal-to-noise, and throughput.</p><p>Because of the uncertainties associated with the interpretation of TDPs for nonequilibrium conditions, we decide to only show TDPs for the equilibrium conditions (apo and +LTC<sub>4</sub>) as Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please cite some earlier studies on other ABC proteins, that have arrived at similar conclusions. The conclusion that in MRP1 ATP hydrolysis occurs much faster than NBD separation is reminiscent to earlier observations on the bacterial ABC exporter TM287/288 (Hutter et al., 2019, PMID: 31113958). The conclusion that under active turnover conditions MRP1 spends the majority of its time in OF (i.e., the IF-&gt;OF transition is not rate limiting) is reminiscent to earlier observations on PgP (Barsony et al., 2016, PMID: 27117502).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript as suggested (Discussion, third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
