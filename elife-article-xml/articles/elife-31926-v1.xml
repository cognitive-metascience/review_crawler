to limited subsets of malignancies. Here we identified a novel mechanism for VHL suppression in tumors that do not have inactivating mutations. Using developmental processes to uncover new pathways contributing to tumorigenesis, we found that Daam2 promotes glioma formation. Protein expression screening identified an inverse correlation between Daam2 and VHL expression across a host of cancers, including glioma. These in silico insights guided corroborating functional studies, which revealed that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing VHL expression. Furthermore, biochemical analyses demonstrate that Daam2 associates with VHL and facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these studies are the first to define an upstream mechanism regulating VHL suppression in cancer and describe the role of Daam2 in tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31926.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain cancer, and the rate of patient survival has not significantly improved over the past 70 years. This cancer arises when glial cells, which provide support and insulation to nerve cells, develop mutations that alter the activity of certain genes or alter the role they play in cells. However, there are also several key genes linked to glioblastomas that don’t exhibit mutations, such as the gene that encodes the Von Hippel Landau protein (or VHL for short). This protein normally helps to protect us from developing cancer, but it is not clear how this protein is prevented from performing this role in glioblastomas.</p><p>One possibility is that proteins that regulate how cells grow and develop may control VHL. For example, a protein called Daam2 plays a critical role in a signaling pathway that is required for glial cell development. Zhu et al. used biochemical techniques to study Daam2 and VHL in both human cells and mouse models of glioblastoma.</p><p>The experiments show that glioblastoma cells have lower levels of VHL compared to normal cells. This decrease is caused by Daam 2, which interacts with VHL and promotes its degradation. Further experiments found that in several different types of cancer, higher levels of Daam2 are linked with the presence of lower levels of VHL.</p><p>These findings indicate that the interaction between Daam2 and VHL could be a new target for drugs to treat glioblastoma and possibly other forms of cancer. Daam2 and VHL have also been linked to multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and other diseases that affect the nervous system. Therefore, understanding how these proteins interact may also help to develop new treatments for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 1508-08406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hyun Kyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP16019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS071153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP150334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS089366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The glial developmental factor, Daam2, promotes glioma tumorigenesis by degrading the VHL tumor suppressor, illustrating how dysregulation of gliogenic factors can impact tumor suppressor activity and promote glioma tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor suppressor and oncogenic pathways function in part by subverting existing cellular programs to promote cancer ‘hallmark’ properties that engender malignant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). This corruption of normal cellular physiology is mediated by aberrant activities of these tumorigenic pathways, which are predominantly driven by genetic mutation. Importantly, genetic mutation is not the sole source of this dysregulation, as changes in gene expression via promoter methylation or protein turnover can phenotypically resemble driver mutations and contribute to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esteller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hegi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pineda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinstein and Ciechanover, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Semenza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zöchbauer-Müller et al., 2001</xref>). While these broad regulatory processes have been linked to cancer, the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of key components of tumorigenic pathways are very poorly characterized.</p><p><italic>VHL</italic> is a key tumor suppressor that is mutated in Von Hippel-Landau disease, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome that often manifests as clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gossage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Kaelin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maher et al., 1990</xref>). VHL functions by binding to HIF1α and hydroxylated Akt and modulating their degradation and activity, respectively. Mutant forms of <italic>VHL</italic> associated with ccRCC are incapable of binding HIF1α or pAkt, resulting in stabilized expression and activation of these proteins, which ultimately facilitates tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaakkola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maxwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Min et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohh et al., 2000</xref>). While dysregulated HIF1α and pAkt are associated with most forms of cancer, mutations in VHL are found predominately in ccRCC. This dichotomy suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms oversee VHL dysregulation or inactivation in other malignancies. Indeed recent studies in glioma have shown that ID2 can interfere with VHL activity in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and that it’s subject to regulation by microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the upstream mechanisms that directly regulate <italic>VHL</italic> expression and protein turnover in cancer remain poorly defined.</p><p>One potential mode of tumor suppressor gene regulation is through developmental mechanisms. Developmental processes directly contribute to all forms of malignancy and are utilized by tumorigenic pathways to maintain cells in an undifferentiated and proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kesari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stiles and Rowitch, 2008</xref>). Given these established molecular and functional interactions, it stands to reason that expression of tumorigenic pathways may be reciprocally regulated by developmental mechanisms. However, whether such reciprocal regulation of tumor suppressor pathways by developmental factors contributes to tumorigenesis is poorly defined.</p><p>To investigate the interface between developmental programs and the regulation of tumor suppressor pathways, we used malignant glioma as a model system. As a molecular entry point for these studies, we focused on Daam2, a key developmental regulator that suppresses glial differentiation and also contributes to dorsal patterning in the developing CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Deneen, 2012</xref>). Here we found that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis in mouse and human models of malignant glioma. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that Daam2 and VHL expression is inversely correlated across a host of human malignancies. These in silico observations are corroborated by in vivo functional studies, which revealed that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing VHL expression. Mechanistically, we found that Daam2 associates with VHL and facilitates its degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. Together, these studies represent the initial characterization of Daam2 function in glioma and define, for the first time, an upstream regulatory mechanism that controls VHL protein expression in cancer. Moreover, because mutations in VHL are restricted to a limited set of malignancies, we have identified a new mechanism for VHL inactivation in tumors that do not have inactivating mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Daam2 is expressed in human and mouse glioma</title><p>Previously, we identified Daam2 as a component of the Wnt receptor complex that directly contributes to dorsal patterning in the embryonic spinal cord and oligodendrocyte differentiation during development and after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Deneen, 2012</xref>).

Together, these mechanistic studies reveal that the underlying biochemical relationship between Daam2 and VHL is mediated by ubiquitin-driven protein degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using factors critical for central nervous system (CNS) development as an entry point to identify new mechanisms that contribute to tumorigenesis, we found that the glial development factor, Daam2 promotes glioma tumorigenesis across human glioma cell lines and multiple mouse models of glioma. Protein screening and bioinformatics studies revealed that Daam2 and VHL expression is inversely correlated across a broad spectrum of cancers, while functional interrogation of this relationship demonstrated that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis via suppression of VHL expression. Mechanistically, Daam2 associates with VHL and stimulates its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these studies are the first to define an upstream mechanism regulating VHL protein turnover in cancer and describe the role of Daam2 in tumorigenesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Daam2 stimulates glioma tumorigenesis</title><p>Leveraging existing TCGA expression data across a broad spectrum of malignancies, we found that Daam2 is most highly expressed in glioma and melanoma. These expression characteristics in glioma were confirmed using tissue arrays and functional studies revealed that Daam2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in human and mouse glioma models. These are the first studies to describe the role of Daam-family proteins in tumorigenesis. Daam1 and Daam2 have highly conserved formin domains yet exhibit non-overlapping expression patterns in the developing CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Deneen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakaya et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting distinct functions during development. Indeed, Daam2 functions in this context via canonical Wnt-signaling, while Daam1 operates via the non-canonical Wnt, planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Deneen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). It will be important to discern whether this functional diversity between Daam1 and Daam2 is also applicable to CNS malignancies. Given that the PCP pathway has been implicated in tumor cell invasion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastas and Moon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weeraratna et al., 2002</xref>), it is possible that Daam-family proteins also contribute to these features of tumorigenesis. Recent studies have implicated Daam1, Daam2 and other formin-family genes in the migration of breast and neuroblastoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luga et al., 2012</xref>), respectively, suggesting that the Daam-family proteins may also contribute to invasion and metastasis in other malignancies.</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that Daam2 potentiates canonical Wnt signaling through the clustering of existing Wnt receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Deneen, 2012</xref>). While the Wnt pathway has been implicated in several forms of cancer, including medulloblastoma, mutations in key components of the Wnt-pathway and dysregulated Wnt-signaling has not been widely linked to low- or high-grade glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienz and Clevers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de La Coste et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lustig and Behrens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinfeld et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zurawel et al., 1998</xref>). This, coupled with the fact that Daam2 acts upon existing Wnt receptor complexes, may explain why we did not witness any overt changes in Wnt activity when we manipulated Daam2 expression in our glioma models. Nevertheless, we cannot formally rule out a possible role for Daam2 in canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling in glioma or in other malignancies driven by Wnt dysregulation.</p><p>Finally, our observations that Daam2 expression is increased in a majority of glioma tumors raises the question how it becomes dysregulated. One possibility is that it is actively regulated by transcription factors or microRNAs that are present in glioma. Currently, these mechanisms associated with Daam2 remain undefined and identifying them are key areas of future investigation that will shed new light on how developmental dysregulation influences tumorigenesis. Another possibility to consider is that Daam2 dysregulation is a passive by-product of its expression in a cell lineage that is over-represented in glioma. Daam2 is expressed in both glial lineages (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes), in both precursor and mature stages of development. Both of these lineages are present in one form or another within the bulk tumor, therefore its possible that elevated Daam2 expression is the result of its expression in analogous cell populations that comprise the primary, bulk tumor. Deciphering which scenario (passive or active) is responsible for Daam2 dysregulation in glioma is an important area of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>New parallels between development and cancer</title><p>Our observation that manipulation of Daam2 expression promoted tumorigenesis, but not canonical Wnt signaling, points to the possibility that it functions through a Wnt-independent mechanism. RPPA and bioinformatics approaches revealed that Daam2 expression is inversely correlated with a cohort of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), including VHL, across a broad spectrum of cancers. Moreover, the RPPA data analysis identified a larger cohort of proteins that were downregulated in the presence of Daam2 in our mouse model of glioma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, future studies may also be geared towards delineating the links between Daam2 and these other downregulated candidates (i.e. Claudin-7 and Syk, etc.) in the context of glioma and glial development. These observations, coupled with our findings that Daam2 associates with- and facilitates- the ubiquitination of VHL, suggest that it may also play a role in the ubiquitination pathway. The nature of this prospective relationship between Daam2 and the existing ubiquitination machinery, and whether these relationships are specific to malignancy or can be extended to development are areas of future investigation and represent potentially new parallels between development and cancer. Indeed dysregulation of ubiquitination is linked to protein aggregation associated with several neurological disorders, functioning through both neuronal and glial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jansen et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegde and Upadhya, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another feature of Daam2 is that it functions to suppress the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) during development and after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Studies in mouse models suggest that OPCs may serve as a cell of origin for glioma, while NG2-positive OPC populations are endowed with tumor initiating properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ligon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Persson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stiles and Rowitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sugiarto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yadavilli et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, OPCs have latent proliferative capacity that is essential for injury responses, suggesting parallels between the processes that drive injury responses and tumorigenesis. Indeed recent studies have linked the VHL-HIF1α signaling axis to OPC development and neonatal hypoxic injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). That Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis via suppression of VHL and also regulates OPC development and injury responses, suggests that it may also utilize these tumorigenic mechanisms in the context of injury. Together these findings add to the emerging evidence that OPC associated signaling networks play critical roles in glioma pathophysiology and further reinforce the parallels between neurological disorders and cancer biology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of VHL in cancer</title><p>Amongst the candidates identified in our RPPA screen, we chose to focus our studies on VHL because it’s a potent effector of tumorigenesis across many forms of cancer. Our mechanistic studies revealed that Daam2 promotes glioma tumorigenesis via suppression of VHL, a classic tumor suppressor that promotes HIF1α degradation and inhibits Akt activity. Importantly, inactivating mutations in VHL are predominately found in ccRCC and are very rare in most other forms of cancer, including glioma. These observations raise the critical question of how VHL becomes dysregulated in cancers that do not have these mutations. Our studies define a novel regulatory mechanism that operates upstream of VHL in cancer and provides additional insight into how its expression is extinguished in tumors that do not have inactivating mutations. Moreover, because Daam2-VHL expression demonstrates a robust, inverse correlation across a spectrum of cancers, this is likely to be a generalized mechanism of VHL suppression in cancer. Future areas of investigation include structure/function mapping of the Daam2-VHL domains in the context of ubiquitination, tumorigenesis, and HIF1α signaling.</p><p>Interestingly, prior studies in yeast have shown that VHL can be degraded via the Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperone system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClellan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melville et al., 2003</xref>). Given that Hsp’s are expressed across a host of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Morales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nylandsted et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sauvageot et al., 2009</xref>), it will be important to determine whether Daam2 engages the Hsp chaperone system to facilitate VHL degradation in glioma and other malignancies. Another intriguing possibility is whether VHL can reciprocally degrade Daam2 protein. Given that VHL functions as an E3 ligase and associates with Daam2, this may be another mechanism by which this complex operates. While we did not observe overt decreases in Daam2 protein levels in the presence of VHL (not shown), such a mechanism may be context or cell lineage specific, requiring additional co-factors or environmental conditions (i.e. hypoxia, etc.). Future studies in other cancer models and cell systems will be required to determine if this is the case.</p><p>Given its role as the central regulator of HIF1α, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory biology surrounding VHL and its role in glioma formation. Studies in glioma cell lines suggest that ID2 interference with VHL activity can deregulate HIF1α expression and promote tumorigenesis in xenograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, ID2 has also been linked to the suppression of OPC differentiation via direct regulation of cell cycle kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). These observations further reinforce the relationship between OPC development and glioma tumorigenesis and highlight key parallels between ID2 and Daam2 function across these systems, as both genes suppress VHL, inhibit OPC differentiation, and promote glioma tumorigenesis. Because both proteins associated with- and regulate- VHL, albeit via distinct mechanisms, it’s possible that these suppressive functions are coordinated and contribute tumorigenesis. From this, a model emerges where ID2 displaces VHL from the ubiquitin complex, which facilitates its association with Daam2 and its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. It will be important to decipher whether ID2 and Daam2 functions are in fact coordinated, and the extent to which Hsp proteins participate in this mechanism. Finally, understanding whether and how these prospective relationships are also applicable to OPC development and injury responses may also reveal new insights in CNS repair mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In situ hybridization on gliomas</title><p>To detect the expression of human Daam2, we generated mRNA probe and performed in situ hybridization on human gliomas.

Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor and three reviewers. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers felt that the manuscript was interesting but also raised many concerns that would require substantial revisions. These include better demonstration of Daam2 over-expression, confirmation of Daam2 loss of function, better descriptions of the glioblastoma lines, etc. I refer you to the reviews below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The report by Deneen and colleagues reports that coordinate regulation of Daam2 and VHL is observed in many cancers, and that Daam2 expression functions to increase tumorigenicity through suppression of VHL levels (ubiquitin-mediated degradation). The experiments are well executed and convincing.</p><p>How quantitative is the DAAM2 expression described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? It would be preferable to look at protein expression in tissue microarrays or perform real time quantitative RT-PCR for these analyses. In addition, it would be useful to compare normal tissue from the exact same location as the tumor whenever possible. This could be performed using mouse gliomas, and should be included to strengthen the importance to gliomas. For example, in the Barres atlas (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html), it appears as though Daam2 is robustly expressed in normal astrocytes.</p><p>What the developmental expression pattern of Daam2 in the mouse or human? Is it inversely correlated with VHL expression?</p><p>Does Daam2 overexpression increase proliferation or decrease apoptosis?</p><p>In the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, VHL was not the top candidate. How did the authors exclude the other compelling candidates, and why did they focus only on VHL?</p><p>In the TCGA datasets, is there a strong correlation between DAAM2 expression and HIF-1a expression?</p><p>One of the key points of the report is that DAAM2 requires VHL. While they demonstrate sufficiency, the necessity portion of this dependency is not as clearly revealed. What is the effect of VHL expression alone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>? One elegant way to demonstrate the dependency is to show that mutations that impair VHL-DAAM2 binding reverse the ability of DAAM2 to accelerate glioma growth in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Previous studies from the Deneen laboratory suggest that DAAM2 regulates Wnt signaling in oligodendrocytes. Was this pathway excluded in the context of tumorigenesis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript, entitled &quot;Daam2 Driven Degradation of VHL Promotes Gliomagenesis,&quot; Zhu and colleagues argue that Daam2 drives glioblastoma development in human and mouse models through a novel regulation of the VHL tumor suppressor. Daam2 overexpression in cells and mice associates with increased cell and tumor growth, while Daam2 depletion in glioma models significantly impairs tumor growth. While Daam2 has been reported to regulate the Wnt pathway by these investigators, they found a lack of association of Daam2 and Wnt here. Thus omic and protein array analyses led them to discover an inverse correlation of Daam2 expression and VHL. Accordingly, Daam2 expression induces HIF1 stabilization and Akt phosphorylation, two mechanistic consequences of VHL loss. The investigators go on to show that Daam2 plays a direct role in the regulation of VHL through a protein protein interaction and a consequent ubiquitylation of VHL. Together the studies identify a new and exciting role for Daam2 in glioma, and a new mechanism of VHL downregulation in cancer, which would have broad implications. The manuscript could be improved by a number of edits.</p><p>1) This is not the first study to show an upstream mechanism of VHL regulation in cancer. The authors correctly point out in their Discussion that ID2 has been shown to regulate VHL, there is also a miRNA story in the literature (Li, et al. 2017). Thus while these other observations do not take away from the story here, this point is overstated several times in the text and should be corrected. Likewise, a comment in the Discussion implies that absent of other alterations, it is unclear how VHL function is inactivated in cancer, and the simple answer is tumor hypoxia.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; high resolution pictures of Daam2 staining that are in the supplemental data should be included in the figure.</p><p>3) Better descriptions of the two GBM cell lines would be useful. Do these contain similar driver mutations as the mouse models? Also, quantification of the colony assays would be helpful, rather than simply a representative figure. Do the control cells form colonies at all? Given that they form tumors, one would expect so.</p><p>4) Quantification of IHC for example for CD31 would be more convincing than a single picture.</p><p>5) HIF elevation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and K</xref> begs the question as to whether HIF target genes are also elevated in cells with altered Daam2.</p><p>6) Can the authors speculate as to how Daam2 is functioning to facilitate VHL ubiquitylation? Is it an E3 ligase? Is there a domain structure of Daam2 that would support a hypothesis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Von Hippel-lindau protein is a tumor suppressor that, through conventional loss-of-function (i.e. germline deletion of one copy followed by somatic l.o.h.) gives rise to cancers of liver, kidney and vagina. In this manuscript, Zhu et al. make the provocative claim that Von Hippel-lindau (VHL) protein may be attenuated in a non-genetic way and thus contribute to a broader array of cancers than hitherto believed including malignant gliomas.</p><p>The point of departure for their work is an in silico survey showing an inverse correlation between expression of the glial developmental factor Daam2 and VHL in a wide variety of cancers including glioma. The authors go on to a set of functional studies with human glioma cell lines and mouse glioma models to show that Daam2 promotes glioma growth by suppressing VHL expression.

Unfortunately, the Daam2 antibodies at our disposal do not adequately stain human tissues, so we cannot perform the suggested immunostaining experiments. Because of this, we turned to qRT-PCR to assess expression of Daam2 in freshly resected human malignant glioma and adjacent white matter samples. RNA was isolated from the primary tumor and the associated, non-tumor white matter and we performed qRT-PCR, finding that Daam2 expression in glioma was elevated in three of the five samples we queried. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. That Daam2 exhibits heterogeneous expression across 5 glioma samples is consistent with the heterogeneous expression we found in the tissue microarrays and the TCGA analysis (TCGA – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Tissue Array now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Developmental expression of Daam2 in the mouse spinal cord can be found in Lee, et al. Neuron 2015. We also assessed expression in the post-natal and adult cortex, finding that Daam2 is also expressed in GFAP expressing astrocyte populations in both the developing and adult cortex.

It’s critical to characterize these features of our tumors. To measure proliferation we injected the tumor bearing mice with BrdU prior to harvesting; the extent of BrdU labeling was quantified via immunohistochemistry. These data were included in the original submission and can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J-L</xref>.</p><p>To assess changes in cell death, we stained these same tumors for Caspase3 and did not detect any changes in Caspase3 expression.

How did the authors exclude the other compelling candidates, and why did they focus only on VHL?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment, as explaining the logic underlying the selection of VHL is critical for a comprehensive understanding of our manuscript. As the reviewer can probably appreciate, selection criteria can be subjective and indeed, that is part of our explanation. VHL was selected, in part, because its role in glioma biology was not well understood and linking it to Daam2 might provide additional and novel insight into its role in this context. While VHL was not the top candidate, it did have the third highest correlation score and a very significant p-value. Moreover, amongst the top candidates, VHL is the most potent effector of tumorigenesis and linking Daam2 with a central regulator of tumor growth made the most sense to us. With that said, future studies will be geared towards delineating the links between the other candidates (Claudin-7 and Syk, etc.) and Daam2 in the context of glioma and glial development. We have amended the Discussion to include these points. Please see subsection “New Parallels Between Development and Cancer”, first paragraph and subsection “Regulation of VHL in cancer”, first paragraph.</p><p>Another component of our selection criteria is a previous publication showing that VHL promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation (Yuen, et al. Cell 2014). This role for VHL is in contrast to our previous findings that Daam2 suppresses oligodendrocyte development (Lee, et al. Neuron 2015). Based on these opponent roles for VHL and Daam2 in glial development, and that their expression is inversely correlated in glioma, we speculated that they may have an antagonistic relationship that influences glioma tumorigenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the TCGA datasets, is there a strong correlation between DAAM2 expression and HIF-1a expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question, as it’s very important to understand the correlations between Daam2 and the downstream effectors of VHL. This correlation analysis was included in the original submission and can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. In addition to a strong correlation with HIF1a in the human TCGA datasets, we also found that two key HIF1a targets (VEGFA and Glut1) are upregulated in tumors that overexpress Daam2. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>. Together, these data strongly support the notion that Daam2 overexpression results in dysregulated VHL-HIF1a signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the key points of the report is that DAAM2 requires VHL. While they demonstrate sufficiency, the necessity portion of this dependency is not as clearly revealed. What is the effect of VHL expression alone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>? One elegant way to demonstrate the dependency is to show that mutations that impair VHL-DAAM2 binding reverse the ability of DAAM2 to accelerate glioma growth in vitro and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, as the effects of VHL manipulation alone are also an important part of this experiment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we have included VHL overexpression controls in our human glioma cell line and mouse PB-Ras glioma model experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, overexpression of VHL alone did not affect growth of the human glioma cell lines or tumorigenesis in our mouse models.</p><p>In an effort to test the sufficiency of the Daam2/VHL relationship, we sought to perform a double LOF experiment by deleting VHL via CRISPR in our mouse glioma model generated in Daam2-KO mice. Towards this we first tested the effects of VHL deletion on tumorigenesis in our CRISPR-IUE model, finding that deletion of VHL resulted in a dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Average survival for mice bearing CRISPR-IUE tumors is ~90 days, mice that have been electroporated with guide RNAs that target VHL (plus the NF1/p53/PTEN combination) survive 14-21 days. Moreover, glioma growth is typically detected by bioluminescence at P40-P45, while tumors that lack VHL are detectable as early as P8. Given that deletion of VHL has such a profound effect of tumorigenesis in our mouse models, we are not able to use these models to examine the sufficiency of the Daam2/VHL relationship.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>CRISPR-IUE tumor model, combined with CRISPR deletion of VHL, generated in a Daam2+/- or Daam2-/- background.</title><p>Deletion of VHL accelerates glioma formation in this model.

To address this we performed a series of co-IP experiments, testing the association between a series of Daam2 mutants and VHL. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, all the Daam2 truncation mutants at our disposal (see Lee, et al.Developmental Cell 2012) are able to associate with VHL. Because, at this time, we are unable to identify a Daam2-mutant that does not interact with VHL, we are unable to further explore this potentially important mechanism. Based on these results, these experiments appear to be beyond the scope of this study, as they will require additional deletion mapping to identify the domains of interaction. Nevertheless, we feel that this is an excellent future set of experiments that we will explore in greater detail and thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Moreover, we have amended the Discussion to include these experiments as a potential future direction.

This point was addressed in the original submission – please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>. In this figure we show that overexpression of Daam2 +Wnt3a ligand (similar conditions were used in Lee, et al. Developmental Cell 2012) did not have a profound effect on Wnt-reporter activity in glioma cell lines. Moreover, we introduced the Wnt-reporter into our mouse model and found that GOF and LOF of manipulations of Daam2 did not affect the number of cells demonstrating high levels Wnt activity. Together, these data indicate that in the context of human and mouse glioma, Daam2 does not robustly influence canonical Wnt-signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) This is not the first study to show an upstream mechanism of VHL regulation in cancer.

Thus while these other observations do not take away from the story here, this point is overstated several times in the text and should be corrected.

Towards this, we performed Western blots on protein lysates extracted from CRISPR-IUE tumors that overexpress Daam2 (and appropriate controls), finding that these tumors exhibit drastic increases in VEGFA and Glut1 protein expression (both are bona fide direct targets of HIF1a).

With that said, one potential explanation for the disconnect between the in vivo and in vitro observations are the differences in systems. The in vitro assay was performed in 293 cells, while the in vivo observations were made in glioma models. It is possible that 293 cells are missing critical co-factors that participate in this process.</p><p>Another consideration is time. In the in vivo systems, Daam2 manipulation occurs across the lifetime of the resultant tumor (approx. 3 weeks for the PB-Ras model and 9-12 weeks for CRISPR-model). In contrast the in vitro experiments, occur across 6 hours. Given these differences in experimental duration, it is possible that we were able to witness more pronounced changes in VHL expression in vivo because these changes had more time to accumulate.

Is Daam2 expressed at hyperphysiologic levels in these tumors or, alternatively, do some gliomas simply arise from Daam2-positive cells? If the latter is true than Daam2 is only permissive for gliomagenesis (along with many other things). If the former is true, then we need to know the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important issue that we should address. Our interpretation of this question is the following: Are increases in Daam2 expression in glioma the result of i) active dysregulation or ii) a passive by-product of its expression in a cell lineage that is over-represented in glioma?</p><p>Regarding the possibility that Daam2 is actively dysregulated, it’s important to point out that we have detected increases in its mRNA levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>This raises the question of how Daam2 mRNA is elevated in these tumors and there are three likely possibilities: 1) direct transcriptional regulation, 2) microRNA regulation, or 3) regulatory links to key glioma drivers.</p><p>1) Regarding direct transcriptional regulation, we have no insight into how Daam2 is transcriptionally regulated. We are currently performing an enhancer screen in the chick spinal cord (similar to Kang, et al. Neuron 2012 and Glasgow, et al. Nature Neuroscience 2017) to identify regulatory elements that can be used as entry points for identifying transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Daam2 during development. These studies are in their nascent stages and it will take a while to have a definitive answer for the developmental mechanism; even longer to apply this mechanism to glioma.</p><p>2) Regarding microRNAs, there is evidence that mir335 can regulate Daam1/2 in neuroblastoma cell lines (Lynch, et al. PLoS One 2013), but whether this mechanism is applicable to glioma remains undefined and is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>3) Another possibility is that Daam2 mRNA expression is linked in some way to key drivers of glioma that are frequently mutated (i.e. NF1, PTEN, EGFR, PDGFR, p53, Rb, etc.). Leveraging existing databases, we have correlated mutations in these key drivers with levels of Daam2 expression and there are no obvious or strong correlations.</p><p>These potential mechanisms are likely contributing, in some way, to Daam2 dysregulation in glioma, however as we have illustrated, deciphering these mechanisms will require a significant amount of work that is beyond the scope of this manuscript. With that said, we have amended the Discussion to include these areas as key future avenues of investigation. Please see subsection “Daam2 stimulates glioma tumorigenesis”, last paragraph.</p><p>The other possibility we must consider is that elevated Daam2 expression is the result of its expression in cell lineages overrepresented in glioma. Daam2 is expressed in both glial lineages: oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, in both precursor and mature stages of development. Both of these lineages are present in one form or another within the bulk tumor, therefore it is possible that elevated Daam2 expression is the result of analogous cell populations that comprise the primary, bulk tumor. Recently we found that glioma is comprised of non-stem cell, heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that are molecularly analogous to normal astrocyte subpopulations (Lin, et al. Nature Neuroscience 2017). Using the RNA-Seq data generated from these astrocyte subpopulations and their malignant counterparts, we found that Daam2 is uniformly expressed in all astrocyte and glioma subpopulations. These data suggest that, as far as we can tell, Daam2 is not selectively expressed in subpopulations of astrocytes or glioma cells that are overrepresented in glioma.</p><p>Another glioma subpopulation worthy of discussion is the glioma stem cell (GSC). We have not assessed Daam2 expression in GSC populations, as the markers that define this population in vivo can be nebulous. Moreover, the glioma stem cell comprises a very small fraction of the bulk tumor (~5-15%) therefore even if Daam2 was highly expressed in this population it is unlikely to account for the increased expression of Daam2 in glioma.</p><p>Despite these limitations, understanding the cellular basis for Daam2 function in glioma is also an important consideration. We have amended the Discussion to include these points as future directions,Please see subsection “Daam2 stimulates glioma tumorigenesis”, last paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
