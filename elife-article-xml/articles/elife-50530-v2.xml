During latency, herpesviruses employ different classes of ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tycowski et al., 2015</xref>) to control gene expression and modulate processes such as apoptosis and the immune response. <italic>Herpesvirus saimiri</italic> (HVS) is an oncogenic γ-herpesvirus that establishes latent infections in T cells of New World monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ensser and Fleckenstein, 2005</xref>) and expresses seven small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) of the Sm-class called HSURs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht and Fleckenstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murthy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wassarman et al., 1989</xref>) during latency.</p><p>So far, functions have only been assigned to HSUR1 and HSUR2. These two viral snRNAs bind host miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cazalla et al., 2010</xref>). HSUR1 binds with perfect complementarity to the seed region of miR-142–3p, whereas it base-pairs with the seed region and the 3’ end of miR-27. Interaction of HSUR1 and miR-27 results in the degradation of this miRNA by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cazalla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pawlica et al., 2016</xref>). HSUR2 contains sequences that base-pair with perfect complementarity with the seed regions of miR-142–3p and miR-16 without affecting the abundance or activity of these miRNAs. Rather, HSUR2 functions as a miRNA adaptor that base-pairs with host mRNAs and recruits miR-142–3p and miR-16 to promote destabilization of the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). HVS utilizes this mechanism to downregulate expression of several proteins including apoptotic factors in latently infected T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). Psoralen-dependent crosslinking suggests that HSUR2 base-pairs with target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>), but it has not been determined if base-pairing is required for HSUR2-mediated mRNA repression. Other questions regarding the mechanism and specificity of HSUR2-mediated mRNA repression remain unanswered. Most importantly, the regions of target mRNAs bound by HSUR2 and the sequences mediating such interactions are not known. It is also unclear why the interaction between HSUR2 and miR-16 is required for destabilization of only a subset of, but not all, target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Small ncRNAs that function as guides for the recruitment of effector complexes to target RNAs usually use a specific subregion, or seed sequence to interact with the target transcript. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decatur and Fournier, 2003</xref>), miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartel, 2018</xref>), CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and bacterial Hfq-dependent small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorski et al., 2017</xref>) provide examples of different systems in which the folding of the guide RNA into secondary or tertiary structures exposes a defined sequence that is used for binding to the target RNAs. Complementarity between this discrete seed sequence and the target RNA is sufficient to confer specificity to the interaction. Members of the Sm-class of ncRNAs part from this norm. In some cases, they can use a subregion to interact with rather diverse sequences through distinct arrangements of base pairs. For example, the 5’ end of U7 snRNA can interact with a series of similar sequences downstream of histone genes to promote the 3’ end processing of histone pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cotten et al., 1988</xref>), whereas the 5’ end of U1 snRNA interacts, also through flexible base-pairing, with a highly diverse sequence element that defines the 5’ end of introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roca and Krainer, 2009</xref>). Moreover, Sm-class RNAs can use different subregions to interact with different RNA-binding partners. For example, U2 snRNA utilizes two different subregions to interact with the branch point sequence and U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nilsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staley and Guthrie, 1998</xref>). This characteristic flexibility of Sm-class RNAs in both the use of subregions for interactions with target RNA transcripts and in the arrangement of base pairs undercuts efforts to predict potential binding sites for HSUR2 in target mRNAs.</p><p>To understand how HSUR2 interacts with its target mRNAs, we developed a method called iRICC to determine sequences mediating RNA-RNA interactions in vivo for an RNA of interest. iRICC was able to reveal sequences mediating interactions between HSUR2 and 171 binding sites in 110 target mRNAs without any previous knowledge of the regions of target mRNAs bound by HSUR2 or the binding properties of this viral ncRNA. HSUR2 does not display a specialized or seed sequence to bind most target mRNAs. Similar to U2 snRNA, HSUR2 can use different subregions to interact with different target mRNAs. Just like U1 or U7 snRNAs, HSUR2 also allows for diverse arrangements of base pairs in its interactions with target mRNAs. Mutational analyses confirmed the sequences mediating HSUR2-mRNA interactions, establishing iRICC as a robust method that can be broadly applied to identify functional RNA-RNA interactions in vivo. Finally, we show that base-pairing between HSUR2 and the target mRNA determines the differential recruitment of miR-16 to target mRNAs and its use in HSUR2-mediated mRNA destabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>iRICC identifies sequences mediating RNA-RNA interactions in vivo</title><p>We had previously developed a method named RICC (<italic>R</italic>NA-RNA <italic>i</italic>nteraction identification by <italic>c</italic>rosslinking and <italic>c</italic>apture) to identify mRNAs that interacted with HSUR2 in virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). This method allowed for the identification of HSUR2 target mRNAs, but did not provide any information about the exact site of interaction, or the sequences mediating such interactions. In this study, we further modified the RICC protocol to develop a method we call iRICC that determines the sequences mediating RNA-RNA interactions in vivo through the identification of the actual psoralen-crosslinked residues.</p><p>HVS-transformed marmoset T cells were irradiated with long-wave (365 nm) UV light in the presence of the psoralen derivative 4′-aminomethyltrioxalen (AMT) to crosslink RNA duplexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calvet and Pederson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cimino et al., 1985</xref>). Polyadenylated (polyA+) RNA was selected and hybridized to an antisense DNA oligonucleotide complementary to full-length HSUR2 (anti-H2 DNA) followed by limited single-strand S1 endonuclease digestion to fragment polyA+ RNA while maintaining HSUR2 integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After removal of anti-H2 DNA by DNase I digestion, samples were split into two samples and hybridization with anti-H2 DNA was repeated in one (Control) sample, followed by digestion of both samples with RNase H, which resulted in removal of HSUR2 only from the Control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Following a second digestion with DNase I, HSUR2 and crosslinked RNAs were purified from both samples under stringent conditions with a biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide antisense to HSUR2. High-throughput sequencing libraries were prepared from both samples using random primers. HSUR2 target mRNAs were identified by comparison of pulldowns from HSUR2 samples with Control samples in three independent replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

However, reliably identifying new, biologically relevant interactions between different RNA species has historically posed a challenging problem. Several methods based on psoralen-mediated crosslinking and proximity ligation have been developed recently to identify RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). All these methods rely on proximity ligation of psoralen-crosslinked RNAs, high-throughput sequencing, and identification of chimeric reads to infer RNA-RNA interactions. Although all these methods have successfully identified well-characterized inter-molecular RNA interactions, it is uncertain how reliable they are to detect new, uncharacterized, biologically relevant RNA-RNA interactions. The requirement for reversal of the psoralen crosslinks before library preparation makes these methods unsuitable for determining the nucleotides involved in psoralen-mediated crosslinking and thus cannot distinguish bona fide, in vivo RNA-RNA interactions from RNA duplexes that are generated in vitro. To address this issue, we developed iRICC to identify the RNA binding partners of a single RNA of interest, and the regions and sequences mediating their interactions in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This method relies on psoralen crosslinking-dependent reverse-transcriptase stalling during library preparation to identify sites of crosslinking and to determine the precise sequences involved in base-pairing.</p><p>We decided to focus on interactions between HSUR2 and target mRNAs. For that reason, we performed a selection of polyA+ RNAs as an initial step in iRICC. This step not only constrains the class of target RNAs identified, but also serves as a means to remove ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from samples. A caveat of this version of iRICC is that it most likely misses interactions between HSUR2 and non-polyA+ target RNAs. Alternatively, a rRNA removal step could be used instead of polyA+ selection as a less biased approach for the identification of RNA-RNA interactions for other classes of RNAs.</p><p>iRICC defined the sequences mediating interactions between HSUR2 and 171 binding sites in target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Since psoralen derivatives preferably crosslink adjacent opposite pyrimidine bases in double-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachellerie and Hearst, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cimino et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 1982</xref>), we predict that interactions mediated by GC-rich regions will be under-represented in datasets generated by iRICC. Alternatively, different RNA crosslinking reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Christian, 2009</xref>) could be used in the iRICC protocol in the future to address this bias. Mutational analyses showed that HSUR2 exerts its repressive function through the sequences identified by iRICC in every case tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). iRICC therefore successfully identified functional RNA-RNA interactions in vivo, providing a reliable and general solution to the long-standing problem of identifying unknown, functional RNA-RNA interactions. Although iRICC can confidently determine base-pairing in the proximity of crosslinked residues, confidence in the predicted base-pairing diminishes as the distance between the predicted base pairs and the crosslinked residues increases. Thorough mutational analyses are thus required to determine the full extent of base-pairing for each interaction identified by iRICC.</p><p>Gene set enrichment analyses of targets identified by iRICC indicated that HSUR2 regulates the expression of genes with roles in processes relevant to viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). However, only three mRNAs previously described by RICC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>) as targets of HSUR2 were identified by iRICC, suggesting that both techniques underestimate the number of mRNAs targeted by HSUR2. Substantial differences in protocol design, high-throughput library preparation systems, and criteria utilized for determining target mRNAs presumably account for the limited overlap between the target mRNAs generated by these two distinct protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Target recognition by HSUR2</title><p>HSUR2’s primary function is to deliver miRNAs to mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that HSUR2 binding sites are found primarily in 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) where most miRNA binding sites occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). It is difficult to discern the functions of HSUR2 binding sites in coding sequences as well as in 5′UTRs of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is possible that HSUR2-mediated recruitment of miRNAs to coding sequences contribute to mRNA repression since miRNAs can downregulate mRNA expression by binding to such regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brümmer and Hausser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang and Rajewsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnall-Levin et al., 2010</xref>); it is also conceivable that HSUR2 regulates target mRNAs through miRNA-independent mechanisms when binding to coding sequences and 5′UTRs. Further experimentation will be required to explore these possibilities.</p><p>The mechanism by which HSUR2 can specifically recognize binding sites in target mRNAs remains unknown. The fact that HSUR2 does not present a specialized or seed region that base-pairs with most binding sites (see below) suggest that sequence complementarity is required but not sufficient for the selection of target mRNAs. This characteristic is shared by cellular Sm-class RNAs. For example, base-pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5’ splice site and between U2 snRNA and the branchpoint sequence are essential for splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mount et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Séraphin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siliciano and Guthrie, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu and Manley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Weiner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhuang and Weiner, 1989</xref>). Yet, <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals like splicing enhancers, and <italic>trans-</italic>acting factors like SR proteins are essential for guiding and escorting spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) to the appropriate splicing signals before base-pairing is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohtz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavigueur et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roscigno and Garcia-Blanco, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tarn and Steitz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tian and Maniatis, 1993</xref>). This combination of protein-assisted recruitment of snRNPs and RNA-RNA base-pairing results in exquisite specificity as well as a enormous regulatory potential, which is manifested by the immense protein diversity that is generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>). It is conceivable that, similarly to cellular snRNPs, additional <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>acting factors may assist HSUR2 in the recognition of binding sites in target mRNAs increasing both the specificity and versatility of HSUR2-mediated mRNA regulation. Further research will be required to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>HSUR2 does not present a seed region</title><p>Unlike miRNAs and other regulatory small ncRNAs that function as guides that base-pair with target RNAs to deliver effector complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Künne et al., 2014</xref>), HSUR2 does not use a dedicated, or seed region to interact with target mRNAs. iRICC revealed that HSUR2 can use different regions of its sequence to interact with different targets and can also employ diverse arrangements of base pairs to mediate these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This property is shared with cellular Sm-class RNAs, which allow for variability in both the choice of region engaged in base-pairing as well as in the arrangement of base pairs between one region of the Sm-class RNA and different target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cotten et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roca and Krainer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staley and Guthrie, 1998</xref>). Mutational analyses showed that HSUR2 can interact with the same target through different arrangement of base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), pointing to the stability of the interaction as the main variable determining the outcome of HSUR2-mediated mRNA regulation. In the future, it will be interesting to determine if base-pairing strength explicitly determines the extent of HSUR2-mediated mRNA repression.</p><p>We hypothesize that the binding properties of HSUR2 confer this viral ncRNA with potential advantages over seed-based systems. For small regulatory ncRNAs that employ seed-based mechanisms for target regulation, the repertoire of regulated transcripts is constrained by the presence of a discrete sequence complementary to the seed region of the ncRNA, in the same way that the size of a wrench constrains the size of bolts and nuts that can be adjusted with it. Several wrenches of different sizes are required to adjust the diverse collection of nuts and bolts that are part of an engine. By analogy, most herpesviruses express large numbers of miRNAs to regulate a diverse collection of transcripts during latency to generate a cellular environment that is conducive to viral persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skalsky and Cullen, 2010</xref>). We propose that flexible base-pairing allows HSUR2 to regulate a diverse group of transcripts functioning like a ‘crescent wrench’ that can be adjusted to fit nuts and bolts of different sizes. By using ncRNAs that employ ‘non-seed’ or flexible base-pairing, HVS can potentially minimize the number of regulatory ncRNAs required to effectively regulate a defined set of transcripts and therefore minimize the investment in viral genome space.</p><p>Seed-based RNA regulatory systems are sensitive to mismatches in interactions between the seed region of the ncRNA and target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chipman and Pasquinelli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Künne et al., 2014</xref>). Single mismatches in the seed region of miRNAs can dramatically reduce their association with target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandradoss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, single point mutations in binding sites can render regulation by miRNAs ineffectual, making it relatively easy for the host to escape viral miRNA-based regulation. We have shown that extensive mutagenesis of HSUR2 binding sites does not affect HSUR2 binding as long as new base pairs are formed to maintain a similar overall binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We speculate that this binding flexibility allows HSUR2-mediated regulation to withstand considerable target sequence evolution, making it difficult for the host to escape this viral mechanism of gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>HSUR2 differentially recruits miR-16 to a subset of target mRNAs</title><p>The molecular mechanism through which miR-142–3p contributes to repression of all HSUR2 target mRNAs tested so far is currently unknown. Since this miRNA is abundantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and mostly absent in non-hematopoietic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), it is conceivable that HSUR2 would not be able to repress target mRNAs in non-hematopoietic tissues, curbing the ability of HVS to establish latent infections in non-hematopoietic tissues and thus defining the tropism of this virus’ latent infection.</p><p>Flexible base-pairing between HSUR2 and target mRNAs provides a mechanism for the differential recruitment of miR-16 to a select group of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). GO-term enrichment analysis showed that miR-16-dependent HSUR2 targets encode proteins with roles in apoptosis, consistent with the fact that the interaction between miR-16 and HSUR2 is required for inhibition of apoptosis by this viral Sm-class RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorbea et al., 2017</xref>). The miR-16 family regulates the cell cycle by modulating the expression of genes with critical roles in the G1-S transition including cyclins D1, D2, D3, E1, and CDK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cimmino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the abundance of members of this family of miRNAs is dynamically regulated by the cell cycle, with the highest abundance of these miRNAs observed in cells that are arrested in G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rissland et al., 2011</xref>). Assuming that the abundance of these miRNAs determines the extent to which HSUR2 can affect its targets, we speculate that this mechanism allows HSUR2 to efficiently repress a subset of transcripts in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This provides a mechanism for HVS to regulate the expression of key genes in specific situations, like when the latently infected cell tries to arrest in G0. Further investigation is required to explore these exciting possibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For stable expression of the Firefly luciferase gene fused to partial 3′UTRs of HSUR2 target mRNAs containing single HSUR2 binding sites, the thymidine kinase promoter from pGL4.54[luc2/TK] (Promega), the optimized <italic>luc2</italic> gene from pmirGLO (Promega), and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (bGH polyA) from PCDNA3 (Invitrogen) were cloned into pLenti CMVTRE3G eGFP Puro (Addgene #27570) to generate the pLenti-TK-Firefly-Control plasmid.

DESeq2 (v1.14.1) was used to normalize gene counts across the samples and determine differential expression between the HSUR2 and control samples in each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Identification of HSUR2 target mRNAs</title><p>A list of HSUR2 targets was generated by filtering the list of genes sequenced according to the following criteria: a) genes with fewer than eight reads across all replicates were removed; b) genes with a non-adjusted p value &gt; 0.05 were eliminated; and c) only genes with an enrichment of 1.5-fold and higher (log2 fold change ≥0.6) in the HSUR2-positive pulldown <italic>versus</italic> the Control (HSUR2-negative) pulldown were used in further analyses. In an initial list of 220 potential HSUR2 targets that conformed to the above criteria, six targets corresponded to snoRNAs, one mRNA encoded a <italic>Herpesvirus saimiri</italic> protein and one was a pseudogene. These were not considered for further analysis. Thus, we initially identified 212 host mRNAs of which 120 displayed peaks of aligned reads with clear boundaries and were subjected to the analyses described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>Determination of potential crosslinking sites and sequences mediating the interaction between target mRNAs and HSUR2</title><p>The coordinates of genes included in the list of HSUR2 targets meeting the criteria described above and the assembled marmoset genome were inserted into the IGV_2.4.2 genome browser to visually inspect the peaks of aligned reads (using both read1 and read2) across each gene and across all experiments. From the initial list of 212 potential HSUR2 target mRNAs a total of eight (3.6%) had unannotated 3'UTRs and were eliminated from further analyses. A total of 32 mRNAs (14.5%) showed high background in control samples and lacked clear and discrete peaks of aligned reads that could be identified in all three experiments and thus were not considered any further. Fifty-two mRNAs (23.6%) had clear peaks of aligned reads across the three experiments, but lacked consistent boundaries (i.e. similar abrupt or smooth edges or drops of reads within a peak in the three experiments). These mRNAs were not further analyzed since crosslinking sites could not be unambiguously determined. The majority of the remaining 120 target mRNAs exhibited peaks with abrupt edges or a sharp drop of aligned reads within a peak, which we used as the primary indicator of a potential site of crosslinking. In a minority of the cases (~17%), peaks were symmetrical in appearance and lacked abrupt edges. To determine the sequences that might be involved in base-pairing with HSUR2, an initial window of 40 nucleotides centered at the potential site of crosslinking (indicated by a sharp drop of reads, or by smooth edges of symmetrical peaks) was entered into the <italic>RNAcofold</italic> web server from the ViennaRNA Package 2.0 at the Institute of Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Vienna (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac/at/RNAcofold">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac/at/RNAcofold</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernhart et al., 2006</xref>) along with the full-length sequence of HSUR2 using default parameters. The initial results indicated that the sequences in HSUR2 including the Sm protein binding site (AUUUUUG) or forming the adjacent stem-loop structure were not involved in heteroduplex formation with a target mRNA in all the cases analyzed. Next, the window of sequence in the target mRNA was iteratively increased to 60 and 80 (for long binding sites) nucleotides until the results of two analyses (i.e. 40 and 60 nucleotides or 60 and 80 nucleotides) yielded similar binding patterns between the target mRNA sequence and HSUR2. The ‘minimal’ sequences mediating the interaction of target mRNAs and HSUR2 were then determined in <italic>RNAcofold</italic> after trimming the sequences not predicted to be involved in contiguous (i.e. not separated by internal secondary structures) base-pairing between the two RNA species. The final analysis was also used to obtain an estimated ΔG of binding and minimal free energy for the interaction of the minimal HSUR2-binding site in the target mRNA with the minimal HSUR2 sequence base-pairing with it. The interactions between the HSUR2 binding sites in target mRNAs and corresponding HSUR2 sequences were visualized using the <italic>RNAfold</italic> web server from the ViennaRNA Package 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac/at/RNAfold">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac/at/RNAfold</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>) to determine the most likely site of crosslinking between the two sequences (i.e. according to the sharp drop of aligned reads or the smooth edges of symmetrical peaks). To this end, we inserted five nucleotides (e.g. AAAAA or UUUUU) between the two interacting sequences and folded the sequence onto itself ensuring that the inserted nucleotides formed a connecting loop. This confirmed that potentially crosslinked pyrimidines were present at the end of helical runs or at G-U wobble base-pairs, sites at which psoralen is most reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachellerie and Hearst, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 1982</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bryan Cullen (Reviewer #1); Xavier Roca (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three of the reviewers were positive about the work, with reviewers 1 and 3 being most enthusiastic, while reviewer 2 asked that the paper be more focused on the technique used. We believe that some expansion on the technique would be an improvement to the paper, but that the emphasis on the biology is appropriate. Please address the points raised by the reviewers as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this very interesting manuscript, Gorbea et al. extend their previous work arguing that the HSUR2 RNA of HVS functions as an adaptor to recruit either miR-16 or miR-142 to target mRNAs and inhibit their expression. This earlier paper did not define how HSUR2 interacts with target mRNAs as a region of obvious homology was not present. Here, Gorbea et al. first map the targets for HSUR2 binding using a novel technique they call iRICC and they then show that HSUR2 acts as a flexible adaptor that interacts with different mRNAs using overlapping but distinct regions of HSUR2 to bind to different mRNA targets. The mutational analysis presented beautifully demonstrates that this is the case and moreover shows that mutations that disrupt HSUR2:target mRNA interactions can be rescued by compensatory mutations in other bases on HSUR2 that are predicted to allow entirely new base pairs to form. Moreover, some interactions with mRNAs are predicted to involve regions of HSUR2 that are complementary to miR-16 and, in those cases, miR-142 but not miR-16 is required for inhibition. Finally, they also show that they can reconfigure these RNA:RNA interactions so that now the miR-142 complimentary region is required for target mRNA binding while the miR-16 region is now free to recruit miR-16 and in that case the miRNA requirement for inhibition is reversed.</p><p>Without going into more detail about the results presented, I will say that I found the data presented uniformly convincing and the conclusions drawn logical and compelling. This paper will certainly be of wide interest to virologists and RNA biologists.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>While I have no technical criticisms, I did have one question. If the region of HSUR2 that binds to target mRNAs includes, for example, the sequence complementary to miR-16, then why doesn't miR-16 compete for binding? If this is a function of relative concentration you might expect the miRNA to be dominant. Alternatively, is there so much HSUR2 that all RNA target sites on both mRNAs and miRNAs are bound? I think it would be interesting to overexpress miR-16 to see if, in this circumstance, mRNA inhibition by HSUR2 via recruitment of miR-142, due to binding of HSUR2 to the mRNA via the miR-16 complementarity region, is selectively inhibited. Otherwise, I have no suggestions for improvement of this very interesting manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Gorbea et al. describe a novel method (iRICC) for the identification and mapping of RNA:RNA interactions of a specific RNA target in vivo. Such a method is currently lacking and iRICC should be useful to apply to a broad range of RNAs in the future. Here, iRICC is used to define the RNA interactome of the herpesviral Sm-type snRNA HSUR2, which functions as a viral adaptor between mRNAs and the miR-16- and/or miR-142-3p-bound RISC complex. Results show variable modes of HSUR2:target interaction, which is interesting in terms of RNA biology and herpesviral ncRNAs. Data and analyses are of high quality.</p><p>1) The authors should discuss whether and how much the reactivity preferences of AMT could bias the results and if there are ways to address such bias.</p><p>2) Could the authors discuss potential reasons why the overlap between the results from RICC-seq (Gorbea et al., 2017) and iRICC-seq (this study) is so limited, with only 3 mRNAs in common?</p><p>3) iRICC-seq uses a polyA enrichment step (please show in Figure 1).

This study is a follow-up of the previous work of the corresponding author describing the characterization of HSUR as viral RNAs together with endogenous proteins assembled into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, which regulate the latent stage of monkey herpes viruses in T cells. HSUR2 was found to bind target mRNAs and then two microRNAs, thus bridging them to the corresponding mRNAs to repress their expression. As only few targets were initially known, authors improved an RNA pulldown technique with HSUR2, which by virtue of crosslink and selective and extensive degradation steps, specifically enriches for mRNAs bound by HSUR2. This elaborate methodology is able to map the crosslinked site at a single-nucleotide resolution, and revealed 171 binding sites in 110 target genes. Authors validated a few of them, however with an impressive 100% validation rate, emphasizing the high power of the technique and the value of the resulting data. Authors used RNA structure predictions to infer the binding mode of HSUR2 to their targets, to surprisingly reveal very different base-pairing arrangements involving different and disconnected segments of the HSUR2 single-stranded 5' end portion. As this segment also binds miR-142-3p and perhaps miR-16, authors nicely used luciferase reporters to firmly establish the flexible base-pairing arrangements and miR dependency. To me, this nice work involves a new technique for high-resolution mapping of RNA-RNA interactions which could be used for other RNAs, together with significant mechanistic insight into a fascinating noncoding RNA. Hence I recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and I feel that addressing the small comments below would only make this report stronger.</p><p>1) Authors identified as many as 171 target mRNAs for HSUR2 in 110 genes, and presumably the viral modulation of these targets altogether helps establish latency. To gain a holistic insight, authors could run Gene Set Enrichment tools or Gene Ontology to see which cellular functions are enriched in this set of genes (apoptosis, cell cycle, etc.). This is important, and could make up one new figure panel and one paragraph description.</p><p>2) The new methodology termed iRICC seems applicable for many other RNA-RNA interactions, and authors could stress this a bit more. Importantly, while all tested targets were confirmed, I wonder if or how many targets were missed (in other words, false negatives). Authors should discuss their opinion on how many targets would have been missed, if any.</p><p>3) Luciferase reporters show some targets whose HSUR2 regulation depends on both miR-142-3p and miR-16, and inhibition of either one abrogates the repressive effect of HSUR2. This is difficult to conceive for me, because repression of one microRNA is not expected to affect the other – are authors implying that both miRNAs must act together or synergistically in these cases? At the very least this should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50530.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Specific comments:</p><p>While I have no technical criticisms, I did have one question.

The question of how HSUR2 utilizes miR-142-3p and miR-16 to repress target mRNAs is a puzzling one that we have not been able to explain using simple models. Our results show that HSUR2 does not use these two miRNAs in an additive manner for any of the targets tested so far, suggesting that either HSUR2 does not recruit both miRNAs at the same time to a target mRNA (making miR142-3 and miR-16 mutually exclusive for HSUR2-mediated mRNA repression), or that recruiting one miRNA already saturates the repressive capacity of HSUR2. A “mutually exclusive” model for the use of miR-142-3p and miR-16 cannot explain our observation that miR-142-3p activity is</p><p>absolutely required for HSUR2-mediated repression for of all targets tested (approximately 25 so far). It is for this that we feel that overexpression experiments as the one suggested by the reviewer will be very hard to interpret and that is why we have so far been able to test only the requirement of each miRNA for HSUR2-mediated mRNA repression. Regarding the first hypothesis proposed by the reviewer, we speculate that since in many cases the regions of</p><p>HSUR2 that bind to target mRNAs are extensive, it is possible that miR-16 competes effectively with the target mRNA for the UGCUGCU sequence (miR-16 binding site) present in HSUR2 without effectively disrupting the HSUR2-mRNA interaction. Regarding the second alternative proposed by the reviewer, we think it unlikely since we have already shown that HSUR2 is less abundant than miR-16 in infected cells (Gorbea et al., 2017) and miR-16 activity is not</p><p>affected by HSUR2 in infected cells (Cazalla et al., 2010), suggesting that only a small fraction of miR-16 is bound by HSUR2 in infected cells. Further experimentation (currently undergoing) is required to dissect the molecular mechanism by which HSUR2 utilize these two miRNAs to repress target mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors should discuss whether and how much the reactivity preferences of AMT could bias the results and if there are ways to address such bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point that needs to be discussed in the manuscript.

We consider that both methods underestimate the number of targets for HSUR2, and there are substantial methodological differences between them that could account for the limited overlap between the two lists of targets. If we do relax our criteria for calling targets in iRICC, the overlap between the two lists increases substantially. For example, if we do consider genes that are enriched in two out of three iRICC experiments, we have 20 genes that appear in the list of targets identified by RICC-seq (data not shown). We prefer to maintain a stringent criterion to call targets with high confidence rather than relaxing it to increase the number of targets in the lists generated. We believe that our criteria explain the 100% validation rate we have had so far with both methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) iRICC-seq uses a polyA enrichment step (please show in Figure 1).
