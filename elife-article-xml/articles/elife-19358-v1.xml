In aged animals, a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive impairments. Increasing activity of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in young adult rodents facilitates cognition, and increases intrinsic excitability. However, it has yet to be tested if increasing CREB expression also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits. To test this hypothesis, we virally overexpressed CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Rats received CREB or control virus, before undergoing water maze training. CREB overexpression in aged animals ameliorated the long-term memory deficits observed in control animals. Concurrently, cells overexpressing CREB in aged animals had reduced post-burst afterhyperpolarizations, indicative of increased intrinsic excitability. These results identify CREB modulation as a potential therapy to treat age-related cognitive decline.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19358.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19358.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>CREB</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Glenn/AFAR Scholarship for Research in the Biology of Aging</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiao-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AG020506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xiao-Wen</given-names></name><name><surname>Curlik</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names><suffix>II</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AG13854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Curlik</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names><suffix>II</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS063245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Jerry CP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AG008796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Disterhoft</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG017139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Disterhoft</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral, biochemical, and biophysical analyses show that age-related memory deficits can be rescued by directly overexpressing wild-type CREB.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related cognitive impairments are observed across multiple species, including laboratory rodents and humans. Forms of learning that require an intact hippocampal formation, such as spatial navigation, are severely impacted in aged humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etchamendy et al., 2012</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallagher and Pelleymounter, 1988</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 1999</xref>). Although age-related cognitive deficits have been observed across numerous tasks and species, not all aged subjects display these impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallagher and Pelleymounter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuttinen et al., 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2001b</xref>). Therefore, the aging population can be split into aged individuals who are cognitively-impaired, and others who are cognitively-unimpaired. These cognitively-unimpaired âsuper agersâ are capable of learning and remembering at young-like levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curlik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallagher and Pelleymounter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuttinen et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogalski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms that differentiate successful from unsuccessful cognitive-agers is highly desirable, as knowledge of the underlying mechanisms will greatly facilitate treatment of these impairments. One likely mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive deficits is a decrease in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Numerous studies have revealed that CA1 pyramidal neurons from aged animals have reduced intrinsic excitability when compared to those from young animals. Specifically, pyramidal neurons from area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus of aged animals exhibit a larger post-burst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) than those from young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Disterhoft and Oh, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Landfield and Pitler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oh et al., 2013</xref>). The magnitude of this age-related decrease in neuronal excitability correlates with age-related cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tombaugh et al., 2005</xref>). Aged impaired (AI) animals have larger AHPs than both young animals, and aged unimpaired (AU) animals. Interestingly, the AHP amplitude from AU animals is no different than that of young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tombaugh et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, pharmacological compounds that reduce the amplitude of the AHP in vitro, ameliorate age-related cognitive impairments in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kronforst-Collins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moyer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh et al., 1999</xref>). Based on these findings, we are searching for molecular pathway(s) that modulate both cognition and intrinsic cellular excitability.</p><p>One such pathway is activated by the transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberini, 2009</xref>). Numerous studies have manipulated CREB activation in young animals to demonstrate its essential role in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernabeu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourtchuladze et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dash et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deisseroth et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaang et al., 1993</xref>). Memories for spatial and cued information were impaired in transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pittenger et al., 2002</xref>). Likewise, mutations which prevent CREB from being activated by inhibiting its phosphorylation also impaired memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kida et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, increases in CREB activity via transgenic or viral means facilitated memory. For instance, expressing a partially-active form of CREB (VP16-CREB) in the amygdala resulted in stronger memories for contextual and cued fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viosca et al., 2009b</xref>). Likewise, infusion of HSV-CREB into hippocampus or amygdala, results in CREB overexpression and facilitation of memory for the Morris water maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sekeres et al., 2010</xref>), water cross maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brightwell et al., 2007</xref>), or fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Josselyn et al., 2001</xref>) in young animals.</p><p>Notably, manipulations that increase CREB activity in young animals have also been found to increase intrinsic excitability of their neurons. For example, expression of VP16-CREB resulted in increased neuronal excitability of numerous brain regions, including CA1 of hippocampus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viosca et al., 2009b</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of wild-type CREB has also been shown to be sufficient to enhance excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these previous studies in young adult animals indicate that increasing CREB activity facilitates memory and increases intrinsic neuronal excitability.</p><p>Contrary to young adults, very little is known about age-related changes to hippocampal CREB levels and/or activity. Furthermore, the few published studies which have examined CREB levels in aging appear to present conflicting results. One study reported that levels of total CREB protein were unchanged with aging, however, levels of CREB phosphorylated at S133 (pCREB) decreased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2001</xref>). Another study reported a decrease in total CREB with aging, which was specifically observed in aged animals that had impairments in spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brightwell et al., 2004</xref>). A third study found that total CREB was unchanged, while pCREB increased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monti et al., 2005</xref>). While the exact nature of age-related CREB levels is unclear, these findings do suggest that CREB levels in the hippocampal formation change with age. Additionally, upstream activators of CREB, such as cAMP, have been found to be decreased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 1999</xref>). Activation of protein kinase A, the next step in this activation cascade, is required for the learning-induced reduction in post-burst AHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and reduced in aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karege et al., 2001</xref>). Calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates CREB, has also been found to be increased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2001</xref>). All of these factors could result in a decrease in CREB activation, which led us to hypothesize that increasing CREB levels would ameliorate both the cognitive and biophysical deficits observed in normal aging subjects. We tested this hypothesis by using an adeno-associated viral vector to overexpress wild-type rat CREB in CA1 of dorsal hippocampus. Spatial learning and memory were then assessed using two different Morris water maze protocols; a less challenging version, and a more difficult version. Our results revealed that CREB overexpression in dorsal CA1 ameliorated age-related long-term biophysical and behavioral deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Infusion of AAV-CREB caused CREB overexpression in infected CA1 neurons from young and aged rats</title><p>While several studies have utilized viral vectors to achieve overexpression of CREB in brains of young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Josselyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sekeres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), few studies have done the same in aged animals. Thus, we characterized the infection efficiency and the extent of CREB overexpression of our new adeno-associated viral vector. AAV-CREB virus with a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) was bilaterally injected into CA1 region of 5 young (3â4 months old, mo), and four aged (29â30 mo) male, Fischer 344XBrown Norway F1 hybrid rats. Two weeks after the viral injections, animals were transcardially perfused, and their brains post-fixed to make coronal sections (40 Î¼m) for immunofluorescent staining. Three sections from each animal were stained for NeuN and GFP, to determine the percentage of neurons that were GFP-positive (GFP+): i.e., cells that had been infected by AAV-CREB virus. By visualizing the GFP signal, we observed widespread infection through the medial-lateral axis of CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), with approximately 2 mm of spread in the anterior-posterior axis. Over 95% of cells in this infected area were positive for GFP, and there was no difference in the percentage of GFP+ cells between young (95.24Â Â±Â 0.71%) and aged (96.30Â Â±Â 0.83%) animals (t<sub>7</sub>Â =Â 1.26, n.s.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To confirm that viral infection led to overexpression of CREB, another set of sections from the beginning of the infected area, with a lower infection rate to encompass sufficient number of GFP- cells, was stained for CREB and GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The average CREB intensity of GFP- neurons was set at 100%, and the CREB immunocytochemical signal from GFP+ neurons was normalized to that value. One sample t-tests against a hypothetical average of 100% revealed that GFP+ cells expressed more CREB than GFP- cells in both young (151.4Â Â±Â 5.16%, t<sub>4</sub>Â =Â 9.97, p=0.0006) and aged (141.0Â Â±Â 3.44%, t<sub>3</sub>Â =Â 11.91, p=0.0013) animals, and no differences were observed in CREB expression of GFP+ cells between young and aged animals (t<sub>7</sub>Â =Â 1.59, n.s.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Together, these data indicate that our AAV-CREB virus infects the same percentage of neurons and achieves the same amount of CREB overexpression in both young and aged animals.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19358.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CREB expression levels are increased in CA1 neurons of both young and aged rats following stereotaxic injection of AAV-CREB vector into dorsal CA1 region.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The AAV-CREB vector contained a GFP reporter.

Animals first received training with the visible platform procedure to ensure that they did not have sensorimotor deficits that would prevent them from performing the task. On the visible platform day, animals were trained with eight trials, and animals were able to successfully acquire the task. A repeated measures ANOVA, with age and virus as the main factors, and trial as the repeated factor, revealed significant effects of trial (F<sub>7, 42</sub> = 15.77, p&lt;0.0001) and of age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 7.67, p=0.0084), but not of virus (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 0.001, n.s.).

All animals were trained with 5 trials of the hidden platform task per day, over four consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Each animalâs average cumulative proximity to the hidden platform during each training session was used to assess performance. We found that young animals acquired the task more quickly than aged animals, but there were no differences amongst viral groups for either age group. A repeated measures ANOVA, with age and virus as the between groups measures, and session as the repeated measure, revealed significant main effects of session (F<sub>3, 42</sub> = 63.3, p&lt;0.0001) and of age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 14.72, p=0.0004), but not of virus (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 0.14, n.s.). We observed that on the last session of hidden platform training, aged GFP animals tended have higher cumulative proximities than the other groups. We examined these differences on the last session with a two-way ANOVA, with age and virus as the between groups factors. This revealed a significant main effect of age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 9.70, p=0.003), but not of virus (F<sub>1,42</sub>Â =Â 1.16, n.s.). Post-hoc comparisons (Tukeyâs) of cumulative proximity on the last day of training confirmed that aged GFP animals had greater cumulative proximities than both young GFP animals (p=0.031), and young CREB animals (p=0.023).</p><p>To assess memory for the platform location, all animals underwent probe trials 1 hr after the end of each daily hidden platform session, as well as 1 day and 4 days after the last session of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Percent time in the target quadrant during the first 20Â s of each probe trial was used as our measure of spatial memory. A repeated measures ANOVA, with age and virus as main factors, and probe trial as the repeated factor, revealed significant main effects of trial (F<sub>5, 42</sub> = 31.66, p&lt;0.0001) and age (F<sub>1, 42</sub> = 23.63, p&lt;0.0001), as well as a trial by age interaction (F<sub>5, 42</sub> = 2.61, p=0.026). Together, these results indicate that aged animals did not perform as well as young animals on probe trials. Since young animals treated with GFP and CREB performed comparably across all sessions of visible platform training (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 0.50, n.s.), hidden platform training (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 1.17, n.s.), and probe tests (F<sub>1, 12</sub> = 0.39, n.s.) we collapsed the data from these animals into one âyoungâ group for further analyses.</p><p>As upregulation of CREB has been shown to enhance long-term memory, we more closely examined performance during the last probe test, conducted four days after the last session of hidden platform training. A one-way ANOVA comparing performance between young, aged GFP, and aged CREB animals was significant (F<sub>2, 43</sub> = 4.45, p=0.018). Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test revealed that young animals spent significantly more time in the target quadrant compared to aged GFP (p=0.01), but not compared to aged CREB (n.s., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). When a DâAgostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was run, we found young and aged CREB data to have a Gaussian distribution, while aged GFP did not (young n.s, aged CREB n.s., aged GFP p=0.045). To determine if we had two groups within the aged GFP group, we separated the animals into two groups; AU and AI, using [young average - one standard deviation] as the cut off (grey dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The two new aged GFP groups were each found to have Gaussian distributions (AU n.s., AI n.s.). Based upon these new behavioral groupings, we reanalyzed the day four probe data, and found a significant difference between the groups (one-way ANOVA: F<sub>3, 42</sub> = 23.78, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

However, a trial by age interaction was observed (F<sub>3, 34</sub> = 3.15, p=0.028). Together, these results indicate that aged animals did not perform as well as young animals across the probe trials. Since young animals treated with GFP and CREB performed almost identically across all sessions of visible platform training (F<sub>1, 7</sub> = 2.039, n.s.), hidden platform training (F<sub>1, 13</sub> = 0.03, n.s.), and probe trials (F<sub>1, 13</sub> = 0.01, n.s.) we once again collapsed the data from these animals into one âyoungâ group for further comparisons against aged animals.</p><p>As with the first set of animals, we split the aged GFP group into AU and AI. The cut off (grey dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) was determined using young animalsâ probe trial performance on the last day [young average â one standard deviation]. Two young animals (one GFP and one CREB) did not successfully learn the task, i.e. performed below chance on this probe trial, and were therefore omitted from this calculation. Upon reanalysis of the probe four data, we found a significant difference between the groups (one-way ANOVA: F<sub>3, 34</sub> = 6.36, p&lt;0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test revealed that the AI group was significantly different from each of the other groups [young (p=0.0024), AU (p=0.0034), and aged CREB (p=0.028)], while young, AU, and aged CREB animals were not different from each other. Despite being trained on a more challenging protocol for water maze the young CREB group still performed comparably to the young GFP group. However, in aged animals, AAV-CREB injection ameliorated long-term memory deficits seen in the AAV-GFP group, to the point where their performance was no different to that of young animals.</p><p>To confirm this protocol was more challenging, we compared the behavioral performance by groups on the two different versions. Given that we saw a significant effect of age, but not of virus for both tasks, the young were collapsed into one group, and the aged were collapsed into a second group for each version. A two-way ANOVA (training protocol as the between groups measure; hidden platform training session as the repeated measure) revealed significant main effects of session (F<sub>3, 81</sub> = 36.89, p&lt;0.0001) and of training protocol (F<sub>1, 27</sub> = 4.36, p=0.047). This indicates that as expected, young animals found it more difficult to acquire the task when trained on the more difficult training protocol. The same effects were found for performance on probe trials; a two-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of probe trial (F<sub>3, 81</sub> = 44.00, p&lt;0.0001), and of training protocol (F<sub>1, 27</sub> = 18.37, p=0.0002). Aged animals also performed worse on hidden platform training and probe trials. A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of hidden platform training session (F<sub>3, 159</sub> = 55.28, p&lt;0.0001), and of training protocol (F<sub>1, 53</sub> = 24.40, p&lt;0.0001). A two-way ANOVA for probes revealed a significant main effect of probe trial (F<sub>3, 159</sub> = 26.93, p&lt;0.0001), and of training protocol (F<sub>1, 53</sub> = 21.35, p&lt;0.0001). These results reveal that both young and aged animals exhibited worse performance on both the learning and memory components of the more difficult water maze task, indicating that the lack of AAV-CREB facilitation of young animalsâ performance was not due to a ceiling effect.</p><p>One hour after the final probe trial, the animals were euthanized to collect tissue for RNA. To verify that CREB overexpression occurred, the CA1 sub-region was examined for CREB mRNA levels. A two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of virus on CREB mRNA levels in CA1 (F<sub>1, 34</sub> = 84.24, p&lt;0.0001). Bonferroniâs multiple comparisons test indicated that AAV-CREB animals had significantly more CREB mRNA than those that had received control AAV-GFP virus in both young (AAV-CREB 2.34Â Â±Â 0.27 fold change over AAV-GFP 1.05 Â± 0.09; p&lt;0.0001), and aged animals (AAV-CREB 2.23Â Â±Â 0.18 fold change over AAV-GFP 1 Â± 0.07;Â p&lt;0.0001). These data indicate that as shown previously, the behavioral effects seen in this second group of aged animals could also be attributed to the overexpression of CREB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to directly increase CREB levels in aged animals, and as a result, rescue their age-related cognitive deficits. Administration of AAV-CREB resulted in widespread infection of dorsal CA1 in young and aged rats, which specifically increased CREB mRNA levels in dorsal CA1. Importantly, this increase in CREB was sufficient to ameliorate age-related long-term spatial memory deficits. Furthermore, as predicted, aged pyramidal neurons infected by AAV-CREB had reduced post-burst AHPs, indicating that infected cells were more excitable. These data reaffirm that aging-related processes increase the AHP in CA1 neurons, and leads to decreased excitability that contributes to memory impairment. Increasing CREB levels is sufficient to reverse these processes and normalize memory function. Our data is clear, and is consistent with some previously reported work. However, it is at odds with other reports, and we suspect that a number of different experimental variables contribute to this inconsistency in the literature.</p><p>Aged animals, as a group, displayed robust spatial memory deficits. However, not every aged animal was impaired. Nearly all aged CREB animals, and a subset of aged GFP rats were able to learn and remember both the less challenging, and more difficult task at young-like levels. These results are consistent with those of earlier studies, indicating that approximately half of aged rats are impaired on this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Disterhoft and Oh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallagher et al., 1993</xref>). With that said, our aged control animals could be separated into those with impaired long-term spatial memory, and those without impaired long-term spatial memory, whereas aged animals receiving AAV-CREB were much more homogenous, consistently performing at, or near, young-like levels. We found water maze performance by our young and, presumably AU animals were not improved with AAV-CREB, which is supported by results of a prior study which revealed that viral administration of CREB-Y134F improved fear memory in young âpoor learnersâ, with no improvement in young âgood-learnersâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowansage et al., 2013</xref>). These findings are also supported by a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brightwell et al. (2004)</xref>, which found that AI animals trained on water maze had lower levels of CREB protein than young animals and AU animals (2004). Together, these previous findings and our present results suggest that lower levels of CREB protein in AI animals contributes to their cognitive deficits, and increasing CREB in these animals can rescue their behavioral deficits. This rescue by CREB overexpression was most likely mediated by increased levels of pCREB. Despite reports of decreased CREB activation with aging, via increases in calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2001</xref>) and decreases in PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karege et al., 2001</xref>), we hypothesize that increasing the absolute levels of their substrate, CREB, would lead to an increase in the levels of pCREB and CREB activity. However, the detailed mechanistic relationship between the levels of CREB, pCREB, and CREB activity is unlikely to be straight forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briand et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A second parameter that might contribute to experimental variability is the nature of the CREB protein that is overexpressed. We found that CREB overexpression increased the intrinsic excitability of aged CA1 neurons. The AHPs from AAV-CREB infected neurons were reduced when compared to neighboring uninfected cells, or GFP-injected controls, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). These results mirror those from studies using pharmacological methods where treatment that reduced the AHP also facilitated cognitive performance in aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deyo et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kronforst-Collins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moyer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weible et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we found that CREB overexpression had no observable effect on the size of AHPs in young neurons. Previous studies using partially-active CREB-Y134F or VP16-CREB have demonstrated their ability to facilitate long-term potentiation and reduce the AHP in cells from young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). The increase in downstream transcription is likely to be much greater when a partially activated form of CREB, as opposed to wild-type, is used. This may in part explain why we did not see any effect of virus on AHP amplitude in cells from young animals.</p><p>A third variable is the excitability state of the animal at the time of training. Studies using CREB overexpression in young animals have produced mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al. (2009)</xref> used HSV-CREB to overexpress CREB in amygdala of mice, which resulted in a smaller AHP amplitude when measured 300 ms after the final action potential, as compared to neighboring control cells. Peak AHP was not found to be different (2009). Another study transfected primary mice hippocampal neurons to overexpress CREB and found that transfected cells had increased excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, when HSV-CREB was injected into locus coeruleus of rats, excitability was unchanged, as compared to rats injected with control virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2006</xref>). These varying results may be due to differences in slice vs. cultured neurons, mouse vs. rat tissue, or even due to differing brain regions, but we suspect that the âexcitability stateâ of the animals is a major uncontrolled determinant. In our hands, CREB overexpression was not sufficient to cause any differences in peak or slow AHP amplitude in CA1 neurons from young animals. Although we saw similar levels of CREB overexpression in both age groups, only the aged animals exhibited a change at the biophysical level. It is possible that while the young animals are already at an âoptimal stateâ, and have sufficient excitability or plasticity for learning and memory, the aged animals are in a âsub-optimal stateâ, and therefore have room for improvement. This effect has been demonstrated before, where systemic application of L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deyo et al., 1989</xref>) or cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weible et al., 2004</xref>) was beneficial for aged animals, but had no effect on young. Similarly, exposure to environmental enrichment, which can indirectly lead to increased CREB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), reduced the AHP in neurons from aged animals, but not young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar and Foster, 2007</xref>). For potential therapeutic purposes, this may be a desirable trait, so as to only affect those who have room for improvement.</p><p>Given our biophysical results, it is not surprising that AAV-CREB (vs. AAV-GFP) injections had no effect on any aspect of young animalsâ water maze performance. We have demonstrated that viral overexpression of CREB was achieved in these young animals, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of wild-type rat CREB, as opposed to a mutated form of CREB, may partly explain the lack of behavioral effect. Expression of VP16-CREB in young animals has led to transient facilitation of eye-blink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruart et al., 2012</xref>), as well as facilitation of memory for contextual and cued fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viosca et al., 2009a</xref>). Additionally, expression of a CREB-Y134F in young animals has given enhanced memory for both fear conditioning and water maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Restivo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). These studies suggest that the increase in CREB expression we observed with our AAV-CREB was not sufficient (when compared to that achieved by mutated forms of CREB) to facilitate the behavioral performance of young animals. However, some studies have shown facilitation of fear conditioning as a result of HSV overexpression of wild-type CREB in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Josselyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sekeres et al., 2010</xref>). In these studies, animals underwent weak training, where control animals failed to form a memory, but animals overexpressing CREB were able to do so. In the current study, we initially used a less challenging version of the water maze task, and delivered 4 sessions of training with five trials per session. We suspected this âstrongâ training may have produced a ceiling effect in our young animals, where increasing CREB activity could not lead to further improvements. Thus, we injected a new group of animals with AAV-GFP and AAV-CREB, and trained them on a more difficult version of the task, to determine if young CREB animalsâ performance would then be facilitated. The difficult version did prove more challenging, with both young and aged animals taking longer to learn the task, and spending less time in the target quadrant across probe trials as compared to the less challenging version. Interestingly, the pattern of behavioral results was very similar to that observed during the less challenging task: CREB mediated rescue in aged rats, but had no effect in young rats. This suggests that the difference between the viral overexpression of HSV and AAV may be at play. HSV is known to give strong, but transient gene expression, while AAV tends to provide more subtle, but stable expression over long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neve et al., 2005</xref>). These data indicate that strong CREB overexpression, such as in the case of HSV, or a mutant form of CREB is required to achieve behavioral facilitation in young adult animals, given that they are already at an âoptimal learning stateâ.</p><p>Notably, CREB mRNA levels were not related to behavioral performance. Young GFP and CREB groups whose behavior did not differ showed differing CREB mRNA levels; while AU and AI groups, who by definition differ in behavior, had the same levels of CREB mRNA. However, levels of CREB protein and pCREB have repeatedly been shown to be related to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brightwell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowansage et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Josselyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pittenger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viosca et al., 2009a</xref>). Importantly, we provide evidence that basal level of CREB protein is correlated to successful learning in aged rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that CREB mRNA and protein levels are not directly related to each other. Moreover, while CREB mRNA levels served to confirm viral overexpression, only CREB protein levels were predictive of behavioral performance.</p><p>Interestingly, CREB mRNA levels did not differ between young and aged animals in CA1, but it was reduced in DG of aged animals. While this is an important observation, given the lack of relationship between CA1 CREB mRNA levels and behavior, our focus continues to be on the CA1 sub-region. We chose to target this sub-region of the hippocampus as it has exhibited biophysical deficits with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Disterhoft and Oh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tombaugh et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, CA1 has been targeted to successfully facilitate memory in young animals with CREB overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sekeres et al., 2010</xref>). In our present study, targeting the CA1 sub-region has successfully enhanced intrinsic excitability of aged pyramidal neurons, with a corresponding amelioration of age-related memory deficits.</p><p>The postburst AHP is influenced by numerous manipulations. One of these is successful learning of a behavioral task, where animals that learn exhibit smaller AHPs than those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh and Disterhoft, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>). However, the learning-related reduction in postburst AHP is transient, and AHP amplitudes return to baseline within two weeks after the end of behavioral training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tombaugh et al., 2005</xref>). All biophysical recordings in this study were made between two to three weeks after the end of behavioral testing in order to measure the baseline AHP, and to avoid any learning-induced changes in the AHP. However, this still raises the question of how CREB overexpression resulted in the reduction of the AHP. CREB may modulate the AHP by indirectly influencing the levels or activity of AHP channels via one or more of CREBâs downstream transcriptional targets. Alternatively, it is possible that CREB could act on AHP channels via a previously unknown non-transcriptional mechanism. Elucidating this mechanism would be of great interest. Despite not fully understanding the mechanisms involved, the consequences of CREBâs enhancement of neuronal excitability have been examined. Neurons that have increased CREB activity become more excitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007</xref>), and are then preferentially recruited to form new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While previous studies have manipulated factors upstream of CREB, such as cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 1999</xref>), this is the first study to directly test CREBâs role in age-related cognitive deficits. Previous studies have shown increases in calcineurin with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2001</xref>), decreases in PKA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karege et al., 2001</xref>), and AI animals have been shown to have reduced CREB protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brightwell et al., 2004</xref>). All of these could result in decreases in CREB function, but only one study has manipulated CREB levels with aging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mouravlev et al. (2006)</xref> did a longitudinal study revealing that overexpressing wild-type CREB in young rats prevents age-related cognitive deficits from arising later in life. However, it was still unclear whether CREB would be able to reverse the age-related deficits after they arose. In our present study, CREB overexpression alone was sufficient to rescue the long-term memory deficits in aged animals. We hypothesize that CREBâs effects on behavioral performance may have been via the normalization of the previously reported deficits in CREB activity/function. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that CREB protein levels strongly correlate with performance on probe 4, where aged animals with the lowest levels of CREB protein performed the worst. This suggests that aged animals with low CREB protein levels are more likely to be AI. On the other hand, aged animals with high CREB protein levels, either naturally or due to AAV-CREB infusions, are more likely to perform at young-like levels. Alternatively, it is also possible that CREB overexpression may have compensated for age-related deficits via other mechanisms. Possibilities include CREBâs ability to modulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benito and Barco, 2010</xref>), and to induce preferential recruitment of neurons to form a new memory via increasing intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these findings contributing to a better understanding of the aging process, other studies have shown that CREB and its activation are also negatively impacted in Alzheimerâs disease. Amyloid âbeta treatment reduces CREB levels and can cause it to be retained in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arvanitis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pugazhenthi et al., 2011</xref>), while high BACE-1 levels reduce CREB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and CREB-mediated gene expression is aberrant in brains of Alzheimerâs patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Satoh et al., 2009</xref>). A recent study has also shown that Tau accumulation reduces CREB activity by increasing calcineurin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these results suggest that impaired, or sub-optimal CREB function in aging may make aged individuals more vulnerable to Alzheimerâs disease. Furthermore, this indicates that CREB may not only be targeted for amelioration of cognitive deficits seen in normal aging, it could also be an important pharmacological target in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimerâs disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Young adult (3â4 mo) and aged (29â30 mo) male F1 hybrid Fischer 344XBrown Norway (F344XBN) rats were used for this study.

All rats were housed in a temperature-controlled facility with a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water. They were group housed, and allowed to acclimate in the Northwestern University vivarium for a minimum of one week prior to any experimentation. All procedures were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All animals were handled according to protocols approved by Northwestern IACUC (Protocol number: IS00002081, Animals Welfare Assurance: A3283-01) following NIH guidelines.

The construct encoded the sequence for endogenous rat CREB, downstream of a chicken Î²-actin promoter with a CMV enhancer.

A second construct (AAV-GFP), lacking the CREB sequence served as a control (vectors were a generous gift from Dr. Corinna Burger).

A thin layer of ophthalmic ointment was applied to keep the eyes moist. Subjects were administered Buprenex sub-cutaneously (0.03 mg/kg) to minimize discomfort. The scalp was incised and retracted, and bilateral holes were drilled through the skull above the hippocampi at the injection sites in dorsal CA1. The injection sites were 5.0 mm posterior andÂ Â±3.0 mm lateral from bregma, and 2.1 mm ventral from the dura. Glass micropipettes with calibrated internal diameters were pulled and cut to have 30â45 Î¼m openings. Glass micropipettes were fitted to a blunt-tipped 10 Î¼L Hamilton syringe, mounted to the stereotaxic frame. For each injection, 1 Î¼L of vector was infused into the hippocampus at a rate of 0.1 Î¼L/min using a Stoelting QSI microinjection pump. The glass micropipette was left in place for an additional 5 min before being gradually removed from the brain. After both injections were complete the scalp was sutured, and animals were given Rimadyl sub-cutaneously (5 mg/kg) to alleviate post-surgical discomfort.

For each animal (5 young and four aged), three sections from the center of the infected area (600 Î¼m apart) were analyzed. From these sections, three non-overlapping z-stacks were collected from CA1 of each hippocampus, resulting in a total of a total of 18 z-stacks for each animal. The sum of the collapsed z-stack was used for subsequent analyses. The threshold of NeuN-positive signal was first set to encompass the signal from cells, but not debris or processes. The signal was then subjected to the Watershed function, followed by Analyze Particles to count how many NeuN-positive cells that z-stack contained. A âselectionâ was then created from a thresholded GFP signal. This was then applied to the NeuN signal, to count how many of the NeuN-positive cells were also GFP-positive, which was then expressed as a percentage. All image analysis was carried out using NIHâs ImageJ software.</p><p>Staining for CREB and GFP was done to determine whether AAV-CREB-infected cells express more CREB protein than uninfected cells from the same animal. Three sections from each animal were analyzed (5 young and four aged animals). Each section was from the edge of the infected area and separated by 200 Î¼m. From these sections three non-overlapping z-stacks were collected from area CA1 of each hemisphere of the hippocampus, resulting in a total of 18 z-stacks for each animal (three sections X 3 z-stacks X two hemispheres). The sum of each collapsed z-stack was used for subsequent analyses. The threshold of CREB signal was first set to encompass the signal from cell bodies, but not debris or processes. After subjecting the signal to the Watershed function, the intensity of each cell was measured along with ROI size. CREB intensity was then normalized to ROI area to ensure the intensity measurement was independent of ROI size (to account for potential differences in measured area). Cells were manually separated into GFP-positive (GFP+), and GFP-negative (GFP-) groups. For each z-stack, the average intensity for all GFP+ cells was calculated, as well as the average intensity for all GFP- cells. To quantify CREB levels in GFP+ cells relative to GFP- cells, the average CREB intensity from GFP+ cells was first normalized to the average CREB intensity from GFP- cells (average GFP+ intensity/ average GFP- intensity. This value was then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. Thus, GFP- cells had an average CREB intensity of 100%, and a higher percentage for the GFP+ cells was indicative of an increase in CREB levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Morris water maze: less challenging version</title><p>We used the Morris water maze task to assess learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory in seven young animals injected with AAV-GFP, seven young animals injected with AAV-CREB, 17 aged animals injected with AAV-GFP, and 15 aged animals injected with AAV-CREB. All training and probe trials were conducted in a circular pool (180 cm in diameter). The water (24Â Â±Â 1Â°C) was made opaque by the addition of white non-toxic paint. Ten minutes before each day of training or testing animals were individually housed in new cages. At the end of each daily session of water maze training animals were returned to their home cages. All animals were handled on three separate occasions, for at least 3 min each, in the week prior to the start of visible platform training.</p><p>We first trained the rats on a visible platform task to ensure they were capable of locating, navigating to, and climbing onto the escape platform. The rectangular escape platform (20.3 cm x 25.4 cm) was placed in the center of 1 of 4 quadrants of the pool, with the bottom of the platform sitting at the level of the water. No distinctive cues surrounded the pool, while the platform had several high-contrast visual cues attached to it. At the start of each trial, the animal was placed approximately 7.5 cm away from the wall of the pool, in the center of the quadrant opposite from the platform-containing quadrant. Each animal was given 60Â s to navigate to the visible platform. If the animal did not reach the platform after 60Â s, the experimenter gently guided the animal to the platform location. The location of the platform changed after every trial, and each animal received eight trials, with an inter-trial interval of 19Â Â±Â 1 min. This visible platform testing ensured that all animals used in subsequent behavioural experiments had no gross sensorimotor deficits, as they were able to swim, see, and climb onto the visible escape platform. All animals successfully reached the platform during the last trial of visible platform training, and no animals were excluded from further water maze training.</p><p>Three days after the conclusion of visible platform training, all animals were trained with a hidden platform task. Distinctive, high-contrast cues were placed on each of the walls surrounding the water maze pool. The circular escape platform (20 cm diameter) was placed in one quadrant, and submerged 2 cm below the water level, so that animals could not see the hidden platform. The location of the platform remained the same throughout hidden platform training. Each animal received 5 trials of hidden platform training per day, over four consecutive days (total 20 trials) with an inter-trial interval of 19Â Â±Â 1 min. Each trial began by placing the animal in the centre of one of the three quadrants that did not contain the hidden platform. Each animal was allowed 60 s to locate the escape platform. If the animal did not swim to the hidden platform after 60 s, the experimenter gently guided the animal to the platform. Upon reaching the platform, animals remained on the platform for a further 15 s, before being removed by the experimenter. The animalsâ cumulative proximity to the platform was measured for each training trial, then the average cumulative proximity was calculated for each animal for each of the 4 days of training.

Memory for the platform location was assessed by quantifying the percent of time each animal spent in the target quadrant of the pool during the first 20 s of the probe test. The target quadrant was the quadrant that contained the hidden platform during training. Similar to the cumulative proximity measure, percent time in target quadrant has been shown to be sensitive to age-related memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster, 2012</xref>).

The experimenter was blind to the infection status of the neurons during collection and analysis of biophysical data.</p><p>In order to confirm infection status of patched cells sections were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then stored in PBS until re-sectioning. To amplify the GFP and neurobiotin signals, tissue was first re-sectioned. Each slice was embedded in 8% agar then re-sectioned into 4â5 70 Î¼m sections. These were permeabilized in PBS-X, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 4 hr. Sections were incubated with chicken anti-GFP primary (1:2000, Abcam, #13970) overnight at 4Â°C. The next day, the tissue was washed with PBS-X, then incubated with anti-chicken IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor488 (1:375, Jackson Immunoresearch) and Streptavidin conjugated to AlexaFluor594 (1:1000, Life Technologies). After further washes, tissue was mounted using ProLong gold antifade (Life Technologies). Patched cells were examined for the presence of neurobiotin and GFP signal to determine infection status.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Four to five hippocampal slices were placed in RNAlater, and frozen. The major hippocampal sub-regions (CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus) were manually dissected from these slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">NÃºÃ±ez-Santana et al., 2014</xref>). Under a Stemi DV4 dissecting microscope (Zeiss), and on ice, a straight cut was first made in front of the blades of the dentate gyrus, to isolate the CA3 sub-region from each slice. The dentate gyrus was then peeled away from the CA1-subiculum, and the subiculum severed from CA1 and discarded. Tissues from the sub-regions were then frozen again before further processing. Tissue from CA1, CA3, or DG was first disrupted manually, then with a QiaShredder (Qiagen) column. RNA was subsequently extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturerâs directions. All samples were eluted in 30 uL RNase-free and DNase-free water. All samples were checked for integrity using Bioradâs Bioanalzyer (Hercules, CA) and RNA 6000 Pico chips (Biorad). All samples had RNA integrity numbers (RIN) of 7 or higher and therefore none were excluded from analysis. For each sample, equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). To ensure reagents were contaminant-free concurrent controls containing no VILO enzyme were made and carried through the rest of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiment.</p><p>All RT-PCR reactions were carried out in 384-well plates. Each well contained sample cDNA, primer and probe against target genes, and SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix (Biorad). Each plate included controls from the cDNA synthesis step, which lacked the reverse transcription enzyme, and wells in which water replaced the cDNA sample. These negative controls were to confirm that no genomic DNA was present, and that no reagents aside from sample cDNA contained template that could be amplified. All samples were run in triplicate, and reactions carried out on a 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</p><p>Primers and probes against GAPDH, CREB1, and GFP were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Utilizing GAPDH as the house-keeping gene, the fold change over young GFP animals were calculated for genes of interest using the ÎÎCt method.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><p>Gene</p></th><th valign="top"><p>Forward primer</p> </th><th valign="top"><p>Probe</p></th><th valign="top"><p>Reverse primer</p> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>GAPDH</p></td><td valign="top"><p>CCAGTAGACTCCACGACATAC</p></td><td valign="top"><p>CAGCACCAGCATCACCCCATTTG</p></td><td valign="top"><p>AACCCATCACCATCTTCCAG</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>CREB</p></td><td valign="top"><p>AGCACTTCCTACACAGCCT</p></td><td valign="top"><p>ATTCTCTTGCTGCTTCCCTGTTCTTCA</p></td><td valign="top"><p>CACTGCCACTCTGTTCTCTA</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>GFP</p></td><td valign="top"><p>GAACCGCATCGAGCTGAA</p></td><td valign="top"><p>ATCGACTTCAAGGAGGACGGCAAC</p></td><td valign="top"><p>TGCTTGTCGGCCATGATATAG</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Four to five hippocampal slices were immediately frozen on dry ice. While frozen and on ice, CA1 was manually isolated under a Stemi DV4 dissecting microscope (Zeiss) as described above. CA1 tissue was lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Each sample was manually dissociated with a syringe, and shaken at 4Â°C for 30 min. All samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min. The supernatants were retained and protein concentration measured by BCA assay (Pierce). Fifteen micrograms of each sample was boiled in 2x Laemmli buffer containing 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA). Samples were separated using 4â20% Mini Protean TGX gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred to Immobilin-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Temecula, CA). Blots were probed for CREB (Millipore Cat #04â767, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1586959">AB_1586959</ext-link>, 1:5000) and GAPDH (Thermo Fischer Scientific Cat #MA1-16757, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_568547">AB_568547</ext-link> 1:40000, Thermo Scientific, Waltman, CA). Anti-rabbit secondary was first used to react with the anti-CREB antibody. After imaging, HRP signal was quenched using 15% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. An anti-mouse secondary (Jackson) was then used to react with the anti-GAPDH primary. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a ChemiDoc XRS+ Molecular Imager System with ImageLab Software (Bio-Rad). Offline quantification of reactive bands also used ImageLab software. All gels were loaded with the same reference sample to allow for comparison across gels. All samples were normalized for loading error using GAPDH signal. Pearsonâs R values were determined to test for strength of correlations between CREB protein levels and behavioral performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Morris water maze: more difficult version</title><p>We determined whether the difficulty of the water maze task affected our results by training a new group of animals on a more difficult version of the task. Similar to the first group, we assessed learning and short-term memory in seven young animals injected with AAV-GFP, eight young animals injected with AAV-CREB, 15 aged animals injected with AAV-GFP, and eight aged animals injected with AAV-CREB. Unless otherwise noted, the training conditions remained the same as the previous protocol.</p><p>As before, we first trained the rats on 8 trials of a visible platform task (inter-trial interval of 19Â Â±Â 1 min) to ensure they were capable of locating, navigating to, and climbing onto the escape platform. All animals successfully reached the platform during the last trial of visible platform training, and no animals were excluded from further water maze training.</p><p>Three days after visible platform training, all animals were trained with a hidden platform task. The location of the platform remained the same throughout hidden platform training. Each animal received 3 trials of hidden platform training per day, over four consecutive days (total 12 trials). The inter-trial interval was 1 min. The animalsâ cumulative proximity to the platform was measured for each training trial, then the average cumulative proximity was calculated for each animal for each of the 4 days of training. We chose to use the cumulative proximity measurement as it has been shown to be sensitive to age-related cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallagher et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>To test for memory for the platform location probe trials were performed 1 hr after each day of hidden platform training. Memory for the platform location was assessed by quantifying the percent of time each animal spent in the target quadrant of the pool during the first 20 s of the probe test. The target quadrant was the quadrant that contained the hidden platform during training. Similar to the cumulative proximity measure, percent time in target quadrant has been shown to be sensitive to age-related memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster, 2012</xref>). Unlike in the less challenging version of the task, no reminder hidden platform trial was given after each probe trial. WaterMaze software was used for computerized tracking during trials and for subsequent offline analysis (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL).</p><p>One hour after the last probe trial, animals were euthanized to collect tissue for RT-PCR. Hippocampi were isolated and frozen in RNAlater. The CA1 sub-region was dissected and RNA extracted as described above. RT-PCR reactions for CREB were carried out as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented at mean Â± SEM. N is number of animals, except for biophysical experiments, where n is number of cells. To minimize number of animals used, only nÂ =Â 4â5 animals were used for the immunofluorescent staining. For behavior, seven young animals were used for each treatment, while approximately double this number of aged animals were used to accommodate for their increased variance due to presence of both aged impaired and aged unimpaired animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curlik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallagher and Nicolle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knuttinen et al., 2001a</xref>).</p><p>GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis. One sample t-test, two-tailed student t-tests, one-way, and two-way ANOVAs with Tukeyâs or Bonferroniâs multiple comparisons tests were used as appropriate. Normality was tested using DâAgnostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Three-way repeated measures ANOVAs were run using Statview version 5.0.1. Significance levels were set at p=0.05. Significance for comparisons: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Northwestern University NUSeq Core Facility.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tom Foster (Reviewer #2); Aline Marighetto (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were generally enthusiastic about the paper, although one reviewer had major reservations and requested an additional analysis, and all the reviewers requested substantial revisions for clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is there sufficient statistical power to detect the effects of CREB in young animals?</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors propose that one reason why they might not have seen memory enhancements in young CREB animals is due to the difficulty of the task for young animals.

Throughout the manuscript, the language used to imply that the results were due to CREB activity should be modified to indicate that the results were due to increased expression. For example: However, it has yet to be tested if &quot;increasing CREB activity also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits&quot;. This sentence should be altered. A review of the literature suggests that there is considerable support for the idea that induction of CREB activity (the level of pCREB) regulates memory in aged animals. Other examples include: Genoux et al., 2002; Porte et al., 2007; Countryman and Gold, 2007). The authors do not have to include these other references, but the point is that there is considerable evidence that learning induced pCREB or increasing pCREB during learning in aged animals improves memory and it has yet to be tested if &quot;increasing CREB expression in aged animals will also ameliorates age-related behavioral and biophysical deficits&quot;.</p><p>5) In the Discussion, the authors may want to suggest that increasing CREB expression alters CREB activity. In this case, a statement suggesting the mechanism by which increased expression of CREB increases pCREB would be appreciated.</p><p>6) Speculation on how CREB expression influenced the AHP would also be appreciated. In discussing the idea that increased CREB expression influenced the AHP, the authors should consider the possibility that the change in the AHP is an epiphenomena due to CREB effects on behavior, rather than a direct effect of CREB expression. This point could be related to the work of the authors and others, which indicate that a decrease in the AHP is observed for young and aged animals that learn/remember on hippocampal-dependent tasks. The authors' data indicate a lack of effect of CREB on the AHP of young animals. Is it possible that the lack of effect on the AHP of young animals is due to the possibility that young animals were able to learn/remember on the hippocampal-dependent task regardless of CREB expression?</p><p>7) Similarly, the ability to modify the AHP in aged but not young animals (Discussion, fourth paragraph), a similar age specific effect is also noted for environmental enrichment which reduces the AHP in aged, but not young animals (Kumar and Foster, 2007) possibly due to differences in the ability to adapt to stress associated with behavioral experience.</p><p>8) Another major concern was that no evidence is provided that CA1 CREB expression (or activity) would diminish in aging. On the contrary, according to molecular analyses performed in the present study, there is, under control conditions, an age-related reduction in CREB mRNA levels in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but not in the CA1 area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The reviewer was surprised to find no mention of these negative findings neither in the Results section nor in the Discussion. The lack of evidence for any age-related change in local CREB expression (or activity) has important implications for interpreting the positive effects of overexpressing CREB in the aged CA1. If CREB expression is not altered by aging, present rescue of age-related defects in memory and cellular excitability cannot reflect normalization of CREB activity/function, but might rather be due to the fact that overexpressing CREB can compensate for age-related changes in alternative cellular pathways. In that sense, the present study fails to elucidate critical molecular mechanisms involved in the age-related cognitive decline, and does not identify CREB as a key player. As one possible attempt to improve the paper and provide more convincing support to the authors' conclusion, it was suggested that the authors reanalyze molecular data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (A, B, C</xref>) by dividing the Aged control group (N=17) into two subgroups: Aged Impaired and Aged Unimpaired (according to the performance in the Probe Trial performed 4 days after the last session of acquisition in the Morris water maze, i.e. just as done previously for behavioral analyzes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). If a difference in CREB mRNA levels was to be found between the two aged groups (AI &lt; AU), I would not disagree any longer with the conclusion on CREB being a key player in cognitive aging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19358.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Is there sufficient statistical power to detect the effects of CREB in young animals?</italic> </p><p>Published behavioral studies with rats and mice, including those from our laboratory, have routinely reported findings with Nâs of 5-10 animals per behavioral group. Examples include McKay et al. 2012, Matthews et al. 2009, Sekeres et al. 2010, and Josselyn et al. 2001. Therefore, we do believe that with Nâs of 7-8 for our young groups, there is indeed sufficient statistical power to detect an effect of CREB, if it were present. We have also re-colored the young data points to differentiate between GFP and CREB data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref>, which shows near identical distribution, with substantial overlap of the two young groups.</p><p><italic>2) In the Discussion, the authors propose that one reason why they might not have seen memory enhancements in young CREB animals is due to the difficulty of the task for young animals. It would be helpful to determine whether CREB impacts memory in young animals in a more difficult version of the task.</italic> </p><p>To fully answer this question, we trained a new group of AAV-GFP and AAV-CREB injected animals on a more difficult version of the water maze task (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The new data showed that in fact young animals were still not impacted by AAV-CREB, even on the more difficult version of the task, which removes the possibility of a ceiling effect causing the lack of facilitation. These results do not concur with studies showing facilitated behavioral performance in young animals using HSV virus, or mutant forms of CREB. We believe that the differing results can predominantly be attributed to the nature of the gene expression achieved by HSV vs. AAV. HSV tends to give expression that is short lasting and strong, while AAV is more subtle and stable. Given young animals are already in an âoptimal stateâ we believe that stronger CREB overexpression, such as that achieved by HSV, or a mutant form of CREB is required to facilitate young behavior. This is discussed in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) The authors did not cite the first paper to have demonstrated the involvement of CREB in memory in mammals (Bourtchuladze et al., Cell 1994).</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the oversight, which has been corrected. The citation has been added to the Introduction of the manuscript (third paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) A concern is the implication that the effects were due to CREB activity and the idea that little is known about age-related changes in CREB activity. Throughout the manuscript, the language used to imply that the results were due to CREB activity should be modified to indicate that the results were due to increased expression.

We have modified the text to replace âCREB activityâ with âCREB levelsâ or âCREB expressionâ where appropriate.</p><p><italic>5) In the Discussion, the authors may want to suggest that increasing CREB expression alters CREB activity. In this case, a statement suggesting the mechanism by which increased expression of CREB increases pCREB would be appreciated.</italic> </p><p>Upon the reviewersâ suggestion, we have included a section in the Discussion (second paragraph). Taking into consideration that CREB activation is thought to be decreased with aging (via increases in calcineurin and decreases in PKA), we suggest that increasing absolute amounts of substrate, CREB, would lead to increased levels of absolute pCREB.However, there have been suggestions that CREB activity may not rely solely on pCREB levels, this has also been acknowledged in the same section.</p><p><italic>6) Speculation on how CREB expression influenced the AHP would also be appreciated. In discussing the idea that increased CREB expression influenced the AHP, the authors should consider the possibility that the change in the AHP is an epiphenomena due to CREB effects on behavior, rather than a direct effect of CREB expression.

While it is not currently understood how CREB might directly affect the AHP, we have now added our thoughts on the possible mechanisms at play. Importantly, we do not believe our observed effects on the AHP are driven by the animalsâ behavioral performance, due to the time point at which we measured the AHP; 2-3 weeks after the last behavioral test. Previous biophysical studies have shown that learning-induced changes to the AHP return to baseline two weeks after the end of behavioral testing (Moyer et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1996; Tombaugh et al., 2005). Furthermore, previously published studies in young animals indicate that increasing CREB activation or CREB overexpression reduces AHP size in neurons (Lopez de Armentia et al., 2007), which in turn makes those neurons more likely to be a part of a new memory engram (Han et al., 2007, Zhou et al. 2009, Yiu et al. 2014). Therefore, we believe that the observed behavioral facilitation was a result of the AHP size, rather the than other way around.</p><p><italic>7) Similarly, the ability to modify the AHP in aged but not young animals (Discussion, fourth paragraph), a similar age specific effect is also noted for environmental enrichment which reduces the AHP in aged, but not young animals (Kumar and Foster, 2007) possibly due to differences in the ability to adapt to stress associated with behavioral experience.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. The citation has been added (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) Another major concern was that no evidence is provided that CA1 CREB expression (or activity) would diminish in aging. On the contrary, according to molecular analyses performed in the present study, there is, under control conditions, an age-related reduction in CREB mRNA levels in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but not in the CA1 area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The reviewer was surprised to find no mention of these negative findings neither in the Results section nor in the Discussion. The lack of evidence for any age-related change in local CREB expression (or activity) has important implications for interpreting the positive effects of overexpressing CREB in the aged CA1. If CREB expression is not altered by aging, present rescue of age-related defects in memory and cellular excitability cannot reflect normalization of CREB activity/function, but might rather be due to the fact that overexpressing CREB can compensate for age-related changes in alternative cellular pathways. In that sense, the present study fails to elucidate critical molecular mechanisms involved in the age-related cognitive decline, and does not identify CREB as a key player. As one possible attempt to improve the paper and provide more convincing support to the authors' conclusion, it was suggested that the authors reanalyze molecular data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (A, B, C</xref>) by dividing the Aged control group (N=17) into two subgroups: Aged Impaired and Aged Unimpaired (according to the performance in the Probe Trial performed 4 days after the last session of acquisition in the Morris water maze, i.e. just as done previously for behavioral analyzes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). If a difference in CREB mRNA levels was to be found between the two aged groups (AI &lt; AU), I would not disagree any longer with the conclusion on CREB being a key player in cognitive aging.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important issue. We reanalyzed the molecular data of the aged control animals as suggested, but did not find a difference in CREB mRNA levels between AI and AU animals (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that CREB mRNA levels are not related to behavioral performance. However, numerous studies have shown CREB protein levels/activation to be impaired with aging (Foster et al., 2001, Karege et al., 2001), more specifically, AI rats have less CREB protein than AU (Brightwell et al., 2004). Together, our present CREB mRNA results and previous CREB protein reports suggest that while CREB function is impaired at the protein level, CREB mRNA levels are not a biomarker of behavioral performance. Therefore, we also carried out western blots on previously frozen tissue from the aged GFP animals trained on the less challenging water maze protocol. Unlike previous reports on CREB protein, which either measured levels from naÃ¯ve animals, or from trained animals shortly after training, we measured basal levels of CREB protein (2-3 weeks after the behavioral testing was completed). At this time point, we show that an animalsâ basal levels of CREB protein is highly predictive of their behavioral performance â in this case on probe 4 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Given this evidence from our new results and previous studies from others, we believe it is very likely our behavioral results were due to a normalization of impaired CREB function. However, as the reviewers correctly pointed out, we have not ruled out the possibility that CREB overexpression led to biophysical and behavioral benefits via other means. These points of discussion have now been included in the revised manuscript (Discussion, last two paragraphs).</p></body></sub-article></article>
