ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells’ (Garnett et al., 2012). Here we report the results. We found Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines, overall, were more sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib than osteosarcoma cell lines; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4C; Garnett et al., 2012), it was not statistically significant. Further, mouse mesenchymal cells transformed with either the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> or <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> rearrangement displayed similar sensitivities to olaparib, whereas the Ewing’s sarcoma cell line SK-N-MC had increased olaparib sensitivity. In the original study, mouse mesenchymal cells transformed with the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> rearrangement and SK-N-MC cells were found to have similar sensitivities to olaparib, whereas mesenchymal cells transformed with the <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> rearrangement displayed a reduced sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4E; Garnett et al., 2012). We also studied another Ewing’s sarcoma cell line, A673: A673 cells depleted of <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> or a negative control both displayed similar sensitivities to olaparib, whereas the original study reported a decreased sensitivity to olaparib when <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> was depleted (Figure 4F; Garnett et al., 2012). Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as the use of different sarcoma cell lines and level of knockdown efficiency, are factors that might have influenced the outcomes. Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>Ewing's sarcoma</kwd><kwd>poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced some parts of the original paper but other parts could not be interpreted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>) for a 2012 paper by Garnett et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2012, Garnett et al. reported the results of a large-scale high throughput screen to identify novel interactions between investigational drugs and cancer-derived human cell lines, along with a similar study published at the same time by Barretina and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to capturing expected gene-drug interactions, several unpredicted associations were identified, including an enhanced sensitivity between the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation of Ewing’s sarcoma family tumors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). Selective inhibition of cell survival and proliferation in Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines was observed with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, comparable to the observed inhibition in <italic>BRCA</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). Further, the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation was reported to be sufficient for increased sensitivity of cells to olaparib, while transient depletion of <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> from Ewing’s sarcoma cells resulted in partial rescue of olaparib sensitivity, suggesting the sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cells to olaparib might be related to EWS-FLI1 transcriptional activity.</p><p>The Registered Report for the 2012 paper by Garnett et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 4C and E–F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>). Additional studies have reported hypersensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ordóñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>). However, studies extending the use of olaparib, or other PARP inhibitors, as monotherapies in xenograft models have reported limited effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ordóñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with no objective responses from a phase II study of olaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choy et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with these observations, a new methodology for biomarker discovery, that accounts for variability in general levels of drug sensitivity, failed to find a statistically significant association of PARP inhibitors and the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geeleher et al., 2016</xref>). However, studies testing combinatorial treatments of PARP inhibitors with other drugs, such as the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide, have reported enhanced sensitivity of Ewing sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ordóñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>), with several clinical trials beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pishas and Lessnick, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study reported that cells with <italic>SLFN11</italic> inactivation are more resistant to PARP inhibitors, as single agents or in combination with temozolomide; however combination with an ATR inhibitor can overcome this resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murai et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to PARP inhibition</title><p>We sought to independently replicate whether Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines were more sensitive to the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, than control cell lines. This experiment is comparable to what was reported in Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 16 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al. (2012)</xref> and described in Protocol 1 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>). While the original study included a comparison of Ewing’s sarcoma cells to cell lines from other tumor types, this replication attempt was restricted to osteosarcoma cells. Similar to the original study, a <italic>BRCA2</italic>-deficient cell line (DoTc2-4510) and a <italic>BRCA</italic>-proficient cell line (MES-SA) were included to capture differential sensitivity to olaparib across genotypes. Olaparib sensitivity was determined for each cell line using a colony formation assay over a range of concentrations (0.1, 0.32, 1, 3.2, or 10 µM) with the effective concentration determined as the olaparib concentration at which the number of colonies were reduced by at least 90% compared to vehicle control. Similar to the original study, DoTc2-4510 cells were found to be highly sensitive to olaparib (0.1 µM), while MES-SA were largely resistant (10 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The median effective concentration of osteosarcoma cell lines (n = 7) was 3.2 µM (range: 3.2 µM - 10 µM), while the median effective concentration of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines (n = 5) was 1 µM (range: 0.1 µM - 10 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This compares to the original study that reported a median effective concentration of 3.2 µM (range: 1 µM - 10 µM) for osteosarcoma cell lines (n = 8) and 1 µM (range: 0.32 µM - 1 µM) for Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines (n = 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29747.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to olaparib.</title><p>Colony formation assays were performed on the indicated cell lines in the presence of a range of olaparib concentrations (0.1, 0.32, 1, 3.2, or 10 µM) or vehicle control (DMSO).

The effective concentration displayed for each cell line is defined as the concentration that reduced colony formation by greater than 90% compared to vehicle control.

Using a sample size determined <italic>a priori</italic> to detect the effect based on the originally reported data, the comparison of the effective concentrations of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to osteosarcoma cell lines was not statistically significant (<italic>U</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic>=0.390). Thus, the null hypothesis that the effective concentration of olaparib is similar for Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines can not be rejected. A similar result was obtained with a duplicate set of plates using the same cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the original study and not statistically significant.</p><p>These results should take into consideration that other methods to assess olaparib sensitivity, such as cellular viability assays, did not result in all Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines tested being acutely sensitive to PARP inhibitors, but rather a majority displaying increased sensitivity with some cell lines relatively insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the cellular viability assays utilized a larger sample size compared to the colony formation assay reported here. The sample size used for this replication attempt was determined from the effect reported in the original study between Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Although the replication study was powered to detect the original effect size estimate with at least 80% power, both the original study and this replication used relatively small sample sizes, which can confound the findings and prevent them from being extrapolated to the overall population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Button et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faber and Fonseca, 2014</xref>). Similarly, only five of the cell lines tested were the same between the two studies, largely due to the inability to obtain any of the Ewing’ sarcoma cell lines used in the original study. These factors, among others, influence the research outcome of each designed experiment. Further studies should take into account both of these results, especially when considering the number of cell lines to test.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sensitivity to olaparib in cells transformed with the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> rearrangement</title><p>The <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> rearrangement is characteristic of Ewing’s sarcoma tumors and in the original study was identified as a statistically significant association with olaparib sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether the sensitivity to olaparib was due to the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> rearrangement, we independently replicated an experiment comparing olaparib sensitivity in mouse mesenchymal cells transformed with <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic>, or <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> a related liposarcoma-associated translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Riggi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2005</xref>). This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 4E of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al. (2012)</xref> and described in Protocol 2 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>). Using the same transformed mouse mesenchymal cells as the original study, as well as the human Ewing’s sarcoma cell line SK-N-MC for comparison, sensitivity to olaparib was determined using a cellular viability assay over a range of concentrations. During the course of the assay, the cells continued to proliferate in no drug conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), a necessary condition since olaparib sensitivity relies on cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale Rein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weston et al., 2010</xref>). While the SK-N-MC cells displayed sensitivity to olaparib with a mean IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.67 µM, 95% CI [3.11–2.23], the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> and <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> transformed mouse mesenchymal cells were both relatively resistant with more than 50% of cells remaining viable at the highest dose tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This compares to the original study that reported <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> transformed mouse mesenchymal cells displaying olaparib sensitivity similar to SK-N-MC cells (estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.1 µM for <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> and 1.5 µM for SK-N-MC) with <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> transformed cells remaining relatively resistant (estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of 7.8 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). The analysis plan specified in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>) proposed to compare the IC<sub>50</sub> values from <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> transformed cells, or SK-N-MC cells, to <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> transformed cells, however as stated above this could not be performed because of the inability to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values for either of the transformed mouse mesenchymal cells.

RNA concentration and purity was determined with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) (data available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/2kz7n/">https://osf.io/2kz7n/</ext-link>). Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR were then performed in technical triplicate using <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> and mouse <italic>Actb</italic> specific primers (<italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> primer is same as above; <italic>Actb</italic> sequence is: Forward: 5’-GACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTG-3’, Reverse: 5’-GATTACTGCTCTGGCTCCTAG-3’) at 200 nM final concentration, and Perfecta SYBR green FastMix according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions were the same as described above. Negative controls containing water with no cDNA template, as well as cDNA template without reverse transcriptase were included.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with R software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>), version 3.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">R Core Team, 2017</xref>). All data, csv files, and analysis scripts are available on the OSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/nbryi/">https://osf.io/nbryi/</ext-link>). Confirmatory statistical analysis was pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/wt8df/">https://osf.io/wt8df/</ext-link>) before the experimental work began as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>). Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error or the <italic>p</italic>-value. The Bonferroni corrected value was determined by divided the uncorrected value (.05) by the number of tests performed. A meta-analysis of a common original and replication effect size was performed with a random effects model and the <italic>metafor</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viechtbauer, 2010</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/whs6e/">https://osf.io/whs6e/</ext-link>). For the colony formation analysis, to obtain an overall effect size estimate from this replication attempt, the estimates from the two repeats were combined with a fixed effects model. Furthermore, all meta-analyses were performed without weighting, since unweighted Cliff’s <italic>d</italic> has been reported to reduce bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kromrey et al., 2005</xref>). The asymmetric confidence intervals for the overall Cliff’s <italic>d</italic> estimate was determined using the normal deviate corresponding to the (1 - alpha/2)th percentile of the normal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliff, 1993</xref>). The original study data presented in Figure 4C was extracted <italic>a priori</italic> from the published figure by determining the height of each bar, while the summary data (mean and standard deviation) pertaining to Figure 4E-F were shared by the original authors. The data and estimated IC<sub>50</sub> values for Figure 4E-F were published in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanden Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>) and used in the power calculations to determine the sample size for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Deviations from registered report</title><p>The source of FBS, RPMI 1640, DMEM, high-glucose, and SYBR Green PCR mix were different than what is listed in the Registered Report, with the used source and catalog number listed above. Statistical analysis proposed in the Registered Report for some of the experiments were unable to be performed as described above. We also included an additional test to confirm the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> rearrangement in the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells shared for this replication attempt. Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology would like to thank Dr. Cyril Benes (Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center) for sharing critical information and data and Dr. Ivan Stamenkovic (CHUV) for sharing the transformed mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells.

For example, failing to reject the null hypothesis (that Ewing's Sarcoma and other tested cell lines are equivalently sensitive to olaparib) does not mean we accept the null hypothesis, only that there is insufficient evidence at the predefined level of significance and power (sample size) to reject the null hypothesis. We do agree that the results we report could be attributed to the use of different sarcoma cell lines and a level of siRNA knockdown of EWS-FLI relative to the original study and have revised the Abstract to highlight this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
