Ligand chemotaxis has been biochemically investigated using mammalian and model systems, but precision of chemotaxis towards ligands being actively secreted by live bacteria is not well studied, nor has there been systematic analyses of interrelationships between chemotaxis and phagocytosis. The genetic/molecular model <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and mammalian phagocytes share mechanistic pathways for chemotaxis and phagocytosis; <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotax toward bacteria and phagocytose them as food sources. We quantified <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotaxis towards live gram positive and gram negative bacteria and demonstrate high sensitivity to multiple bacterially-secreted chemoattractants. Additive/competitive assays indicate that intracellular signaling-networks for multiple ligands utilize independent upstream adaptive mechanisms, but common downstream targets, thus amplifying detection at low signal propagation, but strengthening discrimination of multiple inputs. Finally, analyses of signaling-networks for chemotaxis and phagocytosis indicate that chemoattractant receptor-signaling is not essential for bacterial phagocytosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24627.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24627.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meena</surname><given-names>Netra Pal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eukaryotic chemotaxis to live bacteria was quantified at a high throughput level, for the first time, and mechanistically examined for the interrelationship between chemotaxis and phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Professional phagocytes hunt and destroy bacteria and other small non-related single-celled organisms, and survey for apoptotic or necrotic cells and cell remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulais et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niedergang et al., 2016</xref>).

Particle interaction at the cell surface induces an actin re-organization, forming a cup in the plasma membrane that surrounds the particle for engulfment and re-direction to lysosomes for degradation.

Thus, it has been possible to identify GPCRs for specific chemoattractant ligands, intracellular pathways that become highly polarized in comparison to shallow extracellular gradients, and signaling networks that regulate directional cytoskeletal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artemenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graziano and Weiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>). Still, quantitative analyses of definitive bacterial sensing have been limited. Here, we utilize growth-phase <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to dissect differential responses to live gram positive and gram negative bacteria and, thereby, define high sensitivity to bacterial populations and their secreted chemoattractants (&lt;0.5 nM) and conditions for additive or competitive responses to multiple chemoattractants. We show that multiple, low signal inputs provide a mode to amplify detection for chemotaxis to limited bacterial numbers. Conversely, since adaptive pathways for individual chemoattractants are mechanistically separated, cells can discern and migrate within a defined chemical gradient, even in the presence of other non-directional, saturating signals.</p><p>Finally, we considered if chemotactic cell surface receptor signaling <italic>via</italic> pseudopod extension mediates phagocytosis through locally enhanced host-bacterial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swanson and Baer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinrich and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niedergang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray and Botelho, 2017</xref>). Utilizing strains lacking or expressing specific chemoattractant GPCRs, we demonstrate that phagocytosis is minimally dependent on bacterial chemoattractant sensing; GPCR-deficient lines exhibit similar high efficiencies for phagocytosis as do corresponding strains that express WT (wild-type) GPCRs, regardless of their ability to respond chemotactically.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemotaxis of growth-phase <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to folate</title><p>The Essen IncuCyte system allows real-time imaging of chemotaxis in 96 individual compartments of a multi-tiered, micro-well plate.

Growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> are also highly chemotactic and, as active phagocytes during this part of their life cycle, present an excellent alternative to extend and unify analyses for chemotaxis to and phagocytosis of bacteria.</p><p>We have established conditions that allow the high sensitive detection/migration to bacteria by growth-phase <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and identify both folate and cAMP as active bacterially secreted chemoattractants, atÂ &lt;0.5 nM sensitivity. Although we had previously shown that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> express cAMP receptors during growth at sufficient levels for biochemical response to cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), migratory behavior of growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to cAMP had been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veltman et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless when cAMP signal concentrations are applied atÂ &gt;100 fold levels, chemotactic response to cAMP during growth is similarly sensitive to that of folate, even using other assay systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The ability of growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to respond to bacterially-secreted cAMP may provide an additional signal for nutrient sensing, which would suppress the transitional switch from growth to development, where starved <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> utilize chemotaxis to secreted cAMP as a mode for multi-cell recognition and aggregate formation.</p><p>Several parameters that influence the shape of individual chemoattractant gradients are also critical to enhance migratory response. For folate and cAMP, the diffusion from a concentrated signal in the bottom well to a âzeroâ signal in the upper chamber creates an initial highly steep gradient that would be expected to diminish with time, even as total chemoattractant levels in the upper chamber rise. The secretion and accumulation of chemoattractant de-activating enzymes (deaminase for folate; PDE for cAMP) by <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> serve to attenuate signal levels in close cellular proximity, thereby strengthening the concentration of the gradient and reinforcing directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackenzie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>). Other systems may utilize analogous mechanisms to amplify signaling gradients through ligand degradation, sequestration, or de novo synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muinonen-Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scherber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Venkiteswaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DonÃ  et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boldajipour et al., 2008</xref>). Also with time, as large sub-populations of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> migrate up the gradient (<italic>i.e</italic>. toward the lower chamber), these secreted ligand-degrading enzymes would eliminate chemoattractant signals at the rear of the moving cells, shielding lagging cells from recruitment for activation and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackenzie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>). For migration to bacteria, the continued secretion and accumulation of chemoattractants in the bottom chamber would create a dynamically changing gradient shape, with an exponentially increasing stimulus of the phagocytes, as they approach the source for chemoattractant secretion.</p><p>At least 6 signaling arms are activated downstream of chemoattractant receptors in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Haastert and Veltman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMains et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artemenko et al., 2014</xref>). Although low level (<italic>e.g</italic>. 1 nM) chemoattractant stimulation may elicit too weak a response to be detectable in an individual biochemical read-out, the collective and coordinated activities of multiple signaling paths are sufficient to initiate directed migration, atÂ &lt;0.5 nM. Since chemotactic signaling networks are shared among <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, macrophages, and neutrophils, it is likely that similar interplays function during immune response to ensure high sensitivity for chemotaxis. We suggest that bacterial detection may be further enhanced under conditions of even more limited (<italic>e.g</italic>. 0.1 nM) signal production, where phagocytes migrate toward multiple bacterially-secreted chemoattractants that can act cooperatively at low concentrations. Of note, bacterial chemoattractant production levels and gradients were assayed at conditions (<italic>e.g</italic>. 22Â°C, in buffer) optimal for <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>; it may be anticipated thatÂ &lt;0.1x bacterial numbers could be detected within a mammalian physiological mileu (<italic>e.g</italic>. 37Â°C).</p><p>At the other end of the concentration spectrum (&gt;100 Î¼M), <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemotaxis is diminished (data not shown). At these concentrations, there is ligand-specific down regulation of GrlL/fAR1 (NPM and ARK, in preparation) and CAR1 protein and mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimmel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klein et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louis et al., 1993</xref>). We suggest that reduced chemotaxis of growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> toward areas of very high chemoattractant concentration may be an avoidance measure, since <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> have reduced viability in the presence of extreme bacterial density [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nasser et al., 2013</xref>) NPM and ARK, in preparation].</p><p>The ability of individual growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> to simultaneously respond to multiple chemoattractants permitted analyses of both additive and competitive effects. Although migratory responses to multiple chemoattractants may be enhanced at low concentrations in comparison to a single chemoattractant, such cooperating effects are not observed at saturating doses, indicating that pathways activated downstream of the separate receptors must function in common. At globally applied, saturating levels of ligand, migratory cells lose directional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMains et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artemenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>). These cells undergo an initial rapid stimulatory activation, but then become unresponsive and globally adapt multiple receptor-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMains et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artemenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>). Quiescence persists if extracellular ligand concentrations remain saturated. Identification of adaptive mechanisms has been elusive. Although certain mathematical models have suggested that adaptive pathways must act globally and downstream of GPCRs, we have demonstrated otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Cells adapted to one chemoattractant remain fully responsive to a different stimulus, indicative of ligand selective adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). We have also shown that part of the adaptive network is mediated by GPCR phosphorylation, induced by ligand-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brzostowski et al., 2013</xref>). We further confirm, here, that cells plated in the presence or absence of saturating (adapting) folate (or reciprocally cAMP) are equally chemotactic to cAMP (or folate), indicating that adaptive mechanisms are not shared between the folate and cAMP pathways.</p><p>These data suggest a mechanistic model for chemotactic response under varying signaling parameters that maximize phagocytic behavior. Activations by low-dose stimulation with multiple chemoattracts will amplify gradient detection and low density bacterial sensing. However, cells that have become desensitized though ligand saturation by one chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), remain fully responsive to activation by other bacterially secreted chemoattractants.</p><p>For phagocytes, chemotaxis is a means to engage prey. Both chemotaxis and phagocytosis require polymerized actin at defined membrane surfaces, and there has been conjecture if such interconnected processes act antagonistically and/or cooperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maniak et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinrich and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veltman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veltman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Junemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). Actin-associated PIP<sub>3</sub> levels can accumulate at the leading membrane edge of cells that are migrating within chemoattractant gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parent et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meili et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Servant et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, PIP<sub>3</sub> membrane patches have been shown to co-localize with phagocytic cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). In this connection, it has been suggested that chemoattractant-mediated receptor activation of PI3K may coordinate localized accumulation of PIP<sub>3</sub> to promote actin polymerization and phagocytic cup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Workers have argued that cells lacking the folate chemoattractant receptor have diminished PIP<sub>3</sub>-signaling and phagocytosis compared to WT, and connected a direct dependency for folate-mediated PIP<sub>3</sub> localization with phagocytic cup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). These conclusions, however, are not fully compatible with our data or with that of other published work.</p><p>We systematically compared the chemotactic ability of cells lacking the folate receptor (<italic>grlL</italic>/<italic>far1</italic>-nulls) with <italic>grlL</italic>/<italic>far1</italic>-null cells that had been engineered to re-express GrlL/fAR1 and demonstrated the absence of folate chemotaxis by <italic>grlL</italic>/<italic>far1</italic>-nulls and the definitive rescue of chemotaxis to folate and to folate-secreting <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> by re-expression of GrlL/fAR1. Regardless of chemotactic ability, both cell lines exhibited identical parameters for bacterial phagocytosis. Similarly, although <italic>car1</italic>-null cells are chemotactically insensitive to cAMP, they are as active as chemotactically-positive, CAR1-expressing cells for bacterial phagocytosis. To avoid complications of folate- and cAMP-receptor co-dependence on the phagocytoisis of bacteria that secrete both chemoattractants, we separately confirmed the chemotactic and phagocytic properties of <italic>grlL</italic>/<italic>far1</italic>-null and GrlL/fAR1-expressing cells using <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, whose primary secreted chemoattractant is folate. We do not detect a significant contribution of chemo-sensing activation <italic>via</italic> GrlL/fAR1 or other chemoattractant receptors to mediate phagocytosis by adherent <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Neither did we detect differences in phagocytosis between chemotactically activated or quiescent WT <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Finally, we showed that WT <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> or cells that are deficient for the folate chemoattractant receptor phagocytose folate-coated and non-coated, control latex beads to equivalent rates.</p><p>Our conclusions are supported by additional evidence. We did not detect differences in bacterial phagocytosis when comparing <italic>GÎ±4</italic>-nulls to WT controls, consistent with other observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peracino et al., 1998</xref>). Although a partial dependency on GÎ±4 for phagocytosis of latex beads has been suggested in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gotthardt et al., 2006</xref>), these data were derived independently of the presence of folate. It is well appreciated that GÎ² in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has a significant role for bacterial phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peracino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gotthardt et al., 2006</xref>), and it is argued that GÎ² becomes activated downstream of the folate receptor for control of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). However, where cells lacking GÎ² show aÂ &gt;3x reduced growth rate on bacteria in shaking culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peracino et al., 1998</xref>), the published growth rate of <italic>far1</italic>-null cells on bacteria is reduced by onlyÂ ~0.2x compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a limited absolute role for folate receptor signaling in long-term bacterial phagocytosis. A universal requirement for chemoattractant receptor activation of G proteins in the regulation of phagocytosis is, also, not supported by other studies. Mammalian cells lacking all GÎ² subunits have similar rates of phagocytosis compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). We recognize that GÎ²Â subunits localize with phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desjardins et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gotthardt et al., 2006</xref>), although it has also been suggested that GÎ² may have functions that are independent of GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoeller et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have not examined the role of GrlL/fAR1 in PIP<sub>3</sub> production or PIP<sub>3</sub> association with phagocytic cup formation, but their biological connections to folate response appear to be limited. <italic>pi3k1-5</italic>-null cells accumulateÂ &lt;10% of WT PIP<sub>3</sub> levels, but show no inhibition of phagocytosis of bacteria, growth on bacteria, or chemotaxis, compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoeller and Kay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas PIP<sub>3</sub>-signaling may be dispensable for phagocytosis of bacteria (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlam et al., 2015</xref>), these data do not exclude the possibility that folate stimulated PIP<sub>3</sub>-patch formation may potentiate phagocytic cup formation to some extent. In WT, PIP<sub>3</sub>-free pseudopods primarily orient towards folate during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veltman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veltman, 2015</xref>), suggesting that if PIP<sub>3</sub>-labeled cellular protrusions participate in phagocytic cup formation, they are not initiated <italic>via</italic> folate signaling. Macropinocytosis, a process for fluid-phase uptake that requires PI3K/PIP<sub>3</sub>-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Posor et al., 2013</xref>), is functionally antagonistic to chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veltman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veltman, 2015</xref>).Thus, PIP<sub>3</sub> production interferes with pseudopod orientation during chemotaxis of growing cells to folate, further disconnecting PI3K/PIP<sub>3</sub>-signaling from chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Indeed, in other processes phagocytic cup and chemotaxis leading edge formation are competitive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maniak et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>We carefully, first, defined widely sensitive chemotactic conditions to pure ligands and bacteria, and followed phagocytic assays of cells adhered to culture plates in real time, with near linear activity throughÂ &gt;2 hr, and coupled these parameters to assess interrelationships between bacterial chemo-sensing and directed phagocytic behavior. Our data demonstrate efficient phagocytosis that is independent of chemo-sensing and chemotaxis. Other approaches using mammalian neutrophils have also defined incubation conditions that will suppress chemotaxis without affecting phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinrich and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mankovich et al., 2013</xref>). Still, we recognize that phagocytosis assays differ, which may reveal mechanistic subtleties or novel cross-dependencies in shaking cultures or involving other components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lima et al., 2014</xref>). It is also suggested that chemotactically active neutrophils are more efficient in blocking the growth of infective fungi, subsequent to phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated a unique ability to detect migration toward bacteria, in a cell number dependent manner and correlated <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> sensitivity for detection of bacterial chemoattractant production.

It also explores the relationship between chemotaxis and phagocytosis. The manuscript provides convincing evidence that the amoebae utilize several sensing mechanisms to detect and approach bacteria by chemotaxis and that phagocytosis is largely distinct from chemotaxis. The experimental design is clever and careful, the results are clear and believable, and the authors have adopted several new methods to the system, which will have a significant impact on future investigations. Most importantly, the conclusions are largely supported by the data and the discussion is thorough and interesting. Overall this manuscript is very strong and it does not suffer from major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript from Meena and Kimmel presents a series of interesting observations regarding the chemotaxis of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> towards bacteria.

The role of GPCRs in migration guided by folate is well characterized. (2) The adaptation to various chemoattractants uses specific adaptation mechanisms that are distinct for each chemoattractant.

The major question is not necessarily if phagocytosis and chemotaxis are independent processes. Most important is what is the end-result of the interaction? While the phagocytosis and chemotaxis appear to be independent, the killing ability of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> may be enhanced after chemotaxis. Recently, it was reported that human neutrophils kill fungi more efficiently after chemotaxis compared to exposure to a uniform concentration of chemoattractant (no chemotaxis â Jones et al., JID 2015). Could it be true that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is a more efficient killer after chemotaxis â supporting a relationship between chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Probing the killing of bacteria strains that are more difficult to kill than the two tested so far may reveal some interesting answers?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have carried out a number of well-controlled experiments to tease out the relative contributions of folate and/or cAMP chemotaxis by <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> amoebae in bacterial phagocytosis. They have done an excellent job distinguishing these two actin-dependent processes from one another and conclude that bacterial phagocytosis is independent of chemotaxis to either folate or cAMP. There is much else to admire in the experiments they present. For example, their demonstration that the adaptation pathways for folate and cAMP function independently of one another and upstream of common downstream cellular pathways is particularly convincing.

Comparative testing of e.g. folate-coated latex beads with un-coated controls was never studied in the previous manuscript. We have now added additional data to this end. We show that rates of phagocytosis with control and folate-beads are identical (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), further supporting our previous conclusions that phagocytosis is not modulated by chemo-receptor sensing. We have also experimentally addressed the question if chemotactically active cells have increased phagocytic rates compared to quiescent cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Chemotactically active and quiescent cells have similar phagocytic rates.

The summary for points #1 and #2 is accurate, but we must not have been sufficiently clear to other data for the referee to conclude for #3 that we made a definitive statement with âphagocytosis and chemotaxis being independent processesâ. We present very strong data that âPhagocytosis is not dependent upon Chemo-Receptor Sensingâ. That is, activation of chemoattractant receptors by secreted or surface immobilized ligands is neither activating nor inhibitory to phagocytosis. With increased and directed motility, chemotaxing cells will encounter and engulf âpreyâ more efficiently than non-chemotactic cells. However, our data are not consistent with phagocytic efficiency being modulated by pathways that act downstream of chemoattractant receptor activation.</p><p>In an effort to address this further, we compared phagocytic efficiency of WT cells that had or had not been exposed to pulsatory stimulation of either folate or cAMP chemoattractants. These conditions create periodic chemoattractant activation/adaptation cycling at 6 min intervals, which mimics chemoattractant wave propagation and response (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Chemoattractant activation did not stimulate phagocytosis relative to unstimulated controls.</p><p>We have also extended the question further by comparing phagocytic rates of WT cells for 1 Î¼m latex beads with or without folate surface coats (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), or for WT and folate receptor-null cells for folate-coated beads. No differences in rates of phagocytosis were observed among the different experiments and controls.</p><p><italic>The relationship between phagocytosis and chemotaxis presented in the manuscript is weak.

We had tried to be very specific to examine if âChemo-Receptor Sensingâ influenced phagocytosis. As mentioned above (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), we have added significant new supporting data. We believe that our data strongly indicate that phagocytosis is not dependent upon chemo-receptor sensing. The comparative âkillingâ ability of chemotaxing or non-chemotaxing cells is quite a separate and very distinct question, from phagocytosis per se. Indeed, the assay with essential control normalizations would require new developments, which we feel are beyond the important questions that we have addressed directly. Nonetheless, we have added the concept to the Discussion with appropriate reference. We hope the referee is satisfied with our explanation and with the new data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[â¦] The authors appropriately focus on the last 5-10 years of others' work on the topic because there has been much progress in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of actin-dependent processes during this time, but I was left wondering why there is no comment on the work done in the last century.
