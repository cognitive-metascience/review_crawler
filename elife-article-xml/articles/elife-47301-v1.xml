This was puzzling because AMF retain core meiosis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Halary et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that a meiosis-like process most likely occurs in this lineage. Previous evidence for recombination later turned out to be based on duplicated gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Croll and Sanders, 2009</xref>), or ribosomal RNA sequences that were paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pawlowska and Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, based on work comparing single nuclei whole-genome sequences to bulk sequencing data, new evidence for recombination in these fungi was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>). The isolates were dikaryotic, containing nuclei of two classes defined by their mating type (MAT) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>). For each sequenced nucleus, PCR-amplification was attempted to assign a mating type class (MAT-1 up to MAT-5). Recombination was then inferred based on: (i) base-pair calls classed as one mating type found in the alternate mating type; (ii) nuclei of the same mating type showing variation in consecutive blocks of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (iii) SNPs from nucleus 7 (SL1 strain) being more similar to SNPs of the alternate mating type, consistent with a recombination event spanning the MAT locus.</p><p>Here, we ask how strong the signal of within-strain recombination was in the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref> if we excluded heterozygous sites in haploid nuclei, duplicated regions of the genome, and low-coverage depths base calls. By removing data that cannot confidently be distinguished from sequencing errors and repeated regions, we find that the evidence for recombination is very sparse. We also report specific examples of these possible errors to justify our more stringent filtering of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The effect of filtering positions based on reads</title><p>Our first analysis was of the dataset reported in Supplementary file 6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al.

Applying all three filters together removed 91% of recombined sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The filtering used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref> removed multi-copy sites ‘[i]f BLAST results returned more than two good hits’, but retained regions with two BLAST hits. This could lead to the inclusion of SNPs that are heterozygous due to duplicated regions of the genome.</p><p>To show how repeated regions may lead to a false signal of recombination, we focused on an example highlighted in Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref>, and discussed in the main text of that article. We found that several positions on scaffold 70 from isolate A4 were heterozygous in several nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), although they are treated as homozygous in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref>. High sequencing depth (&gt;30) eliminates rare sequencing errors as the cause. To test if duplicated regions could be the cause of the heterozygosity, we performed a BLAST search against the A4 reference genome with sequences from scaffold 70:100354–100657. This search resulted in two BLAST matches: the self match on scaffold 70, as well as an additional match on scaffold 3570 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When the short reads of the dikaryon (bulk sequencing of all nuclei) were aligned to the reference genome, both these SNPs on scaffold 70 and their match on scaffold 3570 were heterozygous, and the BLAST hit result for both showed 100% identity match. Thus, this repeated sequence seems to have been assembled as a chimera of the two variants in both scaffolds, and the short reads from either copy are mapped equally to both.</p><p>We feel this example illustrates the need to exclude repetitive regions from analyses of recombination.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47301.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heterozygous positions in single nuclei from a duplicated region were treated as homozygous in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al.

Each base call was assigned to a mating type class (green or yellow) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref> based on an unspecified criterion. Variation between nuclei of the same mating type (e.g. variation among nuclei 2, 21, 22, and 24) is interpreted as recombination. We used their Illumina reads to show the ratio of reads supporting alternative nucleotides for each position. For example, in strain 4, mating-type 1, nucleus 2, position 100454, in Chen et al. the base was called as a G with a mating type ‘green’, and 51 of 52 reads matched G. However, for nucleus 21, only 85 of 151 reads supported an A at that position, while the other 66 supported a G.

(2018a)</xref> was filtered with a minimum of two reads. This is a very low threshold, and insufficient even for a consensus in the event of disagreeing reads. To look at the effect of low coverage on the signal of recombination, we compared the distribution of read depths between random and recombined sites. We first needed to identify recombined sites, as the method was lacking from the original manuscript, so we applied a parsimony criterion as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. While imperfect, this method certainly underestimates recombination, as it cannot identify recombined sites when equal numbers of nuclei within a mating type have alternate genotypes. Our method identified 733 positions, sufficient for analysis. Looking at the distribution of read depths, overall SL1 nuclei had ~95% fewer high coverage sites (average of 97 sites &gt; 10 read depth for nuclei from SL1 versus 2290 for A4 and 2441 for A5) compared to A4 and A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We note here, as described in Table 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref>, that SL1 nuclei cover much less of the genome (14%) compared to A4 and A5 (53% and 42%, respectively). Another fact visible from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is that, for A4 and A5, recombined sites are overrepresented by sites with low depth compared to sub-sampled non-recombined sites (Wilcoxon ranked sum test A4; p=3.2×10<sup>−09</sup>, A5 p=2.9×10<sup>−6</sup>). We note that for nuclei from isolate SL1, fewer overall recombined sites can be identified since the decreased breadth of coverage reduces overlap between nuclei, making it difficult to say whether this pattern of excess low-coverage sites is also present (p=0.11).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47301.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Recombined sites are overrepresented for low coverage sites.</title><p>Top row: Distribution of sub-sampled read depths for non-recombined sites of individual nuclei for the three isolates, showing decreased coverage overall for SL1.

This is the analysis presented in Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref>, showing overall more recombination in SL1 than A4 and A5, indicated by a ‘mosaic pattern’. We again note here that sequence from SL1 nuclei covers very little of the assembly (average of 14% from Table 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>) means that very few positions will be covered between any two nuclei between nuclei of SL1 (14% in one nucleus x 14% in the other nucleus = 2% in both). After applying our filters, we find that in A4 and A5 almost all differences between nuclei of one mating type disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For nuclei from SL1, the filtering reduced the differences within a mating type, but since these nuclei cover so little of the genome, the overall dataset is reduced such that on average nuclei only share 9 SNPs that can be compared. Many nuclei have no overlapping SNPs and no comparison can be made (black squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

As such, we have no available evidence for the mating type of this nucleus. Without corresponding Illumina evidence, we consider the PCR product the sole remaining evidence of this recombination event. This PCR experiment that is not confirmed with Illumina data represents the only remaining evidence for recombination after read filtering. We find cross-contamination of the PCR to be a more likely scenario in the face of many billions of sequenced bases from an Illumina run.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Finding a balance between filtering poor data and losing informative data is a critical component of any analysis. For this dataset, we provide evidence for the necessity of stringent filtering to avoid inferences based on erroneous or misleading data. We do not consider our filters to be particularly strict, as removing low coverage sites, repeated regions, and heterozygous sites from haploid data is commonplace in genomic analyses. In SL1, three blocks of consecutive SNPs remained after our filtering, and two regions in A5. Some of these regions likely remain because our heterozygosity filter requires a minimum of ten reads, thus low coverage heterozygous sites are not excluded. This analysis used the first 100 contigs, covering approximately 10 Mb. As such, finding only a handful of putative recombined SNPs certainly cannot be confidently separated from amplification/sequencing noise. While small blocks of genetic exchange may be compatible with gene conversion, the limited number of markers involved greatly increases the difficulty in identifying high-confidence gene conversion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wijnker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Qi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mapping recombination inside repetitive regions would require longer reads than available from standard short-read technologies. This is a formidable task due to the input requirements of PacBio technologies, but it has been accomplished using linked short reads from individual pollen cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the use of a more contiguous reference genome will actually include additional repetitive regions, and the exclusion of repetitive regions will become even more important. As the apparent recombined blocks are much smaller than the contigs, a more contiguous genome assembly would not change our analysis. Single nucleus genome amplification with multiple displacement amplification produces extremely variable genome coverage. Normalization of the data was shown to improve the quality of AMF genomic data when coverage is variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Montoliu-Nerin et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to normalization, low coverage sites could still be used with a model-based approach, which incorporates the associated uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, removing heterozygous sites from haploid single-nuclei seems like a self-evident requirement.</p><p>The conserved meiosis genes found in the genomes of Glomeromycotan species strongly suggests a meiosis-like process allowing recombination and re-shuffling of genetic material among genomes. Uncovering the details of this process would be a major scientific breakthrough. Given this importance, claims made regarding recombination in Glomeromycota require rigorous examination. While we acknowledge that the models presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref> are valuable framework to test hypotheses for meiosis-like mechanisms found in these fungi, the data presented are not robust enough to support or reject them. As such, we believe that one of the greatest remaining mysteries in mycology remains unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Raw data</title><p>We obtained the SPAdes assemblies for the three dikaryotic <italic>R. irregularis</italic> isolates from NCBI, as well as the paired-end read libraries from the dikaryons and the paired-end reads of the single nuclei.

Specifically, we used the primers sequences kary001, kary002, and kary003 as query sequences for BLAST searches against the A4, A5, and SL1 genomes. Each primer sequence had strong matches against two different scaffolds, consistent with divergent ideomorphs as found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ropars et al. (2016)</xref>. As these primers only target a small region, we extended the locus using the annotations found on NCBI to identify the boundaries of the pair of genes. These locations are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</xref>.

However, there are two major issues that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) More information is needed in order for readers to be able to correctly interpret the data presented in Table 1 and to relate it to the parsimony methodology presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Is the number of recombined positions as defined in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B? If so, what do the numbers before and after the slash in the table entry represent? The number of recombined positions out of the total number of positions? If so, then is the total number of positions counted as only those positions where all nuclei were able to be genotyped at that position? If that is the case, then why are these numbers different from the number of shared SNPs presented in Figure 4C? And why would the number before the slash be greater than the number after the slash (as it is for SL1 after filtering)? For &quot;recombined blocks&quot;, does this refer to what is shown and described as &quot;sites&quot; in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A? More information is needed to describe the criteria used for this analysis. I can imagine three possible haplotype situations that could be considered as recombinant sites according to what is presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: (a) all contiguous SNPs match the haplotype assigned to the opposite mating type, (b) only one of the contiguous SNPs matches the other haplotype, and c) multiple SNPs match the other haplotype.</p><p>These scenarios all have different likelihoods of representing true recombinant events. For example, scenario (a) only represents a true recombination event if the mating type is correctly assigned (as later discussed by the authors). For scenario (b), it is rather difficult to assign this to a recombination event, especially if it is only one SNP in the middle of a series of contiguous SNPs that would otherwise match the haplotype associated with its mating type or just a single SNP on that scaffold. Here, the most probable explanation might be a mutation. Scenario (c) has the strongest likelihood of representing a true recombination event, but only if there is a switch where there are contiguous SNPs from one haplotype to contiguous SNPs from another haplotype. Multiple haplotype switching would require multiple recombination events, which seems unlikely given that double crossovers are unlikely to occur within the short sequence lengths of the reported blocks in Supplementary file 2. It is not clear to me which of these scenarios is included in the parsimony criterion for sites. For positions, the attribution of SNP differences between mating types to recombination over other processes is unclear. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, for positions 5 and 6, only one nucleus is (D) is different from the others. This could arise through recombination or through mutation, (especially if it is only one SNP among many on a scaffold – which is not diagrammed in the example shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, but could have been scored in the data). If it is several contiguous positions, then recombination is more likely than several independent mutations that would give rise to the other haplotype. The authors should clarify this in the text and/or by revising Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>2) My other major concern is the analysis presented in Figure 3 and associated commentary. The authors state &quot;Another fact visible from Figure 3 is that for A4 and A5, recombined sites are overrepresented by sites with a read depth of 2 compared to random sites&quot;. I agree that it looks that way in the figure, but I would like to see some statistics to support this claim. The number of random sites is much, much greater than the number of recombined sites, further complicating a simple visual comparison. I suggest that the authors subsample the number of random sites to match the number of recombined sites and display this in the plot. Also, would &quot;non-recombined&quot; sites be a more appropriate term than random sites? The legend of this figure says that recombined sites are identified as recombined based on the parsimony criterion diagrammed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Is the read depth plotted for each individual SNP in a recombined site? Or is the average depth across all SNPs in a recombined site? The discrete values suggest that it is the former or that is actually referring to recombinant positions rather than sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Auxier and Bazzicalupo express their concerns regarding an earlier study on inter-nucleus recombination in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and tested their concerns regarding the data analysis by filtering the presented evidence for recombination using information on repetitive regions/heterozygous sites as well as short read alignment coverage information. In general, the search for rare events in the genome cannot be performed with relaxed filters, as false positives signal (even it is low) will affect rare events much more than frequent events.</p><p>Figure 1 is absolutely convincing and clearly shows that the new filtering more strongly affects the sites that are annotated as recombined sites, as compared to the sites that are not recombined. This technical difference between recombined sites and non-recombined sites can only be true if these two sets of sites are technically different. There is no reason why recombination should lead to such a difference. This is true for the repeat analysis/heterozygous site analysis as well as for the low coverage analysis. In consequence, I do share the concerns regarding the finding of the original study.</p><p>In consequence, I fully agree with the last statement of the manuscript: even though the new filtering does not remove all signals that could be recombination-induced, the (very little) remaining signal for recombination &quot;are not robust enough to support or reject&quot; meiosis-like mechanisms.</p><p>Moreover, I would not even agree that the remaining evidence for recombination, the PCR based assessment of the mating type of nucleus 07 (SL1), is a strong evidence for recombination. It is a non-replicated experiment of a single event (as far as I understand) and thus does not meet the general criteria to support a conclusion of such large impact.</p><p>My only concern regarding the comment:</p><p>Even if stated in the original manuscript, I would not agree that longer conversion tracts support recombination events more than single marker conversions. Recombination does not necessarily exchange long tracts, for example gene conversion-like events could be very short (as for example shown in Arabidopsis where the majority of gene conversions is only supported by single markers). If gene conversion like mechanisms would act here, short tracts might be the expected pattern. Therefore, I do not see why the absence of long tracts should be prominently illustrated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47301.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors present a rather convincing case for a re-appraisal of the data and conclusions of Chen et al., 2018.

We have clarified the legend of the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Auxier and Bazzicalupo express their concerns regarding an earlier study on inter-nucleus recombination in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and tested their concerns regarding the data analysis by filtering the presented evidence for recombination using information on repetitive regions/heterozygous sites as well as short read alignment coverage information. In general, the search for rare events in the genome cannot be performed with relaxed filters, as false positives signal (even it is low) will affect rare events much more than frequent events.</p><p>Figure 1 is absolutely convincing and clearly shows that the new filtering more strongly affects the sites that are annotated as recombined sites, as compared to the sites that are not recombined. This technical difference between recombined sites and non-recombined sites can only be true if these two sets of sites are technically different. There is no reason why recombination should lead to such a difference. This is true for the repeat analysis/heterozygous site analysis as well as for the low coverage analysis. In consequence, I do share the concerns regarding the finding of the original study.</p><p>In consequence, I fully agree with the last statement of the manuscript: even though the new filtering does not remove all signals that could be recombination-induced, the (very little) remaining signal for recombination &quot;are not robust enough to support or reject&quot; meiosis-like mechanisms.</p><p>Moreover, I would not even agree that the remaining evidence for recombination, the PCR based assessment of the mating type of nucleus 07 (SL1), is a strong evidence for recombination. It is a non-replicated experiment of a single event (as far as I understand) and thus does not meet the general criteria to support a conclusion of such large impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, but without any direct evidence against we feel the need to give the authors the benefit of the doubt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My only concern regarding the comment:</p><p>Even if stated in the original manuscript, I would not agree that longer conversion tracts support recombination events more than single marker conversions. Recombination does not necessarily exchange long tracts, for example gene conversion-like events could be very short (as for example shown in Arabidopsis where the majority of gene conversions is only supported by single markers). If gene conversion like mechanisms would act here, short tracts might be the expected pattern. Therefore, I do not see why the absence of long tracts should be prominently illustrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss the length of tracts because they are highlighted by Chen et al. in their Results section:</p><p>“In many cases, recombining genotypes encompass hundreds to thousands of base pairs, (Figure 3, Supplementary file 6). […] In this example, a single recombination event between genotypes harbored by the nuclei 22 (<italic>MAT</italic>-1) and 19 (<italic>MAT</italic>-2) resulted in a genetic exchange involving at least one thousand base pairs, and similar events are found elsewhere in the genome of A4.”</p><p>While we agree that gene conversion could result in the transfer of single markers, Chen et al. refer to “meiotic-like processes” in the Abstract of their publication. If indeed a meiotic-like process is occuring then gene conversion should be paired with at least one crossover event per chromosome for proper segregation. It is possible that crossover events are only occurring on the distal ends of chromosomes, as in <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic>, and these distal ends are not included in the largest 100 scaffolds. But there is no evidence presented for this scenario and we prefer not to speculate on potential mechanisms to explain Chen et al.’s low quality data.</p><p>In consideration of the reviewer’s and editors comments, we have added a sentence to the conclusion acknowledging that gene conversion events would be of a size consistent with the size found by Chen et al., however gene conversion events are extremely difficult to confidently identify, as shown by Qi et al. who we have added as a reference as well as Wijnker et al.</p><p>“While small blocks of genetic exchange may be compatible with gene conversion, the limited number of markers involved greatly increases the difficulty in identifying high-confidence gene conversion events (Wijnker et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
