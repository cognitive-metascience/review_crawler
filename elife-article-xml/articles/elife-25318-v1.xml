It is also considered to be fundamental to self-awareness. Despite its importance, the developmental origins of interoceptive sensitivity remain unexplored. We here provide the first evidence for implicit, flexible interoceptive sensitivity in 5 month old infants using a novel behavioural measure, coupled with an established cortical index of interoceptive processing. These findings have important implications for the understanding of the early developmental stages of self-awareness, self-regulation and socio-emotional abilities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25318.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25318.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25318.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>From the beginning till the end of a person’s life, parts of the body continuously send signals to the brain. Most of this happens without the person even being aware of it, yet people can become aware of the signals under certain circumstances. For example, we can feel our racing heart rate or the “butterflies in our stomach” when we are anxious or excited. This ability to consciously sense signals from the body is called interoception, and some people are more aware of these signals than others. These differences between people can influence a wide range of psychological processes, including how strongly they feel emotions, how they make decisions, and their mental health.</p><p>Despite the crucial role that interoception plays in thought processes in adults, scientists know practically nothing about how it first develops. Progress in this field has been hindered largely because there was no way to measure sensitivity to interoceptive signals in infants.</p><p>Now, Maister et al. have developed a new task called iBEATS that can measure how sensitive an infant is to their own heartbeat. During the task, five-month old infants were shown an animated character that either moved in synchrony with their own heartbeat or out of synchrony with their heartbeat. The infants spent longer looking at the character that was moving out of synchrony than the one moving in synchrony, suggesting that even at this early age, infants can sense their own interoceptive signals.</p><p>As with adults, some of the infants were more sensitive to their heartbeats than others, and Maister et al. could see these differences played out in the infant’s brain activity via electrodes placed on the infant’s head. Infants who had shown a strong preference in the iBEATS task also showed a larger brain signal known as the Heart-Evoked Potential (or HEP). Furthermore, this brain signal got larger when infants viewed a video clip of an angry or fearful face. This suggests that the infants’ brains were monitoring their hearts more closely when they were confronted with negative emotions.</p><p>This study provides a validated measure of interoception for very young participants. Using this task, researchers can now investigate which factors affect how awareness to interoceptive signals develops, including social interactions and the infant’s temperament. Maister et al. also plan to carry out longer-term experiments to learn exactly how interoception may influence the development of emotional abilities, and also what role it might play in disorders such as anxiety and depression. The findings of these future experiments may eventually guide interventions to treat these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25318.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25318.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>interoception</kwd><kwd>cognitive development</kwd><kwd>heartbeat evoked potential</kwd><kwd>emotion processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005032</institution-id><institution>Fundação Bial</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>87/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maister</surname><given-names>Lara</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsakiris</surname><given-names>Manos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC- 2010-StG-262853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsakiris</surname><given-names>Manos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pre-verbal infants demonstrate an implicit sensitivity to interoceptive sensations, which fluctuates spontaneously during emotional processing and guides audiovisual preferences in the environment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>Our entire experience of the world is perceived against a pervasive backdrop of internal physiological sensations from our bodies. Our sensitivity to these visceral sensations, known as ‘interoception’, is thought to be the fundamental basis for subjective feeling states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Craig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damasio, 2010</xref>), and important for maintaining homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and FitzGerald, 2014</xref>). Interoceptive sensitivity is a stable trait which varies between individuals, and influences a range of psychological processes from emotion processing to decision-making and various psychological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Critchley and Harrison, 2013</xref>). Inevitably, interoception has recently witnessed an exponential rise in interest across the neurosciences, psychology and psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khalsa and Lapidus, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Behaviourally, individual differences in interoception are commonly measured by assessing participants’ ability to count their own heartbeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schandry, 1981</xref>) or discriminate cardio-auditory synchrony from asynchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brener et al., 1993</xref>). Interoceptive processing can also be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG); the Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) is an electrophysiological index of cortical cardiac processing, and is found between 250–600 ms after the cardiac R wave over frontocentral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pollatos and Schandry, 2004</xref>) and parietal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dirlich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Couto et al., 2015</xref>). HEP amplitude is positively correlated with interoception at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pollatos and Schandry, 2004</xref>), and is also modulated by <italic>state</italic> changes in interoception such as during emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukushima et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its fundamental role in adulthood, interoception has been given prominence in developmental theories, which highlight its importance in the infant’s experience of reward, motivation and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fogel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mundy and Jarrold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fotopoulou and Tsakiris, 2017</xref>). Interoceptive sensitivity may allow infants to perform crucial self-regulatory behaviours that facilitate homeostasis. By linking perceived internal sensations with events or objects in the environment, infants may be able to develop allostatic seeking or avoiding behaviours depending on the nature of the internal sensation. For example, accurately perceiving sensations of satiety and linking these sensations with feeding behaviour may allow infants to self-regulate their milk intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harshaw, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the detection of unpleasant arousal states may initiate attentional disengagement or avoidance of an aversive stimulus. Therefore, individual differences in interoception may represent an important determinant in socio-emotional and physical development. However, despite much speculation regarding the developmental origins of interoception, developmental research in this area has been restricted to older childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch and Pollatos, 2014</xref>) due to methodological limitations. Here, we develop a novel behavioural measure of interoception in infancy, and present the first ever demonstration of interoceptive sensitivity at 5 months of age, coupled with electrophysiological markers, to show that (a) infants display an implicit sensitivity to interoceptive signals, and (b), that this sensitivity is responsive to socio-emotional processing demands, as in adults.</p><p>We developed a novel implicit behavioural measure, the <italic>Infant Heartbeat Task (iBEAT</italic>), which employs a sequential looking paradigm to assess whether infants are able to differentiate synchronous from asynchronous cardiac rhythms. Twenty-nine infants (17 males, mean age = 5.13 months, SD = 0.29) viewed an animated character, moving either in synchrony or asynchrony (±10% speed) with the infant’s own heartbeat, during continuous eye-tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A clear visual preference for the asynchronous stimulus emerged at the group level, M<sub>ASYNCH</sub> = 5194 ms, SD = 2697, M<sub>SYNCH</sub> = 4170 ms, SD = 2167, t(28)=-3.267, p=0.0029, Cohen’s d = 0.40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that infants displayed an implicit sensitivity to interoceptive signals, and an ability to integrate these interoceptive signals with external visual-auditory stimuli. As with adults, there were individual differences in the direction and magnitude of preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25318.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Infants differentiate between synchronous and asynchronous cardiac rhythms in a sequential looking paradigm (iBEAT task).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) iBEAT paradigm.

Given the varied nature of the topography and timing of HEP in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kern et al., 2013</xref>), we used a non-parametric Monte-Carlo cluster-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) in three broad bilateral regions of interest (ROI: frontal, central and parietal, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) across a 150–300 ms time window after the R wave. This time window was chosen to account for the infants’ rapid heart rate (mean R-R interval = 422.98 ms, SD = 25.36). We calculated a Cardiac Discrimination score as the absolute proportion difference between looking times to the synchronous and asynchronous stimuli during the iBEAT task. Individual Monte-Carlo cluster-based regression analyses were carried out for each of the three ROIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Couto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canales-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>).

Infants’ ability to discriminate cardiac-audiovisual synchrony during the iBEAT task suggests that they are not only sensitive to internal sensations, but are also able to integrate interoceptive information with stimuli in the environment to drive visual preferences. In adults, the relationship between the internal and external experience of the body has been shown to play a critical role in the malleability of body ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsakiris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspell et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the ability to integrate interoceptive and exteroceptive information may be central to infants’ developing awareness of their own body boundaries. Furthermore, this integration process could be a precursor to mechanisms which allow the attribution of reward value to certain events and objects. The ability to preferentially orient to specific aspects of the environment that elicit positive interoceptive sensations, and to avoid aspects that lead to aversive or over-arousing bodily states, may provide the basis for an emerging homeostatic self-regulatory capacity in the developing infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and FitzGerald, 2014</xref>), via a process of interoceptive inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). This process is likely to be essential for guiding learning towards intrinsically motivating classes of stimuli, for example faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quattrocki and Friston, 2014</xref>). A difficulty in detecting interoceptive states, or a subsequent disruption in ascribing interoceptive ‘value’ to the environment, could lead to atypical development in emotional, cognitive and social domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mundy and Jarrold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quattrocki and Friston, 2014</xref>). The developmental trajectory of interoception may therefore provide strong clues as to the origins of certain psychopathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quattrocki and Friston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated that a cortical index of interoceptive processing, the HEP, is particularly sensitive to emotional processing, especially negative emotions, in infancy as it does in adulthood. These findings indicate that infants’ state interoceptive processing and its cortical representation is dynamic, flexible and responsive to task demands. These results support a proposed relationship between online cardiac signalling and emotional evaluation in early infancy, which has already received persuasive support in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garfinkel and Critchley, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results also have important bearing on the study of self-awareness, the development of which has long been a topic of fascination in the behavioural sciences. It is now known that self-awareness in adulthood has close links with interoceptive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsakiris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippetti and Tsakiris, 2017</xref>), but how or when this link emerges has never yet been investigated. Our results allow future research to assess the relationship between individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity and the achievement of various milestones in the development of self-awareness, for example mirror self-recognition or the onset of episodic remembering. The implicit, non-verbal nature of the newly-developed tasks also raise the possibility of taking a comparative approach by measuring interoception in other non-human animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evrard et al., 2014</xref>). This will provide a unique opportunity to learn more about the evolutionary trajectory of interoception and embodied self-awareness.</p><p>In conclusion, the discovery that infants are sensitive to interoceptive sensations has wide-reaching implications for the study of interoception, self-awareness and cognitive development, and paves the way for understanding how individual differences in interoception can develop, persist and influence the way in which we experience ourselves and the world.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Supplementary results</title><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>Supplementary results for iBEAT task</title><p>As the rhythm of the asynchronous stimuli could either be faster or slower than the infant’s own heartbeat, two further one-tailed t-tests were carried out comparing these two types of asynchronous stimuli to the synchronous stimulus separately to ensure that the asynchronous preference held in both cases. Infants looked longer at both the slower stimulus, <italic>M</italic> = 4829, <italic>SD</italic> = 2829, <italic>t</italic>(28)= - 1.977, p=0.029 (1-tailed), <italic>d</italic> = 0.25, and the faster stimulus, <italic>M</italic> = 5547, <italic>SD</italic> = 3190, <italic>t</italic>(28)= 3.038, p=0.0025 (1-tailed), <italic>d</italic> = 0.475, as compared to the synchronous stimulus.

The correlation was non-significant, <italic>r</italic> = –0.15, p=0.502, suggesting that the observed relationship between cardiac discrimination and HEP amplitude was specific to the cortical processing of the heartbeat rather than cardiac activity per se.</p><p>To ensure that the emotional modulation of HEP observed for fear and anger was not instead caused by an ERP to the emotional expressions in the same channels, we also carried out an analysis of the EEG signal time-locked to the onset of emotional expressions, instead of heartbeats. Segmentation was performed surrounding the entire duration of each emotional expression (2000 ms). We employed the same Monte-Carlo random cluster permutation method as used for the HEP analysis, to ensure comparability. First, the entire time-window was interrogated for spatiotemporal clusters that significantly discriminated fear or anger from neutral conditions, within the eleven channels that we found emotional modulation of HEP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). No significant clusters were revealed in these channels, neither for the anger-neutral comparison (p≥0.213) nor the fear-neutral comparison (p≥0.395). We repeated this analysis with a more specific temporal focus on 300–600 ms after emotional expression onset, which has been identified as a likely time-window for infant ERP to emotional expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobiella et al., 2008</xref>). Again, no significant clusters were revealed, either for the fear-neutral comparison (no clusters) or the anger-neutral comparison (p=0.279). Finally, we extracted average amplitude of the EEG signal from the critical channels time-locked to the emotional expression for each individual infant, and calculated correlation coefficients between this signal and the average HEP amplitude during observation of that same emotion. If our HEP results were actually caused by ERP signal fluctuations, there should be a significant correlation between these two variables. Importantly, there were no significant correlations between average ERP amplitude and HEP amplitude, either for fear (<italic>r</italic> = –0.171, p=0.470) or anger (<italic>r</italic> = 0.175, p=0.436). The results of these analyses suggest that the emotional modulation of the HEP signal in frontal areas is not an artefact of more general ERPs in response to these emotions in the same locations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-one healthy, full-term infants were tested in total, at 5 months of age (19 males, mean age = 5.10 months, SD = 0.29).

Three disposable paediatric AgCl electrodes were attached to the infants’ chest and stomach in a 3-lead ECG setup, to monitor their cardiac activity throughout the task (Powerlab, ADInstruments, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.adinstruments.com">www.adinstruments.com</ext-link>). The R-peaks of the ECG were identified online using a hardware-based detection function (‘Fast Output Response’ function) from ADInstruments, and stimulus presentation was managed by a custom-made algorithm implemented in Matlab 2015a (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The onset of each R wave in the ECG trace was defined as the moment the voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, set individually for each infant. Once the function detected a R wave, a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse was then sent to the computer presenting the audiovisual stimuli, with a delay of less than 2 ms as confirmed by internal lab reports.</p><p>In each trial, infants were shown an animated character, which moved rhythmically up and down, either synchronously with the infant’s own heartbeat, or asynchronously (±10% speed). Each up-down movement was accompanied by an attractive sound to mark the rhythm. For synchronous trials, the custom-made algorithm presented an auditory tone and change in position of the animated character upon the receipt of every TTL pulse. For asynchronous trials, the algorithm produced a cardiac-like rhythm that was ±10% the speed of the infant’s average heart rate recorded from the previous trial. Trials alternated between showing either asynchronous or synchronous movement, and the character could appear either on the left or the right of the screen (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Phillips-Silver and Trainor, 2005</xref>]).</p><p>Once a steady ECG trace had been achieved, and the eyetracker had been calibrated to accurately detect the infant’s fixations, the computer task was started. Infants were shown the character for a minimum of 5 s, after which the continued presentation of the character was contingent on the infant’s attention. If the infant continued to look at the character, it remained on the screen for a maximum of 20 s. If the infant looked away from the character for longer than three consecutive seconds, the trial was automatically terminated by the computer program and the next trial begun. Between each trial, an attractive central fixation clip was presented to re-engage the infants’ attention. The task was terminated when four consecutive trials did not receive sufficient fixation to extend the trial time past the five second minimum, or when the infant became too tired or fussy to continue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>HEP measurement</title><p>The EEG recording was prepared whilst the infant was seated on their caregiver’s lap. A BioSemi elastic electrode cap was fitted onto the infant’s head, into which 64 active Ag-AgCl electrodes were fixed according to the 10/20 system. An external electrode was attached to the infant’s upper left abdomen to provide an ECG trace sufficient to detect the R-wave offline. The EEG and ECG signals were recorded using the BioSemi ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz and band-pass filtered online at 0.16–100 Hz. The standard BioSemi references Common Mode Sense (CMS) electrode and Driven Right Leg (DRL) electrode were used.</p><p>Once clear EEG and ECG signals were obtained, the infant was repositioned 60 cm in front of a 29’ computer screen. The caregiver was asked to avoid interacting with the infant or looking at the screen during the task. The task comprised of short video clips of females making emotional expressions, following the paradigm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Missana et al. (2014)</xref>.

Happiness, fear, and anger were selected as emotions of interest. A neutral stimulus was also included, in order to provide a ‘no emotion’ control condition for comparison. Each video was modified to last for three seconds in total; this duration was comprised of a 1 s period showing the face with a neutral expression, then a 1 s dynamic period when the emotional expression manifested, and a final second freeze-frame of the expression at its peak intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Missana et al., 2014</xref>). The videos featured four different female models, and were cropped around the models’ faces using a soft circular template to remove extraneous features.</p><p>Trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order, ensuring that trials featuring the same model and emotion were not presented consecutively. Between each trial, infants were shown an attention-getter, consisting of a short audio-visual clip of an engaging, non-social object presented centrally on the screen. When infants’ attention failed to return to the screen for two consecutive trials, the experimenter (positioned behind a curtain partition) initiated a longer video clip with music which gave the infant a short break and an incentive to reorient to the screen. Once the infant’s attention was recaptured, the experimenter manually recommenced the next trial. If the infant showed prolonged inattention (defined as having not attended to four consecutive trials) or fussiness, the task was terminated. A maximum of 48 trials were presented. Stimulus presentation was controlled using Presentation software (Neurobehavioural Systems, Inc.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Testing procedure</title><p>Mothers and infants familiarised themselves with the testing room.

The cap and ECG electrodes were then removed, and mother and infant were taken to a comfortable rest area to take a break, feed and change if necessary.

For the purpose of correlating heartbeat discrimination ability with HEP amplitude, a discrimination score was calculated reflecting the absolute proportion difference between looking times to the synchronous and asynchronous stimuli. An absolute preference was considered important as it reflected an ability to detect cardio-visual synchrony, regardless of whether the infant had a preference towards or against it. This is because there are high inter-individual and intra-individual differences in whether an infant will show a familiarity or a novelty preference, particularly in intermodal looking time procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Houston-Price and Nakai, 2004</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>HEP measure</title><p>Out of the full sample, thirty-nine infants completed the EEG recording.

This period was selected as this was when the observed emotional expression was at peak intensity. The data was then re-segmented to extract the HEPS, with a duration of 600 ms (−200 ms to 400 ms) time-locked to the R-wave. The resulting segments were baseline corrected using an interval from −200 ms to −50 ms to avoid artefacts from the R wave rising edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canales-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neurobehavioral evidence of interoceptive sensitivity in early infancy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sid Kouider acting as the Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Sarah Garfinkel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor (Sid Kouider) has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found that your paper describes a novel and interesting study investigating interoceptive sensitivity in infants, but a number of important substantive points have been raised. In particular, the study remains inconclusive as to whether the neural signature used in your study really taps onto the modulation of interoception by emotional stimuli. In addition, the reviewers and editors believe that the methods should be clarified as they remained difficult to grasp for assessing the validity of your findings. Further analysis are also required to account for potentials biases in the results (i.e., the potential effect of novelty surrounding trial type, see comments by reviewer 2), and some of the interpretations appears to be too speculative and should probably be toned down (see comments by reviewer 1). In light of these issues, we cannot offer to publish your paper in <italic>eLife</italic>, as it stands. If, however, you feel that you can address all of the points raised below, and make a strong case, we shall be willing to consider a revised version of your paper for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewing Editor:</italic> </p><p>A major issue concerns the interpretation derived from the fact that emotional expressions modulate Heartbeat Evoked Potentials (HEP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The HEP is an EEG component, which is time-locked to the heart beat. However, although they are differences across emotions, this might be the reflection of other sources that would show processing difference regardless of the heart beat: they might reflect the modulation of event-related potentials triggered by the emotional stimuli, although these amplitude differences would still show up when time-locking the analysis to the heart beat. In other terms, the reader might find this finding inconclusive and it seems important to show some degree of specificity to the HEP. This might be done by inspecting the results time-locked to the stimulus onset rather than the HEP, which might differ, or to show that some aspects of the HEP (for instance the phase) are 'specifically' modulated by emotional stimuli. This might also be discussed in an attempt to make the interpretation of your results more convincing and less ambiguous.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>Regarding the same results depicted on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the difference in topography of this finding and of the areas involved in the correlation with the behavioural measure also suggests that they may not both reflect interception. It might be important to look at the onset of the heart beat because one would expect that if the difference really reflects interception, it should not depend on when after the face onset the beats appear. Though, the face presentations were very short, and it is not clear whether this would leave a lot of scope for testing this, and the differences in response to emotional faces could be sustained. And it is possible that the effects on interception are stronger closer to the onset of an emotional stimulus.</p><p>The methodology is not sufficiently described to assess the validity of findings.</p><p>How was the visual stimulation synchronised to the infant's heart beat? How did you achieve +/- 10% speed?</p><p>In most infant looking studies a cut-off of 2 seconds is used to determine when attention was terminated. Justify why 3 seconds were used here.</p><p>The ECG channel activity should also be correlated with the cardiac discrimination score, to rule out a cardiac contribution to the association between HEP and cardiac discrimination. This is justified also by the choice of a rather early time window for analysis – 150 ms after the R wave (compared to 50 ms after the T wave in Park et al., 2014) and which might correspond to a section of the HEP artefacted by the cardiac response itself.</p><p>Was the heart beat latency from the onset of the visual stimuli, similar across conditions? A systematic difference in latency could lead to differential effects that do not reflect emotional processing but more general arousal/orienting.</p><p>Discussion should stay closer to what the current data can tell about infant cognition or better justify the potential broader implications.</p><p>The Discussion is rather speculative and the inferences made from the data unsubstantiated. The authors only measured discrimination between synchronous and asynchronous heart rate. Although there is a tendency to prefer asynchronous stimuli, this is not sufficient to infer that infants assigning positive or aversive value to this perception.</p><p>As the authors correctly state, the HEP findings suggest that facial expressions influence the processing of interoceptive signals. The following (reversed) inference: &quot;Even at this early age, infants' response to emotions appear to be closely influenced by their visceral reactions.&quot; cannot be drawn from the current data.</p><p>The link to self-awareness seems un-motivated. Please explain why interception rather than any bodily sensation, is relevant to self-awareness.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>Trial number: I understand that the authors wanted to balance the amount of synchronous and asynchronous trials, and this is correct. However, because there are two asynchronous conditions this has led to double the amount of trials for the synchronous condition relative to each of the asynchronous conditions (faster, slower). Thus, the effect of novelty surrounding trial type also needs to be controlled for. Within the current paradigm there are three classes of stimulus speeds: average, fast, slow, that map onto synchronous, asynchronous and asynchronous. As there is reduced looking time for the synchronous trials, and there are also double these trials relative to fast and slow speeds, it is necessary to show that this difference does not derive from a reduction in novelty simply due to increased instances of this (average) trial speed. Could the authors please repeat analyses but using only the first half of synchronous trials to demonstrate that the direction of looking time still holds? It is ok if differences are now not significant, as the reduction in power from slashing half the trials is likely to be considerable, but it would be helpful to see that the direction of the effect is still present within the data (and that reduced looking time is not driven by the last half of synchronous trials). This type of analysis could be problematic if it then means more early trials for synchronous relative to asynchronous trials are included (and, say, looking time is significantly reduced with time). Thus the authors should feel free to offer their own solution on how to remove the confound between trial number, speed and synchronicity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neurobehavioral evidence of interoceptive sensitivity in early infancy&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>After reading your reply to reviewers and your revised manuscript, I found your revision satisfying. You addressed all the points raised by the reviewers and myself, and the extra analysis you report seems to contradict the major issue I raised about the possibility that you might be measuring ERPs rather than HEP to emotional pictures.

This might also be discussed in an attempt to make the interpretation of your results more convincing and less ambiguous.</italic> </p><p>We have now carried out an ERP analysis to investigate whether the emotional modulation of HEP that we report is distinct from the more general emotional modulation of ERPs. We accordingly entered the data from all infants included in the HEP analysis into our ERP analysis in order to detect any overlap in topography, which may cast doubt over our initial findings. The analysis was carried out using a Monte-Carlo random cluster permutation method, with a cluster-corrected p-value threshold of. 05, identical to the one used throughout the manuscript to ensure comparability.</p><p>When interrogating the EEG signal for spatiotemporal clusters differentiating ERPs to fear or anger from neutral trials (the key contrasts for our HEP findings) across the entire duration of the emotional stimulus, no significant clusters were revealed in the frontal channels that the HEP analysis had identified as sensitive to fear and anger, respectively (hitherto referred to as the key ROIs). We then calculated the average amplitude from our ERP data in the key ROIs, and tested whether it correlated with average HEP amplitude; this should be the case if our HEP results were actually caused by ERP signal fluctuations. However, these correlations were non-significant for both fear (r=-.011, p=.962) and anger (r=.279, p=.209). Finally, we carried out a more specific analysis focussing in on the time period from 300-600ms after emotional expression onset, which has identified as a likely time-window of infant ERP to emotional expressions (following Kobiella, Grossmann, Reid &amp; Striano, 2007). Again, no clusters were identified that were significantly modulated by emotion in this time window in the key ROIs, and there were no significant correlations between average amplitude and HEP amplitude, either for fear (r-.171, p=.470) or anger (r=.175, p=.436). The results of these analyses suggest that the emotional modulation of the HEP signal in frontal areas is not an artefact of more general ERPs in response to these emotions in the same locations. At the same time we would like to reiterate that our experimental paradigm was designed to enable us to analyse HEP during emotional observation (of which there are many occurring in each emotion trial), As a result the infants included in our analysis did not necessarily complete a sufficient number of artefact-free emotion trials to provide as a reliable and detailed ERP analysis (in which only one segment can be obtained from each trial as one would expect for an experimental design tailored to study ERPs to emotional faces, e.g. Missana, Grigutsch &amp; Grossmann, 2014).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Regarding the same results depicted on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the difference in topography of this finding and of the areas involved in the correlation with the behavioural measure also suggests that they may not both reflect interception. It might be important to look at the onset of the heart beat because one would expect that if the difference really reflects interception, it should not depend on when after the face onset the beats appear. Though, the face presentations were very short, and it is not clear whether this would leave a lot of scope for testing this, and the differences in response to emotional faces could be sustained. And it is possible that the effects on interception are stronger closer to the onset of an emotional stimulus.</italic> </p><p>Although we agree that it would be interesting to investigate how the emotional modulation of HEP changes across the time course of a trial, we fully agree with the several valid challenges that the reviewer raises to this approach, including the issue of our short trials which are not optimised for an analysis of the effects of stimulus duration. Furthermore, it is not clear what would be predicted from such an analysis, or what results would strengthen or challenge our existing conclusions. It is certainly possible that the emotional modulation of HEP is strongest at the onset of an emotional expression, but conversely it is also feasible that the emotional modulation increases as the intensity of the emotional expression builds, and we do not think that either of these plausible options preclude the involvement of interoception. Therefore, on the basis of the reasons provided by reviewer 1 and the nature of our experimental design, we agree that this analysis wouldn’t be informative. Perhaps a different experimental design that has shortened or even static facial expressions could perhaps answer the reviewer’s question, and will be considered in future experiments.</p><p><italic>The methodology is not sufficiently described to assess the validity of findings.</italic> </p><p><italic>How was the visual stimulation synchronised to the infant's heart beat? How did you achieve +/- 10% speed?</italic> </p><p>The following details have been added to the manuscript:</p><p><italic>“</italic>The R-peaks of the ECG were identified online using a hardware-based detection function (“Fast Output Response” function) from ADInstruments, and stimulus presentation was managed by a custom-made algorithm implemented in Matlab 2015a. […] Trials alternated between showing either asynchronous or synchronous movement, and the character could appear either on the left or the right of the screen.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>In most infant looking studies a cut-off of 2 seconds is used to determine when attention was terminated. Justify why 3 seconds were used here.</italic> </p><p>Although 2 seconds is a common cut-off in infant looking paradigms, previous infant studies have varied and several have used either 1 second (e.g. Phillips-Silver &amp; Trainor, 2005) or 3 seconds, (e.g. Mareschal &amp; Johnson, 2003). We decided to use the longer cut-off of 3 seconds because during piloting, we observed that infants often became very active with accompanying head and limb movement during the rhythmic stimulus which could have resulted in temporary loss of eye-tracking signal. Given that our stimulus presentation was automatically controlled by an online algorithm based on the eyetracking signal, rather than experimenter-controlled, we aimed to minimise the number of valid trials terminated prematurely.</p><p><italic>The ECG channel activity should also be correlated with the cardiac discrimination score, to rule out a cardiac contribution to the association between HEP and cardiac discrimination.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this important point. The following passage has been added to the manuscript:</p><p>“To ensure that the correlation found between cardiac discrimination and HEP amplitude was not due cardiac field artefacts, we then calculated the correlation coefficient between the cardiac discrimination score and the average ECG amplitude across the time window of significance (206-272ms). The correlation was non-significant, r=-.15, p=.502, suggesting that the observed relationship between cardiac discrimination and HEP amplitude was specific to the cortical processing of the heartbeat rather than cardiac activity per se.”</p><p><italic>This is justified also by the choice of a rather early time window for analysis – 150 ms after the R wave (compared to 50 ms after the T wave in Park et al., 2014) and which might correspond to a section of the HEP artefacted by the cardiac response itself.</italic> </p><p>The earlier time-window selected for analysis was necessary due to the very rapid nature of the infant heart rate. This is explained in the fifth paragraph of the main text. The Park et al. study referred to is an MEG study rather than EEG, and most crucially uses adult participants whose heart rates are approximately half that of our infants. Although ECG components other than the R wave are not easy to identify from our data due to the montage of the external electrode, it is likely that the 150-300ms post-R-wave window we selected does indeed encompass the T wave of the infant ECG. Our 300ms upper cut-off ensures that the time-window was not contaminated by the following heartbeat.</p><p><italic>Was the heart beat latency from the onset of the visual stimuli, similar across conditions? A systematic difference in latency could lead to differential effects that do not reflect emotional processing but more general arousal/orienting.</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point, but as you know it is theoretically difficult to separate arousal from emotion (see e.g. Luft, C. D. B., &amp; Bhattacharya, J. (2015). Aroused with heart: modulation of heartbeat evoked potential by arousal induction and its oscillatory correlates. Scientific Reports, 5, 15717). Therefore, from a conceptual point of view, we would not want to claim that our results were attributed to ‘pure’ emotional processing devoid of changes in arousal. However, there are also some methodological challenges raised by an attempt to analyse heartbeat latency as the reviewer suggests. We used dynamic emotional facial expressions in our study partly to avoid the potentially confounding role of an orienting response to the sudden onset of a full-intensity static emotional expression. As these emotional stimuli were videos, which initially showed a neutral expression before dynamically moving into showing an emotion, it is unclear to us what the ‘onset’ of the emotional expression could be defined as, i.e. the moment that infants would be predicted to have a cardiac orienting/attentional response.</p><p>However, to allay any concern, we analysed the latency between the onset of the dynamic period of the emotional video and the infants’ next heartbeat, for all four emotion conditions. We then compared the latency for fear and anger conditions to the neutral condition, to mirror the key significant comparisons yielding our HEP results. The latencies for both fear (M=207ms, SD=58) and anger (M=238, SD=56) did not significantly differ from those of the neutral condition (M=221, SD=59, p&gt;.05). Therefore, it seems unlikely that systematic differences in heartbeat latency can explain our HEP results.</p><p><italic>Discussion should stay closer to what the current data can tell about infant cognition or better justify the potential broader implications.</italic> </p><p><italic>The Discussion is rather speculative and the inferences made from the data unsubstantiated. The authors only measured discrimination between synchronous and asynchronous heart rate. Although there is a tendency to prefer asynchronous stimuli, this is not sufficient to infer that infants assigning positive or aversive value to this perception.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this point. We did not intend to claim that our data proved that infants assigned positive or negative value to interoceptive signals, but instead wanted to suggest that a mechanism by which interoceptive information is integrated with exteroceptive stimuli could be a possible means by which positive or negative interoceptive value is assigned to stimuli in the environment. We have now reworded the relevant section to suggest that the integration process may be a <italic>precursor</italic> to the development of mechanisms which allow the attribution of reward value to certain events and objects (rather than sufficient for that attribution, as we inadvertently suggested in our previous draft): “In adults, the relationship between the internal and external experience of the body has been shown to play a critical role in the malleability of body ownership20–22. […] Furthermore, this integration process could be a precursor to mechanisms which allow the attribution of reward value to certain events and objects.”</p><p><italic>As the authors correctly state, the HEP findings suggest that facial expressions influence the processing of interoceptive signals. The following (reversed) inference: &quot;Even at this early age, infants' response to emotions appear to be closely influenced by their visceral reactions.&quot; cannot be drawn from the current data.</italic> </p><p>We have now removed this statement, as we agree that the reversed inference is not valid.</p><p><italic>The link to self-awareness seems un-motivated. Please explain why interception rather than any bodily sensation, is relevant to self-awareness.</italic> </p><p>There is a wide and rapidly-growing literature specifically linking interoception with self-awareness. We do not claim that only interoceptive sensations are relevant for self-awareness, but instead we emphasize the role that interoceptive information together with exteroceptive information about the body in co-constituting self-awareness, as other highly-cited theoretical accounts have suggested (e.g. Damasio, 2010; Craig, 2009), and have recently received growing empirical support (e.g. Tsakiris, Tajadura-Jiménez &amp; Costantini, 2011; Suzuki, Garfinkel, Critchley, &amp; Seth, 2013; Aspell, Lenggenhager, &amp; Blanke, 2009; Allen et al., 2016; Seth, 2013). Readers are directed to some of these references, in the seventh paragraph of the main text, to back up our point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p><italic>Trial number: I understand that the authors wanted to balance the amount of synchronous and asynchronous trials, and this is correct. However, because there are two asynchronous conditions this has led to double the amount of trials for the synchronous condition relative to each of the asynchronous conditions (faster, slower). Thus, the effect of novelty surrounding trial type also needs to be controlled for. Within the current paradigm there are three classes of stimulus speeds: average, fast, slow, that map onto synchronous, asynchronous and asynchronous. As there is reduced looking time for the synchronous trials, and there are also double these trials relative to fast and slow speeds, it is necessary to show that this difference does not derive from a reduction in novelty simply due to increased instances of this (average) trial speed.

This type of analysis could be problematic if it then means more early trials for synchronous relative to asynchronous trials are included (and, say, looking time is significantly reduced with time). Thus the authors should feel free to offer their own solution on how to remove the confound between trial number, speed and synchronicity.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. It is correct that infants saw twice as many trials classified as ‘synchronous’ than those classified as ‘faster’ or ‘slower’. However, crucially, the rate of presented beats for the asynchronous trials was calculated as ± 10% of the mean heart rate of the previous (synchronous) trial. We apologise that we had omitted these key details regarding how the rhythm of the asynchronous trials were presented in the original manuscript (also see reviewer 1 point 2) and so we have now inserted more information in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Due to normal fluctuations in infants’ heartrate during the task, our method meant that individual trials within a certain trial type differed with regards to their speed of beat presentation. For example, any given ‘asynch-faster’ trial was 10% faster relative to the infant’s heart rate during the previous trial, and therefore was unlikely to be exactly the same rhythm as any other trial classified as ‘asynch-faster’. As infants’ heart rates fluctuated, any given trial categorised as, for example, ‘asynch-faster’ could easily be presented at a rhythm close to, or slower than, a randomly selected trial categorised as ‘synchronous’, and the same for ‘asynch-slower’ trials. Thus, the trial designations (synch, asynch-faster, asynch-slower) are only relevant in the context of the infant’s changing heartbeat rhythm and do not reflect absolute or fixed stimulus characteristics relative to an external measure (i.e. fixed number of milliseconds between beats).</p><p>To illustrate this, we calculated the mean, standard deviation and range of inter-beat intervals for each infant and each condition; M(asynch-faster) = 375ms (SD=15), range = 361-392ms, M(asynch-slower) = 417ms (SD = 18), range = 399-436ms, M(synch) = 398ms (SD = 18), range = 376-419ms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, from this we can see that there was a high degree of overlap, at a group level, in the ranges of inter-beat intervals presented between the three conditions across the task. More importantly, at an individual level, mean ranges of interbeat-intervals calculated for each infant showed that the range of synchronous IBIs that any one infant experienced overlapped with the range of asynch-faster IBI’s by an average of 16ms, and with the range of asynch-slower IBIs by an average of 19ms.</p><p>Therefore, for our results to be an artefact of habituation, infants must have habituated to a changing range of heartbeat speeds presented during ‘synchronous’ trials (on average, 376-419ms) but not to two other fluctuating ranges of heartbeat speeds (361-392ms, and 399-436ms) with which the synchronous range overlaps. For this reason, we believe that it is very unlikely that habituation to an external stimulus characteristic such as absolute duration between beats could explain our results. However, we do consider it likely that our results are due to a novelty/habituation effect to a <italic>relative</italic> stimulus characteristic, namely the relationship between the stimulus and the infant’s heartbeat, and this is part of our central claim of the study, as our task was precisely designed to probe the infant’s sensitivity to interoceptive signals.</p><p>However, to further allay any concerns, we also conducted an additional analysis. We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and analysed only the first half of the synchronous trials. As predicted, the lack of power resulted in non-significance, but the looking times to synchronous trials were still numerically lower (4944ms, SD=3087) than those to slower (5925ms, SD=3250) and faster (5045ms, SD=3097) trials. However, as the reviewer suggested, looking duration did reduce over time for all conditions and therefore there was a confound between trial number, speed and synchrony.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] The extra analysis you carried out to disentangle ERP from HEP is reported in the reply while this should appear in manuscript, as it is not about just convincing me or the reviewers but also the reader that might have the same issue in mind when reading your paper.
