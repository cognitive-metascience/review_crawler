Here, we study the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates <italic>Tsix</italic>, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to decreased <italic>Tsix</italic> expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, enhanced accumulation of <italic>Xist</italic> and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, <italic>Tsix</italic>-independent repression of <italic>Xist</italic> by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02024.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02024.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02024.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Gene expression is controlled by a complicated network of mechanisms involving a wide range of enzymes and protein complexes. Many of these mechanisms are identical in males and females, but some are not. Female mammals, for example, carry two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome. Since the two X chromosomes in females contain essentially the same set of genes, one of them undergoes silencing to prevent the overproduction of certain proteins. This process, which is called X-inactivation, occurs during different stages of development and it must be tightly controlled.</p><p>An enzyme called MOF was originally found in flies in two distinct complexes—the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which forms only in males, and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which is ubiquitous in both males and females. These complexes are evolutionary conserved and are also found in mammals. While mammalian MOF is reasonably well understood, the MSL and NSL complexes are not, so Chelmicki, Dündar et al. have used various sequencing techniques, in combination with biochemical experiments, to investigate their roles in embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells in mice.</p><p>These experiments show that MSL and NSL complexes engage in the regulation of thousands of genes. Although the two complexes often show different gene preferences, they often regulate the same cellular processes. The MSL/NSL-dependent regulation of X chromosome inactivation is a prime example of this phenomenon.</p><p>The MSL complex reduces the production of an RNA molecule called Xist, which is responsible for the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females. The NSL complex, meanwhile, ensures the production of multiple proteins that are crucial for the development of embryonic stem cells, and are also involved in the repression of X inactivation.</p><p>This analysis sheds light on how different complexes can cooperate and complement each other in order to reach the same goal in the cell. The knowledge gained from this study will pave the way towards better understanding of complex processes such as embryonic development, organogenesis and the pathogenesis of disorders like cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02024.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02024.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>X inactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SFB DFG Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Backofen</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>Asifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SFB DFG Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>Asifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DFG Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIOSS II</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Backofen</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>Asifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU NoE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpiGeneSys</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>Asifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two complexes that contain the histone acetyl transferase MOF engage in a two-pronged approach to ensure the repression of X inactivation in mouse embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) are among the key architects of the cellular epigenetic landscape as the acetylation of histones is unanimously associated with transcriptionally active domains. Many HATs also have the ability to acetylate non-histone proteins extending their influence to diverse cellular pathways inside and outside of the nucleus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sapountzi and Cote, 2011</xref>). Based on their catalytic domains, the HATs are classified into two major families, GCN5 N-acetyl <underline>t</underline>ransferases (GNATs) and MYST HATs (named after the founding members MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60), that encompass diverse sets of protein complexes. The individual complex members enhance and modulate the enzymes' activities, guiding the versatile HATs towards specific functions. GCN5, for example, is part of SAGA, ATAC, and SLIK complexes that are associated with distinct histone tail modifications and differential gene regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Workman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, one of the well-known members of the MYST family, MOF (also known as: KAT8, MYST1), is rather substrate-specific for lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Becker, 2000</xref>) and its interaction partners are thought to mainly alter the specificity and extent of MOF's H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac). As part of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, MLE, roX1 and roX2 lncRNAs) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, MOF is recruited to the single X chromosome of male flies. The subsequent spreading of H4K16 acetylation results in transcriptional upregulation of the male X chromosome, the major means of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> dosage compensation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</xref>). In addition to the highly specialized MSL-associated role, MOF is also involved in the more universal and sex-independent regulation of housekeeping genes within the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex (NSL1, NSL2, NSL3, MBD-R2, MCRS2, MOF, WDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendjan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lam et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>MOF and most of its interaction partners are conserved in mammals, where MOF is also responsible for the majority of H4K16 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taipale et al., 2005</xref>). MOF is essential for mammalian embryonic development and unlike the male-specific lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, deletion of <italic>Mof</italic> in mice is lethal for both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). More specifically, mammalian MOF is critical for physiological nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>), maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2012</xref>), differentiation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>), and survival of post-mitotic Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to MOF, mammalian MSL and NSL complex members are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the individual complex members appear to have important functions in vivo as mutations of the NSL complex member KANSL1 cause the core phenotype of the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koolen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zollino et al., 2012</xref>) and are common amongst patients with both Down syndrome and myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). Another NSL-associated protein, PHF20 has been shown to associate with methylated Lys370 and Lys382 of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2012</xref>) and to be required for somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2013a</xref>). WDR5 was shown to be an essential regulator of the core transcription network in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2011</xref>). The mammalian counterpart of <italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL2 was shown to have the capacity to ubiquitylate p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kruse and Gu, 2009</xref>) and lysine 34 of histone 2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the study presented here, we set out to dissect the mammalian MOF functions within the MSL and NSL complexes using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptome profiles and biochemical experiments for the core members of MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that the MSL and NSL members possess concurrent, as well as independent functions and that effects generally attributed to MOF are frequently accompanied by the NSL complex. The NSL complex abundantly binds to promoters of broadly expressed genes in ESCs and NPCs. These genes are predominantly downregulated upon depletion of either MOF or KANSL3. In contrast, the MSL complex shows more restricted binding in ESCs, which expands after differentiation, particularly at NPC-specific genes. In addition to promoter-proximal binding, we discover several thousand binding sites of KANSL3 and MSL2 at promoter-distal loci with enhancer-specific epigenetic signatures. The majority of these distal regulatory sites are bound in ESCs, but not in differentiated cells, and genes that are predicted to be targeted by TSS-distal binding of MSL2 are frequently downregulated in sh<italic>Msl2</italic>-treated cells. The distinct, yet synergistic actions of both complexes become very apparent at the X inactivation center (XIC) that encodes numerous non-coding RNAs involved in the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in differentiating female cells. We show that the MSL but not the NSL complex directly promotes expression of <italic>Tsix</italic>, the inverse transcript and the key murine repressor of <italic>Xist</italic> during early differentiation. Depletion of MSL proteins results in attenuation of <italic>Tsix</italic> transcription, enhanced <italic>Xist</italic> RNA accumulation and ‘chaotic’ inactivation of variable numbers of X chromosomes during early differentiation. In addition to the very specific effect of MSL1/MSL2-depletion on the XIC genes, we show that MOF together with the NSL complex also influences <italic>Xist</italic> levels, but instead of affecting <italic>Tsix</italic>, MOF and KANSL3 depletion diminish key pluripotency factors involved in repressing <italic>Xist</italic>. Our study provides novel insights into the intricate interplay between MSL and NSL complexes in orchestrating gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate how MSLs and NSLs ensure the active state of two X chromosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells via distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MOF and its complexes show distinct chromatin binding dynamics during differentiation</title><p>To examine the behavior of MSL and NSL proteins in a cell type-specific manner, we derived homogeneous populations of multipotent neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Splinter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>).

This unbiased approach allowed us to determine five main groups of binding distinguished by different combinations of the proteins and cell-type-specific dynamics. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, three large clusters of binding sites encompassed regions, where at least 1 of the investigated proteins was present both in ESCs and NPCs (clusters A, B and C). The binding sites of clusters A and B predominantly overlapped with annotated transcription start sites (TSS) in contrast to the regions that were bound exclusively in ESCs, which tended to contain inter- and intragenic regions (clusters D and E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The width of the enrichments did not differ profoundly between the groups (cluster E: 836 bp median width, cluster A: 1782 bp median width). We found surprisingly few regions where MOF associated primarily with MSL complex members. Instead, approximately 80% of all MOF peaks displayed strong KANSL3 and MCRS1 signals (cluster B, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a predominant role of the NSL complex among MOF-associated complexes and a more specific role for the MSL complex at subsets of promoters and numerous intergenic and intronic regions. As the different clusters showed distinct enrichment patterns and diverse genomic localization, we set out to analyze the individual groups of binding in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The MSL and NSL complexes co-occur on active promoters of constitutively expressed genes in ESCs and NPCs</title><p>We first focused on the characterization of target promoters as the majority of MOF-binding was found around the TSS (mostly clusters A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified 8947 TSSs overlapping with ChIP-seq peaks of KANSL3 and/or MCRS1 in ESCs that encompassed virtually all MOF- and MSL-bound TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This pattern did not change substantially in NPCs where TSSs overlapping with MOF peaks almost always (99%) showed significant enrichments of KANSL3 and in 35% of the cases additionally contained a peak of MSL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, middle panel).

We subsequently performed RNA-seq experiments from shRNA-treated cells and determined their differential expression against the scrambled control to dissect transcriptional outcomes of the depletions at a global level.

Moreover, we found that MOF is dispensable for the TSS recruitment of its interaction partners and that depletions of the individual proteins predominantly result in the downregulation of TSS-bound genes, further supporting the fact that the promoter-binding of the MSL and the NSL complex is associated with active transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MSL and NSL complex members individually bind to active enhancers in ESCs</title><p>In addition to promoter-proximal binding, where both the MSL and NSL complex tend to (co-)occur constitutively in ESCs and NPCs, we identified a large proportion of binding sites where the proteins were present in a dynamic fashion, that is their binding was observed only in ESCs but not in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, clusters D and E). In contrast to the binding mode represented by clusters A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), here MSL2, MCRS1, and KANSL3 were predominantly enriched within introns and intergenic regions that underwent significant CpG methylation upon differentiation (e.g., from median 50% CpG methylation in ESCs to more than 80% in NPCs for cluster D; bisulfite sequencing data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>).

We noted that enhancers overlapping with MSL2 ChIP-seq peaks tended to show lower KANSL3 enrichments and vice versa, implying that MSL2 and KANSL3 preferred different enhancer regions (heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). MOF was not enriched at super enhancers and generally, its binding to TSS-distal sites was much less pronounced than to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Like for TSS-specific binding, MOF was not alone (87% of TSS-distal MOF peak regions overlapped with either KANSL3 or MSL2). Since a recent report showed H4K16 acetylation to be present at p300- and H3K27-acetylation-independent enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), we analyzed the moderate TSS-distal enrichments of MOF in more detail and observed a slight preference for TSS-distal regions that were not overlapping with previously published ESC enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In fact, we detected the strongest MOF signals in regions with rather low enrichments of known enhancer marks (see DNase HS, p300, H3K4me1, H3K27ac in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and 2C</xref>), which suggested a preferred binding of MOF outside canonical ESC regulatory regions.</p><p>In addition to ESC-specific binding of MSL2 and KANSL3 to predicted enhancers, we also identified a very distinct set of TSS-distal binding sites by MSL2 to introns and intergenic regions without enhancer-associated marks (cluster C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Approximately, 81% of these cluster C regions had solitary MSL2 enrichments without significant signals of any of the other ChIPed proteins. Interestingly, these MSL2 binding sites increased in number and binding strength upon differentiation to NPCs (829 solitary MSL2 peaks in ESCs compared to 3635 in NPCs). In contrast to the previously described binding sites that were characterized by the prevalence of open, active chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>), here MSL2 was excluded from hypo-methylated DNA regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>; note the different behavior of KANSL3). When we searched the unique MSL2 binding sites for DNA motifs, we obtained a (CAGA)<sub>n</sub> motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) that was previously described as a binding site for SMAD3, a transcription factor that translates the TGF-beta receptor response into gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zawel et al., 1998</xref>). When we subsequently scanned all the binding sites for the presence of the published, original SMAD3 motif, we found a strikingly specific signal for the center of the solitary MSL2 ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that MOF, MSL2 and KANSL3 specifically recognize ESC enhancers. In contrast to MSL-MOF-NSL co-occurrence at housekeeping gene promoters, we found evidence for differential and independent binding of the individual proteins to gene bodies and intergenic regions suggesting the potential for distinct tissue-specific regulatory functions of MSL2 and KANSL3. These data reveal a newly evolved function of MSL2 and KANSL3 in mammals, which has not been observed in flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Genes associated with TSS-distal binding sites of MSL1 and MSL2 are frequently downregulated in cells lacking MSL1 or MSL2</title><p>To study the functional implications of the binding of MSL2 and KANSL3 to putative ESC enhancers, we first tested five different regions located near genes related to pluripotency and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young, 2011</xref>). Using luciferase reporter constructs, we found strong transcriptional enhancement for all tested regions in ESCs, but not in NPCs or 3T3 cells which correlated with the presence of MSL2 and/or KANSL3 and MCRS1 in ESCs only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>We then used our RNA-seq data sets from MSL1-, MSL2-, MOF-, and KANSL3-depleted cells to assess the effects on the transcription of those genes that were not bound at promoters, but had been predicted by GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) to be regulated by TSS-distal binding sites of the respective protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, we again found similar effects for KANSL3- and MOF-depleted cells compared to MSL1- and MSL2-depleted cells with the latter group showing genome-wide downregulation of predicted target genes. In fact, the numbers of TSS-distal targets of MSL1 or MSL2 that were significantly reduced in the respective shRNA-treatments were markedly larger than for genes where MSL1 or MSL2 bound to the promoter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Moreover, in MSL2-, but not KANSL3-depleted cells, the effects on TSS-distally targeted genes were slightly stronger than for TSS-targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Depletions of MOF and KANSL3, but not of MSL complex members affect key pluripotency factors</title><p>While TSS-binding predominantly occurred at housekeeping genes, we noticed that the majority of enhancer regions associated with key pluripotency factors (e.g., SOX2, ESRRB, MYC, REX1, TBX3, NANOG) were strongly enriched for MSL2 and KANSL3. We thus assessed the effects of the protein depletions on pluripotency factors in ESCs and found strongly reduced levels of NANOG, REX1, and ESRRB in MOF- or KANSL3-depleted cells. Surprisingly, the pluripotency factors remained almost unaffected in cells depleted of MSL1 or MSL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These contrasting results were mirrored by decreased levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in MOF- and KANSL3-, but not in MSL1- or MSL2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p><p>These findings indicate that despite their frequent effects on TSS-distally targeted genes, MSL1 and MSL2 might not show dominant effects at genes that are bound by KANSL3 as well.

We show that MOF and its associated proteins are involved in gene expression regulation via different means: first, they all target the promoters of housekeeping genes in a cell-type-independent manner and second, members of both complexes occupy different sets of ESC-specific enhancers that are essential for the maintenance of stem cell identity.

We find that all complexes bind to promoters of housekeeping genes in ESCs and NPCs with NSL complex members occupying the majority of the target genes, while MOF and MSL proteins bind NSL-bound genes in a more restricted manner. Furthermore, we observe that upon differentiation, KANSL3 and MSL2 additionally occupy TSSs of different sets of cell-type-specific genes in the absence of MOF. (<bold>B</bold>) When we studied the functions of MSL and NSL complexes at the murine X inactivation center, we determined two basic mechanisms by which the different proteins affect the maintenance of two active X chromosomes in ESCs. (1) MSLs bind to the promoter and enhancer of <italic>Tsix</italic> whose transcription represses <italic>Xist</italic> expression. Upon depletion of MSLs, <italic>Tsix</italic> expression is compromised, so is REX1 recruitment to the <italic>Tsix</italic> locus. Consequently, <italic>Xist</italic> is increasingly transcribed and can occasionally accumulate. (2) In addition, MOF, MSLs, and NSLs bind to typical enhancers (TE) and super enhancers (SE) in ESCs, and notably those of pluripotency factors. In WT ESCs, the high expression of pluripotency factors is another layer of <italic>Xist</italic> repression. The depletions of MOF or KANSL3, but not of MSL1 or MSL2 reduce the expression of pluripotency factors involved in <italic>Xist</italic> repression causing a <italic>Tsix</italic>-independent increase of <italic>Xist</italic> expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02024.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02024.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02024-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Global effects of MOF are correlated with the NSL complex</title><p>Our study sheds light on the interplay between MOF and its complexes in mammals.

On the other hand, MSL1- and MSL2-depletion caused marked decreases of H4K16 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports that established MSL proteins as the main enhancers of MOF's H4K16 acetylation activity, while the NSL complex was shown to possess broader substrate specificity and can crosstalk with histone methylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadlec et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2013b</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed remarkably different phenotypic changes in MSL1- or MSL2-depleted cells compared to MOF- and KANSL3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). A striking example was the strong reduction of key pluripotency factors in KANSL3- and MOF-depleted cells that remain unaffected in MSL1- and MSL2-knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results support the recent finding that MOF is vital for the maintenance of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2012</xref>), but we furthermore show that this is an NSL- and not MSL-related function of MOF independent of H4K16 acetylation deposition.</p><p>Taken together, our data shows that while MOF is the major acetyltransferase for lysine 16 of histone 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taipale et al., 2005</xref>), MSL-dependent H4K16 acetylation is one of several means through which MOF exerts its crucial biological functions. This notion was further supported by the finding that MOF predominantly binds to promoters of broadly expressed genes as part of the NSL complex and subsequently supports their transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). MSL1 and MSL2, on the other hand, bound to a relatively small subset of broadly expressed MOF-NSL-targeted genes that were significantly stronger expressed than those where MOF was exclusively present with NSL complex members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The additive effects of the complexes on gene expression were intriguing, and whether they influence each other's activity or exert their functions separately should be studied in the future. We propose that the MSL complex fine-tunes MOF's activity and ensures precise regulation of more specific targets—after all, their presence is essential for the recruitment of MOF to NSL-independent targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

This apparent MOF-independent binding of the individual proteins (that tended to prefer different sets of enhancers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) suggests that KANSL3 and MSL2 stimulate transcription even in the absence of the histone acetyltransferase. Both proteins are in principle capable of supporting transcription: the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of KANSL3 can directly activate transcription in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raja et al., 2010</xref>) and human MSL2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase at lysine 34 of H2B (H2BK34ub) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), which has been suggested to promote methylation of H3K4, and thus gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we observed several hundred genes that had been predicted to be regulated by TSS-distal binding sites of MSL2 or KANSL3 to be downregulated in the respective knockdowns with particularly high frequencies in MSL2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It is important to note that the subset of ESC enhancers for key pluripotency factors (e.g., <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>) were bound concomitantly by KANSL3 and MSL2 and only the depletion of KANSL3, but not of MSL1 or MSL2 diminished protein and transcript levels of these key ESC molecules (see above). It is possible that KANSL3 could rescue loss of MSL2 at certain loci, but the exact mechanisms through which KANSL3 affects transcription via enhancer-binding need to be studied further. Furthermore, the pluripotency network and/or Mediator-related functions at super enhancers may be sufficient and dominant over MSL2 to maintain the expression of the pluripotency factors in the absence of MSL2, but may well be dependent on the function of KANSL3 at these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MSL1 and MSL2 repress X inactivation by regulating <italic>Tsix</italic> expression</title><p>When we specifically searched for regions where KANSL3 was not present together with MSL1 and MSL2, we found that the X inactivation center (XIC) showed numerous signals for the MSL complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The XIC, a hot-spot of regulatory lncRNAs, is an X-chromosomal region that contains the main regulators of X chromosome inactivation (XCI)<italic>.</italic> The proper function of XIC-located non-coding RNAs is influenced by the spatial organization of the XIC and governed by a sophisticated interplay of multiple transcription factors such as pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donohoe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Navarro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deuve and Avner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gontan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nora et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We found that depletion of MSL1 and MSL2 severely reduced <italic>Tsix</italic> expression in male and in female ESCs, moderately increased <italic>Xist</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), but left pluripotency factors unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, MOF-depleted cells showed downregulation of pluripotency factors and much higher <italic>Xist</italic> levels. Previous studies demonstrated that in undifferentiated ESCs, where pluripotency factors are highly abundant, even severe downregulation of <italic>Tsix</italic>, or <italic>Tsix</italic>-deletion has almost no effect on <italic>Xist</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nesterova et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the pronounced <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation seen in MOF-depleted cells seems to be an indirect effect due to the downregulation of pluripotency factors, while the reduction of <italic>Tsix</italic> transcripts in MSL1- and MSL2-depleted cells, where pluripotency factors remain unaffected, has milder consequences on <italic>Xist</italic> levels.</p><p>Consequently, we could show that once ESCs are forced to initiate differentiation, the depletion of MOF has mild effects while MSL1- and MSL2-depleted cells, in which <italic>Tsix</italic> expression is prematurely downregulated, indeed suffer from enhanced <italic>Xist</italic> accumulation accompanied by ‘chaotic’ X inactivation (different numbers of inactivated X chromosomes within a population of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that the repressive potential of <italic>Tsix</italic> on <italic>Xist</italic> accumulation and the role of <italic>Tsix</italic> and the <italic>DXPas34</italic> locus in the process of counting and choice of XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vigneau et al., 2006</xref>) becomes fully apparent during early stages of differentiation where additional repressive factors such as pluripotency factors are downregulated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rougeulle and Avner, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that NSL and MSL complex members can function in concert to ensure proper regulation of gene expression, but our findings also strongly imply that members of both complexes have the capacity to act independently.

We also removed reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome and ‘random’ chromosomes, as well as known major satellites and duplicated genome regions to avoid coverage biases.</p><p>For normalization procedures, several modules of the deepTools suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://deeptools.github.io/">https://deeptools.github.io</ext-link>) were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramirez et al., 2014</xref>). To ensure a fair comparison between all data sets, first, the GC bias of all mapped reads was determined and, if necessary, corrected so that input and ChIP samples had similar GC distributions of their reads (correctGCbias module). In addition, all aligned read files were corrected for sequencing depth using the signal extraction method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diaz et al.

Only peaks present in both replicates were considered, using the borders and summits defined by peak calling results for the merged replicates. In addition, peaks with −10log<sub>10</sub>(p-values) lower than 50 and false-discovery rate values greater than 0.1% were excluded from down-stream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Annotation used for genome-wide analyses</title><p>We used the RefSeq gene list for genome version mm9/NCBI37. Unless specified otherwise, alternative transcription start sites were scored as individual TSS in the respective analyses. The list of genes with homologues in different species was downloaded from HomoloGene and subsequently filtered for pairs of mouse and fly genes that belong to the same clusters of homology ID. CpG island information was downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), mean observed over expected CpG ratios were extracted for the TSSs ± 0.5 kb using UCSC tools.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Clustering</title><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, a matrix containing the normalized ChIP-seq signals for all peaks was generated as follows: first, the union of peaks was created using mergeBed from the bedtools suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>); then each region was binned to 2 kb and the normalized ChIP values were extracted in 50 bp windows. The ChIP signal values were rank-transformed, converted into euclidean distances using the R function ‘dist’ and subsequently ordered according to their similarity by the ‘hclust’ function (using Ward's method). The resulting dendrogram was pruned to 2 to 10 clusters for which the individual ChIP signals for unscaled regions were extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Visual inspection revealed no striking differences of the binding patterns between the individual clusters for more than 5 clusters.</p><p>The 3 clusters displayed in the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> were obtained similarly: first, a matrix was generated that contained the normalized ChIP-seq values of MOF, p300, H3K4me1 and DNase hypersensitivity sites for all regions of cluster D that did not overlap with ESC enhancers. The regions were then scaled to 1400 bp and mean values were computed for 50 bp bins using the computeMatrix module of deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramirez et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Barbara Panning, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were generally supportive of the content of the manuscript and felt that it added new important information on the potential roles of the MOF complexes in stem and progenitor cells. However, there were a number of queries about the interpretation of the results and suggestions for more experimental data that would be needed to make the paper acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. If you feel you can address all of the issues and provide the appropriate experimental data, we will be happy to consider a revised manuscript.</p><p>It would seem that some more experiments on the biological effects of depletion of the complexes should be included. The phenotype of ES cells after depletion of NSL and MSL proteins such as ES proliferation and differentiation need to be included for documenting the biological function and relevance. The properties of the NPC cells should be better described, along with the efficiency of the differentiation process (i.e., what proportion of derived cells are definitive NPC). It would also be interesting to have comments on the positioning of the MSL/H4K16ac peak across the DXPas34 region of the X. This is some distance from the Tsix promoter. What does this rather precise positioning tell us about MSL's function in this region?</p><p>From the presented data it appears highly unlikely that the individual M/NSL proteins act through a coherent mechanism. The text often refers to “Both complexes bind to ...” but this might be misleading as there is hardly any binding of “complexes” rather than individual proteins acting independently. This weakens the manuscript as interesting data that Msl2 and Smads might be interacting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; is this independent of Mof?). Our impression when reading the paper was that a lot of speculative correlations are included where no biological function can be clearly associated which may be exhausting to some readers. We suggest you focus the study on biologically relevant observations and demonstrate their functional importance. Does Msl2 depletion affect Smad signaling?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02024.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>It would seem that some more experiments on the biological effects of depletion of the complexes should be included</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. Upon revision we have now added a series of new experiments to further elaborate on the biological significance of the MSL and NSL proteins. In short, we added the following findings:</p><p>We show the overall effects on ESC growth and differentiation upon MSL1, MSL2, MOF and KANSL3 depletion. We added genome-wide RNA-seq analyses in MSL1-, MSL2-, MOF- and KANSL3-depleted ES cells. We added additional Xist RNA-FISH experiments upon ESC differentiation to show the dramatic acceleration of Xist-mediated X-chromosomal coating leading to X inactivation and upon MSL1 and MSL2 depletion. We also observe ‘chaotic’ coating of both X chromosomes previously associated with Tsix-DXPas34 deletion, which has been implicated in the processes of counting and choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vigneau, Augui et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>We strongly believe that the new datasets added upon revision not only elucidate the biological significance of these complexes in mammals in more detail; they also highlight a beautiful analogy of the MSL-specific function in Drosophila and mammals to keep the X chromosome active.</p><p><italic>The phenotype of ES cells after depletion of NSL and MSL proteins such as ES proliferation and differentiation need to be included for documenting the biological function and relevance</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment to strengthen the manuscript. We have now added the following newly generated data to provide insights into the biological function and relevance of the NSL and MSL proteins.</p><p>Growth and morphological analyses in ES cells: In the figure supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3 and 4</xref>, we now added growth curves and cell morphology data including AP staining upon MSL1, MSL2, KANSL3 and MOF depletion in ES cells.</p><p>Genome-wide RNA-seq analyses in MSL1-, MSL2-, MOF- and KANSL3-depleted ES cells: To obtain a global overview of the extent of mis-regulation following depletion of MSL and NSL proteins, we performed thorough RNA-seq analyses of control, MSL1-, MSL2-, KANSL3- and MOF-depleted male ES cells. The results provide novel insights into the biological function of these proteins. We find that MOF-and KANSL3-depletion particularly affect genes that were determined as TSS targets in the ChIP-seq analysis while MSL1 and MSL2 predominantly affect TSS-distal target genes. This data further demonstrates the distinct functions of these proteins in ES cells.</p><p><italic>The properties of the NPC cells should be better described, along with the efficiency of the differentiation process (ie. what proportion of derived cells are definitive NPC)</italic>.</p><p>We used a well-established 4-stage procedure that has been shown before to give rise to homogeneous populations of NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conti, Pollard et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Splinter, de Wit et al. 2011</xref>). The efficiency of this method has been proven in the field in many occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gendrel, Attia et al. 2014</xref>). In addition, we selected for NPCs growing in monolayers and exhibiting identical morphology by keeping cells for 5-10 passages to filter out the remaining embryoid bodies. To support our results, we now include an overview of expression values for ESC- and NPC-markers as well as immunostaining for NESTIN (well characterized marker of NPCs) in ESCs as well as NPCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B and 1C</xref>.</p><p><italic>It would also be interesting to have comments on the positioning of the MSL/H4K16ac peak across the DXPas34 region of the X. This is some distance from the Tsix promoter. What does this rather precise positioning tell us about MSL's function in this region</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point. We added a brief paragraph discussing this in the text. We would also like to draw the reviewers’ attention to the fact that Tsix possesses two promoters and that the major promoter (to which we refer in the manuscript as P2) is in close proximity to the DXPas34 locus. It has been also previously shown that the DXPas34 locus on its own (without promoter region) can support the transcription of Tsix and it acts as the major enhancer for Tsix}. We now specified the exact location of MSL1, MSL2 and MOF across the given locus in the text as well as in the respective figures and extended information about properties and importance of Tsix and DXPase34 locus in the last section of results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and discussion.</p><p>“The XIC site with the strongest concomitant enrichments of MSL1, MSL2 and MOF was the major promoter (P2) of Tsix and its intronic minisatellite – DXPas34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A and 5B</xref>). DXPas34 is a well-characterized tandem repeat that serves as a binding platform for multiple transcription factors and contains bidirectional enhancing properties essential for the expression of Tsix, the antisense transcript of Xist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debrand, Chureau et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, Davidow et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donohoe, Zhang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Navarro, Oldfield et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gontan, Achame et al. 2012</xref>). In rodents, Tsix antisense transcription across the Xist promoter is required for regulating the levels of Xist accumulation. In turn, DXPas34 deletion impairs the recruitment of Pol II and TFIIB to the major promoter of Tsix causing its downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vigneau, Augui et al. 2006</xref>).”</p><p><italic>From the presented data it appears highly unlikely that the individual M/NSL proteins act through a coherent mechanism. The text often refers to “Both complexes bind to ...” but this might be misleading as there is hardly any binding of “complexes” rather than individual proteins acting independently. This weakens the manuscript as interesting data that Msl2 and Smads might be interacting (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4G</italic></xref><italic>; is this independent of Mof?)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the point raised by the reviewers. Indeed, our data shows that MSL and NSL proteins could work synergistically but also independently of other complex members in vivo. We have revised our text and analyses and have clearly stated when we refer to the MOF-containing complexes (i.e., MSL = MOF + MSL1 + MSL2; NSL = MOF + KANSL3 + MCRS1) or the individual complex members.</p><p>Just like the reviewers, we are also intrigued by the distinct MSL2 binding and this finding definitely merits an independent and thorough analysis which is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We believe that this MOF-independent MSL2 binding is an important piece of information for the epigenetics community, which we would like to keep in the manuscript. As, indeed, we cannot offer much more than speculations on the functional implication of these binding sites, we have moved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> to the supplementary information.</p><p><italic>Our impression when reading the paper was that a lot of speculative correlations are included where no biological function can be clearly associated which may be exhausting to some readers. We suggest you focus the study on biologically relevant observations and demonstrate their functional importance</italic>. <italic>Does Msl2 depletion affect Smad signaling?</italic></p><p>We have now modified the text so that the emphasis is given on targets where we observe an effect upon depletion of the ChIPed proteins. We have also expanded and added additional data on the regulation of Tsix to further strengthen the direct role of the MSL complex in regulation of Tsix. Eventhough we have extended our results section (due to the addition of new data) we have shortened our discussion to focus on those observations directly supported by our experiments.</p><p>For MSL2/Smad connection, please see the response above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
