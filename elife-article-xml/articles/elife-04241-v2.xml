We dissect how 21% O<sub>2</sub>, an indicator of surface exposure, reprograms <italic>C. elegans</italic>' global state, inducing sustained locomotory arousal and altering expression of neuropeptides, metabolic enzymes, and other non-neural genes. The URX O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons drive arousal at 21% O<sub>2</sub> by tonically activating the RMG interneurons. Stimulating RMG is sufficient to switch behavioral state. Ablating the ASH, ADL, or ASK sensory neurons connected to RMG by gap junctions does not disrupt arousal. However, disrupting cation currents in these neurons curtails RMG neurosecretion and arousal. RMG signals high O<sub>2</sub> by peptidergic secretion. Neuropeptide reporters reveal neural circuit state, as neurosecretion stimulates neuropeptide expression. Neural imaging in unrestrained animals shows that URX and RMG encode O<sub>2</sub> concentration rather than behavior, while the activity of downstream interneurons such as AVB and AIY reflect both O<sub>2</sub> levels and the behavior being executed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04241.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04241.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04241.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>From humans to worms, animals must respond appropriately to environmental challenges to survive. Starving animals must conserve energy while they seek food; animals that encounter a predator must fight or flee. These responses involve the animals re-programming their bodies and behavior, and, in humans, are thought to coincide with feelings or emotions such as ‘hunger’ and ‘fear’. Understanding these states in humans is difficult, but studies of simpler animals may provide some insights.</p><p>The microscopic worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> offers a unique advantage to these studies because it has the most precisely described nervous system of any animal. The worm lives in rotting fruit, but it avoids the fruit's surface, perhaps because there is an increased risk of it drying out or being eaten by predators. Microbes that grow within the rotting fruit reduce the oxygen level below the 21% oxygen found in the surrounding air, and so one strategy that <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses to avoid surface exposure is to continuously monitor the oxygen concentration. If the worm senses that the oxygen level is approaching 21%, which suggests it is nearing the surface, it reverses and turns around. If it cannot find a lower-oxygen environment, the worm switches to continuous rapid movement until it locates such an environment, and adapts its body for surface exposure.</p><p>Laurent, Soltesz et al. sought to understand the circuit of neurons that controls this switch. Monitoring gene expression in the worms revealed that specific oxygen-sensing neurons help generate the widespread changes that occur in the worm's body. These neurons also control the switch in the worm's behavior. Sensory neurons relay signals to downstream neurons that act on muscles to alter behavior. Neurons typically communicate with other neurons via specific connections; but neurons can also release signaling molecules, which act like ‘wireless’ signals and can affect many other cells. Laurent, Soltesz et al. showed that both kinds of signaling are needed to change the worm's behavior, and suggest that the release of signaling molecules may explain the widespread effects of 21% oxygen on the worm.</p><p>Laurent, Soltesz et al. then monitored the activity of neurons in freely moving worms, and found that some neurons appear to encode and relay specific sensory information. Other neurons encode the behavior the animal is performing, and yet others can encode both kinds of information. To confirm which neurons control particular behavioral responses, Laurent, Soltesz et al. measured changes in the worm’s behavior after destroying or altering specific cells, or while they used light-based techniques to artificially excite or inhibit specific neurons.</p><p>At a simple level the worm's response to 21% oxygen resembles the response of a mammal to a dangerous environment: both become more aroused, change how they respond to other sensory cues, and adapt both their bodies and behavior. As such, <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a great model to explore at a small and accessible scale how changes in animals' states are generated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04241.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04241.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd><kwd>caenorhabditis</kwd><kwd>TRPV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soltesz</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>269058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Bono</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sensory neurons that monitor ambient oxygen control a cascade of responses across multiple layers of interneurons to switch the global state of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, reprogramming behavior and gene expression to enable escape from or adaptation to surface exposure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammals adopt different global states in response to threats or opportunities by coordinated changes in physiology and neurochemistry that optimize and focus their response to the situation at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux, 2012</xref>). Hallmarks of such global states include arousal, a reconfiguring of the relative importance given to different sensory cues, and altered physiology due to endocrine feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux, 2012</xref>). Examples of global states include those evoked by a potential mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pfaff et al., 2008</xref>), by predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Motta et al., 2009</xref>), or by nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sternson et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how global states are encoded in neural circuits is of interest because they may provide insights into subjective behaviors: for example, fear, aggression, and hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Damasio and Carvalho, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The exact nature of global organismic states is poorly understood. A switch in global state is thought to involve recruitment of many brain circuits whose individual activities are dynamically assembled to address the circumstances faced by the animal. A powerful entry point to study circuits orchestrating such states has involved identifying small populations of neurons whose activation or inhibition can evoke features of the states. For example, in mouse, optogenetic activation of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus can induce aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), while optogenetic control of basolateral terminals in the amygdala's central nucleus can regulate anxiety-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tye et al., 2011</xref>). How these small populations of neurons modulate different areas of the brain, how their functional effects depend on the state of other circuits, and how their activity is itself controlled, are open questions.</p><p>Invertebrates also adopt different behavioral states, for example, in response to potential mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref>), predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henschel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uma and Weiss, 2012</xref>), conspecific rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dow and von Schilcher, 1975</xref>), and nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaudry and Kristan, 2012</xref>). Some of these responses share features of global organismic states in mammals, and may provide insights into how the latter are encoded. A complication in understanding how circuits encode global animal states is that the cues evoking them are often complex. For example, a male <italic>Drosophila</italic> courting a female fly responds to visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref>); in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, starvation resets many sensory responses, including gustation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saeki et al., 2001</xref>), olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsunozaki et al., 2008</xref>), and thermotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>), but how starvation is sensed and communicated to sensory circuits is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milward et al., 2011</xref>). A way around this problem is to identify animal state changes that are robustly linked to single identified sensory inputs, providing a defined entry point to dissect how neural networks are reconfigured to encode global states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kubli and Bopp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Surface exposure is hazardous for some terrestrial invertebrates, for example, due to desiccation and predation, and triggers a switch in behavioral state as animals seek to escape it. Oxygen concentration [O<sub>2</sub>] is 21% at the surface but lower in buried spaces due to biomass respiration. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> can recognize surface exposure by measuring [O<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). An increase in O<sub>2</sub> from 19% to 21% elicits avoidance behaviors: animals reverse and change their direction of travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). If after these maneuvers <italic>C. elegans</italic> fails to find an environment with lower [O<sub>2</sub>], they become highly active, suggesting a simple form of arousal associated with escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). This activated state is sustained for at least 2 hr, and potentially until animals locate an environment with lower O<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Avoidance and escape from 21% O<sub>2</sub> are driven principally by O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons called URX, AQR, and PQR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couto et al., 2013</xref>). The pair of URX neurons is the most important, and is necessary and sufficient to mediate these responses. In these neurons, rising O<sub>2</sub> stimulates an atypical O<sub>2</sub>-binding soluble guanylate cyclase composed of GCY-35 and GCY-36 subunits (<italic>gcy</italic>, <italic>g</italic>uanylate <italic>cy</italic>clase), leading to cGMP channel opening, and activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couto et al., 2013</xref>). The response of URX neurons (as well as AQR and PQR) to 21% O<sub>2</sub> is tonic, that is, non-adapting, and alters other behaviors besides promoting rapid movement. At 19% O<sub>2</sub>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> strongly avoids carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but at 21% O<sub>2</sub> tonic URX signaling suppresses this avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</xref>). Tonic signaling from the O<sub>2</sub> sensors induces <italic>C. elegans</italic> to leave depleting food patches at much higher rates in 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lima and Dill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milward et al., 2011</xref>). This behavior is consistent with ecological studies of many species showing that animals tend to leave foraging sites when threat levels rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lima and Dill, 1990</xref>). The O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons also promote aggregation and accumulation where bacterial food is thickest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coates and de Bono, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rogers et al., 2006</xref>). Besides reconfiguring behavior, O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons alter physiology: they regulate lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu and Cai, 2013</xref>) and body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mok et al., 2011</xref>). In summary, <italic>C. elegans</italic> perceives 21% O<sub>2</sub> as a threat, and responds to it via a discrete set of O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons whose tonic activity coordinates an altered global organismic state.</p><p>The striking behavioral switch observed in natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates at 21% O<sub>2</sub> cannot be studied in the laboratory reference strain, N2 (Bristol), due to a gain-of-function mutation in a FMRFamide-like peptide (FLP) receptor, called NPR-1 (<italic>n</italic>euro<italic>p</italic>eptide <italic>r</italic>eceptor family) that arose during domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Knocking out <italic>npr-1</italic> restores to N2 (Bristol) animals strong responses to 21% O<sub>2</sub>. NPR-1 is expressed in about 20 neural types, including the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons AQR, PQR, and URX, and their post-synaptic partners RMG and AUA. The NPR-1 215V receptor alters the function of several of these neurons, including URX and RMG, although the mechanisms involved are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coates and de Bono, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate how O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons evoke a change in global <italic>C. elegans</italic> state in response to 21% O<sub>2</sub>. We trace information flow from a defined entry point—the URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors—to downstream circuits that implement the change in state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>O<sub>2</sub> levels can reprogram <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene expression through O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons</title><p>We hypothesized that tonic signaling from the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons URX, AQR, and PQR could reprogram gene expression according to ambient O<sub>2</sub> levels.

To prevent <italic>npr-1</italic> animals from aggregating, which induces gene expression changes that would confound our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2014</xref>), we grew animals at low density.

We then intersected the three comparisons, using as a cut-off q value of 0.05 (see ‘Materials and methods’). If our hypothesis was correct, many of the genes identified as differentially expressed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (<italic>npr-1</italic> 21% O<sub>2</sub> vs <italic>npr-1</italic> 7% O<sub>2</sub>) should also be identified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> (<italic>npr-1</italic> 21% O<sub>2</sub> vs <italic>gcy-35</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> 21% O<sub>2</sub>) but not in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> (<italic>gcy-35</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> 21% O<sub>2</sub> vs <italic>gcy-35</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> 7% O<sub>2</sub>).

To investigate the dynamic range of URX–RMG signaling, and to examine if graded RMG activity can evoke graded changes in the animal's speed, we stimulated RMG in animals kept at either 7% O<sub>2</sub> or 21% O<sub>2</sub>. The effects of activating RMG using ChR2 summated with input from the O<sub>2</sub> sensory circuit: animals kept at 21% reached higher speeds and inhibited reversals more strongly than animals kept at 7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). These data suggest that the dynamic range of the circuit permits higher levels of RMG activation to evoke qualitatively similar but quantitatively stronger behavioral responses.</p><p>RMG and URX are connected by gap junctions and by reciprocal chemical synapses. Stimulating RMG using ChR2 could therefore alter behavior by activating URX. To test this, we selectively activated RMG using ChR2 in animals ablated for URX (and AQR and PQR). Ablated animals robustly increased their speed and suppressed reversals upon light-activation of RMG, both at 7% and at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). As expected if O<sub>2</sub> input was lost, the speed responses of the ablated animals were not influenced by the O<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The ability of RMG stimulation to induce rapid movement and inhibit reversals in the absence of URX, AQR, and PQR neurons suggests that feed-forward signaling from RMG to other neurons evokes these behaviors.</p><p>Our results did not exclude that RMG influences URX activity. To investigate this possibility, we ablated RMG neurons in L1 larvae and imaged URX Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in young adults 2 days later. <italic>npr-1</italic> animals lacking RMG showed a much smaller URX Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to a 7–21% O<sub>2</sub> stimulus compared to mock ablated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, not only does URX activate RMG in response to rising O<sub>2</sub>, but RMG input somehow regulates URX excitability. Although the gap junctions and synaptic connections between URX and RMG provide a direct route for such communication, we cannot exclude more indirect mechanisms. However, consistent with a role for synaptic input in sustaining URX excitability, partial loss-of-function mutants of <italic>unc-64</italic> syntaxin, which have deficits in synaptic release, showed reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in URX and RMG both at 7% and 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,K</xref>). URX neurons could still evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in RMG in <italic>unc-64</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, since the <italic>unc-64</italic> allele we used is a partial loss-of-function (null mutants are dead), we cannot draw firm conclusions about the relative roles of gap junctions and synaptic transmission in mediating URX–RMG communication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FLP-21–NPR-1 signaling limits the output of the RMG circuitry</title><p>Excessive signaling from a hyperactive neuropeptide receptor, NPR-1 215V, prevents N2 (Bristol) animals from moving rapidly on food at 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>).

We exposed transgenic animals to constant blue light of different intensities, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. As expected, control animals not exposed to blue light did not strongly modulate their speed when switched between 7% and 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Thus, injecting a constant Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> current into ASH neurons is sufficient to restore O<sub>2</sub> modulation to the circuit in <italic>ocr-2; npr-1</italic> animals. This suggests that the effects of the <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutation are not developmental, as they can be rescued in adult animals.

To test explicitly if current can flow in the reverse direction, from ASH to RMG, we asked if strongly activating ASH using a noxious stimulus evoked a rise in RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As expected, a 10 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> stimulus resulted in a large, sharp rise in ASH Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was easily detectable using YC3.60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilliard et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). By contrast, this stimulus failed to evoke any Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the RMG cell body that could be measured with YC2.60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggest that the anatomically defined gap junctions may not allow significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> current to flow from the ASH to the RMG cell body under our imaging conditions. How, then, does OCR-2 promote RMG activity? An alternative model is that by tonically/chronically depolarizing ASH and ADL neurons, OCR-2 reduces the current flowing from RMG to ASH and ADL via gap junctions. In <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants, a more negative membrane potential in ASH and ADL leads to more current being shunted from RMG to the nociceptive neurons, reducing RMG activity. To test this hypothesis, we compared O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in URX and RMG in <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Surprisingly, the steady state Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the URX or RMG cell bodies were not significantly affected by the <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutation. Since the tetanus toxin experiments suggested that rescue of the <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> phenotype by a <italic>pASH::ocr-2</italic> transgene did not require synaptic transmission, we speculate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects of disrupting <italic>ocr-2</italic> are local to the gap junctions and not visible at the RMG cell body. Alternatively, ASH and ADL have the potential to leach away some other excitatory factor from RMG via gap junctions, and OCR-2 activity in ASH and ADL can attenuate this.</p><p>If loss of the OCR-2 TRPV channel somehow reduced the functionality of RMG, injecting current directly into RMG should rescue the phenotype of <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> animals.

This contrasts with the failure of ChR2-driven RMG activation to drive tonic changes in behavioral state in N2 animals (which express the NPR-1 215V receptor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

A <italic>ppdf-1::gfp</italic> transgene is expressed in PVP and AVB, two neurons heavily connected with O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons: PVP has gap junctions with AQR and PQR, whereas AVB has gap junctions with AQR and receives synaptic input from AQR, URX, and RMG. Expression of <italic>ppdf-1::gfp</italic> in both PVP and AVB was upregulated at 21% O<sub>2</sub> compared to 7% O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the activity of these neurons is also modulated by O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and see below).

The neuropeptide FLP-17 is expressed by BAG neurons and released when BAG is depolarized in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).

The neuropeptide FLP-3 is expressed in the IL1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim and Li, 2004</xref>), which are part of a touch-responsive circuit, are poorly connected to known O<sub>2</sub>-modulated neurons, and do not express NPR-1. <italic>pflp-3::gfp</italic> expression in IL1 was not regulated by O<sub>2</sub> or <italic>npr-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data suggest that O<sub>2</sub> levels regulate <italic>flp-11</italic>, <italic>flp-5</italic>, <italic>flp-21</italic>, <italic>flp-17</italic>, and <italic>pdf-1</italic> peptide gene expression and peptide release in multiple neurons, including URX, AUA, RMG, RMH, BAG, PVP, and AVB, but not URA, SAB, IL1, M2, and M4.

We have shown that RMG activity is sufficient to drive high locomotory activity, and that ASH, ADL, and ASK are each dispensable for these effects. Does peptidergic signaling from RMG contribute to driving high locomotory activity at high O<sub>2</sub>? We first tested the effects of blocking all neurosecretion from RMG using cell-specific expression of a tetanus toxin transgene in <italic>npr-1</italic>. To monitor expression, we used a polycistronic construct that co-expressed the toxin with RFP. Animals expressing the transgene lost any tonic response to high O<sub>2</sub> and remained very poorly active at all O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

We next tested more specifically if neuropeptides secreted from RMG were required, using cell-specific RNAi to knock down the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) <italic>egl-21</italic> in RMG.

We envisioned three ways by which O<sub>2</sub> circuit output might alter downstream circuits.

In a different model, behavioral state would be encoded across multiple neurons whose activity does not faithfully track O<sub>2</sub> concentration, but which on average show O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. To investigate these possibilities, we used Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to image the activity of motoneurons, and of interneurons in layers upstream of motoneurons, at different O<sub>2</sub> environments. The third possibility would not involve regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, but rather presynaptic effects that would only be observed using other reporters, such as the peptide promoter assay.</p><p>We focused our studies on four sets of neurons: the A and B motoneurons, which are thought to mediate reverse and forward movement, respectively; the AVA ‘command’ interneurons, which promote backward movement by ensuring that the A motoneurons are more active than the B motoneurons; the AVB ‘command’ interneurons which promote forward movement by ensuring that the B motoneurons are more active than the A motoneurons; and the AIY interneurons which do not have anatomically defined connections with URX or RMG but are post-synaptic to multiple other sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">White et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormwiring.org">wormwiring.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This fictive behavior contrasted with the real behavior of animals moving on an agar plate, which only reverse for a few seconds.

Moreover, when we exposed animals to a graded O<sub>2</sub> series of 21–14–7–21%, we found that, despite frequent switches in activity, the average activity in AVB and AIY was modulated by O<sub>2</sub> levels, with higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 21% compared to 7% in both neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04241.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous and O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in interneurons and motoneurons in immobilized animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Spontaneous bi-stable Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses observed in VA and VB neurons (<bold>A</bold>) and in AVA and AVB neurons (<bold>B</bold>) in individual <italic>npr-1</italic> animals immobilized with 3 mM levamisole and kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub>.

Neuropeptides are used across a wide phylogenetic spectrum to create, maintain, or amplify neuronal network states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marder et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple downstream neurons show long-lasting activity changes in response to the tonic information from URX, AQR, PQR, and RMG. The AIY and AVB interneurons act downstream of URX–RMG to promote rapid forward movement at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Unlike URX and RMG neurons, whose Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels tonically report O<sub>2</sub> levels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in AIY and AVB vary widely and rapidly even when O<sub>2</sub> levels are unchanging. On average however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these neurons is higher at 21% O<sub>2</sub> than at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, tonic input from O<sub>2</sub> circuits modulates but does not set AIY and AVB activity. Rapidly varying Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in AIY and AVB likely reflect the ability of these neurons to respond to inputs from other sensory circuits while receiving tonic signals from the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neuropeptide gene transcription as readout of circuit activity</title><p>To delineate long-term changes in the activity of neural populations, we sought simple readouts of neurosecretory activity that do not depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging approaches, although powerful, are blind to signaling mechanisms that alter synaptic and neurosecretory activity without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We were inspired by sporadic reports suggesting a positive correlation between neural activity and neuropeptide gene transcription in the mammalian brain. By studying multiple neuropeptide genes expressed in URX, RMG, and other neurons, we showed that transcription of these genes is positively coupled to the secretory activity of the neurons expressing them. The feedback loop appears to act downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and to be linked to neurosecretion itself, since it can be disrupted by expressing tetanus toxin, which inhibits synaptic release by cleaving synaptobrevin. The effects of tetanus toxin on neuropeptide expression recapitulate the effects of manipulating circuit activity by disrupting signaling molecules or by altering O<sub>2</sub> levels. If our observations are generalizable, neuropeptide transcriptional reporters provide a way to dissect tonic modulation of secretory activity in neural networks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 inhibits RMG output downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The ability of RMG interneurons to alter behavioral state according to ambient O<sub>2</sub> is inhibited by an NPY/RFamide-like neuropeptide receptor, NPR-1.

First, we do not observe a striking difference in O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in RMG between <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>npr-1 215V</italic> animals. Second, whereas ChR2 activation of RMG can induce <italic>npr-1</italic> animals kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> to switch to rapid movement, it has little effect on animals encoding the NPR-1 215V receptor, even at 21% O<sub>2</sub> when RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are high. Third, transcriptional reporters of neuropeptide genes suggest that NPR-1 215V inhibits neurosecretion from RMG and other neurons. NPR-1 may inhibit synaptic release by altering the balance between G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> signaling in favor of G<sub>o</sub>.

Previous work suggested that the RMG hub redistributes inputs across the spoke sensory neurons through gap junctions to direct behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). The importance of gap junctions in the circuit was inferred from the anatomy and genetic manipulations. Whether RMG could propagate electrical signals or Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the network, and if so in which direction, or if gap junctions were rectifying or passive gates was unknown. Our data revise our understanding of how this circuit works, as detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ASK is not a necessary output for the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked behavioral switch</title><p>ASK are ‘OFF’ neurons that act analogously to vertebrate photoreceptors, responding to ascaroside pheromones or food stimuli with a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). ASK neurons were proposed to be a major output of the RMG hub-and-spoke network, inducing rapid movement at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and promoting aggregation in response to pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). In this model, RMG stimulates ASK excitability via gap junctions in aggregating strains, but in solitary strains this is prevented because NPR-1 215V directly or indirectly inhibits gap junctional signaling in the network. We find that ablating ASK neurons or reducing their activity using halorhodopsin does not disrupt either O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in locomotory activity, or aggregation behavior. These data suggest ASK is not required for either of these responses, although we cannot exclude that it acts redundantly with other neurons to promote these behaviors.</p><p>The ASK ablation result contrasts with both our own data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tremain, 2004</xref>) and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). Both these studies show that <italic>npr-1</italic> animals defective in the cGMP gated ion channel TAX-4 fail to aggregate or to move rapidly in normoxia, and that these behaviors can be restored by expressing TAX-4 in URX and ASK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tremain, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). Why does ablating ASK have different behavioral consequences from disrupting cGMP signaling in this neuron? One possibility is that removing <italic>tax-4</italic> reduces the basal excitability of ASK (and other TAX-4-expressing neurons) and shunts current from RMG, compromising its ability to direct O<sub>2</sub> responses. However, since <italic>tax-4</italic> mutations disrupt many sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Bono and Maricq, 2005</xref>), other explanations are also possible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>OCR-2-expressing neurons facilitate RMG interneuron signaling</title><p>Disrupting the OCR-2 TRPV-like cation channel attenuates the switch in locomotory state evoked in <italic>npr-1</italic> animals by 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Restoring <italic>ocr-2</italic> to any one of the ASH, ADL, or ADF neurons restores O<sub>2</sub> modulation of locomotion to <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> animals. Injecting current in ASH neurons using channelrhodopsin also restores strong modulation of locomotion by O<sub>2</sub> to <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants, consistent with <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutations chronically reducing ASH activity. The neuroanatomy suggests that ASH and ADL are gap-junctionally connected to RMG. Although a rise in O<sub>2</sub> evokes an increase in ASH Ca<sup>2+</sup>, several findings argue against a simple ‘hub-to-spoke’ model in which ASH and ADL spokes are necessary to relay RMG hub activity outwards to evoke behavioral responses. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in ASH upon switch to 21% O<sub>2</sub> is very small. Ablating ASH and ADL, or expressing tetanus toxin in these neurons, does not disrupt the O<sub>2</sub> regulation of locomotion. Moreover, selective expression of <italic>ocr-2</italic> in ADF neurons, which are not gap-junctionally connected to RMG, can partially rescue the <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> phenotype. Nevertheless, OCR-2 currents in ASH or ADL can influence the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in locomotion. How? One model is that tonic/chronic OCR-2 channel activity in ASH and ADL keeps these neurons depolarized and limits the current shunted locally from RMG to these neurons. Several observations support this possibility. First, expression of neuropeptide reporters in RMG is downregulated in <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> animals to levels found in <italic>npr-1</italic> animals kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that loss of TRPV activity reduces neurosecretion from RMG. Second, the ability of <italic>ocr-2</italic> expression in ASH or ADL neurons to rescue the <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> phenotype does not require neurotransmission, suggesting gap junctions are involved. Third, injecting current into ASH can restore to <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> animals the O<sub>2</sub> regulated switch in high locomotory activity. Fourth, injecting current directly into RMG using channelrhodopsin can also rescue the <italic>ocr-2</italic>; <italic>npr-1</italic> phenotype, indicating that increasing RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to bypass the lack of OCR-2-dependent activity. Unexpectedly, deleting <italic>ocr-2</italic> did not affect the steady state O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the RMG cell body, suggesting that any effects on RMG Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are local. The simplest model that explains our data is that OCR-2 signaling in ASH and ADL prevents shunting of current, or loss of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent second messenger, from RMG to ASH and ADL through gap junctions. Membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are not necessarily coupled, and a local current leak through gap junctions can be functionally important without necessarily altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the soma.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>RMG outputs</title><p>We show that none of the spoke neurons of the RMG ‘hub and spoke’ are individually necessary for RMG to alter the behavioral state in response to changes in O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>npr-1</italic> animals. This contrasts with the analysis of an anatomically similar circuit that mediates nose touch perception in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatzigeorgiou and Schafer, 2011</xref>). In that circuit, OLQ and CEP mechanoreceptors that are coupled by gap junctions to each other and to the RIH hub interneuron act as coincidence detectors, pooling information through RIH, which in turn enables the high threshold FLP mechanoreceptors, also connected to RIH via gap junctions, to evoke a response to a gentle nose touch. In the RMG circuit, reducing RMG neurosecretory output by cell-selective expression of tetanus toxin or RNAi knockdown of the carboxypeptidase E <italic>egl-21</italic> strongly reduces transmission of the high O<sub>2</sub> information, suggesting that peptidergic release from RMG is a major output of the URX and RMG couple.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>AVB and AIY mediate some of the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked behavior</title><p>Optogenetic experiments coupled with imaging experiments in freely moving animals provide insights into the information carried by different neurons in the O<sub>2</sub> circuit. RMG tracks O<sub>2</sub> levels, becoming more active at higher O<sub>2</sub> levels. Increased RMG activity drives faster forward movement and inhibits short reversals. However, RMG activity does not change when animals slow down or execute a reversal. Thus, RMG provides modulatory input but is not actually part of the circuit executing the behavior. Like RMG, AVB and AIY have, on average, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. However, unlike RMG, these neurons do not show continuously high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Instead, they show switches in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels that correlate with reversal behavior. Most likely, the connectivity within the reversal modules (AIA, AIB, AIY, AIZ, AVA, and AVB) shapes a sequence of neuronal activation triggering/terminating the reversals. Modulation of the AVB and AIY interneurons by O<sub>2</sub> acts on top of that patterned activity to control overall locomotory pattern. AIA, AIB, and AVA neurons do not appear to be modulated by O<sub>2</sub> levels, and are involved in the reversal behavioral sequence irrespective of O<sub>2</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>).</p><p>For behavioral effectiveness, each module state should enhance a specific behavior while suppressing incompatible behaviors. Our results suggest a direct role for AVB and AIY in both promoting high speed and suppressing reversals at high [O<sub>2</sub>]. Such functions have been proposed for these neurons in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, AIY was also proposed to be involved in the control of lifespan and metabolism, something also modulated by O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Potentially, information about O<sub>2</sub> concentration could flow from URX–RMG to AVB and AIY in part through neuropeptide secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>General organismic state</title><p>Persistent changes in behavior and physiology require persistent changes in neural network activity. We identified several layers of neurons that display sustained changes in activity according to ambient O<sub>2</sub>. However, the logic of the activity of different layers differs. In the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, URX, AQR, and PQR, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors reported O<sub>2</sub> levels, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). In the first interneuronal layer, including the RMG hub interneuron and potentially the PVP interneurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels also tracked O<sub>2</sub> concentration, although these neurons probably relay other information besides O<sub>2</sub> concentration, such as activity of the TRPV expressing neurons. Moreover, the activity level of RMG controls behavioral state rather than directly commanding a specific action: RMG activity remains high at 21% O<sub>2</sub> regardless of the animal's speed or direction of travel. By contrast, the second and third layers of interneurons modulated by O<sub>2</sub> appear to be directly involved in generating specific behaviors. Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in these neurons anticipate or report the animal's behavior. The activity of some but not all of these neurons, including AVB and AIY, is modulated but not set by O<sub>2</sub> input. These downstream interneurons are probably not dedicated to a small subset of sensory inputs, as RMG or PVP might be, but instead simultaneously translate multiple streams of information into the appropriate behaviors.</p><p>Changing RMG activity is sufficient to evoke the behavioral states associated with high and low O<sub>2</sub>. Downstream of URX–RMG we find widespread modulation of neurons and neuropeptide expression/secretion, highlighting the complexity of even a simple contextual cue, O<sub>2</sub>. Neuropeptide signaling appears to be key to generating the behavioral switch. Similar to motivated states, organismic states re-organize the salience of different sensory cues and change the physiology of the animal. It is tempting to propose that peptides whose release is modulated by O<sub>2</sub> re-organize sensory responses and modify the physiology of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Studies of cross-modulation of CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance by the O<sub>2</sub> circuit support this scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</xref>). A similar example of how activation of a neuron and secretion of its associated peptides can coordinate behavioral and physiological responses is provided by mammalian tonic nociceptive neurons. In addition to amplifying the nociceptive signal in the spinal cord, the release of tachykinin and CGRP peptides from the nociceptive neurons alters gene expression in the surrounding tissues, producing neurogenic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlton, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral states and emotions are under intense investigation in mammalian systems, but the circuits engaged in implementing these states are only partially mapped.

Where this was not a viable option due to the complexity of the expression pattern, we used a semi-supervised heuristic tracking approach in which in each frame the area within a 20-by-20 pixel square centered around the location of the centroid of the region of interest (ROI) in the previous frame was examined for potential matches. Regions whose intensity differed by less than 1/3 from that of the ROI identified in the previous frame, and whose centroids were located within a 10-pixel radius of the ROI location in the previous frame, were identified as candidates for the ROI in the current frame. If no such candidates were detected, user input was requested in identifying the ROI in the current frame. If exactly one such candidate was detected, it was identified as the ROI in the current frame. If more than one such candidate was detected, match quality scores were calculated for each candidate based on their differences in intensity and centroid location from the ROI in the previous frame. If one candidate had a better quality score in both respects than all others, it was identified as the ROI in the current frame; user input was otherwise requested. In cases where the heuristic tracking method struggled to identify the ROI reliably in an automatic way, we used a user-supervised tracking method, in which a custom-sized moveable region was specified using the GUI, restricting the tracking of the brightest point within this regon of interest.</p><p>Once the centroid of the neuron of interest was identified, we calculated the mean of the 20 brightest pixels within a 10-pixel radius of the centroids for both channels independently, and subtracted from this the median pixel intensity of the respective channels as the background. We then corrected for the crosstalk by subtracting 0.6 from the ratio values.</p><p>To extract the behavior of the worm during the recording, first a more accurate measure of worm position was obtained based on not only the stage position, but also the location, within the field of view, of a successfully tracked neuron, effectively calculating the position, in stage coordinates, of the centroid of the ROI. The path was then smoothed using a moving average filter, and potential short gaps in the position data were identified, which may reflect the neuron temporarily leaving the field of view due to unexpected worm movements during the recordings. Gaps shorter than 30 frames were then filled using a spline interpolant, while gaps longer than this were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>In order to identify reversals, the direction of movement, within the coordinate system of the stage, was calculated for each frame using a central differences method, and changes in direction between successive frames were obtained. Intervals in which the worm moved slower than 10 μm/s were flagged as stationary behavior, and were excluded from further analysis. For the remaining frames, the relative changes in direction between successive frames were then examined, and periods containing changes no larger than 7.5° were classified as consistent movement. Consistent movement lasting longer than 90 s was flagged automatically as forward movements. For consistent intervals lasting shorter than this, user input was requested about the direction of the movement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics for both Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and behavioral assays used the Mann–Whitney U-test. Where we sought to compare steady state values, we chose time intervals where we expected the fluorescence ratios, or behavioral parameters, to have plateaued, that is, with a delay with respect to the timing of the switch in O<sub>2</sub> concentration or the presentation of blue or green light.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging: when presenting time series over the duration of an experiment, <italic>n</italic> refers to the number of animals imaged. When presenting event-triggered averages (e.g., time relative to the onset of a reversal), <italic>n</italic> indicates the number of events. In this case, each animal was still only imaged once, but each animal could contribute to multiple events.</p><p>Behavior: for the intervals of interest, we extracted independent per-subject means deriving from worms flagged as continuously valid for at least 10 s during the interval. A worm was considered valid at a time point if it was not in contact with another animal, it was on the food lawn, and it was located at least half a worm-length from the border. Following these criteria, each worm was sampled at most once per interval; <italic>n</italic> indicates the minimum number of samples obtained per interval for the two intervals being compared.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Yuichi Iino, Dr Chris Li, Dr P Sengupta, Dr R Shingai, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Knockout Consortium, the National BioResource Project (Japan) and the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Centre for strains, and de Bono and Schafer lab members for comments and advice.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior editor), Graeme Davis (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers (Scott Emmons and L René García), both of whom are expert in the research area of the manuscript.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Laurent et al. are reverse engineering circuit function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The circuit they are studying is one that results in multiple behavioral and physiological changes in response to elevated oxygen levels. Laurent et al. use the full range of experimental tools available in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including cell ablation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, optogenetic stimulation, cell-specific expression of transgenes to block chemical transmission and neuropeptide transmission or the cell-specific rescue of such functions in mutants, and automated behavioral analysis. They show that they can identify several layers of neurons in the pathway. Overall the data are convincing and clearly presented in the figures.</p><p>Both reviewers consider the topic interesting and consider the data well presented and supportive of your major conclusions. As you will see from the comments, both reviewers recommend significant re-writing of the text to make the manuscript accessible to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. Both reviewers list a series of suggestions that you can use as a guide to improve accessibility of your text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors should choose one way to refer to <italic>npr-1</italic> “mutants.” This can be very confusing because the N2 allele is itself a “mutant.” The authors refer to the null allele in various places as <italic>npr-1</italic>, <italic>npr-1</italic> mutant, <italic>npr-1</italic> loss of function, <italic>npr-1(null)</italic>, <italic>npr-1(ad609)</italic>, and <italic>npr-1(ky13)</italic>. As <italic>ky13</italic> is specifically referred to as a null, what is <italic>ad609</italic>? In the second sentence of the Results they already refer to “<italic>npr-1</italic> mutants.” They should explain that by this they mean a null mutation (is that right?). They should specify how they intend to refer to the null allele, and then stick to that one form throughout the paper (except where they want to specifically indicate <italic>ad609</italic> vs <italic>ky13</italic>).</p><p>2) The first section of results on changes in gene expression is very confusing and needs rewriting for clarity. URX, AQR, and PQR neurons control “part, but not all, of this response.” What part? Where is the clear statement of the number of genes that change their expression between 7% and 21% O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>gcy-36</italic>(+) but not <italic>gcy-36</italic>(–)? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> does not show this and therefore does not show what it says it does in its heading. It shows genes that change between <italic>gcy-36</italic>(+) vs <italic>gcy-36</italic>(–) at a single O<sub>2</sub> concentration (21%).</p><p>3) Start the third section of Results by saying: “Among the three O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons, the URX neurons uniquely make gap junctions and reciprocal synaptic connections with the RMG interneurons.” Since in the forgoing URX has always been mentioned as one of a group of three sensory neurons, along with AQR and PQR, the reader makes a wrong assumption and puzzles, why doesn't RMG respond to AQR and PQR when URX is ablated?</p><p>4) For all their references to neural connectivity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> wiring diagram, the authors should not only refer to the canonical White et al., paper but also to the data on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://WormWiring.org">WormWiring.org</ext-link> website. The Emmons laboratory has reevaluated the original electron micrographs and has found some discrepancies.</p><p>5) The authors show that stimulating RMG can induce the high O<sub>2</sub> behavioral response, so its activity is sufficient. But is it necessary? Where is the RMG ablation result? Has this been published already? Yes, I see, it is in Busch et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2012. This should be referred to, as well as their earlier data that the other two O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons signal via peptides to a different target. It would be helpful to make clear that the present paper focuses exclusively on the URX-RMG pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>1) The meat of the study begins with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. As a reader that is not intimately acquainted with the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing circuitry, I found it helpful to draw out the circuitry and include where <italic>ocr-2</italic>, <italic>npr-1</italic>, <italic>tax-2</italic>, <italic>flip-11</italic>, etc. were expressed. As I was going through each of the experiments, I referred to my drawing to get my bearings on which part of the circuitry the authors were probing. I suggest that the authors provide a similar circuit roadmap as supplementary figure, to provide a reference for the reader to follow throughout the paper.</p><p>2) Beginning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, as well as in the other figures, I was not sure what N refers to. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, I</xref> did not know if N referred to the number of animals? Or Did N refer to number of times that a 7%-21%-7% train was conducted on a limited number of animals, (if so how many animals?). This could be elaborated in the figure legend. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D</xref>, and elsewhere, what does N&gt; (some number) mean? The graphs have SEMs, so there must be a discreet sample size.</p><p>3) In Figure D, E and F, (as well as in later experiments), the animals are not reported to contain the <italic>lite-1</italic> mutation, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and 2K</xref>, the strains did contain <italic>lite-1</italic>; is this just a typo? On the scopes in my lab, the 430 to 480 nM light will elicit an escape response in the worm (unless they are <italic>lite-1</italic>), if the light is too intense. You might want to mention in your Material and methods how you were able get around this. I noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and 5J</xref> (no retinal) that the light source on your set-up did not irritate the animals, so you might want to mention that early on.</p><p>4) You should clarify in the Material and methods what criteria you chose to pick the intervals (black bars and red bars) that you did your statistics.</p><p>5) In the subsection headed “ASK, ASH and ADL sensory neuron which have gap junctions with RMG are not required for the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked switch in behavioral state”, I was not sure whether the punchline was that these 3 neurons were not relevant for O<sub>2</sub> sensation, or that these 3 neurons were redundant with each other for O<sub>2</sub>-responses. The latter seemed to be the case given the following section on <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutant phenotype, but stronger wording should clarify things.</p><p>6) In the subsection headed “Homeostatic re-setting of downstream O<sub>2</sub> responsive circuits according to input”, the first sentence, “… alters circuitry by a homeostatic mechanism, such as…”: the use of the word homeostatic was not clear to me. My imagination (after pondering this for minutes upon minutes) started to come up with wild ideas of acclimation and desensitization after prolonged stimulation, with the ultimate equilibration to a default behavioral state. Then my imagination wanted to know what is that default behavioral state, and this distracting thinking is not what your paper is about. If I interpret your paper's point correctly, it is about how the regulation of immediate locomotor transitions are realized in a physical set of cell connections. So again, maybe more elaboration and keeping the reader's train-of-thought from digressing can help this section.</p><p>7) In the subsection “TRPV channel activity alters O<sub>2</sub> circuit function upstream of NPR-1”, the last sentence of the first paragraph (“Instead, we suggest that TRPV dependent currents in ASH…”) needs more elaboration; there is more than one concept being stated in this sentence. This sentence puzzled me, and I am guessing (and probably wrongly), that the authors are suggesting that the ASH and ADL have the potential to leach away some excitatory factor from RMG via gap junctions; however, OCR-2 in ASH and ADL can attenuate this? Anyway clarification should make their concepts more obvious. Similarly, three sentences later, the statement, “as the tetanus toxin experiments suggested…”, also contained multiple concepts. This sentence also took me awhile to digest. Again more clarification should make this section easier to understand, and help put the next section in more context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04241.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors should choose one way to refer to</italic> npr-1 “<italic>mutants.</italic>” <italic>This can be very confusing because the N2 allele is itself a</italic> “<italic>mutant.</italic>” <italic>The authors refer to the null allele in various places as</italic> npr-1<italic>,</italic> npr-1 <italic>mutant,</italic> npr-1 <italic>loss of function,</italic> npr-1(null)<italic>,</italic> npr-1(ad609)<italic>, and</italic> npr-1(ky13)<italic>.

We agreed with our reviewer that comparing gene expression in <italic>gcy-35; npr-1</italic> animals grown at both 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub> was a highly desirable control. As we had not analyzed <italic>gcy-35; npr-1</italic> expression at 7% O<sub>2</sub> in our original microarray experiment, we repeated our study, this time using RNA sequencing, and included this condition.</p><p>Briefly, in our revised manuscript we use RNA Seq to compare gene expression of young adult <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>gcy-35; npr-1</italic> animals grown at 7% and 21% O<sub>2</sub>. In repeating the experiment we also took the opportunity to grow animals at very low density under conditions where we could see no aggregation. In this way we minimized changes in gene expression that are a consequence of aggregation behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Start the third section of Results by saying: “Among the three O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons, the URX neurons uniquely make gap junctions and reciprocal synaptic connections with the RMG interneurons.” Since in the forgoing URX has always been mentioned as one of a group of three sensory neurons, along with AQR and PQR, the reader makes a wrong assumption and puzzles, why doesn't RMG respond to AQR and PQR when URX is ablated?</italic></p><p>We have made this change.

We have added a cartoon of the circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. To keep the paper more manageable we have also removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and presented our gene expression data only in Supplementary data.</p><p><italic>2) Beginning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, as well as in the other figures, I was not sure what N refers to. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, I</xref> did not know if N referred to the number of animals?

The graphs have SEMs, so there must be a discreet sample size</italic>.</p><p>For behavioral experiments, n refers to the number of independent worms in the time interval for which the statistic was calculated. The &gt; sign (instead of an = sign) is to indicate that there are more worms on the plate than considered for the purposes of statistics. This is because some animals leave the field of view over the course of an experiment. Therefore, when comparing two intervals, one time point may have a smaller n-number than the other. In such situations we report the smaller n-number. In our revised manuscript we have explained this in the Methods, but removed the &gt; sign as it confuses rather than illuminates.</p><p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging each animal was imaged once, and n refers to the total number of animals studied. The exception is when we show event-triggered averages (e.g. time relative to reversal onset), in which case n refers to the number of events. In this case each animal was still only imaged once, but each animal could contribute to multiple events.</p><p>We say this in a section of our Methods dedicated to statistics.</p><p><italic>3) In Figure D, E and F, (as well as in later experiments), the animals are not reported to contain the lite-1 mutation, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and 2K</xref>, the strains did contain lite-1; is this just a typo? On the scopes in my lab, the 430 to 480 nM light will elicit an escape response in the worm (unless they are lite-1), if the light is too intense. You might want to mention in your Material and methods how you were able get around this. I noticed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and 5J</xref> (no retinal) that the light source on your set-up did not irritate the animals, so you might want to mention that early on</italic>.</p><p>We now say that by using low light intensities we could evoke ChR2-dependent behavioral responses without irritating animals. Note that for most of our optogenetic experiments we used lower levels of blue light to activate ChR2 than used in most published work.</p><p><italic>4) You should clarify in the Material and methods what criteria you chose to pick the intervals (black bars and red bars) that you did your statistics</italic>.</p><p>Done. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging we say: “As much as possible, we chose time intervals for statistical comparison when fluorescence ratios had stabilized. For behavioral experiments we avoid time intervals close to when we switch O<sub>2</sub> concentration”.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection headed “ASK, ASH and ADL sensory neuron which have gap junctions with RMG are not required for the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked switch in behavioral state”, I was not sure whether the punchline was that these 3 neurons were not relevant for O<sub>2</sub> sensation, or that these 3 neurons were redundant with each other for O<sub>2</sub>-responses. The latter seemed to be the case given the following section on ocr-2 mutant phenotype, but stronger wording should clarify things</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the wording to clarify this. However, as we have not ablated ASK, ASH and ADL together, we cannot explicitly state whether all three neurons are dispensable or not.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection headed “Homeostatic re-setting of downstream O<sub>2</sub> responsive circuits according to input”, the first sentence, “… alters circuitry by a homeostatic mechanism, such as…”: the use of the word homeostatic was not clear to me.

So again, maybe more elaboration and keeping the reader's train-of-thought from digressing can help this section</italic>.</p><p>We debated whether to take this section out or to keep it. On the one hand, keeping it allows us to explain why the speed of mutants kept at 7% O<sub>2</sub> is higher than that of controls, an observation that initially puzzled us. On the other hand, as our reviewer highlighted, it distracts from our main message. Given the length of the paper we decided to remove it.</p><p><italic>7) In the subsection “TRPV channel activity alters O<sub>2</sub> circuit function upstream of NPR-1”, the last sentence of the first paragraph (“Instead, we suggest that TRPV dependent currents in ASH…”) needs more elaboration; there is more than one concept being stated in this sentence.
