onset neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability are thought to arise largely from disruption of excitatory/inhibitory homeostasis. Although mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a postnatal neurological disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in <italic>MECP2,</italic> display impaired excitatory neurotransmission, the RTT phenotype can be largely reproduced in mice simply by removing MeCP2 from inhibitory GABAergic neurons. To determine what role excitatory signaling impairment might play in RTT pathogenesis, we generated conditional mouse models with <italic>Mecp2</italic> either removed from or expressed solely in glutamatergic neurons. MeCP2 deficiency in glutamatergic neurons leads to early lethality, obesity, tremor, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired acoustic startle response, which is distinct from the phenotype of mice lacking MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons. These findings reveal a role for excitatory signaling impairment in specific neurobehavioral abnormalities shared by RTT and other postnatal neurological disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14199.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14199.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14199.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rett syndrome is a childhood brain disorder that mainly affects girls and causes symptoms including anxiety, tremors, uncoordinated movements and breathing difficulties. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene called <italic>MECP2</italic>, which is found on the X chromosome. Males with <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations are rare but have more severe symptoms and die young. Many researchers who study Rett syndrome use mice as a model of the disorder. In particular, male mice with the mouse equivalent of the human <italic>MECP2</italic> gene switched off in every cell in the body (also known as <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice) show many of the features of Rett syndrome and die at a young age.</p><p>The <italic>MECP2</italic> gene is important for healthy brain activity. The brain contains two major types of neurons: excitatory neurons, which encourage other neurons to be active; and inhibitory neurons, which stop or dampen the activity of other neurons. In 2010, researchers reported that mice lacking <italic>Mecp2</italic> in only their inhibitory neurons develop most of the same problems as those mice with no <italic>Mecp2</italic> at all.</p><p>Now, Meng et al. – who include two researchers involved in the 2010 study – have asked how deleting or activating <italic>Mecp2</italic> only in excitatory neurons of mice affects Rett-syndrome-like symptoms. The experiments showed that male mice without <italic>Mecp2</italic> in their excitatory neurons develop tremors, anxiety-like behaviors, abnormal seizure-like brain activity and severe obesity; these mice also die earlier than normal mice. Female mice lacking <italic>Mecp2</italic> in half of their excitatory neurons (because the gene is on the X chromosome) were less affected than the males, and had normal life spans. These symptoms are different from those seen in mice missing <italic>Mecp2</italic> only in inhibitory neurons.</p><p>Meng et al. also found that if <italic>Mecp2</italic> was switched on only in excitatory neurons of female mice (which are a model of human Rett syndrome patients) the mice were almost completely normal. In male mice (which show more severe symptoms), activating <italic>Mecp2</italic> in only the excitatory neurons reduced the anxiety and tremors. These findings suggest that impaired excitatory neurons may be responsible for specific symptoms such as anxiety and tremors amongst other Rett-syndrome-like features.</p><p>The next challenge is to explore how the loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> changes the activity of excitatory neurons in different brain regions. Further studies could also investigate if drugs that improve the activity of excitatory neurons can be used to treat Rett syndrome patients. Finally, in a related study, Ure et al. asked if activating <italic>Mecp2</italic> in inhibitory neurons in otherwise <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice was enough to prevent some of their Rett syndrome-like symptoms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14199.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14199.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glutamatergic neurons</kwd><kwd>neurological disorders</kwd><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant 2015-05-54</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007856</institution-id><institution>Baylor College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Curtis Hankamer Basic Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS057819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007857</institution-id><institution>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U54 HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Excitatory signaling impairment contributes to neurological deficits shared by Rett syndrome and a number of postnatal neuropsychiatric disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of postnatal neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and certain types of intellectual disability are thought to involve a disturbance in excitatory/inhibitory homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>). For example, mouse models of Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe postnatal onset neurological disorder, show diminished excitatory drive and overall reduced cortical microcircuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wood et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>Met</italic> conditional deletion mouse (a model of nonsyndromic, sporadic autism) shows increased excitatory synaptic connectivity from cortical layer 2/3 to layer 5B corticostriatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qiu et al., 2011</xref>). Certainly the prevalence of epilepsy as a comorbidity with ASDs and intellectual disability disorders would suggest a tendency toward hyperexcitation, but both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations are affected in these disorders. It is difficult to discern the contributions of different neuronal groups to pathogenesis, however, in part because genes driving disorders such as RTT, Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis (<italic>MECP2, FMRP</italic>, <italic>UBE3A</italic>, and <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic>, respectively) participate in fundamental cellular processes in multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crino, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabb et al., 2011</xref>), and in part because network alterations always induce compensatory changes in the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One way to circumvent this challenge is to examine the effects of such genes on specific neuronal types. This is the approach we and others have taken to understand the contribution of various neuronal types to the complex, wide-ranging phenotype of RTT, which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitously expressed <italic>MECP2</italic> (methyl CpG-binding protein 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trappe et al., 2001</xref>). Removing <italic>Mecp2</italic> from SIM-1 expressing hypothalamic neurons, for example, results in hyperphagia, obesity and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>), whereas deficiency of MeCP2 in somatostatin-positive neurons causes seizures and stereotypies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>). The most surprising result, however, given early studies suggesting RTT involves impairment in excitatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marchetto et al., 2010</xref>), came from conditional knockout of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in GABAergic neurons. These GABAergic conditional knockout mice reproduce most of the features observed in the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice: premature lethality, stereotyped forepaw motions and other repetitive behaviors, abnormal social interaction, learning and memory deficits, hypoactivity, ataxia, and hindlimb clasping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). The only features of the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice that did not develop in the GABAergic knockouts were tremor and anxiety-like behaviors. What role, then, do the excitatory signaling impairments observed in Rett patients and previous mouse models play in RTT pathogenesis?</p><p>To answer this question, we characterized mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> deleted solely in excitatory glutamatergic neurons. We further examined null mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> re-expressed only in the glutamatergic neurons to determine which behaviors healthy excitatory neurons were sufficient to rescue. We found that loss of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons results in neurological deficits that are quite distinct from those revealed upon loss of MeCP2 in GABAergic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Vglut2</italic>-Cre mediated deletion and re-expression of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons</title><p>To target excitatory neurons specifically, we utilized an <italic>Slc17a6</italic>-Cre (also known as <italic>vesicular glutamate transporter 2-</italic>Cre, referred to as <italic>Vglut2</italic>-Cre henceforth) mouse line to express Cre recombinase in the majority of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vong et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Vglut2</italic> is the dominant glutamate vesicular transporter at embryonic and early postnatal stages: by P14 it is mostly replaced by <italic>Vglut1</italic> in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boulland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Fremeau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyazaki et al., 2003</xref>), which ensures that any Cre activity driven by <italic>Vglut2</italic> will have a broad effect on excitatory neurons. Indeed, characterization of <italic>Vglut2-</italic>Cre expression using Rosa-tdTomato reporter mice revealed that the majority of CamKII-positive glutamatergic neurons in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region expressed Cre (88% and 98%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). 99% of Cre-expressing cells were CamKII-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), indicating that Cre is specifically expressed in excitatory neurons.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from these neurons in 6- to 8-week old mice revealed reduced spontaneous action potential firing in CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) similar to that observed in the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dani et al., 2005</xref>). In the presence of synaptic transmission blockers, neurons in CKO mice showed similar firing rates in response to injected currents as WT neurons, indicating normal intrinsic excitabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To explore the cause of reduced spontaneous activity, we focused on the total excitatory and inhibitory drive onto layer V pyramidal neurons. In the presence of ongoing network activity within the slices, we recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) by voltage-clamping the cell membrane at the measured chloride-reversal potential (WT: −70.8 ± 0.4 mV; Cre: −69.1 ± 0.3 mV; Flox: −70.7 ± 0.5 mV; CKO: −69.9 ± 0.6 mV), while spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded by holding the cell at the measured cation-reversal potential (WT: 14.3 ± 0.4 mV; Cre: 12.9 ± 0.4 mV; Flox: 14.3 ± 0.8 mV; CKO: 12.7 ± 0.2 mV). Interestingly, both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic charges were reduced in CKO mouse neurons compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating that the observed reduction in cortical activity is most likely caused by reduced excitatory input to layer V neurons. To determine if the change in sEPSCs is caused by an alteration in quantal responses (miniature EPSCs, mEPSCs) or spike-driven EPSCs, we recorded α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-dependent mEPSCs. The frequency of mEPSCs recorded from CKO mice was significantly decreased when compared to WT mice and showed a trend of reduction although not significant when compared with Cre or Flox mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The amplitude of mEPSCs and both the amplitude and frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) did not differ significantly across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). These data suggest that the weakened spike-driven excitatory input to layer V pyramidal neurons largely accounts for the reduced firing rate in CKO mice.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14199.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reduced cortical activity was induced by conditional deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in glutamatergic neurons but rescued by conditional restoration of MeCP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Sample traces of spontaneous firing of Layer V neurons from CKO and control mice.

To identify the cause of weight abnormalities in both CKO and C-rescue mice, we housed mice individually in calorimetry chambers for 6 days from P25-30 to simultaneously monitor food intake, activity, and components of energy balance. After a two-day acclimation period, we assessed average food intake per day over the subsequent 3 days, accounting for initial differences in individual weights. The CKO mice consumed about 25–40% more food than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and this hyperphagia was associated with significantly greater weight and fat gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

This is particularly necessary to postnatal neurological disorders such as ASDs and intellectual disability in which the neurons are present and only partially impaired. Here we have delineated the contributions of MeCP2 loss in glutamatergic neurons to several neurological deficits shared by RTT and ASDs.</p><p>Generally excitatory neurons are thought to carry information flow while inhibitory neurons are required for tuning the circuits. Given the entangled nature of excitatory and inhibitory signaling, it is surprising that deleting or restoring MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons leads to complementary phenotypes of tremor, anxiety, and acoustic startle response (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the case of acoustic startle response, this is not entirely unexpected: the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) is the major sensorimotor interface, and proper glutamatergic signaling is necessary for the transmission of auditory information onto PnC neurons through action on AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch and Schnitzler, 1997</xref>). As for anxiety and tremor, our findings suggest that the circuits involved are more resistant to inhibitory but not excitatory disturbance, possibly due to their specific connectivity. Similarly, the cerebellar circuits may be more vulnerable to inhibitory alteration since inhibitory Purkinje cells are the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. It is therefore understandable that re-expression of MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons (see companion paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ure et al., 2016</xref>) but not excitatory neurons was sufficient to rescue motor coordination deficits. It is also not surprising that several other <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null features, including ataxia, premature lethality, and obesity, can be reproduced in both excitatory and inhibitory <italic>Mecp2</italic> CKO mice, since those circuits are disturbed with alteration in either excitation or inhibition. Thus, restoring MeCP2 in neither excitatory nor inhibitory neurons alone is sufficient to fully rescue premature lethality. Similarly, re-expressing MeCP2 in excitatory neurons failed to maintain body weight, as the C-rescue mice were underweight when compared with WT animals, indicating the necessity of MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons to balance the circuit.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14199.018</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of stop-null, <italic>Mecp2</italic> CKO, and male and female C-rescue mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14199.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14199.018</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Neurological features</th><th valign="bottom">Stop-null</th><th valign="bottom"><italic>Mecp2</italic> CKO</th><th valign="bottom">Male C-rescue</th><th valign="bottom">Female C-rescue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Tremor</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Altered Anxiety</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Impaired Acoustic Startle Response</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Premature Lethality</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">Significantly delayed</td><td valign="top"><bold>-</bold>*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Obesity</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ataxia</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Repetitive Behavior</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">NE</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Abnormal Social Interaction</td><td valign="top">+</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">NE</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>+: Presence of feature.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><p>-: Absence of feature</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><p>*: Deficits were absent in stop-het mice.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn4"><p>NE: Mice were not examined with this particular assay.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Interestingly, the increased social interaction and repetitive behaviors observed in null mice were not induced in the CKO mice but were improved in the male C-rescue mice. It is worth noting that the GABAergic knockout also shows these defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>); it may be that restoring glutamatergic neuron function in the stop-null mice improved GABAergic neuron function through reciprocal interactions.</p><p>One intriguing finding of this study is that restoring MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons benefits stop-het females more than stop-null male mice: ataxia was normalized in the female, but not in the male, C-rescue mice. This is reasonable considering that in addition to the MeCP2 expressed in glutamatergic neurons, female C-rescue mice also retain MeCP2 in over 50% of non-glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</xref>), none of which express MeCP2 at all in male C-rescue mice. In this regard, it is interesting to note that re-expressing MeCP2 only in GABAergic neurons is less effective in a heterozygous background than in the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null background (see companion paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ure et al., 2016</xref>). The opposite outcomes of these rescue strategies suggest that various types of neurons may be differentially sensitive to MeCP2 dosage, and it seems easier for the brain to compensate for the loss of MeCP2 in 50% of inhibitory neurons (glutamatergic female C-rescue) than in 50% of excitatory neurons (inhibitory female C-rescue). The possible reasons for this difference might include the distinct roles that these two types of neurons play in the brain circuit and the differential changes in gene expression due to loss of MeCP2 in these two types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Telfeian et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, it strongly argues for the use of <italic>Mecp2</italic>-heterozygous mice as the primary RTT disease model when developing and testing therapeutic strategies.</p><p>At the circuit level, we demonstrated that deleting MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons resulted in reduced cortical activity in layer V pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, a defect also seen in the <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. Together with the complete rescue of this defect by restoring MeCP2 only in glutamatergic neurons, this indicates an essential role of MeCP2 in modulating the firing activity of excitatory neurons. The dramatically reduced sEPSC charge reflects weakened excitatory drive onto the layer V neurons of CKO mice. Given that neurons usually need to receive above-threshold excitation to generate action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1990</xref>), the layer V neurons of CKO mice thus fired less often than controls even though they also received less inhibition. It is worth noting that this reduced firing activity in CKO mice may be region specific, as we also observed seizure-like spike-and-wave discharges in the cortex of these mice. Behavioral or electrographic seizures have also been reported in <italic>Mecp2</italic> whole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>) and forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goffin et al., 2014</xref>) inhibitory CKO mice, as well as in somatostatin CKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>), although one group reported absence seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) but another group found no behavioral or electrographic seizures at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goffin et al., 2014</xref>) with the forebrain excitatory neuron KO mice. These data suggest that the seizures we observe in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice are caused by multi-level disruption of circuits that can arise from dysfunction of several different neuronal cell types. This is further supported by the C-rescue mice, as restoring MeCP2 only in excitatory neurons is insufficient to prevent seizure.</p><p>Previous work has shown that postnatal loss of MeCP2 in forebrain excitatory neurons leads to motor coordination deficits, altered anxiety, and impaired social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gemelli et al., 2006</xref>). Through comparing and contrasting the excitatory conditional deletion and conditional rescue models, we confirmed the importance of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons to prevent anxiety-like behaviors. Importantly, we also highlighted its contribution to the pathogenesis of tremor, which is a common and highly penetrant symptom in individuals with RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klauck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roze et al., 2007</xref>), and has not been reported in any other cell type-specific <italic>Mecp2</italic> conditional deletion mouse. Expanding on the observations from Gemelli et al. and on previous studies on the autonomous dysfunction of RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weese-Mayer et al., 2006</xref>), our work suggests that the autonomic dysfunction and premature death of <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice may be mainly driven by impaired excitatory signaling in the brainstem and spinal cord. Our results precisely complement previous knowledge and work from Ure et al., which shows that deficiency of MeCP2 in GABAergic neurons leads to ataxia, increased social interaction, repetitive behaviors, premature lethality, and obesity, but is less involved in tremor, altered anxiety, and impaired acoustic startle response. This work also provides an example of how primary deficits in excitatory signaling lead to neurological deficits, which has ramifications for other postnatal neurological disorders, with disturbances in excitatory and inhibitory homeostasis, such as ASDs and intellectual disability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The <italic>Vglut2-Cre<sup>+/-</sup></italic> knock-in line was a gift from Dr. Brad Lowell and was backcrossed to the FVB strain for four generations to generate progeny with more than 99% FVB strain polymorphic markers. <italic>Mecp2</italic> CKO mice were obtained by breeding <italic>Mecp2<sup>flox/+</sup> </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2001</xref>) female mice on the 129S6SvEv strain to <italic>Vglut2-Cre<sup>+/- </sup></italic>male mice. <italic>Mecp2</italic> conditional rescue mice were obtained by breeding <italic>Mecp2<sup>LSL/+</sup> </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guy et al., 2007</xref>) female mice on the 129S6SvEv strain to <italic>Vglut2-Cre<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>male mice.

Data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Tremor assessment</title><p>Mice were put on the flat palm of the hand for 30 s for a person who is blind to the genotype to decide if the mouse displayed tremor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>EEG surgery and recordings</title><p>The methods were modified from our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2015</xref>). Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Under aseptic condition, each mouse was surgically implanted with 4 recordings electrodes. Two silver wire electrodes (127 µm diameter) were implanted in the right frontal cortex and somatosensory cortex, respectively, with the reference electrode positioned in the occipital region of the skull. Two tungsten electrodes (50 µm diameter) were aimed at the left hippocampal CA1 (P2.0R1.2H1.3) and dentate (P2.0R1.8H1.8) regions, respectively, with the reference electrode in the corpus callosum. All electrode wires were attached to a miniature connector (Harwin Connector) secured on the skull by dental cement. After 2 weeks of post-surgical recovery, EEG activities (filtered between 0.1 Hz and 1 kHz, sampled at 2 kHz) and the mouse behavior were recorded for 2 hr per day over 3–4 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>EEG data analysis</title><p>Seizure candidates were identified using custom-written algorithms. Briefly, EEG signals were divided into 10-minute segments. A third order Butterworth bandpass filter of 0.5 and 400 Hz cutoffs was applied to each segment. The filtered data was divided into 500 ms non-overlapping epochs. Signal changes occurring in the time domain were captured by amplitude correlation (autocorrelation value between successive epochs), root mean square (average amplitude of the epoch), and spike density (number of spikes normalized to the epoch). Signal changes occurring in the frequency domain were captured by frequency band ratio, where the power of the upper band (20–50 Hz) was contrasted with that of the lower band (0.5–20 Hz). EEG signals that exceeded the threshold for all of the above quantitative features were identified as seizure candidates. Each candidate and the corresponding video were visually inspected to identify electrographic seizures. All computation was performed in MATLAB R2015b.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Body composition and indirect calorimetry</title><p>This assay was performed as previously described with a few modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2011)</xref>. Mice were group housed before the experiment started. Then they were placed individually in calorimetry chambers for 6 days, with the first 2 days considered as an acclimation phase. Mice had free access to food and water in the first 5 days. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured on day 6 in the Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments). Feeders were closed at 6 a.m. on day 6 to prevent any further food consumption. The RMR for each mouse was calculated from the two lowest values of energy expenditure from 4 to 8 hr after the start of the fast. Fat and lean mass were measured by quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (EchoMRI, Houston, TX). For food intake, weight and fat gain, energy expenditure, and resting metabolic rate data were analyzed by ANCOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis using body weight (for food intake) or fat and lean mass (for energy expenditure) as covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tschop et al., 2012</xref>). Values are shown as estimated marginal means (least square means) adjusting for covariance ± standard error of mean. For total activity and RER, data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements</title><p>Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, 6-week-old mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Normal body temperature was maintained throughout the procedure by placing the mice on a heating pad. Pure tone stimuli from 4 kHz to 48 kHz were generated using Tucker Davis Technologies System 3 digital signal processing hardware and software (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA), and the intensity of the tone stimuli was calibrated using a type 4938 1/4″ pressure-field calibration microphone (Brüel and Kjær, Nærum, Denmark).</p><p>Response signals were recorded with subcutaneous needle electrodes inserted at the vertex of the scalp, the postauricular region (reference) and the back leg (ground). Auditory thresholds were determined by decreasing the sound intensity of each stimulus from 90 dB to 10 dB in 5 dB steps until the lowest sound intensity with reproducible and recognizable waves in the response was reached. Data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean and analyzed by two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cortical slice electrophysiology</title><p>Coronal slices (350 μm thick) containing primary somatosensory cortex (S1) were prepared from 6- to 8-week-old mice with a vibratome slicer (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Acute slices were collected in chilled (2–5°C) cutting solution containing (in mM) 110 choline-chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Then, slices were incubated in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM) containing 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 D-glucose, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> at 37°C for 50 min before being stored at room temperature for recording. All solutions were saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings were made from visually identified pyramidal neurons in layer 5 region of S1 by using a patch clamp amplifier (MultiClamp 700 B, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Microelectrodes with resistance of 2–3 MΩ were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The intrapipette solution for recording spontaneous firing (holding at -60 mV) and mEPSC (holding at -70 mV) contained (in mM) 140 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.2). Picrotoxin (100 µM), D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 50 µM), and Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.1 µM) were present in the ACSF for mEPSC recording. For measuring mIPSCs, the pipettes were filled with (in mM) 145 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.2). AP5 (50 µM), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX, 20 µM), and TTX (0.1 µM) were also present in the ACSF. The recordings of spontaneous firing and spontaneous synaptic activity were performed in modified ACSF (in mM: 126 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 14 D-glucose, 3.5 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). For measuring sEPSC/sIPSC, the intrapipette solution contained (in mM) 120 CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 0.4 EGTA, 5 TEA-Cl (tetraethylammonium chloride), 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 MgATP, 0.3 GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, and 1 QX-314 [N-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl) triethylammonium bromide] (pH 7.2 with CsOH). To find the reversal potential, the postsynaptic neurons were voltage-clamped at different potentials (with 5 mV interval) between-75 and -55 mV for sEPSC and between -5 and +20 mVs for sIPSC.</p><p>To test the intrinsic property, synaptic blockers (APV 50 µM, CNQX 20 µM, and bicuculine 20 µM) were added into the standard ACSF. The input (current pulse)/output (spikes) curves were generated using incremental depolarizing current pulses (10pA/800 ms).</p><p>The whole-cell recording was performed at (30 ± 1°C) by using an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT). Data acquisition was performed by using a digitizer (DigiData 1440A, Molecular Devices). Minianalysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft Inc) and pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices) were used for data analysis. Data were discarded when the rest membrane potential was above −60 mV or the resistance change was over 20% during experiment. Data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Experiments was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckman et al., 2014</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Manipulations of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons highlight their contributions to Rett and other neurological disorders&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper and a companion paper, the authors use a variety of genetic strategies to revisit the relative roles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal expression of MeCP2 in the pathophysiology of Rett Syndrome as modeled in mice. Although this is an area that has been previously studied, the conclusions reached in prior studies have often apparently been at odds and the present pair of studies attempt to bring some clarity by selectively deleting and restoring MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons (this paper) or selectively restoring MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons (companion paper).</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examine <italic>Mecp2</italic> loss of function in excitatory neurons, and in turn rescue <italic>Mecp2</italic> function in these cells, to demonstrate that <italic>Mecp2</italic> in excitatory neurons regulates distinct behaviors that include suppression of tremor and anxiety. Importantly, these phenotypes largely do not overlap with the phenotypes observed after <italic>Mecp2</italic> loss of function in inhibitory neurons. This thorough work incorporates unique genetic models (including rescue) and associated behavioral and electrophysiological analysis. Before proceeding further with this manuscript the authors should clarify certain aspects of their data and associated conclusions:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The physiological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) analyzes only spontaneous firing and events. The results agree with prior studies in that suggest MeCP2 regulates recurrent excitatory synaptic connections within the cortex and shows that this requires MeCP2 be expressed in those pyramidal neurons. It is disappointing that this analysis was not carried out for the rescue, since it is not clear if MeCP2 expression is sufficient to rescue this phenotype, but we recognize that not all questions can be addressed in this one manuscript. However, the analysis of inhibitory events does not seem adequate given a prior report (Zhang et al. 2014) that loss of MeCP2 from forebrain excitatory neurons causes loss of inhibition and numerous studies show that reduced activity can lead to reduced trophic support of interneurons and reduced inhibition. The present conclusion that the balance is unchanged is based on spontaneous events, but these in turn depend on the excitatory drive and so changes in inhibition cannot be adequately teased apart. Experiments such as measuring evoked inhibition e.g. using ChR2 as done by Scanziani and colleagues to more accurate measure E/I balance, or measure of GABA mini frequency and amplitude and see whether or not this is altered, would unambiguously clarify the authors data and conclusions about the E/I balance. However, we recognize these experiments are experimentally involved and may exceed the scope of the present work: at minimum, the authors should measure GABA mini frequency and amplitude and see whether or not this is altered (see below).</p><p>2) Although the authors conduct current clamp recordings to document action potential firing in cortical neurons as well as voltage clamp recordings to document excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic activity, it is important to analyze the miniature EPSCs and IPSCs in order to compare and contrast these findings to the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the companion paper.</p><p>3) The authors do not address whether or not these animals develop epilepsy and have abnormal EEGs, as reported by Zhang et al.</p><p>4) There have been previous publications that reported selective knockout of MeCP2 in glutamatergic neurons and neither of those is cited or discussed here (Gemelli et al., 2006, Goffin et al. 2014, He et al. 2014).</p><p>5) Stepping back and evaluating the two studies (Meng et al., as well as Ure et al.,) raises the question of how specific loss of function of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons have such non-overlapping phenotypes. Within a network excitatory neurons drive inhibitory activity and in turn inhibitory neurons are the ones that regulate excitatory activity. It is rather surprising that the function of these two neuron populations can be disentangled with clear distinctions. Therefore, it is important for the authors to comment on the interplay and overlap between the two animal models in addition to their distinctions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14199.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The physiological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) analyzes only spontaneous firing and events.

This seems to be the case, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> we showed that it did rescue the decreased firing rate in stop-null mice. To better analyze inhibitory events we measured GABA mini frequency and amplitude in layer V pyramidal neurons as the reviewers suggested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast to Zhang et al. we did not see any significant change across genotypes. This differing result from similar mouse models may be due to the expression of MeCP2 in glia, since the <italic>Emx1</italic>-Cre used by Zhang et al. drives Cre expression in both cortical excitatory neurons and glia, while the <italic>Vglut2-</italic>Cre we used in our study only targets glutamatergic neurons. In addition, the different <italic>Mecp2<sup>flox+/y</sup> </italic>mouse lines used in these two studies may also contribute to the difference.</p><p><italic>2) Although the authors conduct current clamp recordings to document action potential firing in cortical neurons as well as voltage clamp recordings to document excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic activity, it is important to analyze the miniature EPSCs and IPSCs in order to compare and contrast these findings to the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the companion paper.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we analyzed mEPSC and mIPSC in CKO, male C-rescue mice, and their controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>.
