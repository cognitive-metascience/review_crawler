However, in addition to affecting behavior, it also affects perception of the world. In the case of visuospatial perception, it has been shown that the sense of ownership causes external space to be perceptually scaled according to the size of the body. Here, we investigated the effect of ownership on another fundamental aspect of visual perception: visual awareness. In two binocular rivalry experiments, we manipulated the sense of ownership of a stranger’s hand through visuotactile stimulation while that hand was one of the rival stimuli. The results show that ownership, but not mere visuotactile stimulation, increases the dominance of the hand percept. This effect is due to a combination of longer perceptual dominance durations and shorter suppression durations. Together, these results suggest that the sense of body ownership promotes visual awareness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>body ownership</kwd><kwd>visual awareness</kwd><kwd>multi-sensory integration</kwd><kwd>binocular rivalry</kwd><kwd>rubber hand illusion</kwd><kwd>body representation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>James McDonnell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Söderbergska Stiftelsen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004472</institution-id><institution>Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group> <funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submitthe work for publication</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inducing illusory ownership of a fake hand increases the perceptual dominance of that hand during binocular rivalry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon opening one’s eyes and looking down at one’s body, one becomes visually aware of one’s hands, legs, and chest without exerting any effort. In addition to visual awareness of the body, one also has the sensation that what one is seeing is one’s own body, that is, one experiences a sense of body ownership (henceforth, ‘body ownership’). The feeling of body ownership distinguishes one’s own body from external objects; this distinction is critical, for example, when an external object threatens the body. Because one’s own body can be assumed to be more relevant than any other object, it is reasonable to expect that visual awareness will be boosted when, all else being equal, body ownership is present. In this study, we test this prediction.</p><p>Normally, body ownership is not experienced for objects other than the body. However, in the classic rubber-hand illusion, participants do experience ownership of an external object, namely, a rubber hand that is in front of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick and Cohen, 1998</xref>). In this illusion, the participant’s real hand is lying next to the rubber hand but is occluded from sight. After synchronous brushing of the rubber hand and the participant’s real hand for a short period, the participant reports a sensation of ownership of the rubber hand and perceives that tactile sensations originate from the rubber hand. Most research on body ownership has focused on the perceptual rules that determine the rubber-hand illusion and similar ownership illusions. For example, these studies have shown that for ownership of an artificial hand to be induced, the hand must be placed in the same orientation as the real hand, and visuotactile stimulation applied to the rubber hand must be synchronously applied in the same direction as that applied to the veridical hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makin et al., 2008</xref>). From this line of research, it is clear that the rubber-hand illusion is a multisensory illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graziano and Botvinick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsakiris, 2010</xref>) and that ownership of limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makin et al., 2008</xref>) and full bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petkova and Ehrsson, 2008</xref>) depends on the dynamic integration of spatially and temporally congruent visual, tactile and proprioceptive information from a space near the body.</p><p>Recent studies have also shown that body ownership plays an important role in visual perception more generally, affecting how one sees the external world beyond one’s body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banakou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haggard and Jundi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linkenauger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Hoort et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, studies have shown that body size serves as a ruler in the size perception of objects in the external world, but only in the presence of ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Hoort and Ehrsson, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Hoort and Ehrsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Hoort et al., 2011</xref>). When participants experience body ownership of a small doll, other objects appear larger and farther away; conversely, ownership of a large artificial body makes other objects appear smaller and closer. Crucially, when ownership is disrupted, these effects are greatly diminished, although the visual stimuli are identical in the ownership and no-ownership conditions. Thus, body ownership appears to have a direct effect on the <italic>content</italic> of conscious visual perception that cannot be explained by differences in visual input. However, can ownership also affect the very <italic>presence</italic> of conscious visual perception? Can ownership enhance visual awareness? In the current study, we used binocular rivalry to address this question.</p><p>Binocular rivalry is an often-used method of studying visual awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake and Logothetis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lumer et al., 1998</xref>). In binocular rivalry, the two eyes are presented with different visual images that compete for visual awareness, thus resulting in alternating subjective percepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levelt, 1965</xref>). Visual parameters such as contrast, spatial frequency, color, and motion together determine the ‘stimulus strength’ of each of the rival stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brascamp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levelt, 1965</xref>). Increasing the strength of both stimuli equally increases the switching rate during rivalry, whereas increasing the strength of only one of the rival stimuli increases the overall perceptual dominance of that stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brascamp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levelt, 1965</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated whether ownership can increase the perceptual dominance of a hand image as if it were increasing the strength of that visual stimulus. We hypothesized that because one’s own hand is a more relevant object for the brain to process, visual awareness of a hand for which ownership is experienced should be prioritized. In the current study, one of the rival images consisted of a hand being stroked with a spherical object, which was presented while the participant’s veridical hand was touched synchronously with an identical object to elicit illusory body ownership (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We hypothesized that the overall dominance of the hand image would increase through the feeling of ownership of the hand. To isolate the effect of body ownership from effects related to tactile stimulation, visual impression of a hand image, or visuotactile stimulation, we compared the illusion condition to unimodal visual and tactile stimulation conditions (Experiment 1) and a bimodal visuotactile stimulation condition in which the hand image was anatomically incongruent (Experiment 2), that is, control conditions in which ownership was eliminated or significantly reduced. The results of the two experiments supported our hypothesis and demonstrated that body ownership facilitates visual awareness of a hand in the binocular rivalry paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We tested a total of 60 healthy volunteers, who were equally divided between Experiment 1 (mean age = 24.6; 18 women) and Experiment 2 (mean age = 26.2, 13 women), and who were naive to the purpose of the study. Participants were recruited through advertisements on the campus of the Karolinska Institutet. They received a cinema voucher as compensation. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal sight. The number of participants for each experiment (<italic>N</italic> = 30) was based on previous studies in which body ownership was manipulated to investigate its effect on another variable of interest and to allow for correlation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guterstam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Each participant signed an informed consent form before the onset of the experiment.

The hand image was a photographed hand that was isolated using a green screen and had a homogeneous red background added. Next, a video was made of the same hand being covered by a green screen (by folding the green screen back over the hand) while it was being touched with a Styrofoam sphere (37 mm in diameter) attached to a wooden stick (25 cm long, 4 mm in diameter) that approached the hand from the left side. This setup allowed the moving object to be isolated and presented in both the hand image and the mask image. Thus, in conditions in which the moving stick was present, it was present in both images and was therefore visible at all times.</p><p>The mask image consisted of 1000 Mondrian images, created with MATLAB, that randomly alternated at 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stein et al., 2011</xref>). The Mondrian images consisted of different-sized rectangles of different shades of blue. For all conditions, a fixation cross was present in the center of each image. The sizes of the visual stimuli, including the white outline, were approximately 10 degrees of the visual field, and the width of the hand was approximately 8 degrees. Half of the participants were shown the hand image displayed to their right eyes and the mask image displayed to their left eyes, and the other half of the participants were shown the reverse display.</p><p>Tactile stimulation of a participant’s veridical hand consisted of single continuous strokes with the same object used to create the visual stimuli, from the back of the right hand to the tip of the right index finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The duration of each stroke was 0.67 s. These strokes were synchronous and spatially congruent with the moving stick from the visual stimuli. One stroke was applied every 1.5 s with the following pattern: three strokes (4.5 s), one rest (1.5 s), two strokes (3 s), one rest (1.5 s). During rest, the object was stationary next to the hand. In order to synchronize tactile stimulation with the visual stimuli, the experimenter, wearing headphones (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), listened to a click track that contained an audio-cue for each stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Task and procedure</title><p>Participants wore a set of head-mounted displays (HMDs; VR1280, Virtual Realities LLC, Texas, USA, with color displays showing 1280 × 1024 pixels with a 60-degree diagonal field of view) and placed their right hands on a diagonal platform on the table in front of them. They tilted their heads such that they would be looking straight at their own hand if they were not wearing the HMDs. Before the main experiment, they underwent a training session in which the distance between the displays could be adjusted to each participant’s individual interocular distance. Participants fixated on the fixation cross at all times. Their task was to press and hold a button when they perceived the hand and to release the button when they perceived the mask. If they perceived a mix of both images, they were instructed to press the button only if more than half of their percept consisted of the hand image. Between blocks, participants had the option to take a short break.</p><p>Experiment 1 consisted of five conditions, with ownership of the hand being induced during one condition (‘visuotactile’) and ownership of the hand being absent or reduced during the other four conditions (see below). During the visuotactile condition, each participant’s real hand was touched synchronously with the visual appearance of touch in the hand image to induce a sense of ownership of the hand image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We included one condition (‘tactile-only’) to assess the isolated effect of tactile stimulation of each participant’s real hand and one condition (‘visual-only’) to assess the isolated effect of the moving object in the visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we included a ‘no-stimulation’ condition to measure the rivalry dynamics of our visual stimuli in isolation, that is, in the absence of both the tactile component and the visual component of touch. Thus, tactile stimulation of a participant’s veridical hand and the visual presence of the moving object could either be present or absent, thus yielding four conditions in a 2 × 2 design: visuotactile, visual-only, tactile-only, and no-stimulation. In all of these conditions, each participant’s right hand was placed in a relaxed position on the platform in front of the participant, that is, anatomically and spatially congruent with the position of the hand in the image. On the basis of what is known from a large body of work on the rubber-hand illusion, we assumed that the visual-only and tactile-only conditions would not elicit a hand ownership illusion because they contain a mismatch between vision and touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>). The no-stimulation condition could theoretically induce a weak ownership illusion since there was less sensory mismatch between different modalities, but such a putative illusion would be significantly weaker compared to the visuotactile condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guterstam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samad et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we included a ‘baseline’ condition in which each participant’s right hand was held in a relaxed position to the left side of the abdomen, that is, in a position that is incongruent with that of the hand in the image. This baseline condition allowed us to assess the effect of visuoproprioceptive hand congruency because it was similar to the no-stimulation condition in all other respects.</p><p>Each condition was tested in a separate block that lasted 270 s. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across participants. At the end of these five blocks, participants repeated the visuotactile condition for another 120 s, after which they filled out a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained four items: Q1 (‘It felt as if the hand I saw was my own hand’) and Q2 (‘The touch I felt seemed to be caused by the white ball I saw’) captured the illusion, whereas Q3 (‘My own hand started to feel digital’) and Q4 (‘I felt as if I had two right hands at the same time’) controlled for expectancy effects and task compliance.</p><p>Experiment 2 was designed to manipulate ownership by rotation of the hand image in two otherwise equivalent conditions, thereby isolating the effect of ownership from that of synchronous visuotactile stimulation itself. To this end, the one condition in which ownership was present was identical to the visuotactile condition from Experiment 1 (‘congruent visuotactile’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the ‘incongruent visuotactile’ condition, the only difference was the orientation of the hand image, which was rotated 180 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The movement direction of the object that was touching the hand in the image was identical in retinal space to that in the congruent condition (but antidirectional in hand-centered space). In addition, two control conditions were included in which the hand image was presented in the two orientations to serve as a baseline for the visual stimuli in the absence of tactile stimulation. The moving object was still visible in these conditions, and the visual stimuli were therefore identical to those in the two visuotactile conditions. Thus, Experiment 2 had a 2 × 2 design in which congruency and tactile stimulation were manipulated. The hand image was congruent (as in Experiment 1) or incongruent (rotated 180 degrees) to each participant’s real hand, which received tactile stimulation (congruent visuotactile and incongruent visuotactile) or did not (‘congruent visual-only’ and ‘incongruent visual-only’). As in Experiment 1, the duration of each condition was 270 s, and the order of conditions was semi-randomized. After the four blocks of the main experiment, participants repeated both visuotactile conditions (congruent and incongruent) and were given the same questionnaire as in Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Hand ownership illusion</title><p>Across different analyses, we performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to assess the normality of the data. For the questionnaire data, we used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests because the data were measured on an ordinal Likert scale. In Experiment 1, only the visuotactile condition had a questionnaire included. Therefore, we compared the median scores for the illusion-related questions Q1 (‘It felt as if the hand I saw was my own hand’) and Q2 (‘The touch I felt seemed to be caused by the white ball I saw’) with those for control questions Q3 (‘My own hand started to feel digital’) and Q4 (‘I felt as if I had two right hands at the same time’) (see 'Task and procedure'). In addition, we calculated each participant’s individual illusion score as (Q1 + Q2) – (Q3 + Q4). In Experiment 2, we included a questionnaire in both visuotactile conditions (congruent and incongruent), which allowed us to assess differences in each item of the questionnaire directly by using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Total dominance hand percept</title><p>The total time that the hand was seen was converted to a percentage of the total 270 s per condition. Next, we performed planned <italic>t</italic>-tests between conditions that used identical visual stimuli. Thus, for Experiment 1 we compared visuotactile versus visual-only; and tactile-only versus no-stimulation. Similarly, for Experiment 2 we compared congruent visuotactile versus congruent visual-only; and incongruent visuotactile versus incongruent visual-only. In addition, for Experiment 1, we performed a full factorial 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA, with vision and touch being either present or absent, to assess the main effects of the visual component and the tactile component of a touch as well as their interaction effect. For Experiment 2, we performed a full-factorial 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors of congruency (congruent versus incongruent) and tactile stimulation (visuotactile versus visual-only). Finally, we normalized the effect of the visuotactile condition to participants’ overall mean ((visuotactile – mean)/mean) and correlated this perceptual effect with individual illusion scores (see previous paragraph) using a non-parametric Spearman correlation analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-3"><title>Switch rate</title><p>Next, we analyzed how often participants switched their percept from the hand to the mask and vice versa. This ‘switch rate’ is a measure of the overall perceptual stability and should be identical for conditions with identical visual stimuli and similar attentional demands. To test whether conditions with identical visual stimuli indeed had identical switch rates, we counted the total number of switches between the hand percept and the mask percept in each condition for every participant. This number was divided by the total duration of each block (270 s), thus yielding the switch rate per participant and per condition. We performed a 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA as well as paired <italic>t</italic>-tests between conditions with identical visual input to analyze the effects of the visual and tactile components of touch on switch rates in Experiment 1 and the effects of congruency and tactile stimulation in Experiment 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-4"><title>Duration of single percepts</title><p>The last step of the main analysis examined individual percept durations. To control for individual differences and improve statistical power, we normalized dominance durations to participants’ mean percept duration. Thus, separately for hand percepts and mask percepts, we subtracted the participants’ mean percept duration across all conditions from that of individual conditions and divided this difference by that same mean ((condition-mean – mean)/mean). We performed paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests to analyze the difference between conditions with matched visual stimuli and used a 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA to analyze the interaction effect across conditions.</p><p>To obtain a better estimate of the magnitude of the effect of visuotactile stimulation on percept durations, we collapsed the data from both experiments for the (congruent) visuotactile and (congruent) visual-only conditions (which were identical across experiments). The other conditions were not identical and therefore we re-normalized the data by dividing by the mean of only the visuotactile condition and the visual-only condition; ((visuotactile – visual-only)/mean) (mean = 0.5*(visuotactile +visual only)).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-5"><title>The effect of individual touches on overall dominance</title><p>In addition to the analyses described above, all of which are common in binocular rivalry research, we performed some more advanced analyses that made use of the onset and duration of individual touches. For the first of these analyses, for each condition we plotted how dominance changed as a function of time around a single touch by flagging the onset of each touch and calculating the average dominance of the hand-percept between 667 ms before touch onset and 1334 ms after touch onset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Next, we created the difference-waves between conditions that used identical visual stimuli by subtracting those conditions (Experiment 1: [visuotactile – visual-only] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>); and [tactile-only – no-stimulation] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>); Experiment 2: [congruent visuotactile – congruent visual-only] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>); and [incongruent visuotactile – incongruent visual-only] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>)). Finally, we created an interaction-wave for each experiment by subtracting the two difference-waves (Experiment 1: [(visuotactile – visual-only) – (tactile-only – no-stimulation)] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); Experiment 2: [(congruent visuotactile – congruent visual-only) – (incongruent visuotactile – incongruent visual-only)] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>)). For the analysis, we averaged the dominance for each of six time bins, T<sub>-1</sub> (−667 to −333 ms), T<sub>0</sub> (−333–0 ms), T<sub>1</sub>(0–333 ms), T<sub>2</sub>(333–667 ms), T<sub>3</sub>(667–1000 ms), and T<sub>4</sub>(1000–1333 ms), to reduce multiple comparisons. The effect of time was assessed with a 6 × 1 repeated-measures ANOVA for each condition and for each of the difference and interaction waves. Additionally, we performed paired <italic>t</italic>-tests between identical time bins in different conditions. We applied Bonferroni corrections based on the number of time bins. To create the plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), we smoothed the data with a 33 ms moving average for clarity (analyses were performed on the raw data).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-6"><title>The effect of individual touches on single percepts</title><p>A second analysis that made use of the onset of individual touches investigated whether changes in dominance durations and suppression durations were affected by these individual touches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lunghi et al., 2010</xref>). We flagged the onset of the 667 ms pretouch phase (T<sub>-1</sub> – T<sub>0</sub>) and the onset of the 667 ms touch phase (T<sub>1</sub> – T<sub>2</sub>). For each phase separately, we divided the data on the basis of whether the hand percept or the mask percept was dominant at the flag. For the resulting four groups of data (pretouch hand percept, pretouch mask percept, touch hand percept, and touch mask percept), we calculated how often the current percept was maintained, how often it had switched, and how often it had switched more than once. We ignored epochs in which the percept switched more than once. We analyzed the probability of maintaining a hand percept and the probability of switching when seeing a mask percept during both the pretouch phase and the touch phase. We performed a 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA on each of those probabilities with the factors phase (pretouch and touch) and condition (visuotactile versus visual-only). Subsequently, for each phase, we performed paired t-tests between conditions with identical visual stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-7"><title>Additional information</title><p>Effect sizes for Wilcoxon signed rank tests were calculated as <italic>r</italic> = <italic>Z</italic>/√<italic>N</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is the total sample size of a given test (i.e., <italic>N</italic> = 2×30=60 for all tests) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fritz et al., 2012</xref>).

Furthermore, there was no difference between these two conditions in the likelihood of switching from a mask percept to a hand percept (<italic>F</italic>(1,29) = 0.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.528, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.01) (pretouch: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = −0.29 ± 1.44, <italic>CI</italic> = −3.24–2.66, <italic>t</italic>(29) = −0.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.843, <italic>d</italic> = 0.04; touch: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = 1.72 ± 1.41, <italic>CI</italic> = −1.17–4.60, <italic>t</italic>(29) = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.233, <italic>d</italic> = 0.23), and there was neither a main effect of single touches (<italic>F</italic>(1,29) = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.755, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.00) nor an interaction effect (<italic>F</italic>(1,29) = 1.28, <italic>p</italic> = 0.268, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.04).</p><p>Because the congruent conditions in Experiment 2 were identical to the visuotactile and visual-only conditions in Experiment 1, we collapsed the data of all 60 participants for those two conditions to improve statistical power and obtain a more accurate measure of the magnitude of the effect. Again, we found that the overall likelihood of maintaining a hand percept was greater in the visuotactile condition than in the visual-only condition (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 14.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.20). Furthermore, the likelihood of maintaining a hand percept increased during a touch (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 60.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.51), but this effect was similar for the visuotactile and visual-only conditions (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.893, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.00) (visuotactile: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = 7.94 ± 1.34, <italic>CI</italic> = 5.26–10.62, <italic>t</italic>(59) = 5.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.77; visual-only: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = 7.68 ± 1.46, <italic>CI</italic> = 4.76–10.60, <italic>t</italic>(59) = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.68). Next, we analyzed the likelihood of recovering the hand percept from suppression for instances in which the mask was the dominant percept. Overall, hand percepts were more likely to break through suppression in the visuotactile condition than in the visual-only condition (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 7.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.010, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.11). Moreover, switching from the mask percept to the hand percept was more likely during a touch than before a touch (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 11.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.17). Importantly, this effect of single touches on the likelihood of switching was greater in the visuotactile condition than in the visual-only condition (<italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 5.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.08) (visuotactile: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = 5.77 ± 1.73, <italic>CI</italic> = 2.31–9.22, <italic>t</italic>(59) = 3.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <italic>d</italic> = 0.45; visual-only: <italic>mean difference</italic> ± <italic>SEM</italic> = 1.34 ± 1.06, <italic>CI</italic> = 0.78–3.46, <italic>t</italic>(59) = 1.27, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21, <italic>d</italic> = 0.17). Together, these analyses show that the longer maintenance of hand percepts was caused not by single touches but by a sustained effect of ownership of the hand. In contrast, recovering the hand from suppression does appear to rely on single touches, but only in the specific condition in which ownership of the hand is experimentally induced, that is, the congruent visuotactile condition. Interestingly, this suggests that even though the hand percept is suppressed, some information about ownership of the hand is maintained.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In two separate binocular rivalry experiments, we experimentally manipulated the sense of ownership of a stranger’s hand, which was one of the rival images. A key finding was that in the presence of body ownership, the overall perceptual dominance of that hand increased. Body ownership was induced when a participant received tactile stimulation of his or her own hand in a manner that was synchronous with and spatially congruent to the object that touched the hand in the image (the visuotactile condition). Interestingly, participants who reported stronger ownership also had a greater effect of visuotactile stimulation on the dominance of that hand image. Moreover, mere tactile stimulation of each participant’s real hand without induction of ownership (tactile-only condition) did not increase the dominance of the hand image. Together, these results suggest that it is body ownership, rather than mere synchronous visuotactile stimulation, that increases the dominance of the hand image. To test this hypothesis directly, Experiment 2 compared synchronous visuotactile stimulation in the presence of ownership (i.e., when the hand image was spatially congruent with the real hand) with synchronous visuotactile stimulation in the absence of ownership (i.e., when the hand image was spatially incongruent). As expected, only when the hand image was spatially congruent and ownership was induced did visuotactile stimulation increase the dominance of the hand image. Crucially, in both experiments, we found that this dominance increase correlated positively with participants’ individual ownership illusion score. Moreover, these effects were greatest before the onset of single touches, in agreement with the interpretation that it is sustained ownership of the hand that drives the dominance effect rather than transient visuotactile events. The finding that ownership promotes visual awareness provides an important new role for ownership in sensory processing and helps to explain the central role of body ownership in conscious awareness. We know from earlier studies that ownership can change the content of conscious perception in such ways as enhancing tactile acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haggard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 2008</xref>), calibrating proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkarim and Ehrsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick and Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsakiris and Haggard, 2005</xref>), and scaling visuospatial perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Hoort and Ehrsson, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Hoort and Ehrsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Hoort et al., 2011</xref>). The fundamental advance made in this study is the demonstration that body ownership can affect the very presence of conscious perception, namely, visual awareness. How, exactly, does body ownership promote visual awareness in the binocular rivalry paradigm?</p><p>An increase in overall dominance can be caused by longer dominance durations or by shorter suppression durations. It is important to distinguish between the two because dominance and suppression rely on distinct neural processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake and Logothetis, 2002</xref>). We found evidence for both: ownership increased the durations of individual hand percepts and decreased the durations of suppression. The hand percepts were maintained longer independently of individual visuotactile events. This effect cannot be explained by increased voluntary attention toward the hand image for two reasons. First, we did not find a difference in switch rate between conditions with identical visual input, suggesting that the overall attentional demand is the same between conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paffen et al., 2006</xref>). Second, the effect of ownership on suppression durations, which is not affected by voluntary attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ooi and He, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paffen and Alais, 2011</xref>), was of similar magnitude to the effect of ownership on dominance durations. Instead, the prolonged dominance suggests that ownership effectively increases the ‘stimulus strength’ of the visual hand stimulus, similar to an increase in contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brascamp et al., 2015</xref>), and thereby prevents the suppressed mask stimulus from entering the subject’s awareness. In contrast to prolonged dominance, the decreased suppression durations seemed to be driven by single visuotactile events, but only when there was ownership of the suppressed hand. This result is intriguing because the hand is not perceived at the onset of touch. This result suggests that traces of the suppressed hand stimulus still contain information about ownership and that these traces are perceptually bound to the tactile stimulus in the case of ownership in order to break through suppression.</p><p>What might the neural mechanisms underlying these effects involve? Hand ownership is known to arise from multisensory integration in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>). Visual perception of hand images occurs in a part of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) known as the extrastriate body area (EBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Downing et al., 2001</xref>), which is additionally able to dissociate between the visual impressions of one’s own hand and someone else’s hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myers and Sowden, 2008</xref>). During hand-ownership illusions, the LOC/EBA is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Limanowski et al., 2014</xref>), and the effective connectivity between this area and the IPS is increased, indicating increases in neural communication between the two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guterstam et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that functional connectivity between the IPS and the EBA increases the strength of the visual hand stimulus, thereby resulting in longer dominance durations of that hand. During instances of suppression, traces of the suppressed hand image may travel along the dorsal stream and reach the IPS, as is the case for suppressed images of tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang and He, 2005</xref>). Here, signals related to this suppressed hand image would integrate with spatiotemporally congruent signals associated with the tactile stimulus and consequently increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the hand image in the EBA, increase its inhibition of signals related to the dominant mask percept, and thereby speed up its recovery from suppression.</p><p>The above discussion brings us to the conceptual issue of whether body ownership boosts visual awareness ‘directly’ at the higher level of conscious selection, or if body ownership influences visual awareness ‘indirectly’ by first increasing the signal strength in lower level visual representations, which in turn leads to facilitation of awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giles et al., 2016</xref>). Our results cannot distinguish between these two alternatives. We know from a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zou et al. (2016)</xref> that invisible stimulus features can induce binocular rivalry, which shows that the subjective perceptual alternation in this paradigm can be influenced by signal processing at early stages of visual processing. Body ownership illusions on the other hand are associated with multisensory integration in fronto-parietal association cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Limanowski and Blankenburg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petkova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preston and Ehrsson, 2016</xref>) – brain regions that are also implied in theories of consciousness such as the Global Work Space theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dehaene and Naccache, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau and Rosenthal, 2011</xref>), so it is possible that ownership influences its effects at this higher level. The interpretations and speculations outlined in the preceding two paragraphs fit well with the explanation that body ownership could influence visual processing of the hand image in lower level representations by increasing its signal strength, which in turn leads to the enhanced perceptual dominance of the hand. However, it should be pointed out that this account also fits well with the recurrent processing theory of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamme, 2006</xref>), which claims that awareness is the result of recurrent processing. According to this theory body ownership could increase recurrent processing from the IPS to the EBA, and thereby ‘directly’ increase visual awareness of the hand image. Thus, although our results clearly show that body ownership increases the subjective dominance of the hand image, the possible existence of a direct causal relationship between body ownership and conscious awareness remains to be clarified in future studies.</p><p>Previous studies have extensively shown that the dynamics of binocular rivalry is affected by nonvisual stimuli that are congruent to one of the rival images. These nonvisual stimuli can be tactile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lunghi and Alais, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lunghi et al., 2010</xref>), auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sekuler et al., 1997</xref>), and even olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>) in nature. These effects exemplify the role of multisensory processing in resolving perceptual ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst and Bülthoff, 2004</xref>). However, although we used tactile stimulation to induce ownership, the current findings differ from these earlier findings in that rivalry dynamics were altered by ownership specifically and not tactile stimulation in general. Ownership itself does not belong to a single sensory modality but arises when visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information are congruent and can be perceptually bound. Another difference in the effects of tactile stimulation is that these effects have been attributed mainly to visuotactile interactions occurring at lower levels of visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lunghi et al., 2010</xref>), whereas the effect of ownership seems more likely to occur in the IPS and EBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guterstam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Limanowski et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ownership illusion used in this binocular study is different from the classic rubber-hand illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick and Cohen, 1998</xref>) in several aspects. First, the hand was presented to only one eye, and therefore perception of the hand was two-dimensional. Second, the image of the hand was considerably smaller than a life-sized rubber hand. The reason for this was that larger rival images tend to render more mixed-percept states, and we aimed to achieve rivalry dynamics that would make which percept was dominant less ambiguous to reduce response biases. Both the hand’s small size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavani and Zampini, 2007</xref>) and its two-dimensional nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">IJsselsteijn et al., 2006</xref>) may have caused the ownership illusion to be weakened compared with a classical rubber-hand illusion. However, the results of our questionnaire data demonstrated that we elicited a relatively strong limb-ownership illusion, with affirmative ratings of ownership that were comparable to those from previous studies with actual rubber hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, one can speculate that ownership of one’s real hand should have an even larger effect on visual awareness than our experimental design allowed for.</p><p>In addition to the main results regarding the effects of ownership on dominance and suppression, our results show two other interesting phenomena. First, in each experiment, we included two conditions that differed only in terms of the visuoproprioceptive congruency between the participant’s real hand and the hand image in the absence of any dynamic tactile stimulation, and we found that this methodology did not affect the rivalry dynamics of the hand image. In Experiment 1, we found that the rivalry dynamics was similar when participants positioned their hands in front of their bodies, in spatial alignment with the hand image (visual-only), and when participants folded their hands to the left side of their abdomens, in spatial incongruence with the hand image (baseline). In Experiment 2, we found that rotating the hand image itself, so that it was anatomically incongruent with the participant’s hand in front of the body, did not affect rivalry dynamics in the absence of visuotactile stimulation. Thus, visuospatial congruency of the seen and felt position of the hand did not overcome suppression of that hand. This result seems to be in conflict with a recent continuous flash suppression experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salomon et al., 2013</xref>) indicating that a hand image that was congruent with the participant’s hand recovered from suppression slightly faster (60 ms) than a hand image that was incongruent to the participant’s real hand. However, in the current study, we used binocular rivalry, which might be less sensitive to such small changes in suppression durations. A second interesting observation comes from the analysis of the visual-only conditions in which the moving object (ball on a stick) was visible at all times because it was part of both images. As soon as this object started to move, the dominance of the hand image increased. Because visuospatial context is known to affect binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alais and Blake, 1999</xref>), this result indicates that the hand image provides a better context for the moving object than the mask image. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a contextual effect in binocular rivalry that is specific to movement. The hand image probably provides a more congruent visual context because it has similar depth cues (e.g., shadow and visual perspective) for the moving stick and because it is a more ecological visual stimulus than the mask image. We speculate that this finding relates to movement close to a hand being a strong cue for stimulation in peripersonal space, a stimulus that activates visuotactile neuronal populations in the fronto-parietal association cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brozzoli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fogassi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graziano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makin et al., 2007</xref>), including those with mirror-neuron properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brozzoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishida et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Together, the results of this study suggest that ownership of a hand increases the visual awareness of that hand, both by increasing the strength of the hand-image, as if it increases in contrast, and by overcoming suppression when the hand is being touched. These findings increase the understanding of the role of ownership in visual perception in that ownership seems to enhance visual processing of a body part that is ours because it is more relevant to us, especially when it is being touched by an external source.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was made possible by funding from the Swedish Research Council, the James McDonnell Foundation, Söderbergska Stiftelsen, and Riksbankens Jubileumsfond.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Megan AK Peters (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper, &quot;Body ownership promotes visual awareness&quot; by van der Hoort et al. describes a psychophysical experiment in humans in which binocular rivalry was used to study visual awareness. In one of the rivalrous images, a hand was shown. Through the use of the rubber hand illusion, a hand was made to seem a part of the subject's body or not. When incorporated into the subject's own body, the visual hand was dominant in the binocular rivalry.

However, they identified a number of issues that will need to be considered in a revision, before the paper can be further considered for publication.i) You need to demonstrate that ownership was the critical factor that affected dominance.

In one of the rivalrous images, a hand was shown. Through the use of the rubber hand illusion, at hand was made to seem a part of the subject's body or not. When incorporated into the subject's own body, the visual hand was dominant in the binocular rivalry. The experiment shows that some aspect of the rubber hand procedure interacts with visual awareness. Through several control conditions and a clever second experiment, the experimenters narrowed down the possibilities quite a bit. The experimenters suggest that specifically, the incorporation of a visual stimulus into the body schema causes it to increase in visual awareness. As long as this conclusion is presented in a cautious way, the paper seems like a useful and very interesting contribution to me. It is clearly written and the analysis is especially thorough. I have very little to suggest for improvement.</p><p>A few comments throughout could be toned down. For example, in the Introduction, &quot;In the current study, we used binocular rivalry to answer this question.&quot; A lot of readers will take issue with this misplaced confidence. The study does not answer the question. It addresses the question; it provides evidence; some people will be convinced (especially by the very nice experiment 2) but others will need more data to convince them it isn't a different, correlated process that explains the results. For example, it is always possible that body ownership causes a slight increase in attention, and that the crucial factor is attention, however it is directed, whether by body ownership illusion or not.</p><p>The last paragraph of the paper also contains some overly confident sentences. It's very tricky to claim that you have absolutely shown a causal relationship. The results suggest it.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>van der Hoort and colleagues use a binocular rivalry task to measure the effect of body ownership on visual dominance times – a measure of conscious perceptions. They find that induction of the rubber hand illusion (i.e., induction of ownership over a rubber hand) is correlated with longer dominance times, across the same visuotactile stimulation conditions. They conclude that ownership promotes visual awareness.</p><p>Overall assessment and major comments:</p><p>I like the idea of this study. It is clearly motivated and generally well executed, and is presented clearly. I have some conceptual concerns about the interpretation of the results, however.</p><p>Personally, I'm not convinced that binocular rivalry measures visual awareness per se. Zou, He, and Zhang (2016, PNAS) showed that even unconsciously processed conflicting visual inputs can lead to conscious perceptual rivalry, which suggests that rivalry reflects a lower-level alternation or oscillation of ocular dominance rather than subjective awareness per se (see Giles, Lau, and Odegaard, 2016 for discussion). The same could theoretically be going on in the present study, in that the fluctuation in signal is occurring lower than the &quot;visual awareness&quot; stage. In the parlance of hierarchical causal inference in multisensory integration, perhaps the pre-conscious processing ends up selecting the visual input that is congruent with the posterior probability of a common cause that the system arrives at (see Samad, Chung, and Shams, 2015). That is, when the perceptual system assigns a high posterior probability of a common cause (high binding probability), the visual input that is congruent with that inference is boosted (via gain enhancement, or some other mechanism of signal strength enhancement) while the visual input that is incongruent with the inference (or irrelevant to it) is suppressed. This may also be compounded by the fact that binocular rivalry experiments kind of force the observer into a model selection or probability matching decision strategy, rather than a model averaging kind of framework (see Wozny et al., 2010 PLoS Comp Bio), because it's less easy to blend the inputs from the two eyes in a weighted averaging kind of way (although partial breakthrough does occur). So if this is what's happening, it's a low level selection of ocular dominance and signal strength boosting that may have little to do with awareness per se.</p><p>I don't think this conceptual distinction detrimentally impacts the general motivation for the paper, which the authors state right in the first paragraph of the Introduction as, &quot;Because one's own body is more relevant than any other object, it is reasonable to expect that visual awareness will be boosted when, all else being equal, body-ownership is present.&quot; (Sidenote: could the authors provide some citation for the statement, 'Because one's own body is more relevant than any other object'?) But I think it does impact the use of the term – and concept – &quot;visual awareness&quot;: the conclusions of the paper are also consistent with the idea that when body-ownership is present, a low level signal is itself boosted, which then causes longer dominance times. It's a sort of subtle difference, but it's really about where in the processing stream the effects of body-ownership will have their effect. Indeed, the authors mention in the Introduction that rivalrous dominance times can be increased simply by increasing the strength of one eye's visual input, and then again in the Discussion, and I think that explanation of an internal boost in signal strength due to congruency with the result of a causal inference process about ownership/binding might also apply to the results of this study. So unfortunately, I don't think the evidence here is strong enough to warrant the claim that the body-ownership effect is at the awareness level rather than the low-level perceptual or ocular dominance stage.</p><p>Perhaps this is what the authors intend by talking about how boosting signal strength can increase dominance times in binocular rivalry, and the other related purported neural mechanisms in the discussion (e.g. the functional connectivity between IPS and EBA is increased in &quot;ownership&quot; conditions). But I think the conceptual distinction needs to be made between a boost in internal signal strength that leads to increased awareness (longer dominance times), versus an effect at the higher &quot;awareness&quot; level itself. So I think the conclusion of the paper needs to be about how congruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive integration leads to increased internal signal strength or more efficient processing, which can manifest as longer dominance times and higher &quot;ownership&quot; ratings, rather than that ownership leads to awareness itself.</p><p>I also have some comments about the design and analysis:</p><p>– Why the median split for the illusion scores (Q1 + Q2) – (Q3 + Q4)? Why not simply look at continuous measures (e.g. the Spearman correlation already presented)? The median split seems unnecessary.</p><p>– Despite the fact that the dominance time t-tests were planned, they should be corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>– I find it puzzling that the illusion is really only measured once for each participant. Why not assess after each block? It has been shown that the &quot;no stimulation&quot; condition used here also induces the illusion but to a lesser degree (Samad et al., 2015). So, the statement &quot;ownership of the hand being absent during the other four conditions&quot; is not necessarily accurate, but assumed throughout the study. This means the comparisons here might actually underestimate the effect of synchronous stroking on ownership and therefore dominance time, or might not adequately index the effect of ownership per se, but instead index the effect of ownership coupled with congruent visuotactile stimulation. Could the authors justify why the questionnaire was not used after each block? And why each condition (except the visuotactile condition) was only tested once per participant? This sparsity of data makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the results. This is especially interesting because here the no-stimulation condition (in Experiment 1) produced some similar but weaker effects to the congruent conditions; this is also related to the citation of Salomon et al's 2013 paper, which found congruency effects in CFS break times. I know that Experiment 2 somewhat addresses this, but overall I think the results would be stronger and more informative if ownership were more systematically queried.</p><p>– As a related point, the congruent visuo-tactile versus visual only condition is really a comparison of a trisensory congruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive condition to a bisensory congruent (visuo-proprioceptive or tactile-proprioceptive) condition (Experiment 1), or to a trisensory incongruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive condition (in which it is the proprioceptive information that is incongruent, Experiment 2). As a result, and because ownership was not systematically measured as much as I would have liked, it's hard to tell whether the results are due to *ownership per se* or simply more sensory information that happens to be congruent. The fact that there is increased effect with increased ownership in a between-subjects analysis suggests that ownership may be the cause, but this is somewhat confounded by the fact that there is simply more information in the trisensory congruent case, and it may be the congruency and not ownership that is driving the effect.

In the numerator, it is the mean across all conditions, and in the denominator it is the mean in the visual-only condition?

The point really wasn't about the difference between perceptual awareness versus subjective awareness. It was about whether we can say anything about the effect of *ownership* on awareness per se, versus just signal strength (or &quot;more information&quot; that happens to be congruent) that ends up manifesting in the awareness measure. For example, we probably wouldn't claim that turning up the brightness on a computer screen or turning up the volume leads to more 'awareness' – it boosts signal strength which leads to more awareness, but if it's awareness itself that we're interested in, that's not quite the same thing. Likewise, boosting signal strength *internally* also doesn't boost *awareness* itself – but that boost in signal strength (or fidelity, like with attention) can *manifest* as more &quot;seen&quot; reports in an awareness task. But these really aren't the same thing, and it's not clear that ownership is what was doing the boosting anyway.</p><p>I do appreciate that the authors refer to Lamme's recurrent processing theory as support for their interpretation, but as they point out GWT (Dehaene) would not agree. Likewise, higher order theories certainly do not agree that a boost in signal strength = a boost in awareness.</p><p>I hope this will help clarify my concerns. I'm not asking the authors to differentiate between subjective versus perceptual awareness, but rather to acknowledge that in this project the measured 'awareness' might, in fact, be nothing more than a boost in signal strength at a much lower level of processing – akin to turning up the brightness on a computer monitor. This is also not to say that this finding is not *interesting*, but just that it's not the same as boosting awareness per se. Perhaps we are talking past each other here, but a little clarification about this in the manuscript itself, rather than just in the reply to reviews, would be beneficial to the reader.</p><p>Although as I said above the authors have done an acceptable job addressing my other concerns, this one is still at the forefront and really, in my mind, requires a change in the text itself rather than in the replies to me.

The Wilcoxon-signed rank test already demonstrates that the illusion score is smaller in that condition, but it is interesting to look into whether there was nevertheless a relationship between the illusion and dominance even in a condition that had reduced ownership.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26022.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>A few comments throughout could be toned down.

Zou, He, and Zhang (2016, PNAS) showed that even unconsciously processed conflicting visual inputs can lead to conscious perceptual rivalry, which suggests that rivalry reflects a lower-level alternation or oscillation of ocular dominance rather than subjective awareness per se (see Giles, Lau, and Odegaard, 2016 for discussion). The same could theoretically be going on in the present study, in that the fluctuation in signal is occurring lower than the &quot;visual awareness&quot; stage. In the parlance of hierarchical causal inference in multisensory integration, perhaps the pre-conscious processing ends up selecting the visual input that is congruent with the posterior probability of a common cause that the system arrives at (see Samad, Chung, and Shams 2015). That is, when the perceptual system assigns a high posterior probability of a common cause (high binding probability), the visual input that is congruent with that inference is boosted (via gain enhancement, or some other mechanism of signal strength enhancement) while the visual input that is incongruent with the inference (or irrelevant to it) is suppressed. This may also be compounded by the fact that binocular rivalry experiments kind of force the observer into a model selection or probability matching decision strategy, rather than a model averaging kind of framework (see Wozny et al., 2010 PLoS Comp Bio), because it's less easy to blend the inputs from the two eyes in a weighted averaging kind of way (although partial breakthrough does occur). So if this is what's happening, it's a low level selection of ocular dominance and signal strength boosting that may have little to do with awareness per se.</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Perhaps this is what the authors intend by talking about how boosting signal strength can increase dominance times in binocular rivalry, and the other related purported neural mechanisms in the discussion (e.g. the functional connectivity between IPS and EBA is increased in &quot;ownership&quot; conditions). But I think the conceptual distinction needs to be made between a boost in internal signal strength that leads to increased awareness (longer dominance times), versus an effect at the higher &quot;awareness&quot; level itself. So I think the conclusion of the paper needs to be about how congruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive integration leads to increased internal signal strength or more efficient processing, which can manifest as longer dominance times and higher &quot;ownership&quot; ratings, rather than that ownership leads to awareness itself.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting analysis. The reviewer is right to argue that binocular rivalry might be resolved at a perceptual awareness level rather than a subjective awareness level, as is the case in the study of Zhou, He and Zhang, 2016. However, the distinction between perceptual awareness and subjective awareness touches upon the question regarding what (visual) awareness really is. Different theories of (visual) awareness assume different ideas as to what visual awareness is and which brain processes are involved (for a recent review: Klink, Self, Lamme and Roelfsema, 2015). The increased functional connectivity between the IPS and the EBA that we propose in the Discussion would increase recurrent processing in the EBA, which, according to some authors, equals an increase in visual awareness (the recurrent processing theory, e.g., Lamme, 2006), whereas others would claim that a larger global network needs to be involved (the global neuronal workspace theory, e.g., Dehaene, Charles, King and Marti, 2014). However, we think it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript to discuss the nature of visual awareness and the possible neural mechanisms that underlie it. Moreover, we do not draw any conclusions specifically about subjective awareness over and above perceptual awareness (Giles, Lau and Odegaard, 2016), and our data cannot distinguish between these two types of awareness. Therefore, if possible, we would prefer not to speculate about this issue in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Could the authors provide some citation for the statement, 'Because one's own body is more relevant than any other object'?</italic></p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been updated, as it is a logical statement, and not based on empirical evidence.

The alternative hypothesis was that body ownership does not affect visual awareness during binocular rivalry. When testing a specific hypothesis, it is not logical to perform corrections for multiple comparisons (Perneger, 1998). There are several reasons for this claim. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that multiple testing corrections would always be a correct practice, this would imply that the interpretation of the data from a given study depends on the number of tests performed in the analysis and not on the information encoded in the data itself. Moreover, multiple-testing corrections, which have the main goal of reducing Type I errors, have the related drawback of inflating Type II errors, and this effect is problematic as well. In fact, if one specific hypothesis predicts several different effects of an experimental manipulation and each of these effects is found to be significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 level, correctly rejecting the null hypothesis would logically be more likely rather than less likely. For all these reasons, we did not plan to apply corrections for multiple comparisons when we designed the experiments, and we have therefore not included Bonferroni corrections for our planned comparisons in the current version of the manuscript. We do correct for multiple comparisons in our post hoc tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>– I find it puzzling that the illusion is really only measured once for each participant. Why not assess after each block? It has been shown that the &quot;no stimulation&quot; condition used here also induces the illusion but to a lesser degree (Samad et al., 2015). So, the statement &quot;ownership of the hand being absent during the other four conditions&quot; is not necessarily accurate, but assumed throughout the study. This means the comparisons here might actually underestimate the effect of synchronous stroking on ownership and therefore dominance time, or might not adequately index the effect of ownership per se, but instead index the effect of ownership coupled with congruent visuotactile stimulation. Could the authors justify why the questionnaire was not used after each block? And why each condition (except the visuotactile condition) was only tested once per participant?</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would have been informative to measure ownership after each condition. However, there were two main reasons why we did not include a questionnaire after each block. First, we measured the illusion only once per participant in Experiment 1 and twice per participant in Experiment 2, and these subjective measures of ownership were taken after participants had completed all binocular rivalry trials. This design ensured that the binocular rivalry data were unaffected by participants’ knowledge of ownership illusions. Measuring ownership after each block, however, would allow for unwanted compliance and expectancy effects. Second, because the ownership questionnaire contains items that refer to tactile sensations and their relation to visually perceived movement (e.g., “it felt as if the touch I felt was caused by the white ball that I saw”), several conditions render these illusion statements nonsensical. For example, in the tactile-only condition there was no moving probe to be seen, and in the visual-only condition there was no tactile sensation.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that possible weak sensations of ownership could have arisen in the no-stimulation condition (as in Samad et al., 2015), which, if anything, would reduce the described experimental effects. In the new version of the manuscript, we mention this possibility in the Materials and method section. However, it is important to note the very well-established fact that synchronous visuotactile stimulation elicits very strong sensations of limb ownership. In the study of Samad et al., 2015, the addition of synchronous strokes made the illusion of ownership stronger compared with the condition in which the participants merely looked at the model hand. Other studies reported that conditions in which participants merely looked at a hand did not elicit significant ownership illusions in the majority of the participants (Holmes et al., 2006; Guterstam et al., 2016; unpublished observations). Thus, we think it reasonable to assume that limb ownership in our no-stimulation condition should be significantly reduced compared with the synchronous visuotactile condition. Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct that we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the participants experienced (weak) ownership in the no-stimulation condition. Therefore, we have updated the following text:</p><p>“Experiment 1 consisted of five conditions, with ownership of the hand being induced during one condition (“visuotactile”) and ownership of the hand being absent or reduced during the other four conditions (see below).”</p><p>“On the basis of what is known from a large body of work on the rubber-hand illusion, we assumed that the visual-only and tactile-only conditions would not elicit a hand-ownership illusion because they contain a mismatch between vision and touch (Ehrsson, 2012). The no-stimulation condition could theoretically induce a weak ownership illusion since there was less sensory mismatch between different modalities, but such a putative illusion would be significantly weaker compared to the visuotactile condition (Samad, Chung, and Shams, 2015; Guterstam et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>– As a related point, the congruent visuo-tactile versus visual only condition is really a comparison of a trisensory congruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive condition to a bisensory congruent (visuo-proprioceptive or tactile-proprioceptive) condition (Experiment 1), or to a trisensory incongruent visuo-tactile-proprioceptive condition (in which it is the proprioceptive information that is incongruent, Experiment 2).

Moreover, experimental manipulation of the spatial congruency of multisensory body-related signals is a commonly used approach to manipulate body ownership in the rubber hand illusion literature (e.g., Pavani et al., 2000; Ehrsson et al., 2004; Tsakiris and Haggard, 2005; Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>– I do not understand the normalization, described on in Materials and methods subsection “Duration of single percepts”.

The analyses on the effect of individual touches use only the data around single touches (-667 – 1334 ms). As explained in the Method section, the pattern of touches was as follows: three strokes – one rest – two strokes – one rest. During the ‘rest’, the tactile probe came to a full stop next to the hand, and the dominance of the hand image dropped considerably, perhaps as a rebound effect from the stimulating effect of the movement.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>The authors have adequately addressed my concerns, for the most part, although some of my concerns (e.g. ownership assessed more frequently and more comprehensively; differentiating between &quot;more information that is congruent&quot; versus &quot;ownership&quot;) cannot be addressed because the data are not there to support new analyses.</italic> </p><p><italic>Regarding the authors' response to my Comment 1: I think I was not clear enough in my previous point, for which I apologize. The point really wasn't about the difference between perceptual awareness versus subjective awareness. It was about whether we can say anything about the effect of *ownership* on awareness per se, versus just signal strength (or &quot;more information&quot; that happens to be congruent) that ends up manifesting in the awareness measure. For example, we probably wouldn't claim that turning up the brightness on a computer screen or turning up the volume leads to more 'awareness' – it boosts signal strength which leads to more awareness, but if it's awareness itself that we're interested in, that's not quite the same thing. Likewise, boosting signal strength *internally* also doesn't boost *awareness* itself – but that boost in signal strength (or fidelity, like with attention) can *manifest* as more &quot;seen&quot; reports in an awareness task. But these really aren't the same thing, and it's not clear that ownership is what was doing the boosting anyway.</italic> </p><p><italic>I do appreciate that the authors refer to Lamme's recurrent processing theory as support for their interpretation, but as they point out GWT (Dehaene) would not agree. Likewise, higher order theories certainly do not agree that a boost in signal strength = a boost in awareness.</italic> </p><p><italic>I hope this will help clarify my concerns. I'm not asking the authors to differentiate between subjective versus perceptual awareness, but rather to acknowledge that in this project the measured 'awareness' might, in fact, be nothing more than a boost in signal strength at a much lower level of processing – akin to turning up the brightness on a computer monitor. This is also not to say that this finding is not *interesting*, but just that it's not the same as boosting awareness per se. Perhaps we are talking past each other here, but a little clarification about this in the manuscript itself, rather than just in the reply to reviews, would be beneficial to the reader.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for clarifying this comment. We fully agree that the increase in perceptual dominance of the hand image could possibly be due to increased signal strength of that image, which affects the perceptual awareness only “indirectly”. Such an increase in signal strength would nonetheless be mediated by the multimodal integration that comprises ownership since visual input was controlled for. Alternatively, the effect of ownership might “directly” influence by enhancing recurrent processing from the IPS to the EBA. In a new discussion paragraph we outline these two possibilities and explicitly discuss the conceptual distinction raised by the reviewer.</p><p>New text:</p><p>“The above discussion brings us to the conceptual issue of whether body ownership boosts visual awareness “directly” at the higher level of conscious selection, or if body ownership influences visual awareness “indirectly” by first increasing the signal strength in lower level visual representations, which in turn leads to facilitation of awareness (Giles, Lau, and Odegaard, 2016). […] Thus, although our results clearly show that body ownership increases the subjective dominance of the hand image, the possible existence of a direct causal relationship between body ownership and conscious awareness remains to be clarified in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Thank you for addressing the majority of the comments raised and clearing up many of the confusions I had while reading this.

Although the supplied figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is correct, an error occurred in the statistical analysis. The correlation did not reach significance (<italic>ρ<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.197). Updated text:</p><p>“In a post hoc correlation analysis, we found that, in contrast to Experiment 1, the positive correlation between participants’ ownership illusion scores and the increased dominance of the hand-image in the congruent visuotactile condition did not reach significance (<italic>ρ<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.197) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).”</p><p>To be clear, the non-significant correlation in Experiment 2 does not affect our conclusions. This experiment was designed to directly manipulate ownership through manipulating spatial congruency, and this manipulation had significant effects on perceptual dominance of the hand image as we had predicted. Thus our conclusion that ownership of the hand image promotes the perceptual dominance of the hand is supported by the results. Not finding a significant correlation in an explorative post-hoc test does not falsify this conclusion. In our opinion we could take out the correlation analysis from the manuscript and our main conclusions would not change.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to note that the perceptual dominance in the congruent visuotactile condition is normalized based on different control conditions in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. As a result, the normalized effect is on average smaller in Experiment 2 (mean normalized dominance in visuotactile condition of Experiment 1 = 0.182; mean normalized dominance in congruent visuotactile condition in Experiment 2 = 0.064), and therefore there is <italic>relatively</italic> more noise in the normalized perceptual dominances of Experiment 2, which might partially explain the lack of a significant correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>While not crucial from the point of view of this review, I would be curious to see what the correlation looks like for the incongruent visuotactile condition as well (at the very least I strongly recommend including a report of the correlation itself if not also including the plot). The Wilcoxon-signed rank test already demonstrates that the illusion score is smaller in that condition, but it is interesting to look into whether there was nevertheless a relationship between the illusion and dominance even in a condition that had reduced ownership.</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We conducted this correlation analysis, and found a similar trend for the incongruent visuotactile condition (<italic>ρ<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.23, <italic>p</italic> = 0.221) as we found for the congruent visuotactile condition (see Comment 2), with the difference that overall, ownership scores and perceptual dominance were lower in the incongruent condition. The figure below shows the correlation between illusion score and perceptual dominance for the incongruent condition (note: the scales on the axes differ from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).
