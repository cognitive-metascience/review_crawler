However, not all neural crest cells are alike, with distinct populations existing along the body axis. One of the most unique neural crest populations is the ‘cardiac neural crest’ that contributes to the outflow septum and smooth muscle of the outflow tract of the heart. Ablation studies in chick embryos show that removal of the cardiac crest results in a broad range of defects, including persistent truncus arteriosus, abnormal myocardium function, and misalignment of the arch arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waldo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bockman et al., 1987</xref>). These defects are highly reminiscent of some of the most common human congenital heart defects. Importantly, other neural crest populations cannot rescue the effects of cardiac neural crest ablation even when grafted in its place, exemplifying the uniqueness of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirby, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Classically, quail-chick transplantation experiments have been used to uncover contributions of the cardiac neural crest to the heart, with some more recent attempts using antibody staining of migratory neural crest cells or LacZ retroviral lineage analysis as well as transgenic lines such as <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> driven β-galactosidase in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuratani and Kirby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>). The results suggest that the cardiac neural crest contributes to smooth muscle cells lining the great arteries, outflow tract septum and valves, mesenchyme that remodels pharyngeal arch arteries, and parasympathetic innervation of the heart, such as the cardiac ganglion. However, inconsistencies remain between different lineage approaches, most of which suffer from high background and low cellular resolution.</p><p>To reconcile these differences, here, we use a multi-organismal approach to examine the lineage contributions of cardiac neural crest to the heart. Using a novel retroviral labeling approach in chick and confirmed by <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> reporter lines in mouse, we reveal a previously undetected contribution of the amniote cardiac neural crest to the trabecular myocardium of the ventricles, a derivative previously thought to be confined to non-amniotic vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sato and Yost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavanaugh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The homologous cardiac neural crest contribution to cardiomyocytes across diverse species raised the intriguing possibility that these cells may contribute to cardiac repair. As the adult zebrafish heart exhibits extensive regenerative capacity, we turned to this model to test whether the neural crest may contribute to heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, we show that resected adult zebrafish hearts reactivate many genes of a neural crest gene regulatory program during the regeneration process. Taken together, these results demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved contribution of neural crest cells to cardiomyocytes across vertebrates and a previously unappreciated role during heart regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Labeling the chick cardiac neural crest using Replication Incompetent Avian retrovirus</title><p>To specifically label cardiac neural crest cells prior to their emigration from the neural tube and identify novel progeny of chick cardiac crest, we use a replication-incompetent avian retrovirus (RIA) that indelibly and precisely marks neural crest progenitors for long term lineage analysis at single cell resolution and without the need for tissue grafting. To this end, the post-otic neural tube of the hindbrain adjacent to somites 1–3 was injected at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 9–10 with high-titer (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> ifu/mL) RIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which drives expression of nuclear localized <italic>H2B-YFP</italic> under control of a constitutive RSV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fields-Berry et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>). At this stage in the development, premigratory cardiac neural crest cells are positioned within the dorsal neural tube and about to emigrate. Accordingly, this labeling approach solely marks hindbrain neural tube cells including premigratory cardiac neural crest cells that subsequently delaminate from the dorsal neural tube during a two-hour time window when the virus remains active.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47929.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retrovirally mediated fate mapping of cardiac neural crest reveals novel derivatives.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the approach: Replication Incompetent Avian (RIA) retrovirus encoding nuclear H2B-YFP was injected into the lumen of the hindbrain from which cardiac neural crest arises.

Based on our observation on the lineage relationship between cardiac neural crest cells and cardiomyocytes during development, we propose that neural crest-derived cells (progenitors and/or pre-existing cardiomyocytes) may represent a key population that proliferates and differentiates into new cardiomyocytes after injury.</p><p>Our cell lineage labeling results provide direct evidence for a neural crest contribution to the undamaged myocardium of the amniote heart. Furthermore, consistent with previous lineage tracing experiments in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavanaugh et al., 2015</xref>), where a proportion of cardiac crest derived-cells were located in the trabeculated myocardium in adult fish, we show that after injury, there is activation of numerous neural crest gene regulatory transcription factors and other neural crest genes during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While the underlying gene regulatory network of neural crest cells is responsible for formation of cardiomyocytes during normal development, we speculate that it also does so in a similar manner upon injury by redeploying <italic>sox10</italic> and other neural crest gene regulatory network genes. The finding that <italic>sox10-</italic>derived cells are primarily in the proximal trabecular myocardium of the zebrafish heart suggests that these cells must be migrating into to the wound site after injury. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cells that reactivate <italic>sox10</italic> and the neural crest program may come from another adult lineage. But in the adult, their molecular signature strongly correlates with that of embryonic neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Whereas our data clearly show that the <italic>sox10</italic>+ cells contribute to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whether they also might contribute to other lineages (e.g. hematopoietic cells) within the regenerated tissue remains to be explored.</p><p>Why was the contribution of neural crest cells to cardiomyocytes in amniotes previously missed? Interspecific quail-chick chimera are generated via transplantation of donor tissue into the host, which requires time to heal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>). If the neural crest cells that migrate to the ventricles are the earliest migrating cells, this population may have been delayed after grafting due to wound healing and hence unable to migrate as far. Alternatively, the labeled cells may have been missed since it can be challenging to identify a small population of dispersed quail cells amongst many more numerous chick cells. Furthermore, cell behavior might be altered when transplanted quail cells are introduced into a chick environment. Our retroviral lineage labeling circumvents these issues by indelibly labeling an endogenous neural crest population without the need for grafting. Moreover, the labeled cells are easily detectable due to their fluorescent readout. For lineage labeling in mice, there were hints in the literature regarding a possible neural crest contribution to cardiomyocytes. However, the experiments were either indirect or used lineage tracing techniques that were not specific to the neural crest. For example, Tomita et al. showed that cells isolated from ‘cardiospheres’ can behave like neural crest cells when injected into chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, lineage analysis in mouse using a P0-cre line revealed EGFP-positive cells in the myocardium that gather at the ischemic border upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>). However, P0 is not a neural crest specific marker, making these results inconclusive at the time. In contrast, Wnt1 is the ‘gold standard’ for neural crest labeling and the improved Wnt1 line (<italic>Wnt1-Cre2+; R26mTmG)</italic> corrects possible ectopic expression problematic in the original <italic>Wnt1-Cre;ZsGreen line</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In chick and mouse, neural crest-derived cells comprise a significant portion (~17%) of the trabeculated myocardium in the proximal part of both ventricles. Interestingly, this percentage is similar to what has been reported in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavanaugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Wajid et al., 2018</xref>). In amniotes, we find that the density of the cells decreases along the proximal-distal axis and appears to be stable through time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a,b</xref>). The presence of neural crest-derived cardiomyocytes across vertebrates and the redeployment of a <italic>sox10+</italic> cell population in zebrafish heart regeneration suggest that the neural crest-derived myocardium might also play a role in heart regeneration in neonatal mice, which requires further testing.</p><p>In summary, the present results show, for the first time, the common ability of cardiac neural crest cells across diverse vertebrates to contribute to heart muscle. Moreover, these cells appear to be critical for cardiac regeneration in zebrafish. If the results extrapolate to other species, the mechanisms that control the normal development of the neural crest into cardiomyocytes may be harnessed to stimulate these cells to proliferate and regenerate new cardiomyocytes, thus offering potential therapeutic approaches to repair heart damage in mammals including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Wnt1-Cre; ZsGreen<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10725243">10725243</ext-link></td><td>Jackson Laboratories, Stock# 003829</td><td>Drs.

The analyses are well performed and provide interesting data. Remarkably, the authors also report in a model with heart regenerative capacities, the adult zebrafish, a reactivation of embryonic programs related to the neural crest development upon a cardiac injury (both by in situ hybridization and transcriptome analysis).

This is an important and controversial topic with substantial relevance to the causes of congenital heart disease and to the evolution of neural crest derivatives, as well as potential relevance to mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration. It is therefore valuable that the authors provide new lineage analysis data sets that document the contribution of some cardiac neural crest cells to the myocardium in both chick and mouse. This work is carefully performed and interpreted and provides new information of interest to the field. In addition, the authors demonstrate that sox10, as well as other genes associated with the migratory neural crest, are upregulated in the myocardium of the regenerating zebrafish heart, following injury. These new gene expression data add to our understanding of how the adult zebrafish heart responds to injury, and the authors are interested in drawing a connection between these observations and the contributions of cardiac neural crest-derived cells to regeneration. These data are also valuable to those seeking to understand the regulation of cardiac regeneration, but would benefit from some interpretative adjustments. Specifically:</p><p>1) The induction of expression of sox10 and other neural crest-associated genes is very interesting, but it is inappropriate to interpret this as evidence that cardiac neural crest cells contribute to the regenerative capacity of the zebrafish heart without evidence that the cells activating expression of these genes are indeed neural crest-derived. The injury stimulus may induce expression of sox10 et al. in cardiomyocytes that were not originally neural crest-derived, and a different type of lineage tracing experiment would be required to determine whether neural crest-derived cardiomyocytes indeed respond to injury differently than lateral mesoderm-derived cardiomyocytes do. Alternatively, the authors could amend their interpretation – these changes in gene expression are certainly interesting whether or not the responding cells are necessarily neural crest-derived. (Saying that the sox10:GAL4-UAS-Cre line permanently labels all neural crest lineages is an overstatement – it permanently marks sox10-expressing cells, but there may be instances of sox10 expression outside of the neural crest.)</p><p>2) Along the same lines, the data shown here associate the induction of sox10 expression (and the expression of other neural crest-associated genes) with regeneration but do not directly demonstrate the significance of these genes to the regenerative response. Demonstrating their significance would surely require substantial additional experimentation; here, the authors should simply take caution to avoid implying that these particular genes are associated with regulation of regeneration.</p><p>3) Could the authors comment on the relationship of the differential gene expression that they document in Figure 4H with other published datasets that examine the transcriptomic changes triggered by injury? Is it the case that the same neural crest-associated genes are differentially expressed in those datasets (but haven't been highlighted in the analysis done thus far)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper showing additional contributions of the neural crest to parts of the heart across vertebrates. Moreover, the authors present evidence that during regeneration of the zebrafish heart, neural crest-derived heart cells contribute to the regenerate and redeploy a neural crest gene expression programme. This suggests previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the cells contributing to regeneration.</p><p>Overall, the findings are important, but the manuscript could be substantially improved by more explanations and quantifications of data.</p><p>1) The manuscript has two parts and it is not entirely clear how these are connected. In the first part, the authors use lineage tracing to find new and known populations of crest cells that contribute to heart development. These cells seem to be rare in the apex &quot;…&quot;no neural crest-derived cardiomyocytes were observed in the apex of the heart&quot;…&quot;). However, in the second part of the manuscript they remove the apex for regeneration purposes. How are the two parts of the manuscript connected?</p><p>2) The authors say that they have found novel crest-derived cell populations in the heart. At the same time, they state that previous research was controversial, and tools were inadequate due to high background. It is unclear whether previous papers already described these populations and this is here confirmed with more robust tools, or whether these populations are entirely new. Moreover, it would be good to at least discuss in more detail how they know that their tools are superior in their hands (e.g. &quot;the improved Wnt1 line&quot;).</p><p>3) Many results rely on scoring for the presence or absence of cells. How were tissues scored? More quantifications of the relative contribution to the tissue in question should be shown for lineage tracing and zf heart regeneration, such that the relative importance of the crest contribution can be appreciated.</p><p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 1: Were there also cells that expressed sox10 mRNA de novo? The prediction would be that only lineage-traced cells re-express sox10 – otherwise non-neural crest derived cells contribute to the population of sox10+ cells in regeneration. Can this be clearly observed in the combination of colorimetric ISH and transgenic fluorescence?</p><p>5) More information is needed on how the &quot;the cardiac neural crest migratory gene regulatory module&quot; was identified in the expression profile of regenerated heart cells in zf. e.g. did they use GO analysis?

Basically, given that neural crest cells are a well-known stem cell population, the finding that the they can contribute to cardiomyocytes in amniotes similar to what had been previously shown in anamniotes made us wonder if they might contribute to heart regeneration. Zebrafish seemed like the most appropriate model for this due to their extensive capacity for heart regeneration.</p><p>To improve the connection between the two parts of the paper, we now more thoroughly reference and discuss several previously published papers that use the sox10 promoter for labeling cardiac neural crest cells (Carney et al., 2006; Cavanaugh et al., 2015; Abdul-Wajid et al., 2018). These studies show that in zebrafish, the neural crest contribution to the ventricles is primarily to the trabecular myocardium, similar to what we have found in chick and mouse. The study by Cavanaugh and colleagues also shows that <italic>sox10</italic> is downregulated in the heart as development proceeds (Cavanaugh et al., 2015). We confirm this by showing minimal <italic>sox10</italic> expression in control adult hearts.</p><p>The finding that <italic>sox10-</italic>derived cells are primarily in the proximal trabecular myocardium of the zebrafish heart suggests that these cells must be migrating into to the wound site after injury. We now discuss this interesting possibility more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors say that they have found novel crest-derived cell populations in the heart.

Moreover, it would be good to at least discuss in more detail how they know that their tools are superior in their hands (e.g. &quot;the improved Wnt1 line&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these issues. We have added further discussion of why the contribution to cardiomyocytes may have been missed in birds and previous hints from the literature of a neural crest contribution to the mammalian heart. In birds, this population was totally missed. There is no mention of a contribution of neural crest cells to cardiomyocytes in any of the quail/chick chimera papers. In mice, the lineage tracing was done with P0 mice which is not a neural crest specific marker, but rather labels Schwann cells and notochord cells, making these results inconclusive at the time. In fact, Fukada and colleagues recently published a paper (Fukada et al., 2017) describing the differences between P0 and Wnt1 lineage labeling in mice and described Wnt1 as the “gold standard” for neural crest labeling.</p><p>In our study, we use two different Wnt1 lines to examine the contribution of neural crest cells to the murine heart. The reason for using the “improved” Wnt1 line (<italic>Wnt1-Cre2+: R26mTmG)</italic> is because the original line (<italic>Wnt1-Cre:ZsGreen)</italic>, used in most publications, is known to have ectopic expression in some locations due to <italic>Wnt1</italic> activation caused by an in-frame ATG located upstream of <italic>Wnt1</italic> start codon, thus complicating the results. The Wnt1-Cre2+ corrects this issue and is therefore a more reliable reporter. We think that previous authors missed the neural crest contribution due to the myocardium in Wnt1 mice because the early experiments done with Wnt1-cre lineage tracing used colorometric lacZ as a readout. As there is high background from endogenous enzyme activity in the heart, it is likely that any labeling observed in this location was ignored as high background. Thus, with our tools, including retroviral lineage tracing in chick and fluorescent Wnt1-cre2+ mouse lines, we both confirmed all other previously described contributions of cardiac neural crest to the heart (Kirby et al., 1983, Jiang et al., 2000) as well as discovering a novel contribution to the myocardium. We have clarified this point in the paper and thank the reviewer for point out this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Many results rely on scoring for the presence or absence of cells. How were tissues scored? More quantifications of the relative contribution to the tissue in question should be shown for lineage tracing and zf heart regeneration, such that the relative importance of the crest contribution can be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. To address this, we quantitated the numbers of labeled neural crest cells we observe in various cardiac locations. As we do not label the entire neural crest population in chick, it’s most accurate to compare the% of labeled cells in each location (explained Supplementary file 1 legend). For the mouse, we label the entire neural crest population and we find that 16.8% of the labeled neural crest cells are in the proximal ventricles (quantified by automated particle analysis in FIJI program). Supplementary file 1A presents the quantified virally labelled cells in the chick embryo and E15.5 mouse and include the average percentage of neural crest contribution in the ventricular myocardium in mouse. We clarify that tissue were scored for numbers of GFP+ cells and clarify how counting was done in sections through chick, mouse and fish tissue in the methods. We have added approximate numbers of GFP+ cells to Supplementary file 1C in the zebrafish regeneration experiments as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 1: Were there also cells that expressed sox10 mRNA de novo?

We now clarify that only cells that lineage trace with the sox10 marker reexpress <italic>sox10</italic> during regeneration. However, not all mCherry+ cells express <italic>sox10</italic>, presumably because they lose expression as they differentiate into cardiomyocytes. We now include an updated figure that is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More information is needed on how the &quot;the cardiac neural crest migratory gene regulatory module&quot; was identified in the expression profile of regenerated heart cells in zf. e.g. did they use GO analysis?

Why is 21 days post-injury the best time point?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue as we now realize that we were unclear. For comparison, we use data from a recently published paper in which we profiled migratory cardiac neural crest genes in chick (Tani-Matsuhana et al., 2018). We then looked for similar gene signatures in our zebrafish <italic>sox10+</italic> dataset, focusing on transcription factors associated with modules of the neural crest gene regulatory network (Martik and Bronner, 2017). We have also highlighted known zebrafish neural crest genes on our volcano plot (Figure 4D). This gene list was acquired by a literature search as well as ZFIN. We now clarify this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
