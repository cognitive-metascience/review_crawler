for viral DNA synthesis and infection. Here, we show that these pores bind the abundant cellular polyanion IP<sub>6</sub>, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP<sub>6</sub>, which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10°C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse. Moreover, encapsidated reverse transcription assays reveal that, once stabilised by IP<sub>6</sub>, the accumulation of new viral DNA inside the capsid increases &gt;100 fold. Remarkably, isotopic labelling of inositol in virus-producing cells reveals that HIV selectively packages over 300 IP<sub>6</sub> molecules per infectious virion. We propose that HIV recruits IP<sub>6</sub> to regulate capsid stability and uncoating, analogous to picornavirus pocket factors.

To hide from components of our immune system that are active inside the cell, HIV uses a protein shell called a capsid, which protects its genome from detection and destruction. However, the capsid faces an engineering challenge beyond those faced by even the most complex man-made structures. This is because the capsid must be strong enough to survive for hours inside the cell but not so strong that it cannot quickly open when the virus needs to release its genome. How this process, called ‘uncoating’, is achieved is one of the great unanswered questions in HIV biology.</p><p>In 2016, researchers made the unexpected discovery that the HIV capsid is decorated with hundreds of pores: one at the center of every subunit from which it is built. Each pore contains a ring of six positively charged amino acids that should destabilize the capsid and cause it to break apart. Yet similar pores are found on a diverse range of viruses.</p><p>Mallery et al. – who include several of the researchers involved in the 2016 work – set out to investigate why the HIV capsid contains the positively charged pores. Initial experiments revealed that a molecule called IP<sub>6</sub>, which is abundant in cells, can bind to the HIV capsid. To do so, six negatively charged phosphate groups in IP<sub>6</sub> match up with the six positively charged residues in the pore.</p><p>In a related study, Márquez et al. developed a new method that allows the fate of individual capsids to be visualized through time. Here, Mallery et al. use the method to show that IP<sub>6</sub> increases how long the capsid remains intact from several minutes to over 10 hours. This allows HIV to copy its genome inside the capsid, meaning it remains protected while the virus prepares to produce new viruses. Mallery et al. also show that HIV packages more than 300 IP<sub>6</sub> molecules into itself when it replicates.</p><p>Other viruses called picornaviruses use small molecules called pocket factors to stabilize the capsid and to trigger uncoating. Mallery et al. propose that IP<sub>6</sub> is an HIV pocket factor. Just as studies of pocket factors have stimulated the development of anti-picornavirus drugs, understanding the role of IP<sub>6</sub> may help to develop new treatments for HIV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>capsid</kwd><kwd>IP6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105181010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Leo C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Leo C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>339223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böcking</surname><given-names>Till</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1036521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206248/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McEwan</surname><given-names>William A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1110116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>Claire F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inositol phosphate IP6 is selectively packaged into HIV virions, where it coordinates electropositive pores in the capsid to prevent spontaneous collapse and promote encapsidated DNA synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite a wealth of assays and data, HIV post-entry biology remains poorly understood. Before the virus can integrate its genes into the host genome, it must reverse transcribe its RNA into DNA, travel to the nucleus, remove its protective capsid (uncoating) and target actively transcribing chromatin. However, the relationship between these processes and the order and location in which they occur remain hotly debated. Reverse transcription (RT) is the first enzymatic step in infection and likely occurs as soon as the viral capsid enters the cytosol. Evidence suggests that it precedes all other processes including uncoating and nuclear import. Depletion of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2015</xref>) and kinesin one heavy chain (KIF5B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lukic et al., 2014</xref>), required for mechanical transport of viral cores to the nucleus, delays uncoating and nuclear entry but does not affect RT. Moreover, none of the capsid cofactors required for nuclear entry or integration are necessary for RT. Depletion of Nup153, Nup358, CPSF6 or TNPO3 inhibits nuclear entry and/or active chromatin targeting but not RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matreyek and Engelman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sowd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocwieja et al., 2011</xref>). Capsid mutants at cofactor interfaces largely phenocopy cofactor dependence, reinforcing this notion. Mutants N57A, N74D and P90A have defective integration and/or infectivity in primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>) but can still synthesise DNA.</p><p>The critical role the capsid plays in cellular trafficking and nuclear entry strongly suggests that it remains intact in some form until late in post-entry. Inducing premature uncoating in the cell via the restriction factor TRIM5α and the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stremlau et al., 2006</xref>), or the capsid drug PF74, irreversibly blocks RT and inhibits infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Exactly where and when uncoating normally happens and whether this occurs in a single step, or in sequential partial uncoating steps, is unclear. Nevertheless, one implication of RT preceding all other steps is that complete uncoating cannot be immediate. Encapsidated reverse transcription (ERT) assays demonstrate that RT can take place inside purified HIV cores before uncoating when they are supplied with dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warrilow et al., 2007</xref>). Inside the viral capsid, RT enjoys a high enzyme and substrate concentration and synthesised DNA is protected from nucleic acid sensors and nucleases in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lahaye et al., 2013</xref>). While the benefits of remaining encapsidated are clear, HIV capsids are known to be highly fragile in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forshey et al., 2002</xref>) and the accumulation of newly synthesised DNA increases their instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rankovic et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, it takes at least 10 hr for the virus to complete RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler et al., 2001</xref>) and dock at the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arhel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we reported that HIV capsid hexamers possess an electropositive pore that is essential for RT and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>). A ring of arginine residues (R18) within the pore avidly binds dNTPs, potentially explaining nucleotide transport into the capsid interior to fuel RT. However, the properties of the R18 pore and its consequences for encapsidated DNA synthesis and capsid stability remain largely unexplored. Crucially, dNTP is not the only polyanion in the cell nor the most abundant. Here, we show that the highly charged polyanion IP<sub>6</sub> is specifically incorporated into HIV virions and directly binds the R18 hexamer ring. We demonstrate that IP<sub>6</sub> greatly stabilises HIV cores, limiting their spontaneous disassembly and allowing efficient encapsidated RT. We propose that HIV uses IP<sub>6</sub> to regulate capsid uncoating in a manner reminiscent of picornavirus pocket factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATP binds the HIV-1 capsid but does not inhibit ERT</title><p>Our previous study on HIV capsid pores suggested but did not determine that they are unable to discriminate between ribo and deoxyribo nucleotides. This is an important question because ATP is typically present at cytosolic concentrations &gt; 100 fold in excess of dNTPs and thus a potential competitor for dNTP recruitment by the capsid. We therefore investigated whether ATP competes with dNTPs for binding to HIV capsid hexamers and whether the pore can discriminate between them. We used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to determine if ATP binds hexamers by testing for thermal stabilisation, as was previously observed for dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>). As previously, we used a mutant hexamer protein that is coordinated by disulphide bridges between monomers through the introduction of mutations A14C and E45C and with additional dimerisation mutants W184A and M185A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pornillos et al., 2010</xref>). ATP stabilised hexamers with an almost identical increase in melting temperature (Tm) as dATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Moreover, other triphosphate ligands were also stabilising suggesting a shared mode of binding. Next, we solved a crystal structure of hexamer bound to ATP to determine its mode of binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We observed electron density indicating that ATP binds to hexamer at the centre of the sixfold axis and refinement of the six symmetrically equivalent ATP molecules with equal partial occupancy provided a good fit to the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). The structure shows that ATP is coordinated solely by the R18 ring confirming that hexamers do not discriminate ribo versus deoxyribo nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ATP binds to the HIV-1 capsid.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Change in capsid hexamer stability upon addition of different nucleotide triphosphates as measured by differential scanning fluorimetry. Data are from three replicates and representative of at least three independent experiments.

ERT reactions were carried out on capsid cores purified from HIV-1 virions by centrifugation through a triton layer and banding in a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shah and Aiken, 2011</xref>). To ensure that this procedure allows recovery of intact cores of the expected morphology, we carried out negative stain electron microscopy (EM) on capsid cores further concentrated by pelleting. We observed intact capsids similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Welker et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We investigated RT inside these cores by adding dNTPs, together with DNAse to remove DNA accumulating outside the capsid. Surprisingly, even at a 100-fold excess of ATP over dNTPs, not only did ATP fail to inhibit ERT but it actually increased the quantity of measured transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Similar increases were observed with the non-hydrolysable analogue ATPγS, suggesting that this was not due to an undefined ATPase activity. Improvement in ERT efficiency was dose-dependent, with transcripts increasing over two orders of magnitude as ATP was increased from 10 to 1000 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Importantly, ATP had no impact on the activity of purified RT enzyme alone over the same concentration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Furthermore, substantial ATP stimulation was only observed in ERT reactions carried out in the presence of nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In the presence of DNase, any RT products that are made outside of the capsid, or become exposed as a result of uncoating, will be degraded. Thus, ATP does not alter the efficiency of RT directly but facilitates the accumulation of RT products within intact capsids. This is consistent with the fact that ATP hydrolysis is not required, as shown by the ATPγS data. We hypothesised that the ability of ATP to stabilise hexamers, as measured by DSF, may increase capsid stability during ERT. Consistent with this hypothesis, ATP only promoted ERT at concentrations of dNTPs &lt; 100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). At higher dNTP concentrations, ATP presumably had no effect because dNTPs sufficiently stabilised hexamers themselves. This also suggests that different cellular dNTP concentrations (such as during the cell cycle or between different cell types) might alter HIV RT efficiency both directly, by increasing substrate concentration for DNA synthesis, and indirectly by stabilising the capsid. Given that ATP may stabilise hexamers we tested whether ATP is selectively incorporated into HIV particles. ATP was detectable in virions, although at levels approximately similar to those inside the cell (1.5 mM) suggesting no substantial enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ATP does not prevent nucleotide import and ERT.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Electron micrographs of isolated HIV-1 cores as visualised by negative staining. Size bars are 100 nm.

To investigate this further, we compared the ability of nucleotide-based reverse transcription inhibitor (NRTI) AZT and non nucleoside RT inhibitiors Rilpivirine (RVP) and Nevirapine (NVP) to block ERT. We hypothesised that if pores represent the only entry route into the capsid then NNRTIs might be less potent in an encapsidated assay because they lack a triphosphate and may fail to interact with the R18 ring. We first used DSF to test interaction with capsid hexamers and found that only AZT and not the hydrophobic compounds RVP or NVP matched the stabilisation of dATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). A small increase in hexamer stability was observed with RVP but equally in the presence and absence of DTT. This suggests any RVP interaction is not due to the R18 hexameric ring as this feature will be destroyed upon DTT addition because the disulphides holding the hexamer together become reduced. To corroborate these results we measured binding by fluorescence competition with BODIPY-ATP. Only AZT could compete with BODIPY-ATP and was capable of binding capsid hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This data is consistent with pore interaction being dependent on the charged triphosphate group. Determining a structure of capsid hexamer in complex with AZT confirmed that interaction occurs in a similar manner to dATP and ATP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). AZT binds to hexamer at the centre of the six-fold axis and refinement of the six symmetrically equivalent AZT molecules with equal partial occupancy provided a good fit to the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). As with the previous complexes, while there is clear density for the phosphates the position of the base can only be inferred. The AZT triphosphates interact directly with R18, which adopts alternative side-chain conformers to allow multiple hydrogen bonds and prevent steric clashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Taken together with the ATP and dATP structures, this confirms that there are no specific hydrophobic interactions with the pore and is consistent with a lack of hexamer stabilisation by hydrophobic, uncharged NNRTIs. Next, we compared the activity of NRTI and NNRTIs in RT and ERT reactions to determine whether encapsidation markedly influences inhibitor potency. At the IC90 for in vitro RT inhibition, both AZT and the NNRTIs RVP and NVP blocked ERT with equivalent efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>). The fact that NNRTIs are equally capable of preventing ERT despite showing no interaction with the charged pore suggests that specific binding is not required for entry into the capsid. NNRTIs are sufficiently small to pass through the pore and so may enter by simple diffusion. These experiments also do not rule out entry via a different route entirely.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NNRTIs and NRTIs are equally potent ERT inhibitors despite differences in pore binding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Changes in hexamer capsid stability upon incubation with dATP or inhibitors in the presence and absence of DTT. Data are averaged from three replicates and representative of three independent experiments.

Previously, we showed that the six-fold symmetric polyaninon hexacarboxybenzene interacts avidly with the R18 charged pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it bound hexamers more tightly than dNTP and stabilised hexamers to a greater extent. Hexacarboxybenzene is not a cellular metabolite nor is it bioavailable; however, it is reminiscent of the fully phosphorylated inositol ring of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>), a strongly negatively charged metabolite possessing six phosphate rather than carboxylic acid groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Moreover, IP<sub>6</sub> has previously been shown to interact with immature capsid and catalyse in vitro assembly of the immature lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore tested by DSF whether IP<sub>6</sub> can stabilise the mature capsid and promote ERT by facilitating the accumulation of RT products within the core. To obtain additional information as to stoichiometry of binding, we performed experiments at a range of IP<sub>6</sub> concentrations with hexamer protein present at ~33 µM. To show the transition between stabilised species, the melt curves rather than change in stability (ΔT<sub>m</sub>) are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As predicted, IP<sub>6</sub> strongly stabilised capsid hexamers, moreover to a substantially greater degree than ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). A concentration of 20 µM IP<sub>6</sub> gave approximately half maximal stabilisation to a solution of 33 µM hexamer. This suggests that hexamer stabilisation by IP<sub>6</sub> is likely stoichiometric, with one IP<sub>6</sub> molecule per hexamer. Importantly, addition of IP<sub>6</sub> to an ERT reaction greatly increased the number of reverse transcripts in the presence of nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This suggests that IP<sub>6</sub> promotes the accumulation of RT products within intact capsids. To further test this hypothesis, we repeated our ERT experiment in the presence of the anti-capsid drug PF74. At concentrations &gt; 10 µM, PF74 is thought to destabilise the capsid and induce premature uncoating during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Price et al., 2014</xref>), while in vitro it leads to a rapid failure of capsid integrity (Marquez et al., submitted). We measured no RT products in the presence of both PF74 and nuclease, consistent with induced uncoating and degradation of exposed transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of PF74, IP<sub>6</sub> no longer had any effect. Taken together our observations suggest that IP<sub>6</sub> acts to stabilise capsids but that this stabilisation is not sufficient to prevent capsid failure induced by PF74. Nevertheless, in the absence of PF74, IP<sub>6</sub> potently stabilised capsid cores at much lower concentrations than ATP. At concentrations where ATP showed no measurable effect, IP<sub>6</sub> was able to maximally increase ERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Assembly cofactor IP<sub>6</sub> promotes ERT.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) IP<sub>6</sub> molecule, indicating the non-planar phosphate arrangement. (<bold>b</bold>) IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises capsid hexamers with a 1:1 stoichiometry.

Capsid cores are known to be unstable and uncoat after isolation. Consistent with this, addition of dNTPs after 24 hr incubation at room temperature resulted in little measurable ERT, in contrast to dNTP addition at time 0 which resulted in effective DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Experiments were carried out in the absence of nuclease, indicating that the absence of measured RT in pre-incubated samples reflects the inefficiency of transcription outside the capsid. Importantly, however, capsid cores that were incubated in the presence of IP<sub>6</sub> for 24 hr before the addition of dNTPs supported a similar level of RT as capsids that had not been subjected to temperature-induced uncoating. Together with the previous data, this suggests that IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises capsids both prior to and after RT. To investigate this further, we sought to define the intrinsic stability of an HIV capsid and how this is impacted by IP<sub>6</sub>. To accomplish this, we employed a newly developed single molecule assay described in detail in an accompanying report. In summary, this method involves tethering HIV virions to glass cover slips and permeabilizing their lipid envelope using a pore-forming toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Chimeric virions were used in which GFP is cleaved from Gag during maturation of the particle, resulting in GFP molecules packaged within the mature capsid. The uncoating kinetics of individual capsids was then determined by monitoring the loss of GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Uncoating, here defined as sufficient core opening to allow the escape of GFP molecules, occurs as a single rapid event at the single-particle level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). In the absence of IP6, we observed that HIV capsids are highly unstable and rapidly uncoat with a half-life of ~7 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–f</xref>). Remarkably, addition of even 1 µM IP<sub>6</sub> was sufficient to dramatically stabilise virions and increase their half-life well beyond an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). Increasing the concentration of IP<sub>6</sub> to 10 or 100 µM stabilised capsids so efficiently that too few virions uncoated during the timescale of the experiment for an accurate measurement of the half-life. However, estimates suggest that 10 or 100 µM IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises capsid for 5 or 10 hr, respectively.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises the HIV capsid both before and during DNA synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) IP<sub>6</sub>, dNTP, both or neither were added to capsid cores at the indicated time points and ERT measured at 48 hr in the absence of nuclease. IP<sub>6</sub> added at 0 hr maintains HIV capsid integrity sufficiently to allow ERT when dNTPs are added 24rs later.

To investigate this, we solved the structure of hexamer bound to IP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The electron density for the complex confirmed that IP<sub>6</sub> binds the R18 ring and six symmetry copies of IP<sub>6</sub> at partial occupancy were an excellent fit to the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This illustrates that IP<sub>6</sub> can bind in a number of alternate conformations, with the axial phosphate in different orientations. The N-terminal β-hairpin of the hexamer adopts a ‘closed’ conformation in the IP<sub>6</sub> complex, with IP<sub>6</sub> itself located within the central chamber, above the R18 ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Weak density was observed that may correspond to additional IP<sub>6</sub> molecules in the solvent channel below R18 but their inclusion did not improve the fit of the model to the data. Previous hexamer structures have shown that the R18 side-chain can adopt multiple alternative rotamer conformations. Two alternate R18 conformers are necessary in the IP<sub>6</sub> complex to prevent clashes with the ligand and maintain interaction. Despite the fact that IP<sub>6</sub> is not planar and does not bind parallel to the R18 ring, alternate R18 conformers allow each arginine within the hexamer the potential for hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions with a phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>). The structure therefore indicates that IP<sub>6</sub> is tightly bound by the R18 pore, would effectively neutralise the abundant positive charge and is likely to coordinate and maintain hexamer assembly.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35335.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>IP<sub>6</sub> binds the HIV capsid and coordinates all R18 pore guanidino groups.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) View of IP<sub>6</sub>:hexamer complex down the 6-fold symmetry axis. Secondary structure is colored by monomer.

It is synthesised from Inositol pentakisphosphate (IP<sub>5</sub>), which can reach similar concentrations. We therefore tested whether IP<sub>5</sub> or other precursor molecules are also capable of promoting ERT. DSF showed that other IP compounds, including IP<sub>5</sub> and also to a lesser extent IP<sub>4</sub>, were capable of stabilising capsid hexamers under assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Addition in ERT experiments at 1 µM concentration revealed a clearer distinction between IP compounds, with IP<sub>4</sub> unable to stabilise capsids and promote RT product accumulation in the presence of nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In contrast, IP<sub>5</sub> promoted encapsidated RT indistinguishably from IP<sub>6</sub>. Based on the above data, we hypothesised that IP<sub>5</sub> or IP<sub>6</sub> could be used by HIV in order to stabilise its capsid. IP<sub>5</sub> and IP<sub>6</sub> have previously been shown to catalyse the assembly of the immature lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that these molecules are recruited either during budding, in a producer cell, or following entry into a target cell. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we attempted to determine whether inositol phosphates are incorporated into HIV virions. We produced viruses from <sup>3</sup>H-inositol labelled cells and carefully purified budded viral particles by filtering and multiple centrifugal pelleting steps through sucrose. Virions were acid extracted and strong anion exchange chromatography (Sax-HPLC) was employed to resolve the inositol phosphate present in the virions and in the correspondent infected cell extracts. Scintillation counting of Sax-HPLC eluted fractions revealed the specific presence of IP<sub>6</sub> in HIV virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Importantly, the levels of IP<sub>6</sub> were enriched over those of IP<sub>5</sub>; indeed little IP<sub>5</sub> was detected despite the fact that it is present within cells at concentrations around 25% that of IP<sub>6</sub>. This suggests that it is IP<sub>6</sub> selectively incorporated into virions rather than from potential co-purifying microvesicles that is being measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bess et al., 1997</xref>). Subtilisin treatment is used to reduce microvesicle contamination in HIV-1 virion preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ott, 2009</xref>). To ensure that IP<sub>6</sub> detection is not from contaminating microvesicles, we repeated our experiments on subtilisin-treated samples. Subtilisin removed protein contaminants and abolished HIV-1 infectivity consistent with the digestion of envelope proteins, but did not reduce the levels of capsid protein or incorporated IP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, to directly demonstrate that IP<sub>6</sub> is associated with the capsid core rather than the viral membrane, we stripped the envelope from produced virions using the same triton-layer centrifugation method as employed to prepare cores for ERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shah and Aiken, 2011</xref>). Incorporation in capsid cores was compared to virions by calculating the scintillation counts for IP<sub>6</sub> per µg p24, as determined by ELISA. To confirm that our core prep has removed enveloped particles, we also compared the relative levels of inositol. Inositol is an osmolyte found in the cytosol at ~mM concentrations and is therefore only expected in samples derived from enveloped virions and microvesicles. Consistent with this, we observed loss of the inositol peak in the capsid only sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). However, we observed the same levels of IP<sub>6</sub> in both samples demonstrating that IP<sub>6</sub> is associated with the capsid core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). This result reinforces that measured IP<sub>6</sub> is not derived from microvesicles but is enriched into HIV-1 virions and bound to the capsid core. We calculated the number of IP<sub>6</sub> molecules per virion by determining the fraction of cellular IP<sub>6</sub> that is incorporated. Parallel analysis of the cell extracts by PAGE-based separation revealed that 0.8% of total IP<sub>6</sub> radioactivity was incorporated into the produced virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Losito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>).

The logic for requiring a compound such as IP<sub>6</sub> to stabilise the capsid is in part due to the presence of an otherwise repulsive charged structural feature (R18 in the mature capsid). However, if nullifying charge were the only reason for IP6 requirement, then it would be simpler to evolve these residues into apolar alternatives. Thus, using IP6 as a stabilising agent must confer benefits onto the HIV capsid that cannot be achieved by encoding stability via capsid residues alone. A central coordinating ligand like IP<sub>6</sub> allows proteins to be stabilised independently of a hydrophobic core or surface and has been used extensively in evolution, giving rise to motifs like the zinc-finger. Small molecule ligands are also highly effective at catalysing multimerisation, something of particular advantage to an assembling viral capsid. Examples where IP<sub>6</sub> has been exploited as a small molecule chaperone include HDAC co-repressor complexes, where it promotes stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase, where it induces transient dimerisation of the PH-TH module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A further attractive feature of using a small molecule ligand like IP<sub>6</sub> to drive self-assembly is that it provides an inbuilt mechanism of disassembly: ligand binding is reversible and so its dissociation can be used as a disassembly trigger.</p><p>Using IP<sub>6</sub> to stabilise the capsid therefore avoids a fundamental problem in capsid design, namely that the capsid must be strong enough to protect its cargo but not too strong that it can never be uncoated. Based on our data, we propose that IP<sub>6</sub> is the HIV equivalent of a picornavirus pocket factor, providing both stability and a mechanism to initiate uncoating. Pocket factors were originally described by Michael Rossmann, who observed a small molecule bound to the picornavirus capsid that he proposed stabilised it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hogle et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossmann et al., 1985</xref>). Pocket factors have subsequently been shown to stabilise picornavirus capsids until conformational changes induced by environmental cues during infection promote their dissociation and induce disassembly. We hypothesise that IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises the HIV capsid in the cytosol, until its release triggers uncoating. Known capsid cofactors could provide the cues to induce a conformational change and provoke dissociation of IP<sub>6</sub>. The dynamic N-terminal β-hairpin present in hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>) provides one possible mechanism; when closed IP<sub>6</sub> will be retained in the pore but when open it would be free to dissociate. Testing this mechanism will be a key goal of future study, as will determining the importance of IP<sub>6</sub> in post-entry HIV-1 infection.</p><p>While we propose that IP<sub>6</sub> serves as an HIV pocket factor, we cannot rule out that other cellular polyanions also play a role. For instance, although we observed no evidence for enrichment, ATP is highly abundant and was readily detected in virions. In our original discovery of the R18 pore and its importance in HIV RT and infection we postulated that it provided a channel to import nucleotides to drive ERT. The cellular data presented in that work is also consistent with the R18 pore being required to bind IP<sub>6</sub> in order to stabilise the capsid during its transit through the cytosol. Further experiments are needed to dissect the relative importance of the R18 pore in attracting nucleotides for RT versus binding IP<sub>6</sub> for capsid stabilisation. The fact that high concentrations of either ATP or IP<sub>6</sub>, which would be competitors with dNTPs for pore binding, increase rather than decrease ERT efficiency argues against the R18 pore being essential for nucleotide import. However, as there is a multi-log increase in accumulated viral DNA as a result of capsid stabilisation by polyanions this could mask any decline due to reduced nucleotide import. Capsid permeability is not well understood, but the experiments presented here comparing inhibition by NRTIs and NNRTIs in ERT versus cellular infection suggest that either their efficiency of entry into the capsid is similar – and that interaction with the R18 ring is therefore not essential - or that this is not a limiting step. Either way, this indicates that small molecules not bound by the R18 ring can still enter the capsid through the pore, or through solvent channels as has previously been proposed.</p><p>Importantly, as mature hexamers form only after budding, they cannot be responsible for recruiting polyanions such as IP<sub>6</sub> into the virion. Of note, IP<sub>6</sub> has previously been shown to catalyse immature lattice assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting it has a role in the formation and maturation of capsid during viral production. In the immature hexamer, there are two lysine rings (K227 and K158; equivalent to Gag residues 359 and 290) that are analogous to the R18 ring we have described in the mature hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that it is these lysine rings that are responsible for the specific recruitment of IP<sub>6</sub> into virions, where it drives immature lattice assembly. Upon protease cleavage and maturation, the six-helix bundle and lysine rings will be lost, making IP<sub>6</sub> available to bind the R18 pore in mature hexamers and promote mature lattice formation. Thus, we propose that HIV capitalises on a readily available cellular polyanion to catalyse the assembly of immature and mature lattices, promote their stability and regulate the uncoating of capsid in newly infected cells. The identification of the inositol phosphate IP<sub>6</sub> in HIV virions and its role in imparting onto the capsid a property of metastability provides a new dependence to be exploited in antiviral development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>The CA N-terminal domain and the disulfide-stabilised CA hexamer were expressed and purified as previously described, briefly: p24 capsid protein was disassembled in Tris (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (40 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (20 mM), then reassembled in Tris (pH 8.0, 50 mM), NaCl (1 M), 2-mercaptoethanol (20 mM).

Images were analysed with software written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.). Fluorescence intensity traces were calculated for each viral particle in the field of view by integrating the fluorescence intensity in a 7 × 7 pixel region. Membrane permeabilisation was detected as a rapid drop in the signal resulting from the release of GFP contained in the viral particle in the volume outside the capsid (not shown). This step mimics viral fusion in that the capsid is exposed to the surrounding medium and was defined as time zero for measuring capsid opening. Particles with intact cores were identified as those with residual GFP signal after permeabilisation, arising from GFP molecules trapped inside the closed capsid.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wes Sundquist as the Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hans-Georg Kräusslich.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Mallery et al. use a combination of biochemical and biophysical experiments to demonstrate that small polyanionic small molecules (e.g. (d)NTPs and, in particular, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>)) bind within a positively charged ring in each CA hexamers that comprise the capsid lattice. The authors demonstrate that the functional consequence of these capsid-small molecule interactions is to stabilize the hexamer and consequently the mature capsid lattice in a dose-dependent fashion. This increase in core stability favors encapsidated reverse transcription (ERT), and the authors demonstrate that the observed increase in ERT is a consequence of increased capsid stability, with no secondary effects on the reverse transcriptase enzyme itself. The effects are most pronounced with IP<sub>6</sub> – a molecule previously shown to promote the formation of native-like immature HIV-1 Gag particles in vitro. The authors find that IP<sub>6</sub>, as well as the IP4 and IP5 analogs, can stabilize capsid hexamers and promote ERT to varying degrees. Only IP<sub>6</sub>, however, is shown to be incorporated into virions, and the authors show directly that IP<sub>6</sub> associates with the capsid, consistent with their biochemical and structural analyses.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting and potentially important manuscript that identifies IP<sub>6</sub> as a capsid stabilization factor and sheds light on HIV-1 capsid stability and uncoating. The convincing demonstration that IP<sub>6</sub> binds the capsid hexamer pore and stabilizes the capsid at low concentrations, thereby enhancing endogenous reverse transcription is an important one, with significant implications for the HIV post-entry phase, although there remain some questions about the different role(s) of the pore in binding and passing different poly-charged anions (e.g., dNTPs vs. ATP vs. IP<sub>6</sub>).</p><p>Some issues remain to be addressed before publication.</p><p>Significant issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors have not carefully documented the purity of their virus preparations, and it is well known that cells produce microvesicles of similar size and density as HIV-1. Though Figure 7C includes a control (please indicate exactly what this is: one assumes supernatant of uninfected cells, though this information seems to be lacking), HIV-1 infection could stimulate microvesicle production. It therefore is important to demonstrate virus prep purity experimentally. For example, the authors should include subtilisin treatment in at least one of the relevant experiments (if this has not already been done). The subtilisin protease treatment protocol was developed to destroy contaminating microvesicles, and therefore is a gold standard for addressing virion incorporation (and of course it also digests surface viral proteins, but leaves the virions and core proteins intact).</p><p>The issue of virion purity is of particular importance in the report of levels of IP<sub>6</sub> in the virion. This is an important number and should not be published without better evidence for virion purity.</p><p>2) ATP and non-hydrolysable analogs are also shown to stabilize the CA hexamer and stimulate ERT, though in Figure 4D authors importantly show that IP<sub>6</sub> stimulates at much lower concentrations than ATP. However, if ATP is present in cells at much higher concentration, could it be that ATP, not IP<sub>6</sub>, is the more relevant capsid stabilization factor and pocket binding factor? Is ATP incorporated into virus? If so, at what level (an absolute number isn't essential, but it would be useful to understand whether ATP can be a relevant pocket factor)?</p><p>3) In Jacques 2016, the authors concluded that R18 residues at the CA hexamer vertex bind dNTPs and act as pores that selectively incorporate RT dNTP substrates into the capsid. These results met with some skepticism because, prior to the paper, the field assumed that small molecules such as drugs or NTPs freely diffuse, while larger molecules such as proteins required some degree of CA uncoating to access the core. The authors now importantly show that NNRTIs do not interact with the R18 CA pore, and suggest that &quot;NNRTIs are sufficiently small to pass through the pore and so may enter by simple diffusion.&quot; This statement seems puzzling in light of the fact that RVP (studied here), is 366 daltons, dCTP is 467 Da and the NNRTI etavirine (not studied here), is 435 Da. It seems hard to believe that the difference between 467 and 435 d dictates active import vs. passive diffusion. It now seems more likely that the R18 pore is a promiscuous docking site for molecules of appropriate sized and charge, and that the primary biological role of such interactions is to regulate capsid stability (as implied in the current study), rather than to mediate selective transport. The authors should discuss these issues explicitly and explain their current thinking.</p><p>4) Given the focus on capsid stability and the fact that the HIV-1 capsid has a very distinctive morphology, it is surprising that the authors have not included any EM images in their report. While detailed analyses of core completeness requires cryo-electron tomography (and is therefore probably beyond the current studies), good indications of core integrity, purity, and alterations with time should be visualized using negative stain EM.</p><p>5) The authors generally use +/-DNase treatment in their ERT reactions and show that DNase treatment is required to see clear effects (consistent with the idea that RT is occurring within intact capsids). In the absence of DNase treatment, greater levels of &quot;background&quot; DNA synthesis are observed and therefore the effects of capsid stabilizers are relatively minor in the absence of DNase. Why then is the experiment in Figure 5A done without DNase, and why isn't &quot;background&quot; RT observed in this case?</p><p>Other issues for the author's consideration:</p><p>1) In the subsection “Inositol phosphate IP<sub>6</sub> stabilises capsid hexamers and promotes DNA accumulation during RT”, the conclusion 'to a significantly different degree' would be bolstered by including ATP in the experiment.</p><p>2) The Gag polyprotein should be written with a capital G.</p><p>3) Descriptions of reagents and methods are often very terse and should be expanded to the point where others could repeat the experiments.

Though Figure 7C includes a control (please indicate exactly what this is: one assumes supernatant of uninfected cells, though this information seems to be lacking), HIV-1 infection could stimulate microvesicle production. It therefore is important to demonstrate virus prep purity experimentally. For example, the authors should include subtilisin treatment in at least one of the relevant experiments (if this has not already been done). The subtilisin protease treatment protocol was developed to destroy contaminating microvesicles, and therefore is a gold standard for addressing virion incorporation (and of course it also digests surface viral proteins, but leaves the virions and core proteins intact).</p><p>The issue of virion purity is of particular importance in the report of levels of IP<sub>6</sub> in the virion. This is an important number and should not be published without better evidence for virion purity.</p></disp-quote><p>The control in Figure 7C is as assumed above and we have introduced a clarifying sentence into the legend to make this clear. We are grateful for the suggestion to use subtilisin treatment as a way of improving viral prep purity and addressing the issue of microvesicle contamination. In our revised manuscript, we present data on subtilisin treated virions, following the established protocol by Ott. Importantly, we verified that treatment reduced contamination by SDS PAGE and that it acted on membrane associated protein by performing infection experiments. This new data is collated in Extended Data Figure 7. We agree that the issue of virion purity is most important to our IP<sub>6</sub> incorporation data and have therefore repeated our tritiated inositol experiments using subtilisin treated virions. This new data has been added as Figure 7D and shows that measured IP<sub>6</sub> is present in samples treated to remove contaminating microvesicles. This is consistent with the fact that we measure little IP5 in samples despite the fact that it is present in cells at concentrations ~ 25% those of IP<sub>6</sub> and supports the notion that IP<sub>6</sub> is selectively enriched within virions. The new subtilisin data also agrees very well with the data in Figure 7F, which shows that the IP<sub>6</sub> in virions is associated with the capsid core. This data was obtained measuring the IP<sub>6</sub> in purified capsids cores that have been stripped of membrane contaminants using triton. Taken together we believe this provides excellent evidence that IP<sub>6</sub> is associated with the capsid in viral particles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ATP and non-hydrolysable analogs are also shown to stabilize the CA hexamer and stimulate ERT, though in Figure 4D authors importantly show that IP<sub>6</sub> stimulates at much lower concentrations than ATP. However, if ATP is present in cells at much higher concentration, could it be that ATP, not IP<sub>6</sub>, is the more relevant capsid stabilization factor and pocket binding factor? Is ATP incorporated into virus? If so, at what level (an absolute number isn't essential, but it would be useful to understand whether ATP can be a relevant pocket factor)?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion and have now tested for ATP incorporation. Using a luciferase assay that is sensitive to concentrations of 1 nM ATP, we show that ATP is present in HIV-1 virions. An approximate calculation suggests that the concentration in virions is similar to that in the producer 293T cells, which we measured in the same assay. This new data has been incorporated in Figure 2G.</p><p>We agree that it is possible that ATP is a capsid stabilization factor and to acknowledge this more clearly in the manuscript we have inserted the following into the Discussion:</p><p>“While we propose that IP<sub>6</sub> serves as an HIV pocket factor we cannot rule out that other cellular polyanions also play a role. For instance, although we observed no evidence for enrichment, ATP is highly abundant and was readily detected in virions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Jacques 2016, the authors concluded that R18 residues at the CA hexamer vertex bind dNTPs and act as pores that selectively incorporate RT dNTP substrates into the capsid. These results met with some skepticism because, prior to the paper, the field assumed that small molecules such as drugs or NTPs freely diffuse, while larger molecules such as proteins required some degree of CA uncoating to access the core. The authors now importantly show that NNRTIs do not interact with the R18 CA pore, and suggest that &quot;NNRTIs are sufficiently small to pass through the pore and so may enter by simple diffusion.&quot; This statement seems puzzling in light of the fact that RVP (studied here), is 366 daltons, dCTP is 467 Da and the NNRTI etavirine (not studied here), is 435 Da. It seems hard to believe that the difference between 467 and 435 d dictates active import vs. passive diffusion. It now seems more likely that the R18 pore is a promiscuous docking site for molecules of appropriate sized and charge, and that the primary biological role of such interactions is to regulate capsid stability (as implied in the current study), rather than to mediate selective transport. The authors should discuss these issues explicitly and explain their current thinking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have inserted the following section into the Discussion:</p><p>“In our original discovery of the R18 pore and its importance in HIV reverse transcription and infection we postulated that it provided a channel to import nucleotides to drive ERT. […] Either way, this indicates that small molecules not bound by the R18 ring can still enter the capsid through the pore, or through solvent channels as has previously been proposed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the focus on capsid stability and the fact that the HIV-1 capsid has a very distinctive morphology, it is surprising that the authors have not included any EM images in their report. While detailed analyses of core completeness requires cryo-electron tomography (and is therefore probably beyond the current studies), good indications of core integrity, purity, and alterations with time should be visualized using negative stain EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include electron microscopy in our original study as it is not a method we have expertise in and because we felt that our single molecule approach would allow better quantification of capsid stability in a time and condition dependent manner. However, with the help of experienced colleagues in our institute we have now carried out negative stain experiments to visualize cores in our samples. Importantly, these EM experiments were carried out using capsid cores that were prepared using the same triton spin-through method we use to generate material for our encapsidated reverse transcription (ERT) and IP<sub>6</sub> incorporation assays. These new data are presented in Figure 2A and show that there are intact cores with the expected morphology in our samples. In order to concentrate samples sufficiently for visualization, cores were pelleted by centrifugation. This process does damage cores to some degree as we observe a loss of efficiency in ERT when using pelleted samples. We also observed considerable variation between grids and have therefore not attempted to use this approach to quantify capsid integrity under different conditions and timepoints as we have done using our single molecule experiments. Nevertheless, this new EM data demonstrates the presence of capsid cores with the expected morphology in our preparations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors generally use +/-DNase treatment in their ERT reactions and show that DNase treatment is required to see clear effects (consistent with the idea that RT is occurring within intact capsids). In the absence of DNase treatment, greater levels of &quot;background&quot; DNA synthesis are observed and therefore the effects of capsid stabilizers are relatively minor in the absence of DNase. Why then is the experiment in Figure 5A done without DNase, and why isn't &quot;background&quot; RT observed in this case?</p></disp-quote><p>Experiment 5A was carried out without DNase in order to test the stabilizing effect of IP<sub>6</sub><italic>prior</italic> to reverse transcription (RT). Nuclease is required to remove RT products from outside the virion once they have formed, whereas we reasoned that capsids that have fallen apart prior to addition of nucleotides will not support DNA synthesis because RT enzyme and template will be diluted into bulk solvent. This is supported by the data, which shows that cores incubated for 24hrs prior to nucleotide addition are no longer capable of RT whereas cores that are given IP<sub>6</sub> are. As nuclease was not required for the experiment it was not necessary to add it, moreover the resulting data provided a measurement of core stability that was not dependent upon nuclease addition. Background RT is observed in Figure 5A and is similar to the background in our other experiments (e.g. Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues for the author's consideration:</p><p>1) In the subsection “Inositol phosphate IP6 stabilises capsid hexamers and promotes DNA accumulation during RT”, the conclusion 'to a significantly different degree' would be bolstered by including ATP in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a side-by-side comparison and included this as a new figure panel (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Gag polyprotein should be written with a capital G.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Descriptions of reagents and methods are often very terse and should be expanded to the point where others could repeat the experiments.
