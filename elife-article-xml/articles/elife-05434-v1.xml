IRE1 also has an endoribonuclease activity, which initiates a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction, while PERK phosphorylates eIF2α. We engineered a potent small molecule, IPA, that binds to IRE1's ATP-binding pocket and predisposes the kinase domain to oligomerization, activating its RNase. IPA also inhibits PERK but, paradoxically, activates it at low concentrations, resulting in a bell-shaped activation profile. We reconstituted IPA-activation of PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation from purified components. We estimate that under conditions of maximal activation less than 15% of PERK molecules in the reaction are occupied by IPA. We propose that IPA binding biases the PERK kinase towards its active conformation, which <italic>trans</italic>-activates apo-PERK molecules. The mechanism by which partial occupancy with an inhibitor can activate kinases may be wide-spread and carries major implications for design and therapeutic application of kinase inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05434.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05434.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05434.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain thousands of proteins that carry out the essential tasks needed for survival. Before they can work, proteins must first fold into specific three-dimensional shapes. The endoplasmic reticulum, a cellular compartment that specializes in properly folding newly made proteins into their native states, is critical for this protein maturation process. If folding-enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum are not properly balanced with the load of proteins they must fold, the endoplasmic reticulum can be overwhelmed with unfolded proteins that accumulate, leading to ‘endoplasmic reticulum stress’.</p><p>The cell copes with endoplasmic reticulum stress by triggering the ‘unfolded protein response’ (UPR). This response helps to clear the unfolded proteins by increasing the size of the endoplasmic reticulum and the concentration of folding enzymes within it, and by decreasing the influx of newly made protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR engages signaling molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, among them two signaling enzymes called IRE1 and PERK. Drugs that activate these signaling enzymes could help the cell to deal with unfolded proteins, prevent toxicity resulting from endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ward off the diseases that result from it.</p><p>Mendez, Alfaro, Morales-Soto et al. developed a small molecule, called IPA (short for <underline>I</underline>RE1/<underline>P</underline>ERK <underline>A</underline>ctivator), that was designed to bind to and activate IRE1. Serendipitously, IPA not only activated IRE1 but also activated PERK. Surprisingly, PERK activation was only observed at low IPA concentrations in which IPA occupied the active sites in only a few PERK molecules, whereas at higher concentrations and full occupancy IPA completely inhibited PERK. Mendez, Alfaro, Morales-Soto et al. proposed that, under conditions of partial IPA occupancy, a minority of IPA-bound PERK molecules assume an activated state that propagates to adjacent PERK molecules that have no IPA bound to them, and activates them.</p><p>Similar dose-dependent activation was previously observed for a clinically used drug designed to inhibit a similar signaling enzyme that is important in cancer progression. Together with the observations of Mendez, Alfaro, Morales-Soto et al., these results suggest that research into similar treatments must consider that a ‘minimal dose’ can exist, below which drugs may have the opposite effect to what is desired. Further work is still needed to fully understand the mechanisms that produce such behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05434.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05434.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>human cell</kwd><kwd>IPA</kwd><kwd>IRE1</kwd><kwd>PERK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernales</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Shokat</surname><given-names>Kevan M</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigators</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shokat</surname><given-names>Kevan M</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A rationally designed small molecule ATP-mimetic activates IRE1 and PERK signaling in cells by inducing conformational changes that template the assembly of higher-order enzymatically active structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Roughly 30% of all proteins encoded in eukaryotes pass through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded, modified, and assembled, before they are delivered to the plasma membrane, the outside of the cell, or to various way-stations in the secretory and endocytic pathways. To ascertain fidelity during protein maturation, ER-resident unfolded protein sensors continuously monitor the folding status in the ER lumen. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced when the protein folding capacity of the ER is surpassed, triggering the activation of three transmembrane sensors/signal transducers, IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), PERK (protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6). Two of the sensors, IRE1 and PERK, are protein kinases that are amenable to modulation by small molecule ATP-mimetics.</p><p>IRE1is the most conserved of these proteins. It contains an ER-lumenal sensor domain that is activated by binding directly to unfolded polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Credle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). As a result, IRE1 oligomerizes, activating its cytosolic kinase and endoribonuclease domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sidrauski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>). IRE1's RNase domain initiates a non-conventional splicing reaction that results in the excision of an intron from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1. XBP1 produced from the spliced mRNA drives transcription of UPR target genes to remedy ER stress. The luminal domain of PERK is homologous to that of IRE1 and thus its activation is presumably also driven by direct binding to unfolded polypetides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). Active PERK phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harding et al., 1999</xref>), leading to trapping eIF2α in its GDP-bound inactive state, blocks eIF2α recycling. As a result, global protein synthesis is attenuated, while a few mRNAs, including that encoding the transcription factor ATF4, are preferentially translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wek et al., 2006</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p><p>Recent chemical genetic work in our laboratories revealed that phospho-transfer by Ire1's kinase domain can be bypassed using an ATP mimetic (1NM-PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Papa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rubio et al., 2011</xref>). Starting with studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we showed that Ire1's RNase modality can be activated using a small molecule ATP mimetic (1NM-PP1), when used in conjunction with a mutant form of Ire1 (‘IRE1-as’ for <underline>a</underline>nalog <underline>s</underline>ensitized) that allows 1NM-PP1 to bind to the ATP-binding site of IRE1's kinase domain. Subsequent work showed that the RNase activity of wild-type Ire1 can too be activated pharmacologically with the broad-acting kinase inhibitors APY29 and Sunitinib in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). The crystal structure of the Ire1 kinase/RNase domains bound to APY29, combined with biophysical and enzyme kinetic analyses, showed that binding of ATP-mimetic ligands to Ire1's active kinase site predisposes the enzyme to oligomerization, which activates its RNase activity.</p><p>Ligand binding to the ATP binding pocket in IRE1's kinase domain, however, does not always result in oligomerization and RNase activation. Rather, activation requires that IRE1's kinase domain is in its <italic>active</italic> conformational state, characterized by the inward positioning of the αC helix and the DFG-loop in the kinase active site (DFG/αC-in conformation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korennykh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korennykh and Walter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanches et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, ATP-mimetic ligands that trap IRE1's kinase domain in the inactive, DFG/αC-out conformation act as inhibitors, rather than activators, of IRE1 oligomerization and signaling via its RNase domain. Because RNase activation can occur in the absence of a phospho-transfer reaction, IRE1 is unique in that it is possible to monitor the functional consequences of conformational changes in the kinase domain induced by ligand occupancy of the ATP-binding site without concerns of losing the kinase activity.</p><p>The model depicting IRE1's kinase domain as a switch that becomes trapped in two states (DFG/αC-in and DFG/αC-out) depending on the ligand bound to its active site is an over-simplification. Different ligands yield different plateaus of maximal oligomerization and RNase activation, even when saturating the active site. This seemingly perplexing property is reconciled by the model in which different ligands predispose IRE1's kinase domain to populate the DFG/αC-in and DFG/αC-out states to different degrees; a strong IRE1 RNase activator would stabilize the DFG/αC-in state, whereas a weaker one would bias the IRE1 molecules in the population towards the DGF/αC-in state, without completely trapping them in this state. The reverse would be true for IRE1 RNase inhibitors, which would bias IRE1's kinase domain towards the DFG/αC-out state.</p><p>To date, models of IRE1 activation have largely been derived from in vitro characterizations that lack in vivo confirmation, as the available tools were non-selective (and hence overtly toxic) to test in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, while 1NM-PP1 predisposes IRE1-as towards activation, it proved insufficient to activate IRE1 in cells in the absence of ER stress (which vastly concentrates IRE1 by virtue of oligomerization of the lumenal domain) or over-expression. Here, we describe the development of a novel small molecule, IPA, as the lead compound of a series of second-generation IRE1 activators. Surprisingly, IPA activates not only IRE1's RNase, but also PERK signaling but, by contrast to its ability to activate IRE1, only at low concentrations. We propose that PERK activation results from ligand-induced conformational changes in a small percentage of the molecules in the population that then interact with and activate PERK molecules that contain an empty active site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of small molecule activators of IRE1α</title><p>Recent work identified an ATP mimetic that activates mammalian IRE1α's RNase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanches et al., 2014</xref>).

We reasoned that (1) the cyclopropyl substituent on the pyrazole ring, which binds to the gatekeeper pocket in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ire1 structure, would be a key determinant of human IRE1α binding, (2) interactions of the hinge-binding element of the APY29 scaffold would be essential to stabilizing IRE1α's kinase domain in a conformation leading to RNase activation, and (3) the pyrimidine ring, which occupies the adenine pocket in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> structure, would provide an appropriate space filling moiety that further enhances affinity to the ATP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Each member of the panel was tested in an RNase activity assay using recombinant IRE1α-KR43 and a labeled short hairpin RNA substrate derived from human <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA. IRE1α-KR43 comprises the soluble cytoplasmic portion of IRE1α, composed of the kinase and RNase domains plus 43 amino acids of the linker that bridges the kinase to its transmembrane domain.</p><p>As expected from the chemical design strategy, we produced a series of IRE1α RNase activators. We observed that compounds bearing <italic>m</italic>-trifluoromethyl, <italic>p</italic>-methyl, <italic>p-</italic>ethyl, <italic>m-</italic>metoxy, and <italic>p-</italic>methoxy groups on the terminal phenyl ring (<bold>cmp1</bold>, <bold>cmp2</bold>, <bold>cmp3</bold>, <bold>cmp4</bold>, and <bold>cmp5</bold>) activated IRE1α-KR43 activity 10–100-fold under assay conditions, as compared to fivefold by the parent compound APY29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results were surprising, because the presence of an <italic>m-</italic>trifluoromethyl group was previously shown to be important to retain activity of related kinase inhibitors but, as shown here, is not essential for activation of IRE1α-KR43. We were also surprised that the activity was improved further by the presence of a <italic>p-</italic>substituted thioether group and, similarly albeit weaker, by the presence of a <italic>p-</italic>iodo group (<bold>cmp6</bold> and <bold>cmp7</bold>, 900-fold RNase activation under assay conditions). We conclude that IRE1α prefers a substituent with polarizable character at the <italic>para-</italic>position of the terminal phenyl ring, perhaps indicating that the ring occupies a hydrophobic region in IRE1α's active site. Increasing bulkiness at the <italic>para-</italic>position resulted in decreased activities (<bold>cmp8</bold>, <bold>cmp9</bold>, and <bold>cmp10</bold>), suggesting that the size of this pocket must be limited.</p><p>We decided to further characterize compound <bold>cmp6</bold>, based on its robust activation properties. Henceforth, we refer to <bold>cmp6</bold> as IPA (for <underline>I</underline>RE1/<underline>P</underline>ERK <underline>A</underline>ctivator) for reasons to be discussed below. To validate that binding of IPA to IRE1α's kinase domain is critical for IRE1α RNase activation, we generated a control compound, IPAx. In IPAx, the pyrazole ring bears an additional N1-methyl group that is predicted to sterically interfere with binding to the gatekeeper pocket in IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, when assayed for activation of IRE1α RNase activity, IPAx was inactive showing an indistinguishable effect from the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>ATP mimetics, such as APY29, induce IRE1α-KR43 oligomerization, which in turn activates the RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korennykh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). To assess whether IPA acts through a corresponding mechanism, we measured RNase activity as a function of enzyme concentration in the presence of saturating compound concentrations (20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When no activator was added, apo-IRE1α–KR43 RNase activity, measured as k<sub>obs</sub> under single-turnover conditions, increased sharply with increasing enzyme concentration, reaching ½ k<sub>max, obs</sub> at 8 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, purple circles). The measured Hill coefficient of the activation was n = 3.3, indicating that, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>), enzymatic activation parallels oligomerization. By contrast, in the presence of <bold>cmp1</bold> or IPA, IRE1α–KR43 RNase activity reached ½ k<sub>max, obs</sub> at 3- and 20-fold lower enzyme concentrations, respectively (½ k<sub>max, obs</sub> = 3 μM and 0.43 μM; and n = 3.8 and 4.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red and blue circles), indicating that <bold>cmp1</bold> and IPA binding significantly predispose IRE1α–KR43 to oligomerization and activation. By contrast, addition of IPAx did not enhance IRE1α activation, showing activation kinetics that were in all respects indistinguishable from the no-compound control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, pink circles), consistent with its inability to bind to IRE1α-KR43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Kinome-wide screening of <bold>cmp1</bold> and IPA demonstrated a dramatic improvement of selectivity for both molecules when compared to APY24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a close analog of APY29, containing the same core-scaffold. In this assay, compounds were screened at a fixed concentration of 1 μM against a panel of 266 kinases, and the number of those inhibited by ≥ 80% was scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also included in the analysis several bench-mark inhibitors, such as the promiscuous natural product staurosporine (STS) and several clinically approved kinase inhibitors.

In the presence of doxycycline, IRE1α-GFP was expressed and localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As previously described, Tm rapidly induced the relocalization of IRE1α-GFP into discrete foci, indicative of IRE1α oligomerization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the foci dissolved by 8 hr of treatment as cells attenuated IRE1α signaling even in the presence of unmitigated ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, IPA caused relocalization of IRE1α-GFP into foci, consistent with sustained IRE1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lower panels). While Tm-induced foci became larger and fewer over time as previously observed, IPA-induced foci remained small and numerous. Interestingly, IPA-induced foci remained stable even at late time points, consistent with the results obtained for <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results suggest that IPA-binding to IRE1α stabilizes IRE1α's oligomeric state, interfering with its attenuation.</p><p>We next tested the effect of IPA on cell viability. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, IPA killed cells with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 0.82 μM. This strong toxicity was surprising considering that previous studies have shown that IRE1α has a cytoprotective role and that IRE1α knock-out cells are viable. The result therefore is best explained by a possible off-target effect connected to ER stress, likely to be mediated through another kinase in the cell. Moreover, as the interplay between the different UPR branches controls the switch over from cytoprotection to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), we next probed for possible effect of IPA on PERK and ATF6 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In vivo effects of IPA on the ATF6 and PERK UPR branches</title><p>To assess the effects of IPA on the activity of the two other UPR branches, we first examined activation of ATF6.

Unexpectedly, we observed that IPA also induced a shift in the mobility of PERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 2–4). This shift, however, was only observed at low-to-intermediate concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 µM), whereas at higher concentrations (2 and 4 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), PERK phosphorylation was severely diminished or not detectable. We also monitored PERK activation by phosphorylation of eIF2α, detected with a phospho-eIF2α-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

By contrast, equivalent concentrations of IPAx did not stimulate PERK or eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 3).</p><p>PERK activation by IPA could be due to direct binding of IPA to PERK, or it could be caused by indirect activation of PERK by IRE1.

Indeed, when we incubated HEK293T cells with IPA in the low concentration range where PERK becomes activated, incorporation of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine into newly synthesized proteins was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 3 and 5), consistent with translation attenuation.

This pharmacological manipulation therefore allowed us to experimentally uncouple IPA-induced IRE1α and PERK activation. In particular, we were interested in testing whether the unexpected toxicity of IPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) could, at last in part, be explained by PERK activation, which is known to induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). To explore this notion, we tested cell viability at increasing IPA concentrations in the presence GSK. GSK inhibits PERK in cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 200 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>) and shows no cell toxicity at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As a further control, we tested whether GSK would also rescue cells treated with STS, a rather pleiotropic kinase inhibitor.

To this end, the cytosolic portion of PERK was dephosphorylated and then proteolytically severed and chromatographically separated from its glutathione S-transferase tag, known to promote-constitutive multimerization. The resulting PERK cytosolic fragment was responsive to activation, by contrast to the constitutively active, phosphorylated PERK-GST fusion protein assayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, we observed a large increase in the rate of PERK phosphorylation of eIF2α, which peaked at 0.5 μM IPA (3.2-fold increase over DMSO control) and then declined at higher IPA concentrations, whereas IPAx had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).

Based on the co-crystal structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ire1 with APY29, we developed a series of new small molecule activators, including IPA. We showed that IPA is a strong activator of IRE1α signaling in vitro, by trapping IRE1α's kinase domain in its active (DFG/αC-in) conformation, which promotes IRE1 oligomerization. In the oligomer, IRE1's RNase becomes activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>), offering the unique opportunity to read-out the conformational status of a kinase domain in the absence of phospho-transfer. Conversely, a compound, AD60, that traps IRE1's kinase domain in its inactive (DFG/αC-out) conformation acts as an inhibitor of IRE1 signaling. Our studies confirm in mammalian cells that IRE1's kinase domain acts as a conformational switch, in which ligand binding to the ATP binding pocket—rather than enzymatic phospho-transfer—controls activity and down-stream signal transduction events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korennykh et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To rule out that IPA exerts its IRE1 activating activity by causing general ER stress, we explored its effects on the two other branches of the UPR that signal through ATF6 and PERK. Unexpectedly, we discovered that IPA also activated PERK. By contrast to IRE1 however, for which IPA drives activation in vitro and in vivo as IPA concentrations were increased, PERK activation displayed a bell-shaped dose response: PERK was <italic>activated</italic> at low IPA concentrations while being <italic>inhibited</italic> at higher ones.</p><p>The paradoxical activation of kinase signaling by kinase inhibitors was first noted for Raf kinase inhibitors almost 15 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall-Jackson et al., 1999</xref>). The observation of kinase activation in patients undergoing Raf inhibitor (vemurafenib) clinical trials then led to an intense investigation of the cellular basis for the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poulikakos et al., 2010</xref>). Current models suggest that drug-induced dimerization of Raf causes an increase in Raf kinase activity. This contention is supported by apo- and drug-kinase complex crystal structures, which show Raf dimers in the asymmetric crystal unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rajakulendran et al., 2009</xref>). Other models have been proposed that Raf inhibitor-induced Raf activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holderfield et al., 2013</xref>), and, to date, the critical prediction of the model that the Raf kinase inhibitor vemurafenib should induce Raf kinase activity in a purified system has resisted all attempts at biochemical reconstitution. This paucity in direct experimental access has forced mechanistic studies of inhibitor-induced activation to be carried out in cells, where the effects of the many components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway are necessarily confounding. Our work with the reconstitution of PERK's paradoxical activation by IPA shows for the first time that no other components of the kinase pathway are necessary and that inhibitor binding is sufficient for activation through the formation of homo-dimers or higher-ordered homo-oligomers. It was previously suggested that PERK activation is depended upon dimerization and the formation of higher-ordered oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This behavior can be explained in a model in which ligand binding to a few kinase molecules biases them towards the DFG/αC-in conformation that nucleates assembly with apo-kinases, enabling their <italic>trans</italic>-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korennykh and Walter, 2012</xref>). Assuming a K<sub>d</sub> of 2.8 μM for IPA-binding to PERK as determined by PERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we estimate that approximately 15% of the PERK molecules are occupied by IPA under assay conditions that yield maximal activation. Since PERK•IPA triggered activation of unoccupied apo-PERK molecules would bias their conformation towards the active state and hence is likely to enhance their affinity for the inhibitor, the estimate of IPA-occupancy in the population defines an upper limit. This back-of-the-envelope calculation therefore suggests that PERK may form oligomers larger than dimers, in which one PERK•IPA may suffice to activate more than one apo-PERK. At low concentrations of IPA, heterodimers of PERK•IPA/PERK<sup>apo</sup>, or perhaps larger oligomers of PERK•IPA/[PERK<sup>apo</sup>]<sub>n</sub>, where all PERK molecules are in the active DFG/αC-in conformation, are active in phospho-transfer. At higher, saturating IPA doses, all PERK molecules would be occupied by IPA and thus inhibited through competition with ATP binding.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05434.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for PERK activation.</title><p>The mechanism of PERK activation suggests that at low concentrations of IPA PERK protein is hyper activated presumably through movements of the (DFG/αC-in).

This mode of kinase regulation, now documented for two different protein kinases, may be more widespread than currently appreciated. Indeed, we observed a small amount of activation of eIF2α phosphorylation in PERK<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lane 6), indicating that at least one of the other known eIF2α kinases (GCN2, HRI, and PKR) may be similarly regulated. Kinase activation by partial occupancy of the active site, therefore, may be an important consideration in dosing kinase inhibitors for therapeutic applications, imposing a ‘minimal tolerable dose’ below which potential drugs may exert detrimental effects that oppose the desired therapy. This dangerous scenario may result from many kinase inhibitors that bind and stabilize kinases in the DFG/αC-in conformation.</p><p>Based on the observation that ATF6 was not activated in cells treated with IPA, we conclude that IPA-mediated activation of IRE1 and PERK occurred in the absence of ER stress. This property contrasts with that of the previously described activator 1NM-PP1, which binds in the ATP binding pocket to IRE1-as, the cognate, analog-sensitized allele. Activation of IRE1-as by 1NM-PP1 requires the additional induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), or overproduction of IRE1-as driving IRE1-as oligomerization by mass action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). IPA therefore presents a unique pharmacological tool with which activation of wild-type IRE1 can be studied in living cells directly in the absence of ER stress.</p><p>The select application of combinations of UPR modulators has allowed us to begin dissecting the individual contributions of the signaling branches of the UPR. In particular, we have shown that the lethality that IPA displays at high doses can be partially overcome if the PERK pathway is inactivated using a selective PERK inhibitor, GSK, increasing the EC<sub>50</sub> with which IPA drives cells into apoptosis by about an order of magnitude. This observation is consistent with the proposed roles of both the IRE1 and PERK branches, providing cytoprotective and pro-apoptotic outputs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, AD60, as a DFG-out kinase inhibitor, reversed the effects of IPA on IRE1. IPA, AD60, and other compounds developed to date therefore provide a stepping-stone towards developing novel methodologies for the selective pharmacological tuning of the UPR. Diseases, such as multiple myeloma, a cancer of highly secretory plasma cells where the UPR is thought to play a major cytoprotective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrasco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leung-Hagesteijn et al., 2013</xref>), or triple-negative breast cancer, in which high XBP1 activity has been correlated with poor patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), have exposed the potential significance of targeting the UPR in cancers. Additionally, mutations found in cancer cells that weaken IRE1α RNase activity may be amenable targets for allosteric modulation. The chemical biology tools developed in this work provide an important step forward towards exploring the utility of UPR-based therapies, as well as offer fundamental mechanistic insights into a key mechanism that keeps the healthy balance of protein folding in the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T, T-REx293 and wild type, <italic>Ire1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Perk</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> <italic>cells</italic> MEF cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, San Francisco, CA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Mendez et al. report the discovery and characterization of IPA, a small molecule (ATP mimetic) modulator of the unfolded protein response effectors IRE1 and PERK.</p><p>Previous work by the authors using small molecule ATP-mimics to inhibit the kinase domain of IRE1 showed an interesting mechanism by which IRE1 responds to unfolded protein stress: The kinase activity of the IRE1 kinase is not required, but rather the active conformation of the kinase.</p><p>In the present work, using biochemical assays, the authors demonstrate that IPA is an activator of IRE1 both in vitro and in vivo. Based on previous experiments published by the authors, the data are interpreted with a model in which the new compound shifts the equilibrium between the active and inactive conformation of the kinase much more towards the active state.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they also report that IPA acts as a PERK activator at low concentrations and as a PERK inhibitor at high concentrations. The authors propose that at low (non-saturating) concentrations of IPA, IPA binding to one PERK protomer promotes dimerization and transactivation of a second PERK protomer bound to ATP, resulting in auto-phosphorylation of PERK and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α. At higher concentrations of IPA, all PERK protomers are occupied by IPA resulting in complete inhibition of its phosphotransfer function.</p><p>Experiments in <italic>IRE1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs show that activation of PERK does not involve IRE1, and in vitro experiments confirm direct binding of the compound to PERK. Treatment of cells with GSK2606414, a potent PERK inhibitor, provided a protective effect against IPA toxicity, providing further support for the model that IPA toxicity is mediated by off-target inhibition of PERK.</p><p>This is an interesting and timely observation as it closely mimics the analogous phenomenon uncovered for RAF-specific kinase inhibitors, which cause paradoxical ligand-induced activation of RAF kinase signaling in cells. It thus appears that the notion of paradoxical activation of kinase function by kinase inhibitors may be more general to kinase families regulated by kinase domain dimerization. These observations have important implications for the design and clinical use of protein kinase small-molecule therapeutics.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is well written, easy to follow and the data are of high quality. Aspects of the work dealing with structure-informed design of the compound, its specificity and in vitro and cell-based activity on IRE1 are clear and convincing. Despite the general interest in the work, the reviewers all feel that the conclusions regarding the model for PERK activation must be strengthened, with particular attention to the following concerns/questions, described below under the “Major Points” heading. A collated set of other comments that should be considered is also provided.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) While the data are consistent with the proposed model for PERK activation, there are no data to directly show this. There are quite straightforward biochemical experiments that could deliver such evidence:</p><p>i) Given that IPA strongly stabilizes the active conformation of IRE1, one would expect quite strong cooperative binding of IPA to PERK if the proposed model is correct: Binding of IPA to PERK causes the neighboring apo-PERK molecules to be in the active state, hence the high affinity state. This seems to be a good experiment to validate the proposed model.</p><p>ii) Since the authors have the cytosolic part of PERK expressed, a more quantitative in vitro characterization of the binding of the compound would strengthen the proposed model.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the authors use recombinant GST-PERK to demonstrate that IPA directly inhibits PERK. Specifically they show that IPA inhibits PERK phosphorylation of eIF2α in vitro. However, no evidence of enhancement of kinase activity is observed at low concentrations of IPA that mimics the phenomenon observed in cells (i.e. IPA activates PERK kinase function in cells at low IPA concentration) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, at the very end of the manuscript, the authors point to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> showing that low concentrations of IPA in fact does activate PERK kinase activity against eIF2α in vitro. What is the basis for this discrepancy? Perhaps both data panels could be shown in the same figure for clarity.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors show that at low concentrations of IPA, PERK is activated leading to impaired translation (lane 5 vs. lane 3). However, they fail to show what happens to translation at high concentrations of IPA. If their model is correct, then at higher concentrations of IPA, cellular translation should be restored and match the levels shown in lanes 3, 4 and 6. The presented figure in its current form is so striking and tantalizing that the reader hungers for a more detailed analysis.</p><p>Other points to consider:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) At the end of the subsection headed “In vivo effects of IPA on the ATF6 and PERK UPR branches”, the authors state that IPA is an ATP competitive inhibitor. This is not proven experimentally so the authors should either provide the data in support (ATP competition curves) or qualify the original statement (the compound is likely an ATP competitive inhibitor based on the following facts…).</p><p>2) The authors should also include the autoradiographs quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> as a supplementary figure.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Mendez et al. show that PERK signaling can be turned off using GSK (a previously published high affinity PERK selective inhibitor developed by GSK) even in the presence of low concentrations of IPA, that alone cause activation of PERK. One essential missing control in this data figure is the IPA-alone control lanes. To be consistent with other figures presented in the manuscript, the authors should include 1 micromolar (PERK activation) and 4 micromolar (PERK inhibition) concentrations of IPA.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the authors should include a negative control showing the growth inhibition profile of GSK alone, even if it doesn't inhibit growth.</p><p>5) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section, how do the authors infer the K<sub>d</sub> from the IC<sup>50</sup>? Include the details in the Methods section.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors perform a full dose response analysis for IPA but only show a single point analysis for IPAx. And the concentration tested for IPAx does not match any of the concentration points tested for IPA. As such, the IPAx analysis is not informative. The authors should redo the experiment using comparable concentrations of IPAx.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1C and 2D</xref> are consistent with the notion that IPA induces the dimerization of Ire1. In the RAF field, authors use reciprocal IPs to demonstrate inhibitor-induced dimerization in cells (and AUC in vitro). Can the authors provide direct evidence that IPA induces PERK dimerization using either immunofluorescence (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) or IP pull downs? This data would strengthen the proposed model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) Is IPA less toxic to <italic>PERK</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs than WT or <italic>IRE1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs?</p><p>2) Need controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> with IPA treatment but no GSK. Also the thapsigargin induced shift in “phosphoPERK” mobility looks qualitatively more pronounced than that induced by IPA. Is it possible that there are different sites getting phosphoryalted?</p><p>3) Why aren't higher concentrations of IPA (sufficient to inhibit PERK) non-toxic?</p><p>4) Discussion regarding IPA-induced dimerization of PERK is over emphasized, given that there are no data in the paper examining effect of IPA on oligomeric state of PERK. Fine to point out recent findings in RAF, but would not include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> without experimentally addressing the question.</p><p>5) It would be helpful to remind the reader that AD60 is expected to bind an inactive conformation of IRE1, and therefore not to activate RNase (in the appropriate place in the Results section).</p><p>6) Define IRE1 (KR43) construct in Results.</p><p>7) Make clear in the text that specificity comparisons with APY24 and the various commercial TKIs are based on “stock” results from invitrogen, and not an independent comparison conducted/commissioned by the authors (if this is indeed the case?)</p><p>8) Does the GSK compound bind an active or inactive PERK kinase conformation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) It is very difficult to see that the IRE1α-GFP foci become less but larger with Tm treatment, and stay small but numerous with IPA. Could the authors improve the figure? Second what is the mechanistic explanation for the different behavior, particularly the growth of the foci with Tm?</p><p>2) The authors talk about “oligomerization” that triggers RNase activity, can they be more specific about what oligomeric state is found?</p><p>3) The finding for PERK activation is in analogy to ATP-competitive inhibitor induced RAF dimerization. Since the dimerization mechanism is the heart of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), dimerization as a function of IAP concentration needs to be shown with additional direct experiments as previously done for RAF using AUC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05434.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) While the data are consistent with the proposed model for PERK activation, there are no data to directly show this.

Due to its propensity to dimerize mediated by the GST moiety, recombinantly produced PERK-GST fusion protein is constitutively phosphorylated and enzymatically active.

The point raised by the reviewer concerns treatment time and differences in the UPR inducer (Tm vs. Tg). In the earlier figures with IPA treatment cells were incubated for 4 hours. In the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> the treatment was also done for 4 hours but Tm-treated cells are slower in inducing a UPR response, whereas Tg cells elicit the response faster and more robustly.</p><p><italic>3) Why aren't higher concentrations of IPA (sufficient to inhibit PERK) non-toxic?</italic></p><p>See response to Major Point 3 above.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion regarding IPA-induced dimerization of PERK is over emphasized, given that there are no data in the paper examining effect of IPA on oligomeric state of PERK.

This difference in behavior results from the attenuation of IRE1α foci under normal ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2010</xref>).

The method in which the hill coefficient is calculated for IRE1 has been published prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). We do understand that while this suggest a tetramer there could be bigger oligomers coming together as seen in live imaging.</p></body></sub-article></article>
