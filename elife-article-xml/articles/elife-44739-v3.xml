However, the function of Drp1 beyond mitochondrial division is largely unknown. Multiple Drp1 isoforms are produced through mRNA splicing. One such isoform, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, contains all four alternative exons and is specifically expressed in the brain. Here, we studied the function of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in mouse neurons in both culture and animal systems using isoform-specific knockdown by shRNA and isoform-specific knockout by CRISPR/Cas9. We found that the expression of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is induced during postnatal brain development. Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is enriched in dendritic spines and regulates postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis by positioning the endocytic zone at the postsynaptic density, independently of mitochondrial division. Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss promotes the formation of ectopic dendrites in neurons and enhanced sensorimotor gating behavior in mice. These data reveal that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> controls postsynaptic endocytosis, neuronal morphology and brain function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Drp1</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iijima</surname><given-names>Miho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM123266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sesaki</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sesaki</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA041208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletnikov</surname><given-names>Mikhail</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamiya</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH083728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletnikov</surname><given-names>Mikhail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and cell biological analyses reveal a new role of Drp1 in postsynaptic endocytosis during brain development beyond mitochondrial division GTPase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major function of Drp1, which is encoded by the <italic>Dnm1l</italic> gene, is to control mitochondrial division as a mechano-chemical GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kameoka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraus and Ryan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pernas and Scorrano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prudent and McBride, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramachandran, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Bliek et al., 2013</xref>). During mitochondrial division, Drp1 is assembled into helical filaments around the surface of mitochondria. Through GTP hydrolysis and interactions with receptors, the Drp1 filaments change their conformation and constrict the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial division is important for human health: hyper- or hypo-division caused by the mis-regulation of Drp1 has been linked to many neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandimalla and Reddy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serasinghe and Chipuk, 2017</xref>). Notably, human Drp1 mutations also lead to neurodevelopmental defects with post-neonatal lethality, developmental delay, late-onset neurological decline, or optic atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fahrner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vanstone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Waterham et al., 2007</xref>); however, our current understanding of Drp1âs function outside of mitochondrial division is limited.</p><p>To study the function of Drp1, complete and tissue-specific knockout (KO) mice for Drp1 have been characterized. The loss of Drp1 results in mitochondrial elongation and enlargement due to unopposed mitochondrial fusion in the absence of mitochondrial division in many cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kashatus, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Widlansky and Hill, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). Complete loss causes embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>), whereas neuron-specific KO leads to a wide range of phenotypes, depending on the types of neurons and the timings when Drp1 is knocked out. For example, the loss of Drp1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells results in developmental defects when knocked out in embryos and progressive degeneration when knocked out in post-mitotic adult Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to Purkinje cells, the loss of Drp1 induces massive death in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berthet et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, hippocampal neurons are more resistant to the loss of Drp1; hippocampal neurons that lack Drp1 or express dominant negative Drp1, do not die but instead show deficits in bioenergetic and synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Divakaruni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shields et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Drp1-KO hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons are also viable and show increased glucose and leptin sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santoro et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Drp1 is encoded by a single gene and produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing of mRNAs. There are four alternative exons in Drp1 in mice (termed A, B, C, and D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These alternative exons are located in either the GTPase domain (A and B) or the variable domain (C and D), which is mainly intrinsically disordered and contains regulatory phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>). All of the Drp1 isoforms are located at mitochondria and function in mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a subset of these isoforms is also located at additional sites. For example, Drp1<sub>D</sub> and Drp1<sub>BD</sub> are associated with and regulate the dynamics of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strack et al., 2013</xref>). We recently identified a novel isoform of Drp1 (termed Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>) that is exclusively expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>). Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, which contains all of the alternative exons, is the only isoform that is associated with lysosomes, late endosomes, and the plasma membrane when this isoform is expressed in Drp1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis of transcripts and proteins showed that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is expressed at low levels; Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> constitutes less than 5% of all the Drp1 isoforms expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44739.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is induced during a postnatal period and enriched in postsynaptic terminals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>.

We then examined synapses by transmission electron microscopy. In both control and Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons, we observed matured synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, remarkably, the number of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) was significantly different in these neuronsâDrp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons showed more CCPs in postsynaptic terminals compared with control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). In contrast, the number of CCPs in presynaptic terminals was indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>). We then divided the morphologies of CCPs in postsynaptic terminals into three categories: shallow, U-shaped and omega-shaped pits. We found an increased frequency of shallow and U-shaped CCPs, which likely represent early stages during endocytosis, in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). The frequencies of omega-shaped CCPs were similar in control and Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>).</p><p>The observed increase in the number of CCPs could be explained by either activation or inhibition of endocytosis. First, the rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis may be enhanced in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons and therefore shallow and U-shaped CCPs were observed at a higher frequency. Alternatively, clathrin-mediated endocytosis may be slowed at early stages after the initiation of endocytosis perhaps in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons and thereby the intermediates were accumulated. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we treated control and Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that blocks the final step of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macia et al., 2006</xref>), for 30 min prior to chemical fixation for electron microscopy. As expected, dynasore significantly increased the number of CCPs at postsynaptic terminals in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>). In contrast, when we treated Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons with dynasore, we found no increase in the number of CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is decreased in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons. The accumulation of shallow and U-shaped CCPs, but not omega-shaped ones, suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> may function at an early step upstream of the constriction and severing of the neck of coated pits that is mediated by dynamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref>). We confirmed that dynasore did not inhibit Drp1 by examining mitochondrial morphology in neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies to a mitochondrial protein (pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O and P</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the consequence of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we stimulated WT and KO neurons with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) for a short period of time (3 min) and analyzed the number of CCPs at the postsypatic terminal. When we stimulated neurons in the presence of dynasore, the number of postsynaptic clathrin-coated pits increased in control neurons. This is due to stimulation of endocytosis by NMDA and inhibition of its completion by dynasore. In contrast, the number of CCPs remained unchanged in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>). These phenotypes of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss were only observed at the postsynaptic region and not the presynaptic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R</xref>). These data further support the notion that postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis is slow in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons even when stimulated by NMDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref>). Interestingly, when stimulated by NMDA in the absence of dynasore, the number of CCPs was decreased in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>). It appears that NMDA induces internalization of some endocytic vesicles in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons. We suggest that Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons have slow kinetics of endocytosis but do not completely block it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2S</xref>).</p><p>To understand how Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss results in changes in CCPs, we tested postsynaptic positioning of the endocytic zone using mCherry-clathrin light chain (mCherry-CLC) and Psd-95-Fibronectin intrabodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), the majority of mCherry-CLC signals are localized next to Psd-95 signals in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In contrast, we found a higher frequency of dissociation of mCherry-CLC signals from Psd-95 signals in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We speculate that decreased levels of clathrin in the synapses in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons slow the progression of endocytosis. In these synapses, the formation of CCPs is initiated; however, the maturation of CCPs is likely decreased due to the limited availability of clathrin molecules. As a result, CCPs accumulate during relatively early stages of endocytosis (e.g., shallow and U-shaped CCPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). These data suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, unlike dynamin, does not play a role in the scission of the neck of coated pits.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44739.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The endocytic zone is mislocalized in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Hippocampal neurons were cultured and transfected with plasmids expressing Psd-95.FingR-GFP and mCherry-CLC.

To target Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, we used an mRNA sequence that corresponds to the junction between exon A and exon B, which is unique to Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). First, the specificity of this knockdown construct was confirmed. We individually expressed each of GFP-Drp1<sub>ACD</sub>, GFP-Drp1<sub>BCD</sub>, and GFP-Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in separate HEK293 cells. We found that AB-targeted shRNA specifically knocked down GFP-Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, but not GFP-Drp1<sub>ACD</sub> or GFP-Drp1<sub>BCD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, AB shRNA). As a negative control, scramble shRNA was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, Scramble). As a positive control, we targeted an mRNA sequence that is common in all Drp1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, Pan-Drp1).</p><p>Supporting the data from the above experiments using Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO neurons, AB-targeted shRNA significantly increased the number of primary dendrites in cultured neurons at both 2 and 3 weeks compared to scramble shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Ectopic dendrites extended within a short period of time (3 days) after knockdown of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in mature neurons with developed dendrites. The number of axons did not change (one axon per neuron) as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-MAP2 antibodies, which label dendrites but not axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm that the induction of dendrite formation results from the knockdown of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, we co-expressed plasmids carrying a knockdown-resistant form of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> along with AB-targeted shRNAs. The Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> plasmid, but not the empty plasmid, significantly rescued the effect of AB-targeted shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). These data further support the notion that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is important for controlling the number of primary dendrites in neurons.</p><p>Dendrite growth is regulated by neuronal activity-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong and Ghosh, 2002</xref>). To understand the mechanism underlying the ectopic dendrite formation in AB-targeted neurons, we treated hippocampal neurons during knockdown with tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel inhibitor that blocks action potentials. We found that tetrodotoxin significantly blocked the effect of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> knockdown on ectopic dendrite formation, but did not affect the number of dendrites in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These data suggest that the formation of primary dendrites induced by Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> depletion requires neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> induces the formation of ectopic primary dendrites in vivo</title><p>To test the function of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in the morphology of neurons in vivo, we analyzed the morphology of neurons in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice. To achieve this goal, it was critical to sparsely label individual neurons because the density of neurons is too high to faithfully visualize the morphology of each neuron if all of the neurons are labeled. We crossed Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice with a mouse line that expresses a cytosolic GFP in a small number of neurons driven by the neuron-specific Thy1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We counted the number of neurites using z stacks of laser confocal microscopy of frozen brain sections. We found a significant increase in the number of neurites in the CA1 and CA2 layers in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) consistent with the data from the in vitro experiments. The effect of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss on primary dendrites was also evident in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).</p><p>To further test the effect of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> knockdown during brain development in vivo, we performed in utero electroporation of shRNAs. We injected plasmids carrying scramble or AB-targeted shRNA, along with plasmids carrying cytosolic GFP, into the lateral ventricles of E15.5 embryos in timed pregnant mice using a glass micropipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). We then performed electroporation to introduce the plasmids into the hippocampus, after which the embryos were returned to the abdomen. At 7 weeks after birth, mice were fixed using cardiac perfusion of paraformaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Coronal cryosections of the CA1 and 2 layers in the dorsal hippocampus were cut and the neuronal morphology was analyzed using z stacks of laser confocal microscopy images. Since the cytosolic GFP labels both dendrites and axons, we counted the number of neurites (including both dendrites and axons) that directly emerged from the soma. Consistent with the knockout results, we found that knockdown of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> significantly increased the number of neurites, compared to the scramble control, in the hippocampus in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> increases sensorimotor gating function</title><p>To test whether the loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> affects brain function, behavioral phenotypes were systematically characterized in control and Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice. We observed normal general locomotor activities in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice in open field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Intriguingly, KO mice exhibited significantly increased prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle without alterations in the startle response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O and P</xref>). PPI, as a measure of sensorimotor gating, involves several brain regions (including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swerdlow et al., 2001</xref>). Sensorimotor gating function enables selective attention that distinguishes or separates critical information from background noise. In humans, sensorimotor gating function is often referred to as the cocktail party effect, which allows one to talk with someone even in a crowded party environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swerdlow et al., 2001</xref>). This gating function is important for human health and its defects have been associated with mental illness, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swerdlow et al., 2001</xref>). At this moment, we do not know the exact mechanistic basis underlying this enhanced sensorimotor gating in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice; however, the increased number of dendrites or the decreased postsynaptic endocytosis in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice may contribute to the enhancement in sensorimotor gating function. Behavioral changes in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice appeared to be specific to sensorimotor gating since we observed no alterations in spatial working and recognition memory tasks in Y-maze tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), motor coordination in rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C</xref>), and anxiety level in elevated plus maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found, for the first time, that the novel brain-specific isoform Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> controls postsynaptic endocytosis independently of mitochondrial division. It would be important to test if this, in turn, results in the accumulation of cargoes on the postsynaptic surface and leads to ectopic formation of dendrites in future studies. Since the expression of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is induced during the postnatal period, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> may control the number of dendrites by suppressing unwanted, excess dendrite formation in neuronal network wiring during postnatal brain development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source <break/>or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type mice</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Materials and methods: GenerationÂ of Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice using CRISPR/Cas9</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Materials and methods: Generation ofÂ Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO mice using CRISPR/Cas9</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Thy1-GFP-M transgenic mice</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 007788</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J mice</td><td valign="top">JacksonLaboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT and Drp1-KO MEFs</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kageyama et al.

Immediately after quenching, the neurons were washed twice with PBS containing 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and then lysed with RIPA buffer that contained cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor. The biotinylated cell surface proteins were precipitated using NeutrAvidin agarose (Pierce, 29200). The precipitated proteins and total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies to GluR1, GluR2, GluR3 and GAPDH.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>GluR1 internalization assay</title><p>Cultured neurons were transfected with 1 Âµg of Psd-95-mCherry plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpied et al., 2008</xref>) and 1 Âµg of GFP-GluR1 plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>) per coverslip in 12-well plates. Two days after transfection, the neurons were treated with chemical LTD stimulation, fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 8 min, washed with PBS and blocked in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min. To label surface GFP-GluR1, the cells were incubated with GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Senoo et al., 2019</xref>) at 4Â°C overnight and then treated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using LSM800 GaAsP laser scanning confocal microscopes and analyzed using ImageJ. Identical settings were used to acquire each image within an experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Transferrin uptake</title><p>MEFs were incubated with 5 Âµg/ml of Alexa-Fluor-647-transferrin (Thermo, T23366) in the culture medium for 30 min at 4Â°C or 37Â°C.

Mean fluorescent signals in each cell were measured using Image J. Cultured neurons were incubated with 50 Âµg/ml of FITC-transferrin (Thermo, T2871) in the culture medium for 15 min at 4Â°C or 37Â°C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed using PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose, washed in PBS and then visualized by confocal microscopy. Mean fluorescent intensity was measured along dendrites (100 Âµm in length) using Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>In utero electroporation</title><p>In utero electroporation that targeted the dorsal hippocampus region was performed according to our published protocol with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saito et al., 2016</xref>). Pregnant mice (C57BL/6J, The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 000664) were anesthetized at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) by intraperitoneal administration of a mixed solution of ketamine HCl (100 mg/kg), xylazine HCl (7.5 mg/kg), and buprenorphine HCl (0.05 mg/kg). After the uterine horn was exposed by laparotomy, the CAG promoter-driven eGFP expression plasmid, pCAGGS1-eGFP (1 Âµg/Âµl), together with the Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> knockdown plasmid, pSUPER-AB (1 Âµg/Âµl), was injected (1â2 Âµl) into the lateral ventricles with a glass micropipette made from a microcapillary tube (Narishige, Cat #GD-1). Using a Ã¸3mm electrode (Nepagene #CUY650P3), the plasmids were delivered into the dorsal hippocampus by electric pulses (40V; 50 ms), which were charged four times at intervals of 950 ms with an electroporator (Nepagene #CUY21EDIT). After electroporation, the uterine horn was replaced in the abdominal cavity to allow the embryos to continue to develop.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>All of the behavior tests were performed in mice of 2â5 months of age at the Behavior Core of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. For open field tests, mice were placed in a Photo-beam Activity System Open Field (San Diego Instruments, CA, USA) and their movement was recorded for 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breu et al., 2016</xref>). The open field chamber consisted of a clear Plexiglas box (40Â ÃÂ 40Â ÃÂ 37 cm) with 16 horizontal and 16 vertical photo-beams to assess locomotion and location tendency. Activity parameters were quantified as the number of beam breaks.</p><p>For PPI tests, mice were put in a clear Plexiglas cylinder (3.8 cm in diameter) within a startle chamber (San Diego Instruments) and tested for their sensorimotor gating function using SR-LAB software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nasu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saito et al., 2016</xref>) (Startle Response System, San Diego Instruments, CA, USA). A loudspeaker mounted 24 cm above the cylinder provided acoustic stimuli and background noise (70 dB) and controlled the delivery of all stimuli to the animal by SR-LAB software and the interface system. A maximum voltage during the 100 ms period beginning at the stimulus onset was measured as a startle amplitude. To initiate the test, mice were given a 5 min acclimation period with 70 dB background noise; this background noise was present throughout the entire session. After acclimation, mice were exposed to a pulse (a 120 dB, 40 ms) 10 times and then the background-only session 10 times at a 20 s inter-stimuli interval (habituation session). In experimental sessions, mice were exposed to the following types of trials: pulse alone trial (a 120 dB, 100 ms broadband burst); the omission of stimuli (no pulse, only background noise); and five prepulse-pulse combination trials. Broadband bursts (20 ms) were individually presented as prepulses for 80 ms before the pulse (120 dB, 100 ms broadband pulse). Each session consisted of six presentations of each type of trial presented at a 20 s inter-stimulus interval in a pseudorandom order. PPI was defined as a reduced percentage of startle amplitude in prepulse-pulse trials compared to the startle amplitude in startle-alone trials.</p><p>For the Y-maze test, mice were placed in a Y-shaped maze with three arms (38Â ÃÂ 7.5Â ÃÂ 12 cm) at 120-degree angles from each other. After introduction to the center of the maze, mice are allowed to freely explore the three arms and are video-recorded for 10 min. The number of arm entries and the time spent in each arm were scored in order to calculate the percentage of alternation.</p><p>For rotarod tests, mice were placed on the rod spindle assembly (3.0 cm in diameter) of the Rotamex-5 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>) (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA). Mice were first trained at 4.0 rpm for 5 min. After this training session, the rotarod was accelerated with a 1.0 rpm increase in rotational speed every 5 s. The time elapsed before falling was recorded for each mouse. Three consecutive trials were performed and the results were averaged in each mouse.</p><p>For the elevated plus maze test, a mouse was placed on the starting platform in the plus maze (San Diego Instruments Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and the mouse's behaviors were video-recorded for 5 min. We scored the numbers of entries into the closed and open arms and the time spent in the closed and open arms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>MEFs and lentiviruses</title><p>Drp1-KO MEFs were cultured in Iscoveâs modified Dulbeccoâs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kageyama et al., 2014</xref>).

Drp1 is a well characterized GTPase which belongs to the dynamin-like protein family. It has been involved mainly in the fission reaction of mitochondria. In addition, the groups of Miho Iijima and Hiromi Sesaki, corresponding authors of the present manuscript, have very recently found (Itoh et al., 2018) that the splice variant Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>, with all four additional inserts, is specific for the brain and is present not only at mitochondria scission sites but also at late endosomes and lysosomes, and the plasma membrane. In the present study, they examine the effect of deleting specifically Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> (or Drp1<sub>AB</sub> deletion, because the only variant containing both A and B also contains C and D) with a Drp1<sub>exonA</sub> KO mouse and shRNA targeting specifically Drp1 mRNAs containing A and B exons. They found, using cultured hippocampal neurons, that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is present in dendritic spines and that its absence increases the number of CCPs near post-synaptic sites, suggesting that Drp1<sub>ABCS</sub> affects clathrin mediated endocytosis. Surprisingly, spine density was not affected but the number of primary dendrites was increased in cultured neurons and in pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus in vivo. Finally, KO mice have a deficit in two behavioral tests involving sensory gating, but not in classical tests of locomotor activity, anxiety, working memory.</p><p>The experiments are in general well performed and the results are clearly and concisely presented. The results are interesting but it is hard to see clear connections between the three main effects of Drp1<sub>AB</sub> deletion on post-synaptic CCPs, primary dendrites and the modulation of the startle response. In particular, before further consideration for publication, it is important to determine if and how post-synaptic endocytosis is affected and if there is a direct connection with the number of primary dendrites.</p><p>Therefore I propose to:</p><p>1) Test directly the possibility that postsynaptic endocytosis is affected. First, the number of CCPs near PSDs can be quantified (as in Blanpied et al., 2002, Lu et al., 2007 or Rosendale et al., 2017). Second, test the distribution and internalization of post-synaptic cargoes (e.g. transferrin and AMPARs are the classical ones).</p><p>2) Reevaluate the effect of dynasore. It is described as affecting dynamin at a late stage of endocytosis. However, dynasore also affects Drp1, at least in vitro (Figure 2G of Macia et al., 2006) so a different dynamin (or clathrin) blocker such as mitmab or pitstop2 should be used to test if the effects goes through dynamin or Drp1 inhibition.</p><p>3) Explain further in what sense the approach with shRNA is more specific than the Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO. Do the authors mean that they delete the exonA containing Drp1 mRNA in target neurons, and not in the other cells types (e.g. astrocytes)?</p><p>4) Explain why the neurons in culture were transfected at an age that seems quite old (22-24 DIV). At this age, cell survival and transfections are notoriously poor. The authors should indicate if and how often medium was replaced in culture. Why did the authors choose such an old age? Is the effect of Drp1<sub>AB</sub> loss only seen after this time in culture? The authors should document at least in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub> KO neurons if the number of primary dendrites is affected at early stages of neuronal development. Is there any other example where the number of primary dendrites can be affected late in neuronal development?</p><p>5) Figure 1C: the post-natal expression of Drp1<sub>AB</sub>, is very low at P8 (unlike PSD95 as written in the text). This could be in line with my previous point, if the effects of Drp1<sub>AB</sub> deletion are only visible at late stages. Could the authors comment this further?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study that describes the involvement of one particular splice variant (isoform) of Drp1 in postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which ultimately affects neuronal morphology and animal behavior. While the experiments are well-executed and the results mostly convincing, the study primarily addresses &quot;phenomena&quot; from 36K feet up without attempting to delve into the exact role of this Drp1 variant here, or its mechanism. Therefore, this reviewer finds the study to be largely descriptive and observational, without being able to infer roles or mechanisms. Several important questions therefore need to be addressed.</p><p>Specifically, what is Drp1 doing here while in the presence of dynamin (which mediates fission one would think), and associated BAR domain-containing proteins, which presumably function to create the membrane invaginations in the first place? How does this Drp1 variant contribute to membrane remodeling specifically in the context of postsynaptic CME, or does it? Do other modes or locations of endocytosis rely on this variant? Is this Drp1 variant recruited to the postsynaptic endocytic pit, or to the PM in general, in the absence of dynamin? Is there a role for Mff in the selective PM recruitment of this variant as alluded by Li et al., 2013? It is not clear what allows the selective recruitment of this Drp1 splice variant to the PM.</p><p>The recruitment and role of this variant should therefore be further investigated in the context of isoform-specific and pan-dynamin knockdown, which should provide insight into Drp1's role and mechanism, specifically in postsynaptic CME. What is the morphology of these endocytic pits in the absence (or presence) of dynamin 1/2/3? Can Drp1 substitute for dynamin in postsynaptic CME? Further, are there specific binding partners at the PM for this variant versus other Drp1 isoforms? In other words, what is the basis of the selective recruitment of this Drp1 splice variant over others?</p><p>In a nutshell, the following sentence from this manuscript requires additional clarification: &quot;The accumulation of shallow and U-shaped CCPs, but not omega-shaped</p><p>ones, suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> may function at an early step upstream of the constriction and severing of the neck of coated pits that is mediated by dynamin (Schmid and Frolov, 2011).&quot;</p><p>What is the role and mechanism of Drp1 here? This should be established to complete this manuscript, which will provide critical insights into the largely unstudied role of Drp1, outside of the context of mitochondria.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Itoh et al. investigates the function of the Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> isoform, which contains all four alternative exons and is specific to the brain. The authors use both shRNA knockdown and CRISPR isoform specific knockouts. They show that Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> is expressed during postnatal development, is enriched in dendritic spines, and regulates postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> KO or KD induces primary neuron dendrites in culture and in utero KD in hippocampus increases primary neurites. Finally, Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> KO mice display enhanced sensorimotor gating behavior in mice. This is a clear and well written study that provides novel information into Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> function. However, additional studies would further support the findings and rule out a role for Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> in mitochondria function.</p><p>1) Please include representative images used to quantify Spine/Dendrite expression of HA-Drp1 -BCD (Figure 1E and F) similar to those shown of HA-Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> in Figure 1G.</p><p>2) The mitochondria analysis in Figure 3 and S2 is preliminary. Since the main role of Drp1 is to mediate mitochondrial fission it will be important to determine if mitochondria are unaltered with Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO and KD. The authors should provide quantification of mitochondria morphology, which may require genetic labeling of mitochondria. Additionally, Drp1 can alter mitochondria across dendritic regions. From the images it seems that only proximal dendrites are examined. It will be important to analyze the mitochondria across the dendritic field.</p><p>3) In the last sentence of the Abstract the authors state that their results suggest that DRP1-<sub>ABCD</sub> controls morphology and function through surface trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors at postsynapses. Inclusion of more details throughout the manuscript that relate the endocytosis findings to receptor trafficking would help support this conclusion and make it understandable to readers unfamiliar with the neurotransmitter receptor trafficking field.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Brain-specific Drp1 regulates postsynaptic endocytosis and dendrite formation independently of mitochondrial division&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing editor, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission.</p><p>We were helped in making our decision by the original reviewers, who read your revised manuscript. They all agreed that your changes had strengthened the story, and thought it would be helpful to include an illustration or model demonstrating how Drp1 <sub>ABCD</sub> might function in postsynaptic endocytosis.</p><p>The reviewers also suggested a couple of additional experiments. First, there seems to be a discrepancy between the EM data in Figure 2Q, showing more CCPs at the postsynaptic terminal under basal conditions in the KO cells, and the light microscopy data in Figure 3 A-B, which appears to show less clathrin at the postsynaptic terminal terminal. The reviewer who pointed this out felt that you needed more direct evidence for your hypothesis that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> regulates cargo recycling and suggested that you investigate the localisation of AMPA receptors in your KO cells.</p><p>The other suggested experiment was to carry out a similar study to the one in supplementary Figure 6, showing a lack of effect of dynasore on mitochondrial morphology in MEFs, but this time using neurons as in Figure 3D. Because the labelled mitochondria often overlap, it will be important to show how you measure your mitochondrial length. Both of these experiments appear to be straightforward enough to complete within two months.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Brain-specific Drp1 regulates postsynaptic endocytosis and dendrite formation independently of mitochondrial division&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Specifically, there is still the issue of the connection between the phenotypes, which has not been solved. The authors have convincing data regarding the effect of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> deletion on post-synaptic endocytosis and the formation of ectopic dendrites. However, they do not show that ectopic dendrite formation occurs because postsynaptic endocytosis is affected. Therefore, the last sentence of the Abstract and the last paragraph of the Discussion must be changed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44739.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We should stress that all of the reviewers found your study very interesting.

As recommended, during the revision process, we tested the postsynaptic positioning of the endocytic zone using mCherry-clathrin light chain and Psd-95- Fibronectin intrabodies in WT and Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO hippocampal neurons. As previously reported (Lu et al., 2007), the majority of mCherry-clathrin signals are localized next to Psd-95 signals in WT neurons (Figure 3A and 3B). In contrast, in the KO neurons, mCherry-clathrin signals were significantly dissociated from Psd-95 signals (Figure 3A and 3B). Therefore, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is important for localizing endocytic zones to the postsynaptic density. Decreased clathrin amounts near the postsynaptic density may contribute to a decrease in endocytosis in KO neurons (Figure 3C).</p><p>To further test the role of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in endocytosis, we extended our electron microscopic analysis of CCPs in the revised manuscript. In the original manuscript, we showed that the number of CCPs is increased in KO neurons and treatments with a dynamin inhibitor (i.e., dynasore) did not increase the number of CCPs (Figure 2M and N). Conversely, the number of CCPs was lower in WT neurons compared with KO neurons and was increased when treated with dynasore since endocytosis was blocked at the membrane scission step by dynamin inhibition (Figure 2M and N).</p><p>Note: As suggested by this reviewer, we reevaluated the effect of dynasore in cells and ruled out that dynasore blocks Drp1 in both neurons and fibroblasts (Figure 2O, 2P and S1). Please see our responses specific to this point below (Comment 3).</p><p>In new experiments, we stimulated WT and KO neurons with NMDA. When we stimulated neurons in the presence of dynasore, WT neurons increased the number of postsynaptic CCPs (Figure 2Q). This is likely due to stimulation of endocytosis by NMDA and inhibition of its completion by dynasore. In contrast, KO neurons did not increase the number of CCPs (Figure 2Q). These data suggest that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is still slow in Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons even when stimulated by NMDA.</p><p>Furthermore, when stimulated by NMDA in the absence of dynasore, the number of CCPs was decreased in KO neurons (Figure 2Q). It appears that NMDA induces internalization of some endocytic vesicles in KO neurons. We suggest that KO neurons have slow kinetics of endocytosis but do not completely block it (Figure 2S). From these data, we speculate that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> facilitates the kinetics of endocytosis in early steps, likely through connecting the endocytic zone to the postsynaptic density (Figure 3C). Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> does not likely act at the last step of endocytosis such as the scission of the neck of CCPs. This model is also consistent with the accumulation of shallow CCPs, but not omega-shaped CCPs, in the KO neurons (Figure 2L). Finally, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss only affected the postsynaptic region and not the presynaptic region, suggesting that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> mainly functions in postsynaptic endocytosis (Figure 2Q and 2R).</p><p>As suggested, we also examined endocytosis of FITC-transferrin and found similar uptakes in WT and KO neurons (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A). This is consistent with the previous study (Lu et al., 2007) showing that the dissociation of clathrin and Psd-95 signals does not affect endocytosis of transferrin. We also tried to examine endocytosis of AMPARs using surface biotinylation; however, this was technically very difficult, and we could not detect internalization of GluR1, GluR2 and GluR3 even in WT neurons in response to NMDA stimulation. We will continue to improve our techniques and address this aspect in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reevaluate the effect of dynasore. It is described as affecting dynamin at a late stage of endocytosis. However, dynasore also affects Drp1, at least in vitro (Figure 2G of Macia et al., 2006) so a different dynamin (or clathrin) blocker such as mitmab or pitstop2 should be used to test if the effects goes through dynamin or Drp1 inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that it is important to test a potential effect of dynasore on Drp1 in cells. In the revised manuscript, we treated cultured embryonic fibroblasts and hippocampal neurons with dynasore and analyzed mitochondria. We found that dynasore does not change mitochondrial morphology in both cell types (Figure 2O, 2P and S1). As a control for the loss of Drp1 function, Drp1-KO fibroblasts (in which total Drp1 is lost) showed highly elongated mitochondria due to defects in mitochondrial division (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). Therefore, dynasore does not block Drp1 in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Explain further in what sense the approach with shRNA is more specific than the Drp1<sub>exonA</sub>-KO. Do the authors mean that they delete the exonA containing Drp1 mRNA in target neurons, and not in the other cells types (e.g. astrocytes)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for mentioning this important point. The reasons we used knockdown in addition to knockout is because, as you described, we wanted to test whether the effect of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss is cell autonomous in neurons. This is only achieved by the knockdown in a small population of neurons. In addition, the knockdown approach showed that ectopic dendrites can extend 1) for a short period of time (3 days) after knockdown and 2) in matured neurons (3 weeks DIV) with developed dendrites. We added these discussions to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Explain why the neurons in culture were transfected at an age that seems quite old (22-24 DIV). At this age, cell survival and transfections are notoriously poor. The authors should indicate if and how often medium was replaced in culture. Why did the authors choose such an old age? Is the effect of Drp1AB loss only seen after this time in culture? The authors should document at least in Drp1<sub>exonA</sub> KO neurons if the number of primary dendrites is affected at early stages of neuronal development. Is there any other example where the number of primary dendrites can be affected late in neuronal development?</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with in vivodata, Western blotting of cultured neurons showed that the expression level of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> increases during the first 0-2 weeks and reaches a plateau at 3-4 weeks (Figure 1D). Based on this expression pattern, we tested the impact of the knockdown and knockout of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in cultured neurons at 3 weeks.</p><p>With regard to our neuron culture condition, we consistently observe similar viability and plasmid transfection efficiency in neurons at 2 and 3 weeks in my laboratory. We can culture neurons with unaffected viability and transfection rate for at least 4 weeks. As requested by this reviewer, we have added more detailed information about our culture conditions to the revised manuscript.</p><p>To examine the role of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in early culture, we knocked down Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> at 2 weeks (Figure 4H, 2 weeks). Similar to the 3-week culture, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> knockdown significantly increased the number of primary dendrites in the 2-week culture. These data show that the knockdown effect is reproducible in young neurons at 2 weeks. Interestingly, in this experiment, we found that fewer dendrites were found at 2 weeks compared to 3 weeksâfor example, approximately 8 dendrites at 2 weeks and approximately 10 dendrites at 3 weeks in WT neurons (please compare 2 weeks and 3 weeks in Figure 4H). Therefore, neurons likely continue to extend primary dendrites even at 2 weeks in culture. Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> may control the continuous morphogenesis of dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1C: the post-natal expression of Drp1AB, is very low at P8 (unlike PSD95 as written in the text). This could be in line with my previous point, if the effects of Drp1AB deletion are only visible at late stages. Could the authors comment this further?</p></disp-quote><p>As this reviewer correctly pointed out, the expression of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is induced later compared with that of Psd-95 in vivo(Figure 1C) and in vitro(Figure 1D). As described above (Comment 4), new experiments showed that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> depletion induced ectopic extension of dendrites in cultured neurons at 2 weeks (Figure 4H, 2 weeks). Therefore, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> could also function at early stages of neuronal</p><p>development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting study that describes the involvement of one particular splice variant (isoform) of Drp1 in postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which ultimately affects neuronal morphology and animal behavior. While the experiments are well-executed and the results mostly convincing, the study primarily addresses &quot;phenomena&quot; from 36K feet up without attempting to delve into the exact role of this Drp1 variant here, or its mechanism. Therefore, this reviewer finds the study to be largely descriptive and observational, without being able to infer roles or mechanisms. Several important questions therefore need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the supportive comments that our study is interesting, the experiments are well-executed, and the data are convincing. We have addressed all of the concerns raised by the reviewer as described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, what is Drp1 doing here while in the presence of dynamin (which mediates fission one would think), and associated BAR domain-containing proteins, which presumably function to create the membrane invaginations in the first place? How does this Drp1 variant contribute to membrane remodeling specifically in the context of postsynaptic CME, or does it? Do other modes or locations of endocytosis rely on this variant?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that it is important to more deeply understand the function of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>. To further probe the mechanism by which Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> controls endocytosis, we examined the localization of the endocytic zone at the postsynaptic region using mCherry-clathrin light chain and Psd-95-Fibronectin intrabodies. We found that the loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> dissociates mCherry-clathrin signals from Psd-95 signals in Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons (Figure 3A and B). The new data suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is not involved in creating the membrane curvature; rather, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> helps to localize the endocytic zone next to the postsynaptic density (Figure 3C). Please see our related responses to reviewer 1 (Comment 1). In addition, we showed that the number of clathrin coated pits (CCPs) is increased in postsynaptic regions using electron microscopy (Figure 2). Taken together, these data suggest that clathrin may be partially depleted in the vicinity of the postsynaptic density, and therefore endocytosis is slowed in KO neurons (Figure 2S). Furthermore, electron microscopy showed that changes in the number of CCPs are only seen in postsynaptic regions but not presynaptic regions (Figure 2I, 2J, 2Q and 2R), suggesting that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is mainly involved in postsynaptic endocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this Drp1 variant recruited to the postsynaptic endocytic pit, or to the PM in general, in the absence of dynamin? Is there a role for Mff in the selective PM recruitment of this variant as alluded by Li et al., 2013? It is not clear what allows the selective recruitment of this Drp1 splice variant to the PM.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, we showed that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is associated with the plasma membrane as well as late endosomes and lysosomes when expressed in Drp1-KO fibroblasts (in which total Drp1 is lost) (Itoh et al., 2018). During the revision process, to test whether the localization of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> at the plasma membrane requires dynamin, we expressed Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in Drp1-KO cells in the absence or presence of a dynamin inhibitor, dynasore. We found that the localization of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> at the plasma membrane is similar in the presence or absence of dynasore (Figure S6A). Therefore, plasma membrane localization of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is likely independent of dynamin function. This is consistent with the notion that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> controls the position of the endocytic zone likely upstream of dynamin function.</p><p>We also asked whether the plasma membrane localization of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> requires Mff using Mff-KO fibroblasts. New results show that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is associated with the plasma membrane in Mff-KO cells similar to WT cells (Figure S6B). Li et al., 2013, showed that Drp1 is associated with Mff on synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminus. In the present study, we show that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> functions at the postsynaptic terminus. Therefore, there may be multiple mechanisms that anchor different Drp1 isoforms to the membranes at different subcellular locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The recruitment and role of this variant should therefore be further investigated in the context of isoform-specific and pan-dynamin knockdown, which should provide insight into Drp1's role and mechanism, specifically in postsynaptic CME. What is the morphology of these endocytic pits in the absence (or presence) of dynamin 1/2/3? Can Drp1 substitute for dynamin in postsynaptic CME? Further, are there specific binding partners at the PM for this variant versus other Drp1 isoforms? In other words, what is the basis of the selective recruitment of this Drp1 splice variant over others?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above (Comment 1), our data suggest that the role of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is different from that of dynamin. Therefore, Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> would not replace dynamin in membrane constriction. We agree with this reviewer that molecules that recruit Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> to the plasma membrane are of great interest. We have ruled out the possibilities that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is recruited to the plasma membrane through dynamin or Mff (Comment 2). We plan to search for a plasma membrane receptor for Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in our future studies and feel that the actual identification of such molecules will take a large body of new work and is beyond the scope of the present study. Along this line, we would prefer not to include the data about the role of dynamin and Mff in the plasma membrane localization of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in the current manuscript. Instead, we would like to present the data in our future study in which this mechanism is more specifically addressed with additional experiments. If this reviewer and editor feel that the data need to be included in the current study, we would be happy to do so. Please let us know.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a nutshell, the following sentence from this manuscript requires additional clarification: &quot;The accumulation of shallow and U-shaped CCPs, but not omega-shaped ones, suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> may function at an early step upstream of the constriction and severing of the neck of coated pits that is mediated by dynamin (Schmid and Frolov, 2011).&quot;</p><p>What is the role and mechanism of Drp1 here? This should be established to complete this manuscript, which will provide critical insights into the largely unstudied role of Drp1, outside of the context of mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed with reviewer 1 (Comment 1), we further analyzed CCPs using electron microscopy during the revision process. In the original manuscript, we showed that the number of CCPs is higher in KO neurons and that dynasore treatments did not increase their number (Figure 2M and N). Conversely, in WT neurons, the number of CCPs was increased when treated with dynasore because endocytosis was blocked at the last step by dynamin inhibition (Figure 2M and N). Therefore, it appears that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> loss affects early steps during endocytosis (Figure 2S).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we examined CCPs after NMDA stimulation. In the presence of dynasore, WT neurons increased the number of postsynaptic CCPs after NMDA stimulation, indicating that NMDA-promoted endocytosis was blocked at the step of membrane scission by dynamin (Figure 2Q). In contrast, KO neurons still did not increase the number of CCPs (Figure 2Q). These data further support the notion that NMDA-stimulated endocytosis is slower in Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons.</p><p>Interestingly, when KO neurons were treated with NMDA in the absence of dynasore, the number of CCPs was decreased (Figure 2Q). In contrast, in WT neurons, the number of CCPs was slightly increased presumably as a result of a combination of increased initiation endocytosis and internalization of endocytic vesicles. These data suggest that, in KO neurons, NMDA still induces internalization of some endocytic vesicles, but early steps of endocytosis such as its initiation and progression remain slow. We think that KO neurons have decreased kinetics of endocytosis but do not completely block endocytosis (Figure 2S). This model is consistent with both the accumulation of shallow CCPs in KO neurons (Figure 2L). Decreased levels of clathrin in postsynaptic regions, as seen by clathrin and Psd-95 imaging (Figure 3A-C), may contribute to the slow kinetics. We have added this discussion to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study by Itoh et al. investigates the function of the Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> isoform, which contains all four alternative exons and is specific to the brain. The authors use both shRNA knockdown and CRISPR isoform specific knockouts. They show that Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> is expressed during postnatal development, is enriched in dendritic spines, and regulates postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> KO or KD induces primary neuron dendrites in culture and in utero KD in hippocampus increases primary neurites. Finally, Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> KO mice display enhanced sensorimotor gating behavior in mice. This is a clear and well written study that provides novel information into Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> function. However, additional studies would further support the findings and rule out a role for Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> in mitochondria function.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to this reviewer for the encouraging comments that our study provides novel information regarding Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> function. We also appreciate the constructive suggestions and concerns. During the revision process, we have addressed all of them as described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Please include representative images used to quantify Spine/Dendrite expression of HA-Drp1-<sub>BCD</sub> (Figure 1E and F) similar to those shown of HA-Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub> in Figure 1G.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we have included images for HA-Drp1<sub>BCD</sub> in revised Figure 1H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mitochondria analysis in Figure 3 and S2 is preliminary. Since the main role of Drp1 is to mediate mitochondrial fission it will be important to determine if mitochondria are unaltered with Drp1-<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO and KD. The authors should provide quantification of mitochondria morphology, which may require genetic labeling of mitochondria. Additionally, Drp1 can alter mitochondria across dendritic regions. From the images it seems that only proximal dendrites are examined. It will be important to analyze the mitochondria across the dendritic field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that it is crucial to quantify mitochondrial morphology. In the revised manuscript, we included quantification of mitochondrial size in both proximal and distal regions along dendrites (Figure 3D-F). In addition, we measured mitochondrial size in the postsynaptic region using electron microscopy (Figure 2O and 2P. â dynasore). The new results from both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy show that the loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> does not affect mitochondrial morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the last sentence of the Abstract the authors state that their results suggest that DRP1-<sub>ABCD</sub> controls morphology and function through surface trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors at postsynapses. Inclusion of more details throughout the manuscript that relate the endocytosis findings to receptor trafficking would help support this conclusion and make it understandable to readers unfamiliar with the neurotransmitter receptor trafficking field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important suggestion. As described in our responses to reviewer 1 (Comment 1) and reviewer 2 (Comment 1 and 4), we performed new experiments and substantiated our conclusion that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> regulate postsynaptic endocytosis. However, we do not know what critical endocytic cargos are for dendritic morphogenesis at this moment. Therefore, we toned down the statements about the involvement of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in neurotransmitter receptor trafficking in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We were helped in making our decision by the original reviewers, who read your revised manuscript. They all agreed that your changes had strengthened the story, and thought it would be helpful to include an illustration or model demonstrating how Drp1 <sub>ABCD</sub> might function in postsynaptic endocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their supportive comments regarding our manuscript. As recommended, we have expanded a model for the function of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> in the revised version of Figure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also suggested a couple of additional experiments. First, there seems to be a discrepancy between the EM data in Figure 2Q, showing more CCPs at the postsynaptic terminal under basal conditions in the KO cells, and the light microscopy data in Figure 3 A-B, which appears to show less clathrin at the postsynaptic terminal terminal. The reviewer who pointed this out felt that you needed more direct evidence for your hypothesis that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> regulates cargo recycling and suggested that you investigate the localisation of AMPA receptors in your KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. Figures 3A and 3B show that a larger population of PSD95-marked synapses lack an endocytic zone in Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons (30-35%) compared with WT neurons (15-20%). These numbers are similar to those reported for disrupted Homer, an adaptor protein that connect the postsynaptic density and endocytic zone (Lu et al., 2007). Our data suggest that Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> is important for the connection between postsynaptic density and the endocytic zone. However, the loss of Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> does not dissociate all of the endocytic zone from the postsynaptic density. Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> likely regulates the connection of postsynaptic density with a clathrin pool in a fraction of synapses (Figure 3G).</p><p>We speculate that decreased levels of clathrin in the synapses in Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons would slow the progression of endocytosis. In these synapses, clathrin-coated pits initiate formation, but the maturation of clathrin-coated pits is likely decreased due to limited availability of clathrin molecules. As a result, coated pits are accumulated at relatively early stages of endocytosis (e.g., shallow and U-shaped clathrin-coated pits) (Figure 2L). This model could explain why the number of coated pits is increased while the levels of clathrin are decreased.</p><p>The suggested experiment to examine the localization of the AMPA receptor further helped us develop our model. In the revised manuscript, we analyzed the surface localization of GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 using two different approaches. First, we labeled surface proteins using biotin in WT and Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>-KO neurons and found that the surface levels of these receptors are similar in WT and KO neurons (Figure 3C and 3D). Second, we examined the internalization of GluR1 in response to chemical LTP using GluR1-GFP. We found that GluR1 was similarly internalized after chemical LTP in WT and KO neurons (Figure 3E and 3F). These data suggest that GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 are not cargos for the endocytic pathway regulated by Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub>. We plan to identify cargos in the Drp1<sub>ABCD</sub> pathway in our future study. We believe that the identification of such cargos is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other suggested experiment was to carry out a similar study to the one in supplementary Figure 6, showing a lack of effect of dynasore on mitochondrial morphology in MEFs, but this time using neurons as in Figure 3D. Because the labelled mitochondria often overlap, it will be important to show how you measure your mitochondrial length. Both of these experiments appear to be straightforward enough to complete within two months.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting another critical experiment. As suggested, we have analyzed mitochondrial morphology in hippocampal neurons after dynasore treatments. New data show that, consistent with the MEFs data, dynasore did not affect mitochondrial morphology in these neurons (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-C). To minimize the effects of overlaps of mitochondria observed in 2D images, we used serial Z-sections to identify individual mitochondria in this analysis. We have added this description to the revised Materials and methods.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Specifically, there is still the issue of the connection between the phenotypes, which has not been solved.
