Then, the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore in tiny finger-like projections, whose formation requires the mother cell SpoIIDMP protein complex.

One such process is bacterial sporulation: in stressful conditions, bacteria like <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> can divide to produce a smaller cell called a forespore, which the larger mother cell then engulfs. The forespore matures into a hardy spore, which is able to survive in harsh environments and only transform into an active bacterium when conditions improve.</p><p>Bacterial cells are surrounded by a stiff layer of a material called peptidoglycan. This wall sits outside of the bacterium’s thin flexible membrane and determines the bacterium’s shape. At the beginning of sporulation, the forespore is separated from the mother cell by a peptidoglycan wall. Engulfment of the spore by the mother cell requires a dramatic change in the shape of this partition.

This includes a cycle of peptidoglycan production and degradation that accompanies the advancing mother cell membrane as it surrounds the forespore during engulfment.

Their cytoplasm is typically devoid of membrane bound organelles, and their cellular morphology relies upon a semi-rigid peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall that imposes its shape on the malleable cell membrane(s). Bacterial cells are inflated by their high internal turgor pressure, which pushes the membranes against the cell wall, causing the PG to stretch and the cell to adopt its appropriate shape. Despite the apparent simplicity, studies in the past few decades have demonstrated that bacterial cellular architecture is far more complex than previously thought, in terms of both its ultrastructure and dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hawver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagstaff and Löwe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Endospore formation in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> represents a striking example of the dynamic capabilities of bacterial cells, as it entails dramatic changes in cellular architecture. First, the division site shifts to polar position, generating a sporangium comprised of two cells: a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Dworkin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan and Ramamurthi, 2014</xref>). The polar septum traps the forespore chromosome, which is subsequently transported to the forespore by SpoIIIE, a membrane-anchored ATPase that assembles a translocation complex at septal midpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bath et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yen Shin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu and Errington, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Errington, 1997</xref>). Chromosome translocation increases the turgor pressure in the forespore, causing it to inflate and expand into the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopez-Garrido et al., 2018</xref>). Simultaneously, the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a process that resembles eukaryotic phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After engulfment, the forespore is fully enclosed within the cytoplasm of the mother cell, where it matures in a process that involves the synthesis of protective layers of cortex and coat, and the partial dehydration of the forespore cytoplasm. Finally, the mother cell lyses and the mature spore is released to the environment, where it remains dormant until the conditions are appropriate for germination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45257.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualizing the 3D architecture of engulfment during sporulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the process of polar septation, chromosome translocation, engulfment and spore maturation.

Such rearrangement likely involves a profound remodeling of the PG cell wall around the forespore, which would otherwise constrain the movement of the engulfing membrane. At the onset of engulfment, the engulfing mother cell membrane must circumvent the physical barrier posed by the septal PG in order to migrate around the forespore. This has led to the logical proposal that engulfment must entail the complete dissolution of the septal PG, a process often referred to as ‘septal thinning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chastanet and Losick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perez et al., 2000</xref>). This proposal was supported by early electron microscopy studies of fixed and stained sporangia showing that engulfment-defective mutants had thicker septa than wild type sporangia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Illing and Errington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rousseau and Hermier, 1975</xref>). Further studies showed that engulfment requires three mother cell proteins: SpoIID, SpoIIM and SpoIIP, which form a complex (DMP) with PG degradation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chastanet and Losick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morlot et al., 2010</xref>). In principle, DMP could mediate the complete dissolution of the septal PG to remove the steric block to the movement of the mother cell membrane around the forespore.</p><p>The idea that septal PG is completely degraded has been more recently challenged by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) images showing that a thin PG layer is present between the forespore and the mother cell membranes throughout engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tocheva et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been shown that DMP-mediated PG degradation is required and rate-limiting for membrane migration even after the septal barrier has been bypassed, suggesting that DMP plays a role separate from the dissolution of septal PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutierrez et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the movement of the mother cell membrane also requires PG synthesis at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these observations, we proposed a revised model for engulfment membrane migration in which coordinated PG synthesis and degradation at the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane moves the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall around the forespore, making room for the engulfing membrane to advance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). This model eliminates the need for complete dissolution of the septal PG and predicts that PG synthesis happens ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. Then, the mother cell DMP degrades this new PG to mediate membrane migration. However, due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy, conclusive evidence that PG synthesis occurs ahead of PG degradation is lacking.</p><p>Cryo-ET allows the visualization of three-dimensional (3D) architecture of bacterial membranes and cell wall in a hydrated near-native state that cannot be achieved by methods reliant on chemical fixation and staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Harush et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matias and Beveridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oikonomou et al., 2016</xref>). However, a limitation of cryo-ET is that the samples must be less than ~500 nm thick to obtain high-resolution tomograms, constraining its application to only a handful of bacteria that are either naturally slender, or, as in the case of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, for which slender mutant strains are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tocheva et al., 2013</xref>). But the latter typically contain mutations in genes involved in PG metabolism and may not be ideal to study cell wall remodeling. Recent application of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has produced artifact-free thin sample sections of ~100–300 nm, which allows the acquisition of high-resolution tomograms of sections of wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rigort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villa et al., 2013</xref>). Cryo-FIB milling coupled with cryo-ET (or cryo-FIB-ET) is therefore becoming the method of choice for studies of cellular architecture of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikeeratisak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopez-Garrido et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used cryo-FIB-ET to study sporulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, revealing the different stages of engulfment with a resolution that has not been achieved previously. We have analyzed wild type sporangia, engulfment mutants, and sporangia treated with PG synthesis inhibitors to obtain new mechanistic insights into the PG transformations that occur during engulfment. First, we provide evidence that septal PG is not degraded completely at the onset of engulfment. Second, we show that during membrane migration, the newly synthesized PG deforms the forespore membrane ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane, indicating that PG synthesis precedes PG degradation. Third, we observe that the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore by forming tiny finger-like projections, the formation of which depends on DMP complexes tethering to and degrading the PG ahead of the engulfing membrane. The methodology, images and analyses presented here will provide valuable resources for future studies of spore assembly and other fundamental cell biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualizing sporulation in wild type <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at molecular resolution</title><p>Recently, we used cryo-FIB-ET to illustrate the role of DNA translocation in inflating the forespore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopez-Garrido et al., 2018</xref>).

Immediately after polar septation, we observed ellipsoidal complexes that were present only in the forespore, adjacent to the membrane and often close to the intersection between the septum and the lateral cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). These structures were observed in 2 out of 7 tomograms of wild type sporangia with flat septa, with ~4 ellipsoidal complexes observed in ~200 nm slices. The 3D reconstruction of these complexes revealed that the ellipsoidal structures had a mean radius of ~45 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>, see Materials and methods). The molecular identity of these structures remains undetermined. We also identified a region approximately in the center of a flat septum where the two membranes are closer together than elsewhere on the septum (14 nm vs. 23 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>).

We observed this thin region in the polar septum and channel-like features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>) in 2 out of 15 tomograms of wild type sporangia with flat and curved septa. The low frequency of observation could be attributed to the fact that we are imaging only ~150–250 nm slices of cells that are over 1 μm wide. So, many tomograms would not include low abundance structures such as SpoIIIE, which is comprised of two adjacent channels. Next, we observed a basement coat layer adjacent to the outer forespore membrane that is likely comprised of SpoVM and/or SpoIVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2009</xref>).

We reasoned that, if the septal PG was completely degraded, we would observe sporangia lacking PG between the mother cell and the forespore membranes after antibiotic treatment. However, if the septal PG was not completely degraded, the sporangia would show a layer of PG around the forespore, independent of antibiotic treatment.</p><p>To inhibit PG synthesis, we treated the cells with bacitracin, cephalexin, penicillin V or a combination of penicillin V and cephalexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We previously assessed the extent of PG inhibition after antibiotic treatment by determining the frequency of division events, which rely on the synthesis of new PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). As expected, our results showed that untreated cells continued to grow and divide under the experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but when treated with cephalexin and penicillin V, cell division was completely blocked. These results also indicated that PG synthesis was inhibited within a few minutes of antibiotic treatment, because cells that were already undergoing septation were unable to complete septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, top panels). To complement this analysis, we tested if these drugs also inhibited elongation, which also depends on PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spratt, 1975</xref>). To do so, we measured the elongation of vegetative cells present in sporulating cultures over a period of one hour after antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, see Materials and methods). The length of wild type untreated vegetative cells increased by ~35% in an hour, but when treated with cephalexin or penicillin V alone, they elongated only ~10%.

To test this, we measured the distance between the forespore and the mother cell membranes across the length of the septum (see Materials and methods) for cells with flat (Stage II<sub>i</sub>), curved (Stage II<sub>ii</sub>) and engulfing (Stage II<sub>iii</sub>) septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since the PG is not completely degraded, it will represent a major obstacle for the advancement of the engulfing membrane. To explain how cells overcome this hurdle, we previously proposed a conceptually new model for engulfment in which coordinated PG synthesis and degradation at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane moves the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall around the forespore, making room for the engulfing mother cell membrane to advance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). In this ‘make before break’ model, new PG would be synthesized ahead of the engulfing membrane by forespore-associated PG biosynthetic complexes and subsequently degraded by DMP. To test this model, we first focused on the shape of the forespore membrane opposing the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane. In wild type sporangia, the forespore membrane was rounded immediately ahead of the engulfing membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This could be due to accumulation of additional PG at this site, which might push and deform the forespore membrane, introducing a broader curve. To confirm this, we analyzed the shape of the forespore membrane of sporangia in which PG synthesis was blocked with either bacitracin or cephalexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and methods).

If the septum is thinner in the presence of antibiotics, it would suggest that additional septal PG is synthesized after the DMP complex advances and degrades the PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. However, if septal thickness is independent of the presence of antibiotics, it would suggest that PG is not normally synthesized behind the DMP complex. Our data showed that the septal thickness of cells treated with cephalexin was comparable to that of untreated cells. Surprisingly, the septal thickness of cells treated with a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V was ~3 nm greater than that of untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This modest increase in septal thickness is of a magnitude that is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations which show that relaxed PG is thicker than stretched PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeby et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that treatment with antibiotics blocking PG synthesis inhibits the stretching of septal PG due to the absence of membrane migration which could pull the septal PG around the forespore. Alternatively, the residual DMP might partially cleave septal PG, releasing the tension and leading to slightly thicker septa. Taken together, in both cases of antibiotic treatment the septal thickness did not decrease compared to untreated sporangia, suggesting that PG is not synthesized behind the DMP complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>3D architecture of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane</title><p>The new PG synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane might interfere with the movement of the engulfing membrane, until it is degraded by DMP. To obtain insights about the movement of the engulfing membrane, we annotated the forespore and the mother cell membranes in our tomograms to visualize the architecture of the leading edge in 3D. Our data showed that the leading edge of the engulfing membrane in wild type sporulating cells moved around the forespore in tiny finger-like projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The projections were ~10–30 nm wide and ~5–20 nm long, with significant variations from cell to cell. We hypothesized that those projections could be due to the uneven degradation of PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. To test this possibility, we imaged <italic>spoIIP</italic> mutant sporangia, which lack a functional DMP complex. As expected, the septum bulged towards the mother cell cytoplasm, but the mother cell membrane did not move forward in these cells. No membrane projections anywhere were observed in the mother cell membrane in any of the tomograms that were annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>).

When treated with antibiotics that block PG synthesis, membrane migration is blocked although the forespore continues to grow into the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). The case of cephalexin-treated cells is more complicated than other antibiotics, because after the septum curves into the mother cell, the leading edge sometimes retracts on one side while advancing slightly on the other (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>). This appears to consist of rotation of the ‘cup’ formed by the bulging septum relative to the lateral cell wall, rather than membrane migration, because the distance between the leading edges does not decrease during this process. Thus, rotation of the septal cup does not reflect the degree to which the forespore is engulfed. Cephalexin inhibits the earliest stages of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kocaoglu and Carlson, 2015</xref>), and therefore we speculate that it might be required to tether the extending septum to the lateral cell wall. In the absence of these bridges, the septum might be free to rotate according to Brownian motion, perhaps anchored by the Q-AH ratchet that can also mediate engulfment in the absence of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broder and Pogliano, 2006</xref>). We used cryo-FIB-ET to compare the architecture of both sides of the engulfing membrane in cephalexin-treated sporangia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–O</xref>).

Also, when cells were treated with penicillin V, we observed fewer projections that were shorter compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Instead, the septum gets slightly (~25%) thinner as it curves into the mother cell, with PG continuously present between the mother cell and the forespore membranes. In addition, the whole septum transitions from thick to thin homogenously, contrary to previous results that suggested that septal thinning started in the middle and progressed towards the edges. The homogenous thinning of the septum can be explained by our previous finding that septal PG is stretched as the forespore grows towards the mother cell due to increased turgor pressure caused by SpoIIIE-mediated chromosome translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopez-Garrido et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, septal thinning could simply represent a change in the conformation of the septal PG, from a relaxed to a stretched state, triggered by the increased turgor pressure in the forespore. This is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations on Gram-positive cell walls, which show that relaxed PG fragments are ~25% thicker than those in a strained conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeby et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results also indicate that DMP is required to maintain a flexible septum that can curve as the forespore grows into the mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that the septa of DMP triple mutants have irregular thickness and are on average thicker than wild type septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). Since DMP is produced after polar septation, the septa of DMP mutant sporangia must have thickened after they have been formed. Thus, it is possible that DMP prevents septal thickening by clearing PG synthases from the septum, where they would accumulate after polar septation. This model is consistent with the increased localization of PBPs throughout the septum in DMP mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that DMP degrades the septal PG partially to generate a flexible septum. If this was the case, the partial degradation should happen simultaneously across the whole septum to enable the homogenous transition from thick to thin. However, since DMP is rate limiting for engulfment, it seems unlikely that there may be enough DMP complexes to mediate the homogeneous thinning of the septum. We therefore favor the model that septal thinning is primarily driven by stretching of septal peptidoglycan.</p><p>Our data also provide insights into the mechanism of membrane migration during engulfment. Using fluorescence microscopy, we previously observed that new PG is synthesized at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tocheva et al., 2013</xref>). We also showed that many forespore penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) can track the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that PG synthesis at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane is carried out by forespore PBPs. The cryo-FIB-ET images presented here provide further support to this idea: the comparison of the architecture of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane between native sporangia and sporangia in which PG synthesis is blocked by antibiotics shows that new PG deforms and rounds the forespore membrane ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), indicating that new PG is synthesized by forespore PBPs immediately ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane. We propose that DMP complexes at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane target this new PG for degradation, making room for the engulfing membrane to advance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). This relatively simple model suggests that engulfment could have evolved by developing new mechanisms to spatially and temporally regulate the conserved protein machineries that synthesize and degrade peptidoglycan.</p><p>The 3D reconstruction of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane shows the presence of finger-like projections that resemble the filopodia of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, these membrane projections are produced by cytoskeletal proteins, and the projections are typically a few micrometers wide. In contrast, no cytoskeletal elements contributing to engulfment have been described so far (or visualized in our tomograms) and the finger-like projections at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane are only a few nanometers wide. Instead, our results demonstrate that DMP is required for the formation of these finger-like projections. The simplest model to explain these data is that DMP tethers the engulfing membrane to the PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, as it degrades the new PG to make room for the engulfing membrane to expand. DMP activity is rate limiting for membrane migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abanes-De Mello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that there is a discrete number of DMP complexes to remove the steric barrier posed by the newly synthesized PG ahead of the leading edge. The limited number of DMP complexes might cause the PG to be degraded irregularly, generating an uneven membrane front in the form of finger-like projections. The distance between the tips of the finger-like projections is ~5–20 nm, which would require that some DMP complexes are ahead of others by 2 to 8 glycan strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2018</xref>). Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the finger-like projections are produced via the tethering of the DMP complex to existing peptidoglycan, since short fingers are observed when PG synthesis is inhibited, and that these fingers are either stabilized or enhanced by binding newly synthesized peptidoglycan, since longer fingers are observed in the presence of ongoing PG synthesis. This is supported by prior studies of the two enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan (D and P), which have shown that these comprise a processive enzyme complex in which P binds and cleaves PG first, allowing D to bind and cleave PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morlot et al., 2010</xref>). Our cell biological data showed that localization of P to the leading edge of the engulfing membrane is decreased but not completely absent when PG synthesis is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ojkic et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that P can bind to existing PG, but that high affinity binding requires newly synthesized peptidoglycan. This increased binding of P would likely allow the formation of longer finger-like projections. From a functional perspective, we speculate that the finger-like projections could be compared to ‘friction ridges’, the minutely raised ridges of the epidermis that provide a grasping surface on our fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomlinson et al., 2007</xref>). During engulfment, these membrane projections may provide the engulfing membrane a tighter lateral grip while moving around the forespore, hence serving as a ratchet that prevents backward movement of the membrane.</p><p>The application of cryo-FIB-ET has been instrumental in allowing us to visualize and accurately measure structural details of engulfing sporangia, which transpire at a scale of a few nanometers. Our studies support a mechanistic model for the enigmatic process of engulfment, while revealing novel architectural details about engulfment and spore assembly, including intriguing new molecular structures that will require further study to unambiguously identify them. Our findings reveal details about sporulation at an unprecedented resolution and further illustrate the potential of cryo-FIB-ET to reveal critical new information about dynamic biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PY79)</td><td valign="top">PY79</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngman et al., 1984</xref>)</td><td valign="top">Tax.

Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Engulfment is a phagocytic-like process that is essential for bacterial sporulation. During engulfment, the mother cell membrane migrates around the developing spore, generating a cell within a cell. Membrane migration involves cell wall synthesis and remodeling events that remain incompletely resolved. In this study, authors use state-of-the-art cryo-FIB-ET to investigate these unresolved aspects in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Their data confirm earlier observations (obtained by ECT, Tocheva et al., 2013) that a layer of PG remains in the intermembrane space separating the mother cell and forespore. In addition, the unprecedented resolution of their images provides new insights into the thickness of this septal PG layer, as well as the morphology of the engulfing membranes at different stages of the engulfment process and upon impaired PG degradation or synthesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While their observations represent a significant contribution to the field, there are two major concerns regarding their conclusions, both based on the fact that the extend of PG inhibition in the presence of antibiotics is not clear:</p><p>- Authors observe finger-like projections associated with migrating membranes. They provide convincing evidence that these projections are associated with the DMP complex and they propose that they result from &quot;tethering of the engulfing membrane to newly synthesized PG via DMP&quot;. However, these finger-like projections are still observed at the leading side of the engulfing membrane, although being less prominent, when PG synthesis is inhibited by cephalexin (Figure 4N and subsection “3D architecture of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane”, second paragraph).</p><p>Do authors really consider that PG synthesis is fully inhibited in the presence of cephalexin? If so, remnant finger-like projections and membrane migration still occurs when PG synthesis is inhibited. They might result from tethering of the engulfing membrane to old PG surrounding the forespore via DMP. In that case, finger-like projections may be stabilized/enhanced (rather than &quot;caused&quot;) by tethering of the engulfing membrane to newly synthesized PG. To resolve this problem, the authors need to test the extent of PG synthesis inhibition by Cephalexin.</p><p>- Figure 4B shows a reduced rounding of the forespore membrane in the presence of antibiotics, providing evidence that PG is synthesized at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. Based on this observation and a previous study (Ojkic et al., 2016), authors propose a model (Figure 5) in which PG is exclusively synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that PG synthesis also happens behind the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, or in other words that PG is resynthesized after degradation by the DMP complex. Indeed, as pointed in the previous point, the fact that membrane migration still happens in the presence of antibiotics again questions whether PG synthesis is fully inhibited. In cells displaying incomplete or asymmetrical engulfment (such as those shown in Figure 2), PG synthesis might have continued for a while and stopped, resulting in septal disks containing newly synthesized PG and leading edges showing impaired PG synthesis. Analysis of septum thickness (as performed in Figure 3B-E) in the presence of antibiotics might shed light on this issue: a thinner septum (but not absent if DMP does not totally degrades septal PG) in the presence of antibiotics would suggest that PG is synthesized behind the DMP complex. If septum thickness is independent of the presence of antibiotics, it suggests that either PG is not synthesized behind the DMP complex or that PG is not fully inhibited in the presence of antibiotics. This uncertainty impacts the hypothesis proposed by the authors because PG synthesis happening behind the DMP complex might explain why a slight and homogenous septal thinning is observed (Figure 3); it might also contribute to the residual PG layer observed in the intermembrane space</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45257.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>This revised version includes additional experiments and analysis to address the reviewers’ comments. Here is a summary of the main points: We did additional experiments to more precisely test the extent of peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis inhibition upon antibiotic treatment to ensure that our results are representative. In addition to using septation as a readout for PG synthesis, we determined the rate of elongation of vegetative cells when treated with different antibiotics and tested two additional drug treatments – penicillin V and a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V. We found that a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V was most effective to ensure complete block of both septation and elongation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Videos 7-10). We also acquired cryo-electron tomography data of wild type sporangia treated with penicillin V and a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2), measured the septal thickness of sporangia treated with cephalexin and a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V, and compared it to untreated sporangia (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The data showed that the septal thickness did not decrease upon antibiotic treatment which suggested that PG synthesis did not precede the mother cell DMP complex. In addition, we have modified the text wherever necessary to explain the impact of antibiotic treatment on septal architecture and engulfment in a more detailed and clear manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While their observations represent a significant contribution to the field, there are two major concerns regarding their conclusions, both based on the fact that the extend of PG inhibition in the presence of antibiotics is not clear:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that determining the extent of PG inhibition in the presence of antibiotics is key for the interpretation of our results.

We expect that the cryo-EM experiments can be completed within 2-3 weeks.

We previously showed that engulfment membrane migration does not continue when PG synthesis is inhibited (see Ojkic et al., 2016, Figure 1 and its supplements), although forespore growth causes the septum to stretch and curve into the mother cell, making it appear that membrane migration has occurred. Measurements of individual cells during timelapse microscopy shows that the distance between the leading edges of the engulfing membrane decreases during engulfment in untreated cells. However, after antibiotic treatment, this distance does not decrease, indicating that the mother cell membrane does not migrate around the forespore. The case of cephalexin-treated cells is more complicated than other antibiotics, because after the septum curves into the mother cell, the leading edge sometimes retracts on one side while advancing slightly on the other. This appears to consist of rotation of the ‘cup’ formed by the bulging septum relative to the lateral cell wall, rather than membrane migration, because the distance between the leading edges does not decrease during this process. Thus, rotation of the septal cup does not increase the degree to which the forespore is engulfed. We are uncertain as to the mechanistic basis for this rotation, but our timelapse experiments indicate that it is a consequence of cephalexin treatment, although it probably also happens after treatment with some penicillins (Ojkic et al. Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Cephalexin inhibits the earliest stages of cell division (Adam et al., 1997; Eberhardt et al., 2003; Kocaoglu et al., 2012), and therefore we speculate that it might be required to tether the extending septum to the lateral cell wall. In the absence of these bridges, the septum might be free to rotate according to Brownian motion, perhaps anchored by the Q-AH ratchet that can also mediate engulfment in the absence of the cell wall (Broder and Pogliano, 2006). We will describe the phenotypes produced by antibiotic treatment more precisely in the text. One area where this will clearly be necessary is where we refer to the side of the membrane that has retracted as the “lagging side” and the other one as the “leading side”, which may have created the misunderstanding that membrane migration happens in cephalexin-treated cells. A revision of this section, and expanded description of the phenotypes, will greatly improve our revised submission.</p><p>Second, the reviewers correctly point out that our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the finger like projections are produced via the tethering of the DMP complex to existing peptidoglycan, since short fingers are observed when PG synthesis is inhibited, and that these fingers are either stabilized or enhanced by binding newly synthesized peptidoglycan, since longer fingers are observed in the presence of ongoing PG synthesis. This is supported by prior studies of the two enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan (D and P), which have shown that these comprise a processive enzyme complex in which P binds and cleaves PG first, allowing D to bind and cleave PG (Morlot and Rudner, 2010). Our cell biological data showed that localization of P to the leading edge of the engulfing membrane is decreased but not completely absent when PG synthesis is inhibited (Ojkic Figure 2F-G and associated supplementary figure), suggesting that P can bind to existing PG, but that high affinity binding requires newly synthesized peptidoglycan. This increased binding of P would likely allow the formation of longer finger like projections. Thus, we thank the reviewers for this suggestion, and will revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>We agree that it is critical to determine the extent of PG inhibition upon antibiotic treatment. The experiments in this manuscript were based on previously published results of time-lapse microscopy in which we assessed if new division events were blocked after antibiotic treatment, thereby using cell division as a read out for PG synthesis (Ojkic et al., Figure 1—figure supplement 2). These studies showed that cell division was completely blocked by cephalexin, indicating that septal PG synthesis was blocked, and that PG synthesis was inhibited within a few minutes of cephalexin treatment, because cells that were already undergoing septation were unable to complete septum formation. To complement this analysis, we will determine the elongation rate of the vegetative cells that are present in sporulating cultures under our experimental conditions, in order to identify an antibiotic or combination of antibiotics that inhibit both septation and elongation, and we will then collect additional cryo-FIB-ET of cells treated with this antibiotic(s). This will allow us to address the question of the extent of PG synthesis inhibition, and the second essential revision (see below). Our preferred antibiotic candidate is Penicillin V, which has a broad affinity for many <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PBPs (Lakaye et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1999; Kocaoglu, 2012), and which our preliminary data indicates severely affects both septation and cell elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4B shows a reduced rounding of the forespore membrane in the presence of antibiotics, providing evidence that PG is synthesized at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane.

As proposed by the reviewers, we have analyzed septal thickness in cephalexin-treated sporangia. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the septal thickness for untreated and cephalexin-treated wild type sporangia is comparable (17.46 ± 1.17 nm for untreated and 18.72 ± 1.13 nm for cephalexin-treated sporangia). This therefore suggests that either PG is not synthesized behind the DMP complex or that PG is not fully inhibited in the presence of antibiotics.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45257-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, our published results (Ojkic et al., 2016) indicate that septal PG synthesis is completely inhibited in cephalexin treated cells, suggesting that PG synthesis does not happen behind DMP. To provide additional evidence on this important point, we will perform the additional experiments explained above to determine if both elongation and septal PG synthesis is completely inhibited by the antibiotics used in our experiments, and if not, to identify an antibiotic treatment or combinatorial treatment that blocks both processes. We will also collect cryo-electron tomograms of sporangia treated with at least one additional antibiotic (probably Penicillin V or a combination of Penicillin V and cephalexin) and perform a similar analysis to further test this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
