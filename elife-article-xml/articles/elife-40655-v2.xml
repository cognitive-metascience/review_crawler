Here, we have screened an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> population of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) for resistance against <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa)</italic>. These lines share the same genetic background, but show variation in heritable patterns of DNA methylation. We identified four epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTLs) that provide quantitative resistance without reducing plant growth or resistance to other (a)biotic stresses. Phenotypic characterisation and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that <italic>Hpa-</italic>resistant epiRILs are primed to activate defence responses at the relatively early stages of infection. Collectively, our results show that hypomethylation at selected pericentromeric regions is sufficient to provide quantitative disease resistance, which is associated with genome-wide priming of defence-related genes. Based on comparisons of global gene expression and DNA methylation between the wild-type and resistant epiRILs, we discuss mechanisms by which the pericentromeric epiQTLs could regulate the defence-related transcriptome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40655.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In plants, animals and microbes genetic information is encoded by DNA, which are made up of sequences of building blocks, called nucleotide bases. These sequences can be separated into sections known as genes that each encode specific traits. It was previously thought that only changes to the sequence of bases in a DNA molecule could alter the traits passed on to future generations. However, it has recently become clear that some traits can also be inherited through modifications to the DNA that do not alter its sequence.</p><p>One such modification is to attach a tag, known as a methyl group, to a nucleotide base known as cytosine. These methyl tags can be added to, or removed from, DNA to create different patterns of methylation. Previous studies have shown that plants whose DNA is less methylated than normal (‘hypo-methylated’) are more resistant to plant diseases. However, the location and identity of the hypo-methylated DNA regions controlling this resistance remained unknown. To address this problem, Furci, Jain et al. studied how DNA methylation in a small weed known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> affects how well the plants can resist a disease known as downy mildew.</p><p>Furci, Jain et al. studied a population of over 100 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines that have the same DNA sequences but different patterns of DNA methylation. The experiments identified four DNA locations that were less methylated in lines with enhanced resistance to downy mildew. Importantly, this form of resistance did not appear to reduce how well the plants grew, or make them less able to resist other diseases or environmental stresses.</p><p>The results of further experiments suggested that reduced methylation at the four DNA regions prime the plant’s immune system, enabling a faster and stronger activation of a multitude of defence genes across the genome after attack by downy mildew.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work are to investigate exactly how the four DNA regions with reduced methylation can prime so many different defence genes in the plant. Further research is also needed to determine whether it is possible to breed crop plants with lower levels of methylation at specific DNA locations to improve disease resistance, but without decreasing the amount and quality of food produced.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>plant immune signalling</kwd><kwd>plant-microbe interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0237EPIMOBILE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colot</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>European Commission Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>291763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johannes</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johannes</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RL-2012-042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ton</surname><given-names>Jurriaan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>309944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ton</surname><given-names>Jurriaan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L008939/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ton</surname><given-names>Jurriaan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P006698/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ton</surname><given-names>Jurriaan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> identified four hypomethylated DNA loci controlling quantitative disease resistance, which is associated with genome-wide priming of defence genes without affecting plant growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cytosine methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability. In plants, this form of DNA methylation occurs at three sequence contexts: CG, CHG and CHH, where H indicates any base except guanine (G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vanyushin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). Patterns of plant DNA methylation in the plant genome can remain stable over multiple generations and influence heritable phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quadrana and Colot, 2016</xref>). Recent evidence has suggested that reduced DNA methylation increases the responsiveness of the plant immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espinas et al., 2016</xref>) This ‘priming’ of plant defence enables an augmented induction of defence-related genes after pathogen attack, causing increased levels of quantitative resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prime-A-Plant Group et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conrath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez-Medina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liégard et al., 2018</xref>). In some cases, priming of defence-related genes is associated with post-translational histone modifications that mark a more open chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luna et al., 2012</xref>). Additional evidence for epigenetic regulation of plant immunity has come from independent studies reporting that disease-exposed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> produces progeny that expresses transgenerational acquired resistance (TAR), which is associated with priming of defence-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slaughter et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants that are impaired in the establishment or maintenance of DNA methylation mimic TAR-related priming without prior priming stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luna and Ton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, the hyper-methylated <italic>ros1-4</italic> mutant, which is impaired in active DNA de-methytation, is more susceptible to biotrophic pathogens, affected in defence gene responsiveness, and impaired in TAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, DNA (de)methylation determines quantitative disease resistance by influencing the responsiveness of defence-related genes. However, causal evidence that selected hypomethylated DNA loci are responsible for the meiotic transmission of this form of quantitative disease resistance is lacking.</p><p>Epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) have been developed with the aim to study the epigenetic basis of heritable plant traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinders et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johannes et al., 2009</xref>). EpiRILs show little differences in DNA sequence, but vary substantially in DNA methylation. A commonly used population of epiRILs is derived from a cross between the Arabidopsis wild-type (Wt) accession Col-0 and the <italic>decreased DNA methylation1-2</italic> (<italic>ddm1-2</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johannes et al., 2009</xref>). The DDM1 protein is a chromatin re-modelling enzyme that provides DNA methyltransferase enzymes access to heterochromatic transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeddeloh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brzeski and Jerzmanowski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation causes loss of pericentromeric heterochromatin and reduced DNA methylation in all sequence contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kakutani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). Although the epiRILs from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> x Col-0 cross do not carry the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation, they contain stably inherited hypomethylated DNA regions from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent, which are maintained up to 16 generations of self-pollination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johannes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colomé-Tatché et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latzel et al., 2013</xref>). A core set of 123 epiRILs from this population at the eight generation of self-pollination in the wild-type (Wt) background has been characterized for differentially methylated region (DMR) markers, enabling linkage mapping of heritable hypomethylated loci controlling root growth, flowering and abiotic stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liégard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooke et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have characterised the core set of 123 lines from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> x Col-0 epiRIL population for resistance against the biotrophic downy mildew pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<italic>Hpa</italic>) to search for heritable hypomethylated loci controlling disease resistance. We identified four of these epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTLs), accounting for 60% of the variation in disease resistance. None of these epiQTLs were associated with growth impairment, indicating that the resistance does not incur major physiological costs on plant development. Further phenotypic characterisation and transcriptome analysis of selected <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant epiRILs revealed that their resistance is associated with genome-wide priming of defence-related genes. Interestingly, bisulfite sequencing did not reveal defence regulatory genes inside the epiQTL regions that were simultaneously primed and hypomethylated, suggesting that DDM1-dependent DNA methylation at the epiQTLs <italic>trans</italic>-regulates the responsiveness of distant defence genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of epiQTLs controlling quantitative resistance against <italic>Hpa</italic></title><p>To examine the role of DDM1-dependent DNA methylation in heritable disease resistance, 123 epiRILs from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> x Col-0 cross were analysed for <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance and compared to siblings of the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, red), the Wt parent (Col-0), and five progenies thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, green). Leaves of 3-week-old plants were inoculated with <italic>Hpa</italic> conidiospores and then collected for trypan-blue staining at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). Microscopic classification of leaves into four classes of <italic>Hpa</italic> colonisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed 51 epiRILs with statistically enhanced levels of resistance compared to each susceptible Wt line (Pearson’s Chi-squared tests, p&lt;0.05). Of these, eight epiRILs showed similar levels of <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance as the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, dark blue triangles; Pearson’s Chi-squared test, p&gt;0.05), whereas 43 epiRILs showed intermediate levels of resistance. To identify the epiQTL(s) responsible for the observed variation in <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance, the categorical classification of <italic>Hpa</italic> infection was converted into a single value numerical resistance index (RI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, bottom graph). Using a linkage map of stably inherited DMR markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colomé-Tatché et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S1), interval mapping revealed four statistically significant epiQTLs on chromosomes I, II, IV and V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The epiQTL on chromosome II had the highest logarithm of odds (LOD) value. For all epiQTLs, the DMR markers with the highest LOD scores (‘peak markers’) showed a positive correlation between <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotype and RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), indicating that the hypomethylated haplotype from <italic>ddm1-2</italic> increases resistance against <italic>Hpa</italic>. A linear regression model to calculate the percentage of RI variance explained by each peak marker (<italic>R (2)(g)</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>) confirmed that the DMR peak marker of the epiQTL on chromosome II had the strongest contribution to RI variation. Using an additive model, the combined contribution of all epiQTL peak markers to RI variation (<italic>R<sup>2</sup>(G)</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>) was estimated at 60.0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40655.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping of epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTL) controlling transgenerational resistance against <italic>Hyaloperonosopra arabidopsidis</italic> (<italic>Hpa)</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Levels of <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance in 123 epiRIL lines, the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> line (F4; red triangle) and six Wt lines (Col-0; green triangles).

Frequent transposition events in the epiRILs are nevertheless rare as most DNA hypomethylation occurs at relic transposons that have lost the ability to transpose, and the occurrence of independent transposition events at similar loci is extremely unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colomé-Tatché et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>). However, it is possible that transposition events originating from the heavily hypomethylated <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent were crossed into the population, resulting into shared transposition events (STEs) between multiple epiRILs, which could have contributed to variation in resistance. To account for this possibility, we compared the genomic DNA sequences of the four epiQTL intervals from 122 epiRILs (LOD drop-off = 2) for the presence of STEs in more than two epiRILs, using TE-tracker software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilly et al., 2014</xref>).

None of the STEs in the epiQTL on chromosome I showed statistically significant linkage with RI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S2). Accordingly, we conclude that the segregating <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance in the epiRIL population is caused by epigenetic variation in DNA methylation, rather than genetic variation by STEs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of the resistance epiQTLs on plant growth and resistance against other (a) biotic stresses</title><p>Expression of inducible defence mechanisms is often associated with physiological costs, resulting in reduced plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huot et al., 2014</xref>).

The second group of genes had been selected for enhanced <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the epiRILs, using the following criteria (Wald tests, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05): (<italic>i</italic>) <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible in the Wt (#602), (<italic>ii</italic>) <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible in the epiRIL(s) and (<italic>iii</italic>) displaying statistically increased accumulation in <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated epiRILs compared to <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated Wt plants (‘Group 2’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). For each epiRIL, we identified more genes in Group 2 than in Group 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> datasets S5 and S6). This difference was most pronounced at 48 hpi, which represents a critical time-point for host defence against <italic>Hpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koch and Slusarenko, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soylu and Soylu, 2003</xref>). Analysis of a statistical interaction between epi-genotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment revealed that &gt;92% of all genes in Group 2 are significant for this interaction term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S7), indicating a constitutively primed expression pattern. Visualisation of the expression profiles in heatmaps confirmed this notion, showing that the induction of Group 2 genes by <italic>Hpa</italic> is strongly augmented in the resistant epiRILs compared to the Wt line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), which is consistent with the definition of plant defence priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez-Medina et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To examine the functional contributions of the <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes in Groups 1 and 2, we employed gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. After exclusion of redundant GO terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jantzen et al., 2011</xref>), we identified 469 GO terms, for which one or more of the sets showed statistically significant enrichment. Group 2 genes at 48 hpi displayed dramatically enhanced GO term enrichment compared to all other sets, which was obvious for all epiRILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This enrichment was particularly pronounced for 111 GO terms relating to SA-dependent and SA-independent defence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S8), which supports our phenotypic characterisation of SA-dependent and SA-independent defence markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the quantitative resistance of the epiRILs is based on priming of <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible defence genes.</p><p>Interestingly, compared to the other gene selections, a relatively large proportion of defence-related genes in Group 2 at 48 hpi was shared between all four epiRILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), pointing to relatively high similarity in the augmented immune response of the epiRILs. Furthermore, only 5% of the genes in the Group 1% and 6.5% of the genes in Group 2 are physically located within the borders of the epiQTL intervals (LOD drop-off = 2). The frequency of Group 1 and 2 genes relative to all other genes was significantly lower for the epiQTL regions compared to the entire <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (14.6%; Pearson’s Chi-squared test, p&lt;0.05). Thus, the majority of <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible Group 1 and 2 genes showing enhanced expression in the more resistant epiRILs are (<italic>trans</italic>-)regulated by DNA methylation at the four epiQTLs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The resistance epiQTLs do not contain defence genes that are <italic>cis</italic>-regulated by DNA methylation, suggesting involvement of <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mechanisms</title><p>Although 92% of all genes in Group 2 were located outside the physical borders of the four epiQTL intervals (LOD-drop-off=2), we hypothesized that a small set of defence regulatory genes inside the epiQTL regions are directly (<italic>cis</italic>-)regulated by DNA methylation to mediate augmented levels of defence in response to <italic>Hpa</italic> infection. Since the Group 2 genes were strongly enriched with defence-related GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), we examined whether their augmented expression during <italic>Hpa</italic> infection is associated with the hypomethylated <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotype. To this end, we calculated for each gene in Group 2 the ratio of normalized transcript abundance between <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated epiRIL and the <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated Wt line, which is proportional to their level of augmented expression during <italic>Hpa</italic> infection. Hierarchical clustering of these ratios enabled us to select for genes that exclusively show augmented expression when associated with the hypomethylated <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotype of the corresponding epiQTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

To confirm the hypomethylated status of these genes, we performed comprehensive bisulfite sequencing analysis of DNA methylation for the four epiRILs and the Wt line. DMR analysis of the gene body (GB), 2 kb promoter region (P) and 1 kb downstream (D) regions confirmed that the levels of augmented gene expression of the 279 genes in cluster II do not correlate positively with the extent of DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Furthermore, analysis of the genomic context of the six protein-coding genes revealed the presence of overlapping and/or nearby TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that their correlation between augmented expression and DNA hypomethylation is determined by association with TEs.

The combined contribution of all 4 DMR peak markers was estimated at 60% of the total variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), which is higher than previously reported variation in developmental plant traits for this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latzel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooke et al., 2015</xref>). It was previously shown that half of all stably inherited DMRs in the Col-0 x <italic>ddm1-2</italic> epiRILs also occur in natural Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latzel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>). Considering that the epiRIL population includes heritable variation in a range of ecologically important plant traits, including flowering, root growth, nutrient plasticity and (a)biotic stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latzel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortijo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kooke et al., 2015</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that variation in DDM1-dependent DNA methylation contributes to natural variation and environmental adaptation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Indeed, the phenotypic diversity in the Col-0 x <italic>ddm1-2</italic> epiRIL population closely resembles that of natural <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mauch-Mani et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, independent studies have shown that high levels of enduring (a)biotic stress can trigger transgenerational acquired resistance (TAR) in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wibowo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rasmann et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, repeated inoculation of 2- to 5 weeks old Arabidopsis seedlings with the hemi-biotrophic leaf pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> causes TAR, which is associated with reduced transcription of <italic>DDM1</italic> gene in local leaves that is maintained in the apical meristem of paternal plants (Furci and Ton, unpublished results). To what extent this this prolonged repression in <italic>DDM1</italic> gene transcription causes heritable reduction in DNA methylation at the epiQTLs requires further study.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aller et al. (2018)</xref> have recently used the same Col-0 x <italic>ddm1-2</italic> epiRIL population to map the contribution of heritable variation in DNA methylation to the production of defence-related glucosinolate metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aller et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the resistance epiQTL on chromosome I from our study partially overlaps with an epiQTL that influences basal production of the aliphatic glucosinolate 3-methylthiopropyl (3MTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aller et al., 2018</xref>). Glucosinolates contribute to defence against both herbivores and microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, myrosinase-dependent breakdown products of indole-derived 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate have been linked to the regulation of callose-mediated cell wall defence in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bednarek et al., 2009</xref>). However, the 3MTP-controlling epiQTL identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aller et al. (2018)</xref> was relatively weak compared to the epiQTL controlling <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that its contribution to <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance would at most be marginal. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis revealed that the largest variation in gene expression between epiRILs and the Wt line comes from the transcriptional response to <italic>Hpa</italic>, rather than differences in basal gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). Moreover, the genes in Group 2, which displayed enhanced <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the resistant epiRILs at the critical early time-point of 48 hpi, were strongly enriched with defence-related GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The majority of these Group 2 genes showed a statistically significant interaction between epi-genotype and <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S7), indicating that these epiRILs were primed to activate defence-related genes. This notion was supported by the actual expression profiles of Group 2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), as well as the defence phenotypes of the eight most resistant epiRILs in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, our epiRIL screen for growth phenotypes demonstrated that the resistance-controlling epiQTLs do not have a major impacts on plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings that defence priming is a low-cost defence strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Hulten et al., 2006</xref>). While we cannot exclude other mechanisms, these independent lines of evidence collectively indicate that genome-wide priming of defence genes is the most plausible mechanism by which the epiQTLs mediate quantitative disease resistance in the population.</p><p>Over recent years, various studies have established a link between DNA hypomethylation and plant immune priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espinas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conrath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>). However, causal evidence that heritable regions of reduced DNA methylation mediate transgenerational disease resistance is lacking. Our study has shown that heritable regions of hypomethylated DNA are sufficient to mediate resistance in a genetic Wt background. Furthermore, our study is the first to link phenotypic and epigenetic variation of selected epiRILs to profiles of global gene expression, revealing that epigenetically controlled resistance is associated with genome-wide priming of defence-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The majority of these pathogenesis-related genes showed augmented induction at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which represents a critical early time-point in the interaction between Arabidopsis and <italic>Hpa</italic>, during which hyphae from germinating spores start to penetrate the epidermal cell layer and invade the mesophyll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koch and Slusarenko, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soylu and Soylu, 2003</xref>). Notably, this set of primed genes was substantially more enriched in SA-dependent and SA-independent defence GO terms than the set of <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes that were constitutively up-regulated in <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant epiRILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), corroborating the analysis of phenotypical defence markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>DNA methylation of TEs has been reported to <italic>cis</italic>-regulate expression of nearby genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soppe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saze and Kakutani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinoshita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, our study did not find evidence that DNA methylation in the epiQTLs <italic>cis</italic>-regulates the responsiveness of nearby of defence genes. Firstly, the majority of primed defence genes in the <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant epiRILs were located outside the epiQTL intervals (92%). Secondly, of all primed genes within the epiQTLs, only 73 showed augmented induction that coincided with DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S10). Of these, 67 encoded TEs or TE-related genes, while the six protein-encoding genes were closely associated with one or more TEs and did not have functions related plant defence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> dataset S10). Since TEs do not encode defence signalling proteins, we propose that DNA hypomethylation at the TE-rich epiQTLs mediates augmented induction of defence genes across the genome via <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms. A recent transcriptome study of <italic>Hpa</italic>-infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> identified 166 defence-related genes that were primed in the hypomethylated <italic>nrpe1-11</italic> mutant and/or repressed in hyper-methylated <italic>ros1-4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of these defence genes were not targeted by NRPE1- and/or ROS1-dependent DNA (de)methylation, indicating that their responsiveness is <italic>trans</italic>-regulated by DNA methylation. Although NRPE1 and ROS1 target partially different genomic loci than DDM1<sup>20</sup>, this study supports our hypothesis that DNA methylation controls global defence gene responsiveness via <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms.</p><p>There are various mechanisms by which DNA methylation could <italic>trans</italic>-regulate defence gene expression. It is possible that transcribed TEs in the hypomethylated epiQTLs generate 21-22nt or 24nt small RNAs (sRNAs) that influence distant heterochromatin formation through via RDR6- and DCL3-dependent RdDM pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panda et al., 2016</xref>). Support for <italic>trans</italic>-regulation by sRNAs came from a recent study, which reported that induction and subsequent re-silencing of pericentromeric TEs in Arabidopsis upon <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection is accompanied with accumulation of RdDM-related sRNAs that are complementary to TEs and distal defence genes. Interestingly, while the accumulation of these sRNAs coincided with re-silencing of the complementary TEs, the complementary defence genes remained expressed in the infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cambiagno et al., 2018</xref>). These findings are supported by another recent study, which demonstrated that AGO1-associated small RNAs can <italic>trans</italic>-activate distant defence gene expression through interaction with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Apart from sRNAs, it is also possible that long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) from the hypomethylated epiQTLs regulate pathogen-induced expression of distant defence genes. A recent study revealed that pericentromeric TEs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can produce DDM1-dependent lincRNAs that are increased by abiotic stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>). Since lincRNAs can promote euchromatin and heterochromatin formation at distant genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinodoz and Guttman, 2014</xref>), hypomethylated TEs within the epiQTLs could generate priming-inducing lincRNAs. While knowledge about lincRNAs in plants remains limited, like sRNAs, their activity depends on sequence complementary with target loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vance and Ponting, 2014</xref>). Unlike non-coding RNAs, long-range chromatin interactions can <italic>trans</italic>-regulate gene expression independently of sequence complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmston and Lenhard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>). Previous high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis revealed that the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation has a profound impact on long-range chromatin interactions within and beyond the pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). Projection of these DDM1-dependent interactions onto the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome shows extensive coverage of the resistance epiQTLs identified in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Whether these long-range interactions contribute to <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of defence gene priming would require further study, including a fully replicated Hi-C analysis of the resistant epiRILs characterised in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has shown that heritable DNA hypomethylation at selected pericentromeric regions controls quantitative disease resistance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is associated with genome-wide priming of defence-related genes. This transgenerational resistance is not associated with reductions in plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), nor does it negatively affect resistance to other types of (a)biotic stresses tested in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, whether this form of epigenetically controlled resistance can be exploited in crops depends on a variety of factors, including the stability of the disease resistance and potential non-target effects. For instance, our experiments with Arabidopsis revealed that the resistance has limited stability and can erode over one more generation in some epiRILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, the genomes of most crop species contain substantially higher numbers of TEs, rendering predictions about the applicability and potentially undesirable side effects on growth and seed production uncertain. Future research will have to point out whether introgression of hypomethylated pericentromeric loci into the background of elite crop varieties allows for selection of meta-stable quantitative disease resistance without side-effects on agronomically important traits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, accession Col-0) were purchased from Versailles Arabidopsis Stock Centre, INRA, France (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://publiclines.versailles.inra.fr/epirils/index">http://publiclines.versailles.inra.fr/epirils/index</ext-link>).

Reactions were performed using previously described primer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López Sánchez et al., 2016</xref>).

Every epi-genotype/treatment/time-point combination was based on three biologically replicated samples, each consisting of 6–12 shoots from different plants. Initial RNA extraction was performed as described for RT-qPCR reactions. Prior to library preparation, RNA concentration and integrity were measured, using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with provided reagents kits and according to manufacturer’s instructions. All RNA samples had RNA integrity numbers (RIN) &gt;7.5. Sequencing libraries were prepared from total RNA, using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit and Ribo-Zero Plant leaf kit (Illumina, RS-122–2401), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing runs were performed on a HiSeq1500 platform (Illumina), generating paired-end reads of 125 bp and an average quality score (Q30) &gt;93%. Each sample generated around 35 million paired reads.</p><p>Read quality was assessed by FastQC software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Read length and distribution were optimized and adapter sequences were trimmed, using Trimmomatic software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>).

For all samples, more than 95% of reads could successfully be mapped once or more onto the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. Number of reads per gene were quantified with the Python package <italic>HTseq</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Differential expression analysis was performed using the <italic>DESeq2</italic> R package, which applies a negative binomial generalized linear model to estimate mean and dispersion of gene read counts from the average expression strength between samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to principal component analysis (PCA) by the <italic>plotPCA</italic> function, gene read counts were subjected to regularized logarithmic transformation, using the <italic>rlog</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Likelihood ratio tests of variance within a three-factorial linear model for epigenotype, treatment, time-point and interactions thereof were used to identify genes showing differences in expression across one or more factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to hierarchical clustering (Ward method) and presented as a heat map, using the <italic>pheatmap</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolde, 2015</xref>). For each gene, <italic>rlog</italic>-normalized read counts of each sample were subtracted from the mean of all samples, and divided by the standard deviation to facilitate heatmap visualisation (z-score). To identify DEGs between two treatment/time-point/epi-genotype combinations, pair-wise comparisons (Wald test; <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) were performed with the DEGs selection obtained by the <italic>lrt</italic> test, using the selection criteria illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>. All <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes in the Wt and/or epiRILs were selected for elevated expression in the more resistant epiRILs during <italic>Hpa</italic> infection. Subsequently, these genes were divided between two groups based on their expression profile. Group 1 genes were selected for constitutively enhanced expression in the epiRIL(s) relative to the Wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>); Group 2 genes were selected for enhanced levels of <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the epiRIL(s) relative to the Wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). To determine the number of Group 2 genes that show a statistically significant interaction between epigenotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment (all 16,009 genes significant for this interaction were selected from the three-factorial linear model, using the <italic>contrast</italic> function, and cross-referenced against Group 2 genes.</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed with the Plant GSEA toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). GO terms were checked for significant enrichment against the whole genome background, using a hypergeometric test and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05). Lists of enriched GO terms in each treatment were analysed by the GO Trimming 2.0 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jantzen et al., 2011</xref>) to remove redundancy of terms, applying a soft trimming threshold of 0.40. The output list from GO Trimming 2.0 was run through GOSlim Viewer (AgBase) to reduce GO terms according to GO slim ontologies (GO consortium). Enrichment was quantified as the percentage of GO term-annotated genes within a certain selection relative to the total number of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes in that GO term.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Methylome analysis</title><p>For each line, three independent biological replicates were collected, consisting of pooled leaves from six plants of the same developmental stage. High-quality genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of 5-week-old plants, using the GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Bisulfite sequencing was performed by GATC Biotech (UK). After quality trimming of read sequences, adapter sequences were removed, and reads were filtered by Cutadapt (version 1.9; Pair end-mode; phred score = 20, min.length = 40). Reads were mapped to an index genome, using of BS-Seeker2 (version 2.0.10, mismatch = 0.05, maximum insert size = 1000 bp). Bowtie2 (version 2.2.2) was used for alignment of reads, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauss et al., 2018</xref>). Differential methylation for promoter regions (−2 kb), gene bodies, and downstream regions (+1 kb) relative to the Wt was called using methylkit (version 1.0.0; minimum coverage = 5 x, <italic>q</italic> = 0.05). Differentially methylated states were visualised as a heat map, using the ‘<italic>pheatmap</italic>’ R package (version 1.0.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolde, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To differentiate Wt methylation states of all epiQTL-based genes in Group 2 (see above), gene bodies of all nuclear genes were categorised between un-methylated, gene body methylated (gbM; CG context only) or TE-like methylated (teM; CHG and/or CHH with or without CG). For each gene containing 20 or more cytosines, methylated and un-methylated cytosine base calls in each context were extracted from the sequence read alignments. Positions with less than 4x coverage were ignored. Methylation patterns were categorised as TE-like if methylated read calls relative to un-methylated read calls in CHG and/or CHH contexts showed a statistically significant increase over average methylation rates of all genes across the genome in the respective context, using the ‘<italic>binom.test</italic>’ function in R (FDR-adjusted p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.01). The remaining genes were classified either as gbM if the same test revealed a statistically significant increase in CG context, or as un-methylated if no statistically significant increase in DNA methylation could be detected in any sequence context.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Correlation analysis between gene expression and DNA methylation</title><p>Correlations between augmented expression ratio of Group 2 genes (see Transcriptome analysis) and DNA hypomethylation (CG), were determined by plotting augmented gene ratios at 48 hpi against average hypomethylation compared to Wt (%) across promoter region, gene body, and downstream region (see Methylome analysis). To determine which type of DNA hypomethylation correlates with augmented expression in the epiRILs, hypomethylation at gene bodies of Group 2 genes were divided between teM and gbM and plotted against the corresponding expression ratios at 48 hpi. If hypomethylation occurred at CG context only, genes were classified as being reduced in gene body methylation (gbM); if hypomethylation occurred all three sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH), genes were classified as being reduced in TE methylation (teM). Values of gbM hypomethylation were expressed as percentage reduction in GC methylation relative to the Wt; values of teM hypomethylation were expressed as percentage reduction in all sequence contexts. Linear regression analyses were performed using R software (v.3.5.1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Hi-C analysis</title><p>HiC sequence libraries SRR1504819 and SRR1504824<sup>64</sup> were downloaded from NCBI SRA.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification and characterisation of epigenetic loci controlling transgenerational immune priming in Arabidopsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work utilizes a collection of epiRILs to show that there is potential epigenetic variation in controlling defense responses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussion, there were considered two essential components that need addressing to make the manuscript publishable in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First, it was felt that the work is highly interesting in itself but that at a number of locations, claims were made that were not supported by the data at best and occasionally contradictory information was available in other papers. As such, it was agreed that the authors should use the guidance in the reviews to rewrite the manuscript to more precisely focus on what has and has not been shown in this manuscript and others.</p><p>Second, we all agreed that the Hi-C was a potentially interesting idea but that the claims were unsupported. To support the claims would require doing Hi-C in the specific epiRILs or drop it from the manuscript at this point in time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>– If they were just honest about what they found, it would be a really nice paper and I would support it for <italic>eLife</italic>. But their claims are simply unjustified by their analysis.</p><p>The authors map epiQTLs that link to resistance to <italic>Hpa</italic>, then assess potential epigenetic influences on transcripts and how this may be priming. Finally, the authors look for chromatin interactions in WT/<italic>ddm1</italic> and use them to argue that this is the mechanism. The data itself is very nice. but I find that the claims are not justified based on the conducted analysis. The experiments and data themselves will be very useful but the authors would need to focus on what they do show. To illustrate, they nicely map resistance epiQTLs and do some really nice transcriptomics. Just presenting that as plainly as what they found would be interesting.</p><p>In contrast, the writing makes extensive claims about priming, transgenerational and chromatin interactions. The transgenerational argument is trying to link in with the work showing that there is one-generation of disease effects on resistance. However, there is no analysis of if their loci really play any role in this phenomena. They just have loci whose <italic>ddm1</italic> marks lead to altered resistance. They would have to show that these same loci influence the transgenerational resistance phenomena to make their arguments.</p><p>The chromatin interactions are all done in <italic>ddm1</italic> v. WT and not in the epiRILs v. WT or v. <italic>ddm1</italic> so I'm not sure they can actually make their claims. Wouldn't they need to look at interactions in the epiRILs to make any of these arguments.</p><p>Priming concerns –</p><p>I should caveat the following in that I have some quant/eco/evo training in my background so I go by a very strict definition of priming; a pre-treatment leads to an elevated response to a secondary treatment that cannot be explained by any effect of the pre-treatment. Similar to the definition I work off of for epistasis. The effect of A x B is not explainable by adding up the effect of A and B separately.</p><p>Given this definition, the transcriptomics analysis does not make a direct test of priming. The authors use pairwise analysis which do not allow for a statistical testing of priming directly. To claim priming would require re-analyzing the data with a linear model where Transcript = genotype + treatment + genotype x treatment. And only the transcripts with a significant genotype x treatment term would fit into what might be called priming. Priming is the interaction term rather than the main effect of genotype or treatment.</p><p>This concern about what is or is not priming, arises from their own data that argues against priming even when they say it argues for priming. If you notice in Figure 2B, the PCA plot actually shows that the main transcript variance in the epiRILs are not priming but mainly constitutive changes as the change from Mock to <italic>Hpa</italic> infected is a similar level of variance in each genotype. If it was truly a predominantly priming effect, the uninduced would all be similar to the WT uninduced. Figure 2—figure supplement 2A also shows my worry about priming. If you look at the plots for what a primed transcript looks like, only 2 of those five plots would truly fit what is priming.</p><p>The authors argue that priming is the sole thing altered and that other defense traits aren't influenced. There are a couple of potential issues with this exclusionary arguments. The use of the 8 most resistance epiRIL lines to test other interactions is not really evidence of much. There isn't enough statistical power to say anything other than they aren't exactly 100% the same traits. It is possible that there is still a correlation. Additionally, at least one if not two of their loci are linked to variation in defense metabolism in this population based on previous work looking at epigenetic variation in defense metabolites within population. This shows that there are defense traits that are altered in these lines prior to infection. This previous work should be cited and incorporated appropriately when discussing the authors results as it contradicts the central claim about exclusivity of effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study uses the <italic>ddm1</italic> epiRIL population to identify QTL controlling resistance to. At least four epiQTL are identified which contribute &gt;50% of the heritable variation. To explore these epiQTL further, transcriptome and methylome analyses were performed. These experiments revealed that four of the epiRIL lines with the highest resistance display a heightened transcriptome response to <italic>Hpa</italic> indicating these lines are already primed. This enhanced priming explains why the lines are not suffering a growth defect as there is not a constitutive response to <italic>Hpa</italic> or other a/biotic stresses. To understand how the priming of <italic>Hpa</italic> induced genes occurs the DNA methylome data were integrated, which generally revealed that the loci within the QTL regions were not directly affected by loss of DNA methylation and that perhaps there is a genome-wide trans affect occurring in these lines due to the global loss of DNA methylation. To provide a mechanistic explanation for how this could occur the authors hypothesize that long range chromatin interactions could be in play. To test this, Hi-C data from WT and <italic>ddm1</italic> was analyzed to revealed the existence of long range chromatin interaction between the QTL and the affected defence genes.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study, especially with the identification of epiRILs that are resistant to Hpa seemingly with no growth defects. However, the causal basis for these phenotypes requires additional evidence. The use of Hi-C is innovative, but it does not prove the strong statement made in the subsection “DDM1-dependent chromatin interactions between the resistance epiQTLs and distant defence genes as a potential <italic>trans</italic>-priming mechanism”, in the Abstract and in the Discussion.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript there are references to phrases that do not make sense. What are &quot;epigenetic loci&quot; as stated in the title or &quot;epigenetic resistance&quot;. I would refer to these as &quot;loci&quot; and &quot;resistance&quot;. Furthermore, why is &quot;transgenerational&quot; invoked throughout the paper? QTL are stably inherited. There are no transgenerational experiments presented in this study. Please remove this phrase from the study unless referring to the literature.</p><p>2) There is a potentially interesting observation of a trans effect being causal for the resistance, but this has not been proven as stated in the Abstract and the paper.</p><p>3) The epiQTL span regions associated with 4 out of 5 pericentromeric regions indicating that overall depletion of DNA methylation and potentially loss of heterochromatin is associated with <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance. What is the association between the amount of <italic>ddm1</italic> like chromosomes within the epiRILs and the resistance phenotype. Essentially, if you remade Figure 1 to show the amount of Col vs. <italic>ddm1</italic> chromosome would it correlate with the observed resistance phenotype?</p><p>4) Why was <italic>ddm1</italic> not included in the transcriptome study upon <italic>Hpa</italic> infection? This would be useful to understand if it is stronger than the epiQTL, which seems to be a prediction based on the discussion.</p><p>5) The data presented to support a &quot;tight correlation&quot; between hypomethylation and gene expression in Figure 3B needs additional support. While it is expected that loss of methylation and transposon genes could result in their reactivation, this is not as likely to occur at genes given that most genes are unmethylated, a small percent are gene body methylation (which is causally linked to expression) and rare genes show transposon-like methylation profiles. This can be resolved by splitting out the genes into unmethylated, gene body methylation (CG) and TE-like methylation (CG, CHG and CHH). Although some of these genes are cis-regulated by DNA methylation, it does not look like they all are as stated. This could be further tested using a scatter plot between change in DNA methylation versus change in expression.</p><p>6) There is no data provided to support the statement that &quot;their transcriptional profile is determined by their associated TEs.&quot; Please rephrase this as a hypothesis.</p><p>7) The use of Hi-C data is an interesting idea. It is stated that &quot;43 interactions between the epiQTLs…&quot; were reduced or intensified in <italic>ddm1</italic> vs. wt. Yet, there is no statistical support to indicate whether this represents an enrichment over background expectations. This is a critical test as this forms the mechanistic basis for how the trans interactions occur.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I think this paper is likely to be of broad interest. The demonstration that demethylation of particular bits of the genome affects a particular phenotype, in this case immunity, is intriguing. The authors have made a serious effort to understand why, and have made substantial progress in that direction. They have demonstrated increased effectiveness of callose, a known factor in resistance to this pathogen, and they have shown increased expression of genes known to be induced in response to infection. They make use of a new technology, Hi-C, and obtain data suggesting that the altered methylation may have long distance effects on expression levels of genes associated with immunity, possibly explaining the resistance phenotype. I found this rather unexpected, as conventional wisdom is that in the small genome of Arabidopsis, control of gene expression is nearly always very local. This work suggests that may not be correct, and a wider view is needed.</p><p>The authors were faced with the considerable challenge of working out how the epiQTLs affect expression of immmunity-related genes. In the last experiment, they use Hi-C and find connections between the epiQTL DNA and certain infection-inducible genes outside the QTL regions. Moreover, those genes are up-regulated in the resistant epiRILs carrying the epiQTL alleles. This is temptingly close to showing a mechanism. However, more statistical analysis is needed to make this convincing. A large number of infection-inducible genes are up-regulated in the resistant epi-RILs. Is the fraction of these detected in the Hi-C experiment as being linked to the QTL loci greater than would be expected by chance?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Identification and characterisation of hypomethylated DNA loci controlling quantitative resistance in Arabidopsis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We also make reference to a recent study by Aller et al., 2018, who have used the same epiRIL population to study the contribution of heritable variation in DNA methylation to the production of defence-related metabolites (glucosinolates). Finally, we have removed the preliminary Hi-C analysis from the Results section of our manuscript.

The experiments and data themselves will be very useful but the authors would need to focus on what they do show. To illustrate, they nicely map resistance epiQTLs and do some really nice transcriptomics. Just presenting that as plainly as what they found would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his supportive comments. We agree that some of our assertions were too speculative or not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence. Please, see our below answers for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast, the writing makes extensive claims about priming, transgenerational and chromatin interactions. The transgenerational argument is trying to link in with the work showing that there is one-generation of disease effects on resistance. However, there is no analysis of if their loci really play any role in this phenomena. They just have loci whose ddm1 marks lead to altered resistance. They would have to show that these same loci influence the transgenerational resistance phenomena to make their arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>To start with this reviewer’s concern about the term ‘transgenerational’, we used this word to refer to the hypo-methylated epiQTLs that are segregating in the epiRIL population. These loci were inherited from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent in a wild-type background and can therefore be regarded as ‘transgenerational’. The epiRILs described in our paper were at the 8<sup>th</sup> generation of self-pollination in a wild-type background (Johannes et al. 2009). In fact, Latzel et al., 2013, have shown that some hypo-methylated DNA regions from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutant are inherited for up to 16 generations of self-pollination in a wild-type background. Since we have established a statistically significant link between the segregating resistance in the epiRIL population and four hypo-methylated epiQTLs that are inherited from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent, we believe it is justified to refer to the resistance as ‘transgenerational’. To clarify this argument, we have adjusted the following sections in our manuscript:</p><p>“A core set of 123 epiRILs from this population at the 8th generation of self-pollination in the wild-type (Wt) background has been characterized for differentially methylated region (DMR) markers, enabling linkage mapping of heritable hypo-methylated loci controlling root growth, flowering and abiotic stress tolerance (Cortijo et al., 2014; Kooke et al., 2015).”</p><p>“In this study, we have characterised the core set of 123 lines from the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> x Col-0 epiRIL population for resistance against the biotrophic downy mildew pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa</italic>) to search for heritable hypo-methylated loci controlling disease resistance.”</p><p>Furthermore, we have carried out an additional experiment to confirm the transgenerational inheritance of the resistance trait and assess the ‘transgenerational’ stability of the trait. To this end. 40 F9 individuals from 8 <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant lines were self-pollinated, after which the resulting F10 progenies were tested for <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance. As is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 of the revised manuscript, the resistance was still evident in the F10 generation for every line tested, confirming that the resistance is indeed ‘transgenerational’ and passed on from the F9 to the F10 generation.</p><p>Interestingly, however, 4 epiRILs displayed statistically significant variation between the five F10 families within the line, suggesting that these epiRILs show transgenerational instability of the trait. Moreover, two of the forty F10 families showed similar levels of <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance as the wild-type, indicating that they had lost the transgenerational resistance completely.</p><p>“The 123 epiRILs analysed for <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance had been self-pollinated for 8 generations in a Wt (Col-0) genetic background since the F1 x Col-0 backcross (F9) (Johannes et al., 2009). […] Furthermore, 4 of the 8 epiRILs tested (#71, #148, #545, and #508) displayed statistically significant variation in Hpa resistance between the 5 F10 families within the epiRIL (Figure 1—figure supplement 5; Pearson’s Chi-squared test, p&lt;0.05; † symbols), suggesting instability of the <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The chromatin interactions are all done in ddm1 v. WT and not in the epiRILs v. WT or v. ddm1 so I'm not sure they can actually make their claims. Wouldn't they need to look at interactions in the epiRILs to make any of these arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the Hi-C analysis of the data from the Feng et al., 2014 study remains too preliminary to conclude that DDM1-dependent chromatin interactions contribute to defence priming in the resistant epiRILs. Based on the collective feedback from all reviewers and the editor, we decided to remove the Hi-C analysis from the Results section of the manuscript. The revised manuscript refers in the Discussion to the results by Feng et al., 2014, who showed that the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation has a major effect on heterochromatic interactions in the pericentromeric regions, including the epiQTLs identified in our study. We illustrate this by referring to Figure 3—figure supplement 4, which projects the data from the Feng et al., 2014 paper onto the Arabidopsis genome and shows ample DDM1-dependent chromatin interactions originating from the epiQTLs. Considering that the same <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutant was used to generate the Col-0 x <italic>ddm1-2</italic> epiRIL population, this provides support to the hypothesis that DDM1-dependent long-range chromatin interactions with the pericentromeric epiQTLs could play a role in <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of defence genes. However, we emphasize that this remains a hypothesis until further Hi-C studies with the resistant epiRILs can confirm statistically significant interactions with the constitutively primed defence genes:</p><p>“Unlike non-coding RNAs, long-range chromatin interactions can trans-regulate gene expression independently of sequence complementarity (Harmston and Lenhard, 2013; Liu et al., 2016; Weber et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). […] Whether these long-range interactions contribute to trans-regulation of defence gene priming would require further study, including a fully replicated Hi-C analysis of the resistant epiRILs characterised in this study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Priming concerns –</p><p>I should caveat the following in that I have some quant/eco/evo training in my background so I go by a very strict definition of priming; a pre-treatment leads to an elevated response to a secondary treatment that cannot be explained by any effect of the pre-treatment. Similar to the definition I work off of for epistasis. The effect of A x B is not explainable by adding up the effect of A and B separately.</p><p>Given this definition, the transcriptomics analysis does not make a direct test of priming. The authors use pairwise analysis which do not allow for a statistical testing of priming directly. To claim priming would require re-analyzing the data with a linear model where Transcript = genotype + treatment + genotype x treatment. And only the transcripts with a significant genotype x treatment term would fit into what might be called priming. Priming is the interaction term rather than the main effect of genotype or treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we would like to point out that there is published evidence that basal resistance in plants can be caused by an increased responsiveness of pathogen-inducible defence mechanisms, which is commonly referred to ‘constitutive priming’ (van Hulten, 2006; Ahmad et al., 2010, MPP, 11: 817-827, Ahmad et al., 2011 PCE, 34: 1191-1206, Gamir et al. 2014; Plant J, 78:227-240). This resistance phenotype has also been described for Arabidopsis mutants with reduced DNA methylation (Lopez et al., 2011; Lopez et al., 2016) and progeny from diseased parental plants that express transgenerational acquired resistance (Luna et al., 2012; Rasmann et al., 2012). Thus, the term priming is not strictly limited to describe an induced resistance response to a prior stimulus within the same generation, but can also be used to describe an innate resistance phenotype, as is the case for the epiRILs described in our current study.</p><p>Our arguments to support the conclusion that <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant epiRILs are constitutively primed for defence-related gene expression is based on three statistical tests, the visualisation of the associated gene expression patterns, and the GO term analysis (which confirms enrichment of defense-related functions). The first statistical selection is based on a comprehensive linear model that includes all factors and interactions (epi-genotype, treatment, time-point and all interactions thereof). Using this model, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) selected for all differentially expressed genes by any factor and/or interaction, yielding a large number of genes. Although hierarchical cluster analysis of this gene set already indicated a large cluster displaying augmented induction in the epiRILs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), we performed (Wald tests (+ FDR) to select for <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes that show elevated expression in the more resistant epiRILs during <italic>Hpa</italic> infection (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Wald tests are recommended by the DeSEQ2 vignette to extract specific contrasts in gene expression and allowed us e.g. to separate the <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes from the <italic>Hpa</italic>-repressed genes. Using a series of Wald tests, we distinguished two <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible gene groups that differ in expression profile between the Wt and epiRILs: in addition to <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes that are constitutively up-regulated in the resistant epiRILs (Group 1), we identified a larger group of genes that show elevated levels of <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the resistant epiRILs (Group 2). This latter gene group was strongly enriched with defence-related GO terms at 48 hpi, which represents a critical time-point in the interaction between Arabidospis and <italic>Hpa</italic> (Figure 2D). Thirdly, on advice of the reviewer and the editor, we have selected all genes from the general linear model that show a statistically significant interaction between epi-genotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment (16,009 genes), and determined the percentage of genes in Group 2 that are significant for this interaction term. As is presented in Supplementary dataset S7 in Supplementary file 1, the majority of Group 2 genes show a statistically significant interaction term for each epiRIL (&gt; 92%), supporting a primed expression pattern. Finally, we confirm this notion by visualization of the actual expression profiles in heatmaps (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 4), which show clearly that the vast majority of Group 2 genes exhibit augmented induction levels by <italic>Hpa</italic> in the resistant epiRILs.</p><p>Thus, to address this reviewer’s concerns about priming, we have applied the following changes to our manuscript:</p><p>- We have adjusted our description of the gene expression profiles. The selection for <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes showing enhanced expression in the more resistant epiRILs now differentiates between genes that show constitutively enhanced expressed in the resistant epiRILs (now referred as “Group 1”) and genes that show elevated levels of <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the resistant epiRILs (now referred as “Group 2”). We have removed the notation of “primed” at this stage of the gene selection.</p><p>- On advice of the reviewer, we selected from our comprehensive general linear model all genes that show a statistically significant interaction between epi-genotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment. This criterion alone is not sufficient to select for primed genes, since it also selects for genes that are e.g. differentially repressed by <italic>Hpa</italic> infection. However, when applied to the genes within Group 2, which had already been selected for enhanced levels of <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the epiRILs, we found that the vast majority (&gt; 92%) of genes in this group were statistically significant for this interaction term. The combination of these criteria indicates a constitutively primed expression pattern.</p><p>- We have included z-score-normalised heatmaps of the gene expression profiles in Groups 1 and 2. This visualisation of the actual expression patterns supports our conclusion that the majority of Group 2 genes are constitutively primed in the resistant epiRILs: the genes show strongly augmented gene induction by <italic>Hpa</italic> in the resistant epiRILs, while showing no or only marginally higher levels of basal expression in mock-treated epiRILs (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4). This expression profile is consistent with the agreed definition of priming, as described by Martinez-Medina et al.,2016).</p><p>- We only refer to ‘<italic>defence</italic> gene priming’ after the analysis of a statistically significant interaction between epi-genotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment, visualisation of the actual expression patterns, and the GO term analysis. The latter analysis demonstrates that Group 2 genes at the early and critical time-point of 48 hpi are strongly enriched with <italic>defence</italic>-related GO terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This concern about what is or is not priming, arises from their own data that argues against priming even when they say it argues for priming. If you notice in Figure 2B, the PCA plot actually shows that the main transcript variance in the epiRILs are not priming but mainly constitutive changes as the change from Mock to Hpa infected is a similar level of variance in each genotype. If it was truly a predominantly priming effect, the uninduced would all be similar to the WT uninduced. Figure 2—figure supplement 2A also shows my worry about priming. If you look at the plots for what a primed transcript looks like, only 2 of those five plots would truly fit what is priming.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that we did not conclude from the PCA plot that the epiRILs are primed for defence gene expression. What the PCA plot shows is that samples from mock- and <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated plants separate mostly along the first principal component (PC1), which explains 31% of the variation in the experiment, whereas samples from different epi-genotypes separate along the second principal component (PC2), which explains only 20% of the variation. Thus, the main transcript variation in the experiment is caused by the response of the plants to <italic>Hpa</italic>. Since the samples from <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated Wt plants cluster differently along PC1 than those from the <italic>Hpa</italic>-inoculated epiRILs, it is justifiable to conclude that the transcriptome of the epiRILs responds differently to <italic>Hpa</italic> infection than the Wt.</p><p>Regarding this reviewer’s concern about the expression profiles depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, we removed the label ‘Primed’ from the gene selection, which is now referred as ‘Group 2’. As detailed above, we define genes in this Group as displaying enhanced levels of <italic>Hpa</italic>-induced expression in the resistant epiRILs. Based on further statistical analysis of the interaction between epigenotype x <italic>Hpa</italic> treatment and visual confirmation of the actual gene expression profiles, we conclude that the vast majority of Group 2 genes are constitutively primed in the resistant epiRILs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors argue that priming is the sole thing altered and that other defense traits aren't influenced. There are a couple of potential issues with this exclusionary arguments. The use of the 8 most resistance epiRIL lines to test other interactions is not really evidence of much. There isn't enough statistical power to say anything other than they aren't exactly 100% the same traits. It is possible that there is still a correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the callose phenotypes and <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression profiles of the 8 epiRILs are insufficient to conclude that the resistance controlled by the epiQTLs is solely based on defence priming. Accordingly, we have removed the exclusionary tone about the causal link between the epiQTLs and defence priming. However, we can conclude that the 8 most resistant epiRILs in the population are constitutively primed for cell wall defence and SA-dependent <italic>PR1</italic> induction. This is supported by the genome-wide transcriptomic expression profiles and related GO term analysis, revealing that the majority of <italic>Hpa</italic>-inducible genes with defence-related functions show a constitutively primed expression pattern (see above). Furthermore, based on our population-wide screen for growth phenotypes, we can conclude that the resistance-controlling epiQTLs have no major impact on plant growth, which is consistent with the fact that defence priming has been shown to provide plants with resistance that is associated with no or minimal effects on plant growth (van Hulten et al., 2006). Thus, while we cannot exclude that other defence mechanisms have a contribution to the segregating resistance in the epiRIL population, independent lines of evidence in our study suggest that defence priming is the most plausible mechanism by which the epiQTLs control <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance. As is further detailed in our response to comment #7 of this reviewer (see below), we have addressed this point in the second paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, at least one if not two of their loci are linked to variation in defense metabolism in this population based on previous work looking at epigenetic variation in defense metabolites within population. This shows that there are defense traits that are altered in these lines prior to infection. This previous work should be cited and incorporated appropriately when discussing the authors results as it contradicts the central claim about exclusivity of effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us to the Aller et al., 2018 paper; “Comparison of the Relative Potential for Epigenetic and Genetic Variation To Contribute to Trait Stability”. The revised version of our manuscript now discusses the potential contribution of pre-existing defence metabolites (glucosinolates) in the <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance:</p><p>“Aller et al., 2018, have recently used the same Col-0 x ddm1-2 epiRIL population to map the contribution of heritable variation in DNA methylation to the production of defence-related glucosinolate metabolites (Wibowo et al., 2016<sup>)</sup>. […] While we cannot exclude other mechanisms, these independent lines of evidence collectively indicate that genome-wide priming of defence genes is the most plausible mechanism by which the epiQTLs mediate quantitative disease resistance in the population.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is an interesting study, especially with the identification of epiRILs that are resistant to Hpa seemingly with no growth defects. However, the causal basis for these phenotypes requires additional evidence. The use of Hi-C is innovative, but it does not prove the strong statement made in the subsection “DDM1-dependent chromatin interactions between the resistance epiQTLs and distant defence genes as a potential trans-priming mechanism”, in the Abstract and in the Discussion.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript there are references to phrases that do not make sense.

We have therefore removed this statement from the Abstract. In addition, we have toned down the conclusiveness regarding <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of defence genes in our paper. Instead, we propose different mechanisms of <italic>trans</italic>-regulation in the Discussion as possible explanations for our finding that we did not find defence-related genes within the epiQTL regions that are <italic>cis</italic>-regulated by the DNA methylation (i.e. genes that show augmented expression in the epiRILs during <italic>Hpa</italic> infection and that are simultaneously reduced in DNA methylation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The epiQTL span regions associated with 4 out of 5 pericentromeric regions indicating that overall depletion of DNA methylation and potentially loss of heterochromatin is associated with Hpa resistance.

Essentially, if you remade Figure 1 to show the amount of Col vs. ddm1 chromosome would it correlate with the observed resistance phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Each of the 123 epiRILs in the population shows different combinations of the 126 DNA methylation markers, which are stably inherited in a Mendelian fashion from the Wt and <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parents (Colomé-Tatché et al., 2012) Since the population is derived from a backcross, on average, the epiRIL population contains 25% of the <italic>ddm1</italic> haplotype and 75% of the Col-0 haplotype. Interval mapping provides the appropriate method to establish a statistical relationship between the resistance phenotype of each line and the haplotype for each marker (quantified by LOD score).</p><p>To address this reviewer’s question, we have included a supplementary dataset (S1 in Supplementary file 1), which details the DNA methylation marker distribution of the Wt and <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotypes of all epiRILs, ranked by <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance. The bottom row of this table shows the estimated percentage of <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotype in each epiRIL, which indeed shows a weak positive correlation with <italic>Hpa</italic> resistance. We attribute this trend to the size of the epiQTL intervals (particularly on chromosomes I and IV). However, as mentioned above, it is the actual interval mapping that establishes which parts of the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> haplotype contribute to the resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why was ddm1 not included in the transcriptome study upon Hpa infection? This would be useful to understand if it is stronger than the epiQTL, which seems to be a prediction based on the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including siblings of the F4 <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent of the epiRIL population would have been informative. However, we did not have enough F4 seeds of this line to ensure sufficient replication and plant material for the transcriptome analysis. Because of the nature of the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation, propagation of this mutant into a subsequent generation (F5) would increase the level of DNA hypomethylation (Kakutani et al., 1996). As such, using F5 progeny from a F4 sibling of the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> parent would not provide an appropriate estimation of the amount of DNA hypomethylation that had been introgressed into the wild-type background for this epiRIL population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data presented to support a &quot;tight correlation&quot; between hypomethylation and gene expression in Figure 3B needs additional support. While it is expected that loss of methylation and transposon genes could result in their reactivation, this is not as likely to occur at genes given that most genes are unmethylated, a small percent are gene body methylation (which is causally linked to expression) and rare genes show transposon-like methylation profiles. This can be resolved by splitting out the genes into unmethylated, gene body methylation (CG) and TE-like methylation (CG, CHG and CHH). Although some of these genes are cis-regulated by DNA methylation, it does not look like they all are as stated. This could be further tested using a scatter plot between change in DNA methylation versus change in expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. The revised manuscript now includes additional scatterplots to visualise and quantify the correlation between augmented expression ratio and DNA hypomethylation of the corresponding Group 2 genes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For each epiQTL, linear regression analysis confirmed the positive correlations for genes in expression cluster I, which were statistically significant (Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). By contrast, no positive correlations could be detected for genes in expression cluster II (Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This extra analysis provides statistical support to our conclusion that cluster I genes are <italic>cis</italic>-regulated by DNA methylation, whereas the cluster II genes are <italic>trans</italic>-regulated by DNA methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is no data provided to support the statement that &quot;their transcriptional profile is determined by their associated TEs.&quot; Please rephrase this as a hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned done the conclusiveness of this statement and modified the sentence as follows: <italic>“</italic>Furthermore, analysis of the genomic context of the sixprotein-coding genes revealed the presence of overlapping and/or nearby TEs (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), <italic>suggesting</italic> that the correlation between augmented expression and DNA hypomethylation for these genes is determined by association with TEs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The use of Hi-C data is an interesting idea. It is stated that &quot;43 interactions between the epiQTLs…&quot; were reduced or intensified in ddm1 vs. wt.

This is a critical test as this forms the mechanistic basis for how the trans interactions occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional analysis to validate a statistically significant enrichment of heterochromatic interactions between the epiQTLs and distant defence genes identified in our RNA-seq analysis would be necessary to conclude that long-range chromatin interactions contribute to priming of distant defence genes. Sadly, the publicly available dataset from Feng et al., 2014, was based on only one replicate per genotype, thereby limiting the statistical stringency of such analysis. In addition, as pointed out by the reviewer #1 and the editor, even if we would be able to provide a statistically significant justification for these specific interactions, the analysis would still only be based on the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutant, and not on the epiRILs that were analysed for genome-wide gene expression. For these reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the Hi-C analysis remains too preliminary at the current state to be presented as a main result in the manuscript.</p><p>In its current form, the Discussion of our revised manuscript raises the possibility that long-range heterochromatic interactions with peri-centromeric epiQTLs could have a contribution to <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of distant defence genes. We support this hypothesis by referring to the study by Feng et al., 2014, who demonstrated that the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation has a profound effect on long-range heterochromatic interactions with pericentromeric regions, including those that are covered by our epiQTLs. To illustrate this point, we refer in the Discussion to Figure 3—figure supplement 4, which presents the interaction maps of the Wt (Col-0) and the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutant from the Feng et al., 2014 paper, and highlights the inferred DDM1-dependent interactions with our epiQTL intervals. For the reasons outlined above, we do not take this analysis further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I think this paper is likely to be of broad interest. The demonstration that demethylation of particular bits of the genome affects a particular phenotype, in this case immunity, is intriguing. The authors have made a serious effort to understand why, and have made substantial progress in that direction. They have demonstrated increased effectiveness of callose, a known factor in resistance to this pathogen, and they have shown increased expression of genes known to be induced in response to infection. They make use of a new technology, Hi-C, and obtain data suggesting that the altered methylation may have long distance effects on expression levels of genes associated with immunity, possibly explaining the resistance phenotype. I found this rather unexpected, as conventional wisdom is that in the small genome of Arabidopsis, control of gene expression is nearly always very local. This work suggests that may not be correct, and a wider view is needed.</p><p>The authors were faced with the considerable challenge of working out how the epiQTLs affect expression of immmunity-related genes. In the last experiment, they use Hi-C and find connections between the epiQTL DNA and certain infection-inducible genes outside the QTL regions. Moreover, those genes are up-regulated in the resistant epiRILs carrying the epiQTL alleles. This is temptingly close to showing a mechanism. However, more statistical analysis is needed to make this convincing. A large number of infection-inducible genes are up-regulated in the resistant epi-RILs. Is the fraction of these detected in the Hi-C experiment as being linked to the QTL loci greater than would be expected by chance?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our initial Hi-C analysis remains too preliminary to conclude a contribution of DDM1-dependent heterochromatic interactions to defence gene regulation in the resistant epiRILs. As outlined in our response to comment #3 from the first reviewer and comment #7 from the second reviewer, additional statistical analysis would be needed to support this claim. Sadly, the publicly available dataset from Col-0 and <italic>ddm1-2</italic> plants is based on one replicate per genotype, so lacks statistical power to make this analysis more conclusive. Moreover, the analysis would still only be based on the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutant, and not on the epiRILs that were analysed for genome-wide gene expression. Ultimately, we believe that a fully replicated Hi-C analysis on the <italic>Hpa</italic>-resistant epiRILs compared to Wt would be needed to provide more conclusive statistical evidence for long-range chromatin interactions with the genes identified in from RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>For these reasons, we have omitted the Hi-C analysis from the main Results section of the manuscript. However, the Discussion of our revised manuscript addresses the possibility that long-range chromatin interactions could play a role in the <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of global defence gene expression by the epiQTLs. We support this hypothesis by referring to the results in the Feng et al., 2014 study, which demonstrate that the <italic>ddm1-2</italic> mutation has a profound impact on the long-range heterochromatic interactions with pericentromeric regions, including those that are covered by our epiRIL regions.

One thing that I think might help this version of the manuscript is to simplify the Discussion and definitions surrounding augmentation and priming. I found myself getting confused about what was being meant. It would help to have discrete explicit definitions being given to allow the reader to fully understand what the authors mean.</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction of our revised manuscript provides a better definition of priming, and how priming relates to augmentation of defence-related gene induction and quantitative resistance:</p><p>“Recent evidence has suggested that reduced DNA methylation increases the responsiveness of the plant immune system (Espinas, Saze and Saijo, 2016. […] In some cases, priming of defense-related genes is associated with post-translational histone modifications that mark a more open chromatin structure (Jaskiewicz, Conrath and Peterhänsel, 2011; Luna et al., 2012).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
