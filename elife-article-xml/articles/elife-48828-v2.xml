Mutations in <italic>TIMM8A</italic> cause a neurodegenerative disease, Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome (MTS), which is characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia and blindness. Nothing is known about the function of hTim8a in neuronal cells or how mutation of this protein leads to a neurodegenerative disease. We show that hTim8a is required for the assembly of Complex IV in neurons, which is mediated through a transient interaction with Complex IV assembly factors, in particular the copper chaperone COX17. Complex IV assembly defects resulting from loss of hTim8a leads to oxidative stress and changes to key apoptotic regulators, including cytochrome c, which primes cells for death. Alleviation of oxidative stress with Vitamin E treatment rescues cells from apoptotic vulnerability. We hypothesise that enhanced sensitivity of neuronal cells to apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of MTS.</p></abstract><kwd-group

governing many metabolic processes including fatty acid oxidation, the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and fatty acid ß-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasahara and Scorrano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McBride et al., 2006</xref>). Organelle dysfunction is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, including mitochondrial diseases that are genetic, often inherited disorders associated with energy generation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frazier et al., 2019</xref>). The health and functionality of the mitochondrial network relies on the biogenesis of approximately 1500 nuclear encoded proteins, which are imported into mitochondria using sophisticated translocation machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>). The biogenesis of many hydrophobic membrane proteins relies on the small TIM proteins, a chaperone network in the intermembrane space that function to shield hydrophobic proteins as they passage this aqueous space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curran et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curran et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins and Nargang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiedemann et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Unlike yeast that have five well-characterised small TIM proteins, Tim8, Tim9, Tim10, Tim12 and Tim13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koehler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koehler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koehler et al., 1998</xref>), human cells have six small TIM proteins that have been poorly characterised, these include, hTim8a, hTim8b, hTim9, hTim10a, hTim10b, and hTim13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gentle et al., 2007</xref>). Hexameric assemblies consisting of yeast Tim8-Tim13 and Tim9-Tim10 function to transfer hydrophobic proteins through the intermembrane space to inner and outer membrane translocases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins and Nargang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiedemann et al., 2004</xref>). The yeast Tim8-Tim13 complex is believed to be responsible for the delivery of TIM substrates (Tim17, Tim22 and Tim23) to the TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beverly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curran et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paschen et al., 2000</xref>). However, the presence of hTim13 in protein interaction networks like the SPY complex, an inner membrane proteolytic hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wai et al., 2016</xref>), suggests that the small TIM proteins may have acquired novel functions in human mitochondria. Additionally, why human mitochondria have two Tim8 isoforms is unclear and the predominate expression of hTim8a in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 1999</xref>), suggests cell specific functions. In line with this, mutations in the <italic>TIMM8A</italic> gene that encodes the hTim8a protein, cause Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome (MTS), an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, cortical blindness and dysphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koehler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tranebjaerg et al., 1995</xref>). Given the function of yeast Tim8 in the import of Tim23, it has been assumed that defects in the import of human Tim23 were the underlying basis of MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leuenberger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paschen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothbauer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Using cell knock-out studies in HEK293 and the neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, we uncover a novel function for hTim8a and hTim8b in the assembly of Complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) in a cell-specific manner. Our data suggests that hTim8a function is more prominent in neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells, while hTim8b function is more prominent in HEK293 cells. Consequently, depletion of hTim8a has a drastic impact on cell health in SH-SY5Y cells, with major impact to cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, perturbed Complex IV activity and oxidative stress. This cellular dysfunction is associated with changes to key apoptotic regulators, in particular cytochrome <italic>c</italic> that sensitises cells lacking hTim8a to intrinsic cell death. Alleviation of oxidative stress in cells lacking hTim8a by treatment with Vitamin E rescues cells from their apoptotic vulnerability and provides a molecular explanation for previously reported neuronal cell loss in MTS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tranebjaerg et al., 2001</xref>). We suggest that early intervention with antioxidant could represent a treatment strategy for mitochondrial neuropathologies like Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of functional hTim8a or hTim8b reveals a role in Complex IV biogenesis</title><p>We set out to establish the function of hTim8a and hTim8b in human cells by targeting the genes using CRISPR/Cas9 in two cell models: (i) the widely used HEK293 cell line; and (ii) the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which we used as an in vitro model of neuronal function. We also targeted <italic>TIMM9</italic> in HEK293 cells as a control. <italic>TIMM9</italic> edited cells had two indel variants causing frame-shift mutations and new stop codons at 2 or four aa beyond the wildtype stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), giving rise a slower migrating hTim9 mutant protein that was reduced at the steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, left panel). Given this, we refer to this cell line as hTim9<sup>MUT</sup> (MUT, mutant). HEK293 cells edited for <italic>TIMM8A</italic> resulted in a complete loss of the hTim8a protein and we refer to this cell line as and hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> (KO, knockout) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, middle panel). SH-SY5Y cells targeted for <italic>TIMM8A</italic> were heterozygous (contained a wild-type and modified allele) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), however isolated mitochondria had no hTim8a visible by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, right panel) or via mass spectrometric analyses (Figure 2C). Given that the expression of hTim8a can be altered by skewed X-chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plenge et al., 1999</xref>), we hypothesise that the observed wild-type allele of <italic>TIMM8A</italic> is located on an inactive X-chromosome and therefore refer to this cell line as hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> (<sup>SH</sup> indicates SH-SY5Y). We also obtained knock-outs of <italic>TIMM8B</italic> in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and refer to these cell lines as Tim8b<sup>KO</sup> and Tim8b<sup>KO SH</sup> (<sup>SH</sup> indicates SH-SY5Y).</p><p>We addressed the implications of depleting hTim9, hTim8a and hTim8b on the TIM22 complex and substrates of this inner membrane translocase in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells.

To the contrary, lack of functional hTim8a in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells had no obvious impact on the TIM22 complex or TIM22 substrates when analysed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; quantified for hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Further analysis using in vitro mitochondrial import assays of [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim23, [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 and the glutamate carrier ([<sup>35</sup>S]-GC1) into mitochondria isolated from hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> and hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>) or hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) suggests no defects in the assembly of these putative substrates. This data demonstrates that hTim9 is firmly embedded in the TIM22 complex biogenesis pathway, like its yeast counterpart, while hTim8a and hTim8b do not directly influence the TIM22 complex or pathway and may have alternative function(s) within human mitochondria. The normal import and assembly of hTim23 in the absence of hTim8a and hTim8b suggests there is an alternative pathomechanism underlying MTS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48828.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cells lacking hTim8a have no defects in the TIM22, TIM23 or carrier biogenesis pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Mitochondria were isolated from control, (<bold>A</bold>) hTim9<sup>MUT</sup> HEK293 cells, (<bold>B</bold>) hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> HEK293 cells, (<bold>C</bold>) hTim8a<sup>MUT</sup> SH-SY5Y cells, (<bold>D</bold>) hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> HEK293 cells, or (<bold>E</bold>) hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> SH-SY5Y cells prior to solubilisation in 1% digitonin-containing buffer.

We wanted to dissect if the downstream consequences of hTim8a depletion, such as membrane potential defects and cell death sensitivity were in fact due to Complex IV biogenesis defects or some additional role of hTim8a. A closer look at the quantitative mass-spectrometry data from all four knock-out cell lines highlighted the importance of hTim8a and hTim8b in maintenance of Complex IV subunits, especially in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> HEK293, hTim8a<sup>MUT</sup> SH-SY5Y and hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> SH-SY5Y cells showed decreased abundance in Complex IV subunits or assembly factors compared to control cells. hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> HEK293 did not share this phenotype, however this may reflect the tissue-specific expression and/or function of hTim8a. Further support for a novel role of hTim8 proteins in Complex IV assembly comes from the minimal effect that loss of either hTim8a or hTim8b had on SLC25A-family carrier proteins and TIM proteins, those thought to be putative substrates based on work in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel). This contrasts with the broad defect in SLC25A proteins observed in hTim9<sup>MUT</sup> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By collating the relative abundance of subunits from each OXPHOS complex, it is clear the OXPHOS defect is not a generic OXPHOS defect or downregulation but specific to Complex IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Both hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> and hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> SHSY5Y cell lines had reduced protein levels for all core subunits of Complex IV, a less severe reduction in the majority of Complex I subunits and little or no effect on Complexes II, III and V. Despite the downward trend of Complex I as a whole, few individual subunits are depleted significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle panel) and we believe this reflects a co-dependency of Complex I on Complex IV for stability in respiratory supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2007</xref>) not a direct influence of hTim8a or hTim8b on Complex I.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48828.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>hTim8a and hTim8b have a cell type specific function in Complex IV biogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Data from label-free quantitative mass spectrometry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was used to create volcano plots showing relative levels of proteins in CRISPR-edited cells compared to control cells. n = 3 biological replicates.

We confirmed the reduction in COX17 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells depleted of hTim8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and investigated if hTim8a is required for the import and/or assembly of COX17 using in vitro import analysis.

However, analysis of in vitro import reactions by BN-PAGE to monitor assembly of [<sup>35</sup>S]-COX17 did suggest that COX17 assembly was perturbed in the absence of hTim8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>;~40% less COX17 assembly compared to control). We set out to investigate if hTim8a was interacting with COX17 to accommodate a COX17-dependent process in mitochondria. hTim8a<sup>FLAG</sup> was re-expressed in hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> cells and mitochondria were isolated from these cells for downstream immunoprecipitation (IP) using FLAG antibodies. Under these conditions no interaction between hTim8a and COX17 was captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We questioned if the interaction was too transient to be captured using standard IP conditions. Furthermore, cell growth on galactose enhances oxidative capacity and increases Complex IV activity and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rossignol et al., 2004</xref>).

Comparative analysis of neuronal-like and non-neuronal cells demonstrates the cell-specific function of the hTim8a and hTim8b isoforms, with hTim8a function being critical for SH-SY5Y cells. While loss of hTim9 resulted in profound disruption of the TIM22-biogenesis pathway, removal of hTim8a or hTim8b from both HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells showed no impact to the biogenesis of the TIM22 complex or associated substrates, in particular hTim23, whose perturbed import has been suggested to be the underlying basis of MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothbauer et al., 2001</xref>). Rather, our data suggests that hTim8a and hTim8b have evolved novel functions in human mitochondria in particular in the biogenesis of Complex IV.</p><p>Complex IV dysfunction is associated with increased mitochondrial ROS and cellular toxicity and causes a clinically heterogeneous variety of neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular disorders in childhood and adulthood and can result from either nuclear or mitochondrial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frazier et al., 2019</xref>). Complex IV is unique among the respiratory chain complexes as it has tissue-specific subunit isoforms, which are believed to have regulatory roles in adaptation of tissues to specific metabolic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wallace and Fan, 2010</xref>). Our crosslinking and IP data suggests that hTim8a and hTim8b likely have multiple functions in mitochondrial biology. Growth in glucose (low respiratory demand) shows a predominant interaction with: (i) partner proteins hTim8b and hTim13; (ii) Complex IV related proteins (Coa4, Coa7, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and COX6B1) and key players involved in mitochondrial quality control including Opa1, the prohibitins and pGAM5. Indeed, these interactions are evident in the literature with hTim13 coming down as a member of the SPY complex, an inner membrane regulatory hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wai et al., 2016</xref>) and hTim8a and hTim13 immunoprecipitating with pGAM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holze et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly under high respiratory demand (growth on galactose) hTim8a shifts away from its interaction with hTim13 to exclusively engage in the Complex IV interaction network (including Coa4, Coa6, Coa7, COX41L and COX6B1) and mitochondrial quality control interactions. COX assembly is a modular process that includes a number of assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Timón-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the lack of isolated defects in a specific Complex IV module in cells lacking hTim8a or hTim8b, and the predominant engagement of hTim8a with proposed assembly factors, including COX17 we can only postulate at this stage that the hTim8a/b are serving as assembly factors in Complex IV biogenesis, or have some regulatory role in chaperoning/guiding assembly factors to their place of action. Our identification of a copper-independent but redox-sensitive interaction between hTim8a and COX17 hints that hTim8a could be a player that take parts in the redox-dependent modulation of COX17 for copper delivery to Complex IV. In line with our observations, loss of functional COA6, which is thought to be required for delivery of Cu(I) to COX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pacheu-Grau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2015</xref>), results in a &gt; 1.5 fold increase in the levels of COX17, hTim8a, hTim8b and hTim13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, a similar pattern of Complex IV subunit turnover is observed in cells lacking COA6 to that observed in hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the proteins impact Complex IV at a similar stage of its assembly.</p><p>Cell lines lacking hTim8a display heightened vulnerability to apoptotic induction due to oxidative stress. This phenotype can be partially restored by the re-expression of COX17 in these cells, strongly suggesting that oxidative stress is the driver of the observed apoptotic vulnerability. We cannot dismiss that there may be additional players, potential substrates of hTim8a, that could be contributing to this phenotype. Indeed, while cells lacking hTim8b have reduced levels of COX17 these cells do not display the same level of oxidative stress and ultimately are not as sensitive to apoptotic induction. We propose that cells lacking hTim8a are primed for cell death, a term used to describe the proximity of cells to the apoptotic threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</xref>). The apoptotic sensitivity of cells lacking hTim8a was selectively rescued by treatment with the lipid-soluble anti-oxidant Vitamin E, but not the water-soluble Vitamin C. Vitamin E plays a major role in protecting membranes and nervous tissues from oxidative stress, where it scavenges peroxyl radical to maintain the integrity of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Traber and Atkinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Traber and Stevens, 2011</xref>). Our results therefore suggest lipid peroxidation as a potential oxidative pathway modulated upon hTim8a loss, leading to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Importantly, MTS is characterized in its end-stage by widespread and severe neuronal cell death in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merchant et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tranebjaerg et al., 2001</xref>). In agreement with this, cells lacking hTim8a have significant defects in glucose catabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, both of which are evolutionarily linked to the regulation of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">King and Gottlieb, 2009</xref>). In SH-SY5Y cells, loss of hTim8a was associated with defects in glutamine catabolism and the operation of the malate-aspartate shunt, which may underlie global changes in redox balance and ROS production, further contributing to the acute severity of loss of hTim8a on neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mergenthaler et al., 2013</xref>). Changes to the malate-aspartate shunt coincides with work showing that citrin and aralar1, calcium-responsive aspartate-glutamate carriers that function in the malate-aspartate shuttle, are substrates of the hTim8a-hTim13 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roesch et al., 2004</xref>). Strikingly, loss of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y also skewed the levels of epinephrine (elevated levels) and dopamine (lowered levels), two principal neurotransmitters, which are synthesised by the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway, a reaction unique and essential to the central nervous system and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kobayashi, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our data demonstrates a cell-specific function for hTim8a in the assembly of Complex IV in the SH-SY5Y cell model, an in vitro model for neuronal cell function. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tranebjaerg et al. (2001)</xref> highlighted neuronal loss as a prominent feature in MTS patients. We now provide insight into the molecular features eliciting this cell loss and show that cells lacking hTim8a are sensitised to an oxidative stress induced intrinsic cell death. Importantly, our data highlights a strategy for early therapeutic intervention using Vitamin E for mitochondrial neuropathologies like MTS. Given the role of hTim8a in Complex IV assembly we believe it would be appropriate to reclassify MTS from a secondary mitochondrial disease, to a primary mitochondrial disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culturing, siRNA transfection, transient protein expression and stable cell line generation</title><p>Cell lines used in this work were HEK293T, Flp-In T-REx 293 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SH-SY5Y.

The syndrome is caused by mutations in the TIMM8A gene which codes for one of two human Tim8 isoforms, hTim8a. Kang et al. identified a new role of the human Tim8a protein in the assembly of respiratory chain complex IV, and demonstrated that this function is highly specific for neuronal cells. As a consequence of the complex IV assembly defect, the cells lacking Tim8a overproduce reactive oxygen species and are sensitized to apoptosis. Vitamin E was able to mitigate some of the secondary defects caused by the TIMM8A mutations although it did not repair the primary COX deficiency.</p><p>Overall, the data reveal an exciting new insight into the poorly defined patho-mechanism of the severe disease and shed light on a phenomenon of tissue specificity and mitochondria related disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuronal-specific function of hTim8a in Complex IV assembly provides insight into Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Johannes M Herrmann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are quite excited about the findings. The results are sound, of high quality and interesting for a broad audience. However, several major points need to be addressed, experimentally and by text clarifications, to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors claim that hTim8 has different substrates in different cell types. However, the approaches used here are not exactly identical (for example, hTim8a is deleted in HEK293 cells whereas about 40% of SH-SYS5 cells still contain WT alleles). Also, the isoforms are not comprehensively investigated (for example, it would seem more appropriate to perform the study in Tim8b KO cells to investigate the role of complex IV in the apoptosis response). The study would be stronger if the authors could unify some of the critical experimental schemes (potentially probing also for direct interactions to confirm substrate specificity). Also, the remaining differences in approaches should be acknowledged in the text.</p><p>2) Import assays analyzing the assembly of complex IV subunits in the mutants will strengthen the message of the manuscript. They would help to answer an important question which COX factors interact with hTim8 and whether Tim8-Tim13 is critical for the import of these proteins or whether it is part of a COX assembly complex and hence forms persistent contacts to COX subunits.</p><p>3) The authors made an impressive effort to study hTim8a interactors by mass spectrometry. However, the authors only highlighted very selective components in these graphs (e.g. Figure 3C) to support their conclusions (e.g. on the hTim8a-COX interaction). Follow-up experiments to identify direct substrates of the human Tim8-Tim13 complex and to confirm the proteomic analyses are missing. What are the direct interaction partners of hTim8 in SH-SYS5 cells?</p><p>4) In addition to complex IV defects, the authors also refer to a defect in complex I (Figure 2D). In addition, immunoblotting of several mitochondrial and nuclear encoded complex IV and complex I subunits in the hTim8a mutant cell lines will complete the dataset. It would be interesting to assess oxygen consumption and complex activities in Tim8a-deficient cells.</p><p>5) In relation to the points 3 and 4 above, the authors propose a series of events in the following order: TIMM8a -&gt; COX assembly defect -&gt; ROS production -&gt; Apoptosis -&gt; pathological consequences. Presumably the human Tim8-Tim13 complex serves a number of different clients, such as carriers, TIM22 components and COX constituents, or complex I and their absence causes a more pleiotropic defect. How confident can we be that it is complex IV disassembly in Tim8a-deficient SH-SY5Y cells that is responsible for priming the cells to apoptosis?</p><p>Specific comments (discussed and unified by the reviewers):</p><p>- In most cases, to quantify apoptosis, the authors measure PS exposure using the Annexin V assay and the results are expressed as 'relative luminescence unit'. Although this is useful, it would be more informative to include the proportion of cells which die in these assays.</p><p>- It is stated in the text that hTim8bKO HEK293 cells show reduced levels of Cox16 in Figure 2B, but from the data shown, it looks more like Cox16 levels are enhanced. This point should be clarified.</p><p>- The hTim8 proteomic data set is missing. The text refers to Table 3, however, this table contains the metabolomics data. This needs to be fixed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48828.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are quite excited about the findings.

Is it important to note that Complex IV related pathologies also have a strong tissue specificity and we have addressed this in the revised Discussion. We have also included significant new data to show the cell specific function of the hTim8a and hTim8b isoforms. See comment 1-2 below.</p><p>To clarify the comment on the presence of WT alleles in the SH-SY5Y hTim8a cell line (hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup>): we are not using a mixed population of cells – i.e. 40% of these cells do <italic>not</italic> contain the wild type allele as indicated in this comment, rather hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup> is a clonal cell line that contains one modified allele (c.[54_55insT]) and one wild type allele (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Immunoblotting and mitochondrial proteomics (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2) confirm the absence of any detectable hTim8a protein. Given the presence of a wild-type allele, but no protein we conclude as indicated in the text &quot;It has been reported that the expression of hTim8a can be altered by skewed X-chromosome inactivation (Plenge et al., 1999), thus we hypothesise that the observed wild-type allele of TIMM8A is located on an inactive X-chromosome in these cells. As this cell line is not a complete knockout, we refer to it as hTim8a<sup>MUT SH</sup>.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the isoforms are not comprehensively investigated (for example, it would seem more appropriate to perform the study in Tim8b KO cells to investigate the role of complex IV in the apoptosis response).

We have performed the following analysis on all four cells lines, which has allowed us to dissect the cell specific function of the Tim8 isoforms, but also uncover a tissue specific role of this protein in Complex IV biology.</p><p>2) Mitochondrial proteomics (Figure 2) and BN-PAGE analysis (Figure 6) showing that both hTim8a and hTim8b influence the levels of Complex IV subunits and assembly factors in a cell specific manner.</p><p>3) Comprehensive cell and mitochondrial health measurements in Figure 4, including cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rates, and respiratory chain complex activity.

Our data collectively suggests that hTim8a is involved in the general assembly of Complex IV possibly as an assembly factor acting within the network of assembly factors. New Figure 7G shows a hTim8<sup>FLAG</sup> immunoprecipitation from cells grown on glucose (new experiment) versus galactose (in original manuscript). Interestingly, we show that the most enriched partners of hTim8a in situations of low respiratory demand (glucose) are hTim8b and hTim13, in addition to Coa4, Coa7, cyt <italic>c</italic> and COX6B1. Under high respiratory demand, hTim13 becomes far less enriched and we see the addition of Coa6 and COX41l to this interaction network. This suggest a rearrangement of the hTim8a/b/13 complex and based on crosslinking of hTim8a to Cox17 (Figure 7F) we conclude that hTim8a is acting in the modular assembly pathway of Complex IV either as an assembly factor or regulator of other assembly factors. Unravelling the precise molecular function of Tim8 is beyond the scope of this paper and presents an exciting avenue of future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors made an impressive effort to study hTim8a interactors by mass spectrometry. However, the authors only highlighted very selective components in these graphs (e.g. Figure 3C) to support their conclusions (e.g. on the hTim8a-COX interaction). Follow-up experiments to identify direct substrates of the human Tim8-Tim13 complex and to confirm the proteomic analyses are missing. What are the direct interaction partners of hTim8 in SH-SYS5 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this and now adjusted new 7G (old Figure 3C) to include labelling of additional enriched proteins. We have also included Figure 7—source data 1 showing a ranked list of all enriched proteins in the IP. To address the stable interacting partners, we performed the experiment described above in point 2, x-linking and immunoprecipitation of hTim8a<sup>FLAG</sup> from mitochondria grown on glucose as a carbon source. This data reveals that one of the most stable interacting partners is indeed hTim13, however this interaction is compromised under conditions of high respiration. This exciting result indicates the hTim8a/b/hTim13 complex is not a static entity but can rearrange to accommodate unique functions.</p><p>As indicated in the Discussion our data suggests that the Tim8a/Tim8b/Tim13 network is involved in a number of aspects of mitochondria biology. We see interactions among the chaperones themselves, but also with proteins involved in Complex IV biology and other proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control, including pGAM5, OPA1, Yme1L, CLPB and the Prohibitins. We have not addressed these additional interactions in the context of this study, but again this will likely represent an exciting avenue for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In addition to complex IV defects, the authors also refer to a defect in complex I (Figure 2D). In addition, immunoblotting of several mitochondrial and nuclear encoded complex IV and complex I subunits in the hTim8a mutant cell lines will complete the dataset. It would be interesting to assess oxygen consumption and complex activities in Tim8a-deficient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, which include immunoblots and quantifications for Complex I and Complex IV subunits in mitochondrial lacking hTim8b or hTim8a. We also include Figure 6A, which addresses the reviewers comment more directly and shows the relative abundances of all Complex I and Complex IV subunits across the four cell lines used in this study (hTim8a<sup>KO</sup>, hTim8<sup>MUT SH</sup>, hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> and hTim8b<sup>KO SH</sup>). Through this analysis we can see that hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> HEK293, hTim8a<sup>MUT</sup> SHSY5Y and hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> SHSY5Y cells have decreased abundance in Complex IV subunits or assembly factors compared to control cells. hTim8a<sup>KO</sup> HEK293 do not share this profile, reflecting the tissue-expression and/or function of hTim8a. Despite the downward trend of Complex I (Figure 6A, middle panel), few individual subunits are depleted significantly, and we believe this reflects a co-dependency of Complexes I and IV for stability in respiratory supercomplexes.</p><p>Oxygen consumption rate measurements (new Figure 4C, D and E) indicate no major respiration defect in HEK293 cells lacking hTim8a or hTim8b, however a minor reduction in maximal OCR of hTim8b<sup>KO</sup> HEK293 following the addition of FCCP. Importantly, SH-SY5Y cells lacking hTim8a are severely impaired in both basal and maximal OCR, which correlates well the individual respiratory chain complex activities in these cells (new Figure 4F showing defects in complex I and IV in SH-SY5Y cells lacking either hTim8a or hTim8b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In relation to the points 3 and 4 above, the authors propose a series of events in the following order: TIMM8a -&gt; COX assembly defect -&gt; ROS production -&gt; Apoptosis -&gt; pathological consequences. Presumably the human Tim8-Tim13 complex serves a number of different clients, such as carriers, TIM22 components and COX constituents, or complex I and their absence causes a more pleiotropic defect. How confident can we be that it is complex IV disassembly in Tim8a-deficient SH-SY5Y cells that is responsible for priming the cells to apoptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>Given that all four cell lines created in this study had reduced levels in the COX17 protein we wondered if a COX17-dependent process was at the heart of the cell death phenomenon in cells lacking hTim8a. To dissect this, we have included new Figure 9. We show that knockdown of COX17 results in the same cellular outcomes as the depletion of hTim8a (upregulation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis, elevated oxidative stress), suggesting a link. In a more direct approach, we then assessed if CMV driven re-expression of COX17 in hTim8<sup>MUT</sup> SH-SY5Y cells could restore some of the cellular phenotypes observed in these cells. As COX17 is an established substrate of Mia40 we knew the protein should have no issues reaching the mitochondria. Indeed, this approach complemented many of the phenotypes observed in cells lacking hTim8a, including a reduction in ROS levels and reduction in cell sensitivity to death. We believe this data suggests that the Complex IV assembly defect is driving the pathology associated with MTS, however we do agree with the reviewer in that we cannot dismiss the possibility that some other protein and/or substrate of hTim8a is playing a role. Indeed, we indicate this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments (discussed and unified by the reviewers):</p><p>- In most cases, to quantify apoptosis, the authors measure PS exposure using the Annexin V assay and the results are expressed as 'relative luminescence unit'.

The text refers to Table 3, however, this table contains the metabolomics data. This needs to be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been fixed and appropriate source files are associated with each figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
