<italic>PAPP‐A2</italic> inactivating mutations have low bone mineral density. The underlying mechanisms for this reduced calcification are poorly understood. Using a zebrafish model, we report that Papp-aa regulates bone calcification by promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting epithelial cell (ionocyte) quiescence-proliferation transition. Ionocytes, which are normally quiescent, re-enter the cell cycle under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress. Genetic deletion of Papp-aa, but not the closely related Papp-ab, abolished ionocyte proliferation and reduced calcified bone mass. Loss of Papp-aa expression or activity resulted in diminished IGF1 receptor-Akt-Tor signaling in ionocytes. Under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress, Papp-aa cleaved Igfbp5a. Under normal conditions, however, Papp-aa proteinase activity was suppressed and IGFs were sequestered in the IGF/Igfbp complex. Pharmacological disruption of the IGF/Igfbp complex or adding free IGF1 activated IGF signaling and promoted ionocyte proliferation. These findings suggest that Papp-aa-mediated local Igfbp5a cleavage functions as a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated molecular switch linking IGF signaling to bone calcification by stimulating epithelial cell quiescence-proliferation transition under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pappalysin</kwd><kwd>STC</kwd><kwd>IGFBP5</kwd><kwd>IGF signaling</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ deficiency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1557850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Cunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M-Cubed3 Project U064122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Cunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011958</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Sciences (DFF|FSS) 4183-00314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oxvig</surname><given-names>Claus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R317-2019-526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oxvig</surname><given-names>Claus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Shuang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zinc metalloproteinase Papp-aa-mediated Igfbp5 proteolysis functions as a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated molecular switch linking IGF signaling to epithelial cell proliferation and bone calcification.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-a (PAPP‐A) and PAPP‐A2 belong to the conserved pappalysin proteinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boldt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oxvig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conover and Oxvig, 2018</xref>). PAPP-A was first discovered in the plasma of pregnant women in the 1970s. Decades of studies suggest that PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 are zinc metalloproteinases cleaving insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laursen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oxvig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conover and Oxvig, 2018</xref>). IGFBPs are a family of six secreted proteins that bind IGF ligands with high affinity and regulate IGF availability to the IGF1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard and Duan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clemmons, 2018</xref>). In vitro studies suggested that PAPP-A is tethered to the cell-surface and primarily cleaves IGFBP4 and IGFBP5 among the six IGFBPs. PAPP-A2, on the other hand, is secreted and cleaves IGFBP3 and IGFBP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oxvig, 2015</xref>). Papp-a knockout mice showed a 40% reduction in body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conover et al., 2004</xref>), a phenotype similar to those of the IGF1 and IGF2 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 1993</xref>). Papp-a2 knockout mice had a modest decrease in body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christians et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christians et al., 2019</xref>). These findings led to the proposal that PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 promote somatic growth by increasing bioavailable IGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oxvig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujimoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conover and Oxvig, 2018</xref>). This notion is further supported by recent clinical studies showing that human patients carrying inactivating mutations in the PAPP-A2 gene displayed progressive growth failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dauber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujimoto et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to reduced body height, these patients also had lower bone mineral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dauber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujimoto et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, the Papp-a mutant mice had delayed appearance of ossification centers and reduced calcified bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conover et al., 2004</xref>). The Papp-a2 mutant mice had sex-and age-specific defects in bone structure and mineral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christians et al., 2019</xref>). Despite observations suggest a role of these metalloproteinases in bone mineralization, there is still a lack of causal evidence and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.</p><p>We have recently found that genetic deletion of IGF binding protein 5a (Igfbp5a), a major PAPP-A substrate, results in reduced calcified bone mass in zebrafish even though <italic>igfbp5a</italic> is not expressed in skeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish embryos and larvae, <italic>igfbp5a</italic> is specifically expressed in a population of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting epithelial cells (ionocytes) located in the yolk sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). These ionocytes, known as NaR cells, are functionally similar to human intestinal epithelial cells. They play a key role in maintaining body Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by uptaking Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the surrounding habitat, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Hwang, 2016</xref>). A hallmark of NaR cells and human intestinal epithelial cells is the expression of Trpv6/TRPV6, a constitutive calcium channel constituting the first and rate-limiting step in the transcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoenderop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2014</xref>). Trpv6/TRPV6 also regulates NaR cell quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xin et al., 2019</xref>). NaR cells, normally non-dividing and quiescent, rapidly exit quiescence and re-enter the cell cycle in response to low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). This is thought to be an adaptive response, allowing animals to take up adequate Ca<sup>2+</sup> for maintaining body Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and survive under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, while no change was observed in NaR cells under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions, the lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced adaptive NaR cell reactivation and proliferation were impaired in <italic>igfbp5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism underlying this [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent phenotype is unclear.</p><p>Zebrafish have three genes belonging to the pappalysin family, including <italic>papp-aa</italic>, <italic>papp-ab</italic>, and <italic>papp-a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kjaer-Sorensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kjaer-Sorensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolman et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we show that among the three genes, <italic>papp-aa</italic> is highly expressed in NaR cells. Genetic deletion of <italic>papp-aa</italic> but not the paralogous <italic>papp-ab</italic>, resulted in a lack of calcified bone and abolished low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced NaR cell reactivation and proliferation. We provide several lines of independent evidence showing that Papp-aa-mediated Igfbp5a proteolysis acts as a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated switch linking local IGF signaling to epithelial cell proliferation and organismal Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Papp-aa is highly expressed in NaR cells and is indispensable in NaR cell reactivation and bone calcification</title><p>To date, published whole mount in situ hybridization data suggest that <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA is expressed in various neural tissues, <italic>papp-ab</italic> mRNA in developing myotomes and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kjaer-Sorensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>papp-a2</italic> in the notochord and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kjaer-Sorensen et al., 2014</xref>). Because NaR cells are located in the yolk sac epidermis, they are more sensitive to protease K treatment, a key step in the whole mount in situ hybridization procedure to permeabilize embryos. To test whether any of the pappalysin genes are expressed in NaR cells, we isolated NaR cells from <italic>Tg(igfbp5a:GFP)</italic> fish using FACS. <italic>Tg(igfbp5a:GFP)</italic> fish are a reporter fish line in which NaR cells are labeled by GFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). The mRNA levels of <italic>papp-aa</italic> in NaR cells were 2-fold higher than those of <italic>papp-ab</italic> and <italic>papp-a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress treatment had no effect on their mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also compared the <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA levels in NaR cells with those non-GFP cells from the rest of the fish body. The level of <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA in NaR cells was approximately 10-fold greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In comparison, the <italic>papp-ab</italic> mRNA levels were similar between NaR cells and other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed after optimizing the permeabilization condition. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolman et al., 2015</xref>), strong <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA signal was detected in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA signals were detected in cells in the yolk sac region beginning at three dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To test this idea we used NBI-31772, an aptamer that can displace and release IGF from the IGF/IGFBP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>).

While NBI-31772 treatment increased Akt and Tor signaling activity, these increases were abolished by BMS-754807 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Zebrafish have been used with growing success to model various pathological defects affecting human skeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laizé et al., 2014</xref>). Zebrafish shares many similarities in bone biology with mammals, including bone formation, resorption, mineralization, and extracellular matrix maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laizé et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike mammals, however, zebrafish bone is acellular and osteoclasts are mononucleated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laizé et al., 2014</xref>). Calcium, an important bone component, is an essential ion and plays important roles in development and adult physiology. Calcium homeostasis is regulated by many hormonal circuits. Many hormones known to be critical to mammalian bone mineralization, including Vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin were found to be important in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Hwang, 2016</xref>). There are also examples of hormones first discovered in fish. Stanniocalcin (Stc), for example, was initially discovered in bony fish as a hypocalcemic hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pang, 1973</xref>). It was later found that humans and other mammals have two STC genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeung et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies suggest that human STC1 and STC2 are potent PAPP-A and A2 inhibitors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jepsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kløverpris et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we provide genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological evidence showing that Papp-aa and IGF signaling regulates bone calcification by promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting epithelial cell reactivation and proliferation. Mechanistically, Papp-aa acts by cleaving Igfbp5a and activating IGF1 receptor-mediated Akt and Tor signaling in NaR cells in response to low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress.</p><p>Using an optimized in situ hybridization protocol and qPCR analysis of FACS isolated NaR cells, we found that Papp-aa is highly expressed in NaR cells. This was further confirmed by double color in situ hybridization. Our genetic analysis results showed that deletion of Papp-aa, but not the closely related Papp-ab, abolished low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced NaR cell quiescence-proliferation transition. There was a complete lack of calcified bone in <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish at seven dpf. Although low levels of calcification were detected in some components of the craniofacial skeleton in <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish at 10 and 12 dpf, the mutant fish had no calcified vertebrate in these late stages. The defective bone calcification and impaired NaR cell reactivation suggest that <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish suffered and died prematurely from Ca<sup>2+</sup> deficiency, likely due to insufficient epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. The action of Papp-aa on epithelial cells requires its proteinase activity. Reintroduction of wild-type Papp-aa, but not a proteolytically inactivated mutant, reactivated NaR cells in the <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant fish. Likewise, treatment of wild-type fish with two distinct metalloproteinase inhibitors impaired NaR cell reactivation. When STC1 and STC2 was specifically expressed in NaR cells separately, they both blocked low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced NaR cell quiescence-proliferation transition, indicating the importance of local endogenous Papp-aa in NaR cells.</p><p>We provide several lines of independent evidence showing that Papp-aa regulates NaR cell quiescence-proliferation transition via proteolytically cleaving locally expressed Igfbp5a and activating IGF signaling. We have previously reported that Igfbp5a is specifically expressed in NaR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that in addition to Igfbp5a, Igfbp2a is also highly expressed in NaR cells. The expression levels of other Igfbps including Igfbp5b are low in NaR cells. Our biochemical analysis showed that Papp-aa efficiently cleaved human IGFBP4 and IGFBP5 but not IGFBP2 and other IGFBPs. Since the zebrafish genome does not have an igfbp4 gene, we postulated that Igfbp5a is the main Papp-aa substrate in NaR cells. We found that while Papp-aa cleaved Igfbp5a, Papp-a2 had no such activity. Although Papp-ab can also cleave Igfbp5a, its expression in NaR cells is relatively low. Another line of evidence came from <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish. The impaired NaR cell reactivation in <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish was accompanied with reduced IGF1 receptor-mediated Akt-Tor signaling activity. Likewise, inhibition of Papp-aa proteolytic activity resulted in reduced Akt-Tor activity in NaR cells. Importantly, targeted expression of a constitutively active Akt in <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NaR cells was sufficient to rescue their reactivation and proliferation, supporting the notion that Akt mediates Papp-aa action in NaR cells. Akt is involved in signal transduction of a number of growth factors and hormones. However, the fact that addition of human or fish IGF-1 was sufficient to activate NaR cell proliferation strongly argues that IGF signaling is critical.</p><p>A most interesting finding made in this study is that Papp-aa-mediated Igfbp5a proteolysis in NaR cells is suppressed under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions. This conclusion is supported by the fact that genetic deletion of Papp-aa had no effect on Akt-Tor signaling or NaR cell proliferation when fish were kept under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions, while it abolished IGF signaling and NaR cell reactivation and proliferation under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress. Pharmacological inhibition or targeted expression of STC1/2 affected IGF signaling in NaR cells only under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Furthermore, pharmacological disruption of the Igfbp5/IGF complex by NBI-31772 treatment was sufficient to increase Akt and Tor activity and promote NaR cell reactivation under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions. This effect of NBI-31772 is clearly mediated by IGF signaling because 1) NBI-31772 increased Akt and Tor signaling activity in an IGF1 receptor-dependent manner, and 2) NBI-31772 treatment-induced NaR cell proliferation was abolished by co-treatment with inhibitors blocking the IGF1 receptor, Akt, PI3 kinase, and Tor activity. NBI-31772 not only binds to IGFBP5, but also other IGFBPs. Indeed, our RNA expression analysis results showed that not only Igfbp5a, but also Igfbp2a is highly expressed in NaR cells. While the levels of <italic>igfbp1b</italic>, <italic>igfbp3</italic>, <italic>igfbp5b</italic>, and <italic>igfbp6b</italic> mRNA in NaR cells are low, they are nonetheless detectable. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that NBI-31772 may also affect IGFs bound to other Igfbps. However, regardless of whether Papp-aa acts via Igfbp5a alone or together with other Igfbps, the NBI-31772 results clearly indicate that latent IGF is present in/near NaR cells under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], suggesting the limiting step may be the release of IGFs from the Igfbp/IGF complexes. The zebrafish genome contains 4 IGF genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zou et al., 2009</xref>). Currently, there are no antibodies available against these zebrafish IGF ligands, making it impossible to measure IGF release after NBI-31772 treatment. To circumvent this problem, we treated zebrafish embryos with free IGF1 following a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassaf et al., 2019</xref>). Addition of either human or fish IGF-1 increased NaR cell proliferation, supporting the idea that bioavailability of IGFs is critical.</p><p>IGFBP5/Igfbp5a has been shown to both inhibit and potentiate IGF actions in mammalian and zebrafish cells in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan and Allard, 2020</xref>). How the same protein exerts these opposing biological effects was not well understood. The data presented in this study suggests that Papp-aa-mediated Igfbp5a proteolysis functions as a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated molecular switch to turn on and off IGF signaling in NaR cells. Under normal conditions, Papp-aa activity is suppressed at low levels and Igfbp5a is intact. Intact Igfbp5a acts as an IGF inhibitory protein as it binds IGF ligands and prevents its binding and activation of the IGF1 receptor. Under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress, Papp-a activity is increased. Papp-aa proteolytically cleaves Igfbp5a and releases IGFs from the Igfbp5a/IGF complex to activate IGF1 receptor-mediated PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor signaling, thus promoting NaR cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the seemingly opposite biological effects of Igfbp5a and IGFBP5. We suggest that when Igfbp5a/IGFBP5 is present in a microenvironment containing active Papp-aa, it potentiates IGF action because Papp-aa-mediated Igfbp5a proteolysis releases IGFs from the Igfbp5a/IGF complex. When Igfbp5/IGFBP5 is expressed in tissues without Papp-aa or with Papp-aa activity inhibited, it inhibits IGF action as Igfbp5a binds to IGFs and sequesters IGFs in the IGF/Igfbp5a complex.</p><p>While it has become evident that Igfbp5/IGFBP-5 acts as the pivot point in a switch between regulated states of inhibition and activation of IGF signaling, many questions remain. For example, mutation of Igfbp5a K148 to alanine reduced, but did not abolish Papp-aa cleavage, suggesting there may be other residues and/or other proteinases involved. Although Papp-ab can cleave Igfbp-5a efficiently in vitro, Papp-ab is clearly not involved in NaR cell reactivation in vivo as demonstrated by the <italic>papp-ab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant fish data. Whether Papp-ab-mediated Igfbp5a plays similar role in switching on/off IGF signaling in different tissues or different life stages awaits further investigation. All three pappalysin family members can proteolytically cleave Igfbp5b efficiently but the functional role of Igfbp5b and its regulations by pappalysins are unclear. We noted that Igfbp5a was partially degraded in the absence of Papp-aa. This was evident in the mock group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, suggesting the presence of other proteinases in the conditioned media used. This is consistent with the fact that human IGFBP5 is degraded by a host of proteinases. In addition to PAPP-A and -A2, thrombin, elastase, cathepsin G, C1s, ADAM 9, ADAM 12 s, MMP-1, and MMP-2 etc. have been shown to degrade IGFBP5 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan and Allard, 2020</xref>). Future studies are needed to elucidate whether any of these proteolytic modifications play similar roles in turning on and off IGF signaling.</p><p>Another important remaining question is how Papp-aa proteolytic activity is suppressed under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions. Since changes in external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] did not change <italic>papp-aa</italic> mRNA level nor <italic>igfbp5a</italic> mRNA level, and because addition of free IGF1 or pharmacological disruption of the Igfbp/IGF complex was sufficient to activate IGF signaling and induce NaR cell reactivation under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions, we speculate that there is a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-regulated post-transcriptional mechanism(s) at work. One possible candidate is Stc. Recent studies showed that mammalian PAPP-A proteolytic activity is inhibited by STC1 and STC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jepsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kløverpris et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we showed that overexpression of STC1 or STC2 in NaR cells impaired Papp-aa-induced IGF signaling and NaR cell reactivation in vivo. Stc protein was originally discovered in bony fish as a hypocalcemic hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pang, 1973</xref>). We now understand that the human genome has two <italic>STC</italic> genes while the zebrafish genome has four <italic>stc</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeung et al., 2012</xref>). The mRNA levels of <italic>stc1</italic> but not the other <italic>stc</italic> genes are significantly higher in fish raised in high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] medium compared to those kept in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2015</xref>). Forced expression and morpholino-based knockdown of Stc1 altered NaR cell density and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tseng et al., 2009</xref>), although these manipulations have also changed HR and NCC cell density and the uptake of other ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2015</xref>). Whether endogenous Stc1 and/or other Stc proteins are responsible for the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent suppression of Papp-aa activity awaits future studies. It is also worth noting that both human PAPP-A and zebrafish Papp-aa contain three Lin-12/Notch repeat (LNR) modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolman et al., 2015</xref>). LNR modules were initially discovered in the Notch receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lovendahl et al., 2018</xref>). These modules can bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and are involved in calcium depletion-induced Notch receptor cleavage and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vardar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). The three LNR modules in human PAPP-A can bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent substrate binding exosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mikkelsen et al., 2008</xref>). Whether these LRN modules are involved in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent suppression of Papp-aa activity is unclear.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study have uncovered a novel function of Papp-aa in reactivating quiescent epithelial cells and regulating bone calcification. Papp-aa promotes quiescent NaR cells to re-enter the cell cycle by locally cleaving Igfbp5a and activating IGF signaling in a physiological context-dependent manner. These findings not only provide new insights into the physiological functions of the pappalysin family zinc metalloproteinases, but also have important implications in the regulation of cellular quiescence. Reactivation of quiescent cells is critical for tissue repair, regeneration, and adult stem cell renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao, 2014</xref>). Genetic studies in flies and mice suggest that insulin/IGF-PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor signaling pathway is critical in adult stem cell quiescence regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito and Suda, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ziegler et al., 2015</xref>).

Reactivation of the imprinted IGF2 gene expression or activation of mTOR in mouse adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) promotes them to exit quiescence and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venkatraman et al., 2013</xref>). IGF2 also stimulates adult neural stem cell and intestinal stem cell reactivation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ziegler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziegler et al., 2019</xref>). Elevated PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor activity stimulates reactivation of adult stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gil-Ranedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemmati et al., 2019</xref>). Although the role of insulin/IGF-PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor signaling in reactivating quiescent adult stem cells has been demonstrated across a wide range of species, the mechanisms underlying its cell type- and cell state-specific activation are poorly understood. The similarities among mammals, flies, and fish imply evolutionarily conserved and general mechanisms at work. Future studies are needed to determine whether the PAPP-A/A2-mediated IGFBP proteolytic cleavage plays similar roles in the reactivation of adult stem cells and/or other quiescent cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Zebrafish were raised and crossed according to the standard husbandry guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

acts to reactivate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting epithelial cells. This in turn impact bone calcification. As such, this provides novel insight into the mechanism linking IGF signaling action on the epithelial cell to bone calcification.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The metalloproteinase Papp-aa functions as a molecular switch linking IGF signaling to adaptive epithelial growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shoshana Yakar (Reviewer #1); Julian Christians (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General Assessment:</p><p>While it has been known for some time that plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) loss impacts bone, the mechanism has not been completely explored. The reviewers find that this paper utilizes a zebrafish model, to provide evidence that PAPP-aa (zebrafish paralog) activity in ionocytes (NaR cells, similar to human intestinal endothelial cells) is calcium dependent. They then explore an alternative mechanism by which the PAPP-A protease regulates IGF-1 bioavailability to the IGF-1 receptor.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) They have determined that PAPP-aa protease regulates intestinal calcium transport to an extent that this alters skeletal calcification within the intact zebrafish.</p><p>2) They demonstrated that expression of PAPP-aa was required for ionocyte activation and that inhibition of PAPP-aa impaired ionocyte activation.</p><p>3) Mechanistically, these data suggest that PAPP-aa contributes to the proteolysis of the IGFBP5-IGF-1 complex, that this is co-incident with the activation of the Akt-Tor pathway and thus initiating ionocyte cell proliferation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was significant concern raised during review about specificity of PAPP-aa in the zebrafish with regards to cleavage of just Igfbp5a. The data regarding the PAPP-aa mutant clearly show that PAPP-aa is required for this activity. The prospect that PAPP-aa might be cleaving other IGFBPs and other non-Igfbp peptides was raised by multiple reviewers. A limitation of this study is that this possibility is not addressed. It was felt that alternative explanations of the results need to be more clearly presented.</p><p>2) While it was acknowledged that it is possible that PAPP-aa's mechanisms of action is via IGF-1, reviewers felt that this was not definitively demonstrated in this paper. The limitations of the data presented in Figure 6 were not fully discussed and no definitive evidence that free IGF-I is actually increased was shown. The reviewers point out that the NBI inhibitor binds to multiple IGF binding proteins as well as other proteins, including EGF binding proteins, therefore it is not a mono specific agent for IGFBP-5, particularly at the concentration used in this study. A positive control showing that IGF-I was released was considered to be important. Further, more discussion regarding the limitations needs to be provided.</p><p>3) It was felt that the data presented linking Igfbp5, IGF-1 and PAPP-aa was thin. The reviewers wished to see results from a double Igfbp5a and Papp-aa deletion mutant. The rational was that if Papp-aa acts through Igfbp5a, there should be no difference between <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup> igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish and <italic>papp-aa<sup>+/+</sup> igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish.</p><p>4) Expression of the constitutively active Akt mutant partially reversing the changes in the signaling pathway is reasonable evidence that the Akt pathway is involved in mediating the effects of PAPP-aa; however multiple growth factors as well as nutrients can activate the Akt pathway. IGF-I is a cofactor for multiple other growth factors and therefore simply inhibiting the IGF receptor with a relatively high concentration of a kinase inhibitor was not considered adequate specificity data. This limitation was not discussed.</p><p>5) There is one experiment wherein a cleavage site mutant of IGFBP-5a was slightly changed in terms of proteolytic degradation in the presence of activated PAPP-aa, but the data are not definitive. It was felt that an experiment showing this mutant could alter the biologic response was required.</p><p>6) There is an extensive paragraph about PAPP-A in the Discussion and an inferential comment to relating to PAPP-aa since it contains the same three modules that are important for PAPP-A activation. However, PAPP-A has different substrates therefore it's activity may not be comparable to PAPP-aa. This paragraph should be edited to deemphasize the importance of this possible correlation in light of the limitations already raised.</p><p>7) The model presented in Figure 6F is consistent with the results of the present study, but does not explain a previous study (described in the Introduction), in which deletion of Igfbp5a reduced calcified bone mass, an observation similar to deletion of PAPP-aa (Figure 2G). This previous study also described that deletion of Igfbp5a &quot;blunted the low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced IGF signaling and NaR cell proliferation&quot;. However, at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], Igfbp5a is being proteolyzed by PAPP-aa, so why would it matter if it is deleted? Deletion of Igfbp5a would be expected to have effects opposite to those of deleting PAPP-aa (which would increase intact Igfbp5a levels). The Discussion states: &quot;Igfbp5a is critical in activating IGF signaling and promoting adaptive epithelial growth by reactivating NaR cells&quot; and yet the model in Figure 6F suggests that Igfbp5a maintains quiescence. There should be some acknowledgement/explanation of this contradiction.</p><p>8) There is mention of the rescue of the PAPP-aa mutants with wild-type PAPP-aa, but no mention of whether this rescued the lethal phenotype.</p><p>9) The impact statement should be reworded, as it is not clear what &quot;quiescence exit decision&quot; means without reading the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52322.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was significant concern raised during review about specificity of PAPP-aa in the zebrafish with regards to cleavage of just Igfbp5a.

To address this concern, we have performed additional proteinase assays. As shown in Figure 4A, Papp-aa efficiently cleaved IGFBP5 and IGFBP4, whereas it did not cleave IGFBP1, -2, -3, and -6. This finding is in good agreement with published mammalian studies (Oxvig, 2015; Conover and Oxvig, 2018). Zebrafish genome does not contain any <italic>igfbp4</italic> gene, but it has 2 igfbp5 genes and several other igfbp genes. We mapped the expression profiles of these <italic>igfbp</italic> genes in NaR cells. The new results, shown in Figure 4D, showed that <italic>igfbp2a</italic> and <italic>igfbp5a</italic>mRNA is highly expressed in NaR cells. The levels of other <italic>igfbp</italic> genes are much lower. Among the 3 pappalysin family members, Papp-aa and Papp-ab can both proteolytically cleave Igfbp5a, while Papp-a2 had little activity (Figure 3C). In comparison, Igfbp5b can be cleaved by all 3 pappalysin family members (Figure 4B) and Igfbp3 can be degraded by Papp-a2 only, albeit at very low levels (Figure 4C). These data together with the data shown in Figure 1, suggest that Igfbp5a is likely an important substrate of Papp-aa in NaR cells.</p><p>To further address the specificity issue in vivo, we generated a new mutant fish line by deleting the paralogous <italic>papp-ab</italic> gene using CRISPR/Cas9. The new results shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, showed that genetic deletion of Papp-ab had no effect on low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced NaR cell reactivation and proliferation. These new data argues strongly that Papp-aa-mediated cleavage of Igfbp-5a is critical in NaR cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While it was acknowledged that it is possible that PAPP-aa's mechanisms of action is via IGF-1, reviewers felt that this was not definitively demonstrated in this paper. The limitations of the data presented in Figure 6 were not fully discussed and no definitive evidence that free IGF-I is actually increased was shown. The reviewers point out that the NBI inhibitor binds to multiple IGF binding proteins as well as other proteins, including EGF binding proteins, therefore it is not a mono specific agent for IGFBP-5, particularly at the concentration used in this study. A positive control showing that IGF-I was released was considered to be important. Further, more discussion regarding the limitations needs to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern. As shown in Figure 6, addition of NBI-31772 was sufficient to increase Akt and Tor activity and promote NaR cell reactivation under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions. This effect of NBI-31772 is clearly mediated by IGF signaling because 1) NBI-31772 increased Akt and Tor signaling activity in an IGF1 receptor-dependent manner (Figure 6C and 6D), and 2) NBI-31772 treatment-induced NaR cell proliferation was abolished by co-treatment with inhibitors blocking the IGF1 receptor, PI3 kinase, Akt, and Tor activity (Figure 6E; Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, NBI-31772 treatment did not alter pErk signaling and MEK inhibitor U0216 did not inhibit NBI-31772-induced NaR cell proliferation (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These data suggest that the effect of NBI on NaR cells is mediated by IGF1 receptor-PI3 kinase-Akt-Tor signaling.</p><p>We agree that the NBI inhibitor is not a mono specific agent for IGFBP-5. Our new gene expression analysis results (Figure 4D) show that in addition to Igfbp5a, Igfbp2a is also highly expressed in NaR cells. The levels of <italic>igfbp1b, igfbp3, igfbp5b,</italic> and <italic>igfbp6b</italic>mRNA in NaR cells are much lower, while those of <italic>igfbp2b</italic> and <italic>igfbp6a</italic> are barely detectable. In the revised manuscript, we have discussed the possibility that NBI may also affect other Igfbps (Discussion paragraph four).</p><p>Zebrafish has 4 IGF ligand genes (Zou et al., 2009). Currently, antibodies against these IGFs are not available and there are currently no tools to measure free IGFs in these or other cells in vivo. We have discussed these limitations in the revised manuscript (Discussion paragraph four). To circumvent this problem, we took an alternative approach following a recent paper by Alassaf et al., 2019. We found that adding free human or fish IGF1 was sufficient to activate NaR cell proliferation (Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). These new data have provided additional evidence supporting the idea that bioavailable IGFs are important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was felt that the data presented linking Igfbp5, IGF-1 and PAPP-aa was thin. The reviewers wished to see results from a double Igfbp5a and Papp-aa deletion mutant. The rational was that if Papp-aa acts through Igfbp5a, there should be no difference between papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup> igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup> fish and papp-aa<sup>+/+</sup> igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup> fish.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have obtained <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double mutant embryos and compared them to <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> single mutant embryos. As shown in Figure 4E, no differences in NaR cell reactivation were found between <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic>single and <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup>: igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double mutant fish.</p><p>We also measured pAkt levels in these fish and found no difference. These data results are presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Expression of the constitutively active Akt mutant partially reversing the changes in the signaling pathway is reasonable evidence that the Akt pathway is involved in mediating the effects of PAPP-aa; however multiple growth factors as well as nutrients can activate the Akt pathway.

This limitation was not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have also discussed the limitation of the CaAkt results (Discussion paragraph three). As mentioned above, to further test our idea, we treated zebrafish embryos with free fish and human IGF1. The new data show that adding free IGF1 was sufficient to stimulate NaR cell proliferation under normal calcium conditions (Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This has provided new and independent evidence supporting our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is one experiment wherein a cleavage site mutant of IGFBP-5a was slightly changed in terms of proteolytic degradation in the presence of activated PAPP-aa, but the data are not definitive. It was felt that an experiment showing this mutant could alter the biologic response was required.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We have repeated the proteinase assays and the new results showed that mutation of Igfbp5a K148 to Alanine indeed reduced Papp-aa-mediated proteolysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). But the Igfbp5aK148A mutant was also partially degraded, suggesting there may be other proteinases and additional cleavage site(s). This is not unexpected. In addition to PAPP-A and A2, other proteases have been reported to degrade IGFBP-5 in vitro, including thrombin, elastase, cathepsin G, C1s, ADAM 9, ADAM 12s, MMP-1, and MMP-2 etc. (Clemmons, Endocr Rev. 2001, 22:800-17; and Duan and Allard, 2020). Although human PAPP-A-mediated human IGFBP-5 cleavage has been reported and the cleavage site(s) mapped for two decades, to date there is no biological data on any PAPP-A-resistant IGFBP-5 mutants. This is in large part due to the fact that many proteinases can cleave IGFBP-5, depending on different locations/stages, cell types, and physiological/pathological states. In this study, we found that recombinantly expressed Igfbp5a is unstable and susceptible to degradation. Even in the absence of Papp-aa or Papp-ab, it degrades quite rapidly. This is evident in the Mock group shown in Figure 3C, Figure 4A, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. Because of this, we were unable to obtain sufficient amount Igfbp5a for biological assays. In the revised manuscript, we have discussed these limitations and the need for further experiments in the future (Discussion paragraphs four, five and six). We have also moved the Igfbp5a and Igfbp5b mutant data into the supplemental materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is an extensive paragraph about PAPP-A in the Discussion and an inferential comment to relating to PAPP-aa since it contains the same three modules that are important for PAPP-A activation. However, PAPP-A has different substrates therefore it's activity may not be comparable to PAPP-aa. This paragraph should be edited to deemphasize the importance of this possible correlation in light of the limitations already raised.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is no experimental evidence showing the three structurally conserved LNR modules in zebrafish Papp-aa play a similar role as those in human PAPP-A. In the revised manuscript, we have shortened and reworded the Discussion about LNR modules (paragraph seven).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The model presented in Figure 6F is consistent with the results of the present study, but does not explain a previous study (described in the Introduction), in which deletion of Igfbp5a reduced calcified bone mass, an observation similar to deletion of PAPP-aa (Figure 2G). This previous study also described that deletion of Igfbp5a &quot;blunted the low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced IGF signaling and NaR cell proliferation&quot;. However, at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], Igfbp5a is being proteolyzed by PAPP-aa, so why would it matter if it is deleted? Deletion of Igfbp5a would be expected to have effects opposite to those of deleting PAPP-aa (which would increase intact Igfbp5a levels). The Discussion states: &quot;Igfbp5a is critical in activating IGF signaling and promoting adaptive epithelial growth by reactivating NaR cells&quot; and yet the model in Figure 6F suggests that Igfbp5a maintains quiescence. There should be some acknowledgement/explanation of this contradiction.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data and model (Figure 6G) suggest that Papp-aa cleaves Igfbp5a in a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent manner. Under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] conditions, Papp-aa activity is suppressed and Igfbp-5a is intact. Intact Igfbp5a acts as an IGF inhibitory protein as it binds IGF ligands and sequester the IGF ligands from the IGF1 receptor. Under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress, Papp-a activity is increased. This increases IGFBP-5a proteolytic cleavage and releases IGFs from the IGFBP-5a/IGF complex to activate IGF-1 receptor and promotes NaR cells to proliferate. We propose that IGFBP-5 is part of a molecular switch that turns IGF signaling on or off in NaR cells. We have revised the text, Figure 6G and the legends to clearly explain these findings and our model to avoid any confusions.</p><p>The results of this study and those of Liu et al., 2018, are in good agreement with each other. In both <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant and <italic>igfbp5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant fish, the low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] stress-induced IGF signaling and NaR cell proliferation were blunted.These mutant fish also both suffered from Ca<sup>2+</sup> and die prematurely, but <italic>papp-aa<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant appeared to be more severe and die younger, indicating that Papp-aa may have substrates other than Igfbp5a. In this study, we have presented data showing that Papp-aa also cleaved Igfbp5b (Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).

While this approach is very useful in testing the sufficiency of Papp-aa and its mode of action, it cannot rescue the lethality because it only targets the expression of Papp-aa transiently and to a small subset of NaR cells in a mosaic pattern. We have added a sentence in the revised manuscript to make this point clearer (subsection “Endogenous Papp-aa proteinase activity in NaR cells is critical”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The impact statement should be reworded, as it is not clear what &quot;quiescence exit decision&quot; means without reading the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have re-worded the impact statement.</p></body></sub-article></article>
