In the human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, CNV and LOH confer increased virulence and antifungal drug resistance, yet the mechanisms driving these rearrangements are not completely understood. Here, we unveil an extensive array of long repeat sequences (65–6499 bp) that are associated with CNV, LOH, and chromosomal inversions. Many of these long repeat sequences are uncharacterized and encompass one or more coding sequences that are actively transcribed. Repeats associated with genome rearrangements are predominantly inverted and separated by up to ~1.6 Mb, an extraordinary distance for homology-based DNA repair/recombination in yeast. These repeat sequences are a significant source of genome plasticity across diverse strain backgrounds including clinical, environmental, and experimentally evolved isolates, and represent previously uncharacterized variation in the reference genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>inverted repeats</kwd><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>loss of heterozygosity</kwd><kwd>segmental aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>antifungal drug resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nebraska LB692 New Initiatives Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LB692 NE Tobacco Settlement Biomedical Research Development New Initiative Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmecki</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nebraska's Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EPSCoR First Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmecki</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010537</institution-id><institution>Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LB506-2017-55</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmecki</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007254</institution-id><institution>Creighton University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CURAS Faculty Faculty Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmecki</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20RR018788 sub award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmecki</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 AI090633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forche</surname><given-names>Anja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Previously uncharacterized long repeat sequences are associated with significant genome variation that can increase fitness and promote antifungal drug resistance in diverse isolates of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome plasticity is surprisingly common in eukaryotes. DNA insertions and deletions (indels), copy number variations (CNV), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are frequently described during the evolution of organisms and of disease states such as cancer. In particular, the genome plasticity of fungal pathogens was recognized well before whole genome sequencing was available, including genome copy number variation (polyploidy), inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements, and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chibana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Magee and Magee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rustchenko-Bulgac, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Suzuki et al., 1982</xref>). Controlled in vitro and in vivo evolution experiments in combination with whole genome sequencing have further highlighted the speed in which specific genome rearrangements provide a fitness advantage that can be selected for in these fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Araya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Croll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gerstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Selmecki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stukenbrock et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, associated with nearly half a million life-threatening infections annually, predominantly in immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown and Netea, 2012</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a heterozygous diploid yeast capable of mating, yet true meiosis has not been observed. Instead, it undergoes a parasexual process that involves random chromosome loss and rare Spo11-dependent chromosome recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The majority of genomic diversity observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is attributed to asexual mitotic genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lephart and Magee, 2006</xref>). Despite this clonal lifestyle, <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates exhibit extensive genomic diversity in the form of de novo base substitutions, indels, ploidy variation (haploid, diploid, and polyploid), karyotypic variation due to segmental and whole chromosome aneuploidies, and allele copy number variation including LOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chibana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Magee and Magee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rustchenko-Bulgac, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Suzuki et al., 1982</xref>). Additionally, while <italic>C. albicans</italic> did not undergo an ancient whole genome duplication event like <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marcet-Houben et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wolfe and Shields, 1997</xref>), small-scale duplication events have resulted in gene family expansions, especially in sub-telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunn et al., 2018</xref>). A comprehensive analysis of these duplication events, their evolutionary trajectories and impact on genome stability, remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Early comparative studies of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome identified diverse repetitive loci that contribute to genotypic and phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jones et al., 2004</xref>). First, repeat analysis in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has characterized at least three major classes of long repetitive sequences: the 23 bp tandem telomeric repeat units and the 14 member telomere-associated (<italic>TLO)</italic> gene family residing in sub-telomeric regions; the Major Repeat Sequences (MRS) found, at least in part, on every <italic>C. albicans</italic> chromosome and formed by a long tandem array of ~2.1 kb RPS units flanking non-repetitive HOK and RBP-2 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chibana et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chindamporn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lephart and Magee, 2006</xref>); and the ribosomal DNA repeats (rDNA) found on ChrR, which are organized as a tandem array of up to ~200 copies of ~12 kb units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freire-Benéitez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rustchenko et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wickes et al., 1991</xref>). These long repetitive sequences can undergo both inter- and intra-locus recombination events that rapidly generate chromosome length polymorphisms, chimeric chromosomes, and telomere-telomere chromosomal fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Selmecki et al., 2010</xref>). Second, like most eukaryotes, <italic>C. albicans</italic> also encodes many ‘lone’ long terminal repeats (LTRs) and retroelements (Zorro, Tca2, Ty1/Copia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goodwin and Poulter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goodwin and Poulter, 2000</xref>); however, the relative copy number of many of these genes is hypervariable between <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates and is expanded relative to other Candida species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>). Third, short repeat sequences (short tandem repeats and trinucleotide repeats) are significantly more frequent in protein-coding sequences of <italic>C. albicans</italic> than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jones et al., 2004</xref>). Fourth, expansions of multi-gene families (identified by protein alignment) were both more common and larger than the orthologous gene family size found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. These gene families often encode proteins with roles in commensalism and virulence, including the agglutinin-like sequence (<italic>ALS</italic>) family (eight genes) and other glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored genes that encode large cell surface glycoproteins (five genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Levdansky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wilkins et al., 2018</xref>). Among these gene families, recombination and/or slippage between repeat units yields extensive allelic variation, leading to functional and phenotypic diversity, similar to the <italic>FLO</italic> genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hoyer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kunkel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Richard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Verstrepen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). The evolution of different alleles in these repeat-containing ORFs predominantly occurs by the addition, deletion, and rearrangement of repeat units within an ORF and between different ORFs, not by the acquisition of point mutations or indels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Christiaens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, these genomic studies focused on short repeat sequences and repeats found in protein-coding sequences. Less is known about long repeat sequences found throughout the genome, especially those encoding multiple ORFs and intergenic regions.</p><p>Over 19 years ago, Wolfe and colleagues showed that the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome contains thousands of small chromosomal inversion events (~10 genes long) relative to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. These inversions resulted in substantially different gene order between these two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Seoighe et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, Dujon and colleagues demonstrated that the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome had the highest rate of genome instability due to micro- and macro-rearrangements of syntenic gene blocks, relative to 11 other hemiascomycete species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>). The loss of synteny primarily resulted from chromosomal rearrangements, not sequence divergence of orthologous regions. A mechanism proposed for this genome instability was a higher incidence of repetitive sequences and/or a less efficient DNA repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The genomic diversity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> increases during in vitro and in vivo exposure to stress. For example, rates of LOH increase during exposure to elevated temperature (37°C), DNA transformation, and antifungal drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouchonville et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Forche et al., 2018</xref>). LOH is also increased during in vivo models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Forche et al., 2018</xref>). LOH events occur due to chromosome nondisjunction leading to whole chromosome LOH or via recombination, in which only part of the chromosome undergoes LOH. Exposure to stress also selects for isolates that have acquired adaptive mutations and genome rearrangements. For example, aneuploidy is found in ~50% of isolates resistant to the most common antifungal drug, fluconazole (FLC). The most common and only recurrent aneuploidy in different strain backgrounds is the amplification of the left arm of chromosome 5 (Chr5L), often through acquisition of a novel isochromosome structure (denoted as i(5L)), comprised of two copies of Chr5L separated by the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Selmecki et al., 2008</xref>). Acquisition of i(5L) conferred FLC resistance via the amplification of two genes, <italic>ERG11</italic> and <italic>TAC1</italic>, encoding the drug target (Erg11) and a transcriptional activator of drug efflux pumps (Tac1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Selmecki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Selmecki et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the centromere of Chr5 contains a long inverted repeat sequence, and recombination between these repeats can form homozygous isochromosomes of both the left arm (i(5L)) and right arm of Chr5 (i(5R)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>). The role of long repeat sequences in the formation of other segmental aneuploidies and other genome rearrangements has not been comprehensively addressed.</p><p>We provide evidence that long repeat sequences are involved in the formation of all observed CNV breakpoints and chromosome inversions, and many LOH breakpoints, across 33 diverse clinical and experimentally evolved isolates. Our comprehensive analysis of long repeat sequences within the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome identified hundreds of sequences representing novel multicopy repeats, none of which include MRS, rDNA, sub-telomeric repeats, known repeat families (<italic>ALS</italic>, <italic>TLOs</italic>) or known repetitive elements (tRNAs, LTRs, retrotransposons). Long repeats that are associated with genome rearrangements (CNV, LOH, and inversions) have on average higher sequence identity than all long repeats combined. Additionally, long repeats that contain ORFs (including partial ORF sequences, single complete ORF sequences (paralogs), or multiple ORFs and intergenic sequences) are longer and associated with more genome rearrangements than long repeats that contain other genomic features (such as LTRs, retrotransposons, or tRNAs). Additionally, repeat copies involved in genome rearrangements can be located up to ~1.6 Mb apart on the same chromosome, suggesting a non-conventional, long-range mechanism for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and somatic genome diversification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An inverted repeat within <italic>CEN4</italic> is associated with the formation of a novel isochromosome</title><p>To identify the mechanisms by which <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates generate genome plasticity, we performed a comparative genomics analysis of 33 diverse clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This set of isolates included 11 that underwent controlled experimental evolution, where a known progenitor isolate was passaged in vitro or in vivo. Additionally, we performed comparative genomics on newly obtained clinical isolates, and clinical isolates whose genomes were published previously, including the reference isolate SC5314.</p><p>Given the significant impact of i(5L) on antifungal drug resistance, we focused first on the characterization of a novel segmental aneuploidy detected on Chr4 that arose during in vitro evolution in the presence of FLC. Initially, we passaged a FLC-sensitive clinical isolate P78042, which was trisomic for Chr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lockhart et al., 2002</xref>), in the presence of FLC (128 µg/ml) for 100 generations by serial dilution (see Materials and methods). One evolved isolate (AMS3743) was selected, based on increased fitness in FLC (see below), and the whole genome was sequenced.

Intra-chromosomal repeats are often generated in tandem by recombination between sister chromatids or replication slippage, and these repeats can move further away from each other by chromosomal rearrangement events (including chromosomal inversions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achaz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>).

Strikingly, spacer length ranged from 1 bp to 2,856,212 bp (median ~82.8 kb, excluding the complex tandem repeat genes, see Materials and methods), and was correlated with chromosome size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.066, p&lt;0.0001).

Most of the repeats associated with LOH breakpoints were intra-chromosomal (46/61), in all three orientations (inverted, mirrored, and tandem), and separated by a distance ranging from 903 bp to ~1.6 Mb (median ~35.3 kb). The vast majority of long-range homozygous regions contained only one LOH breakpoint and proceeded from the breakpoint to the proximal telomere, similar to previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Forche et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Selmecki et al., 2005</xref>).

Furthermore, a second copy of this same 8 bp sequence was found in an inverted orientation ~3.4 kb away in the adjacent ORF (<italic>orf19.5884</italic>). This long-range LOH event continued to the right telomere of Chr3. While LOH may have resulted from a repair template on the other homolog, an alternative model cannot be ruled out. We previously found that an LOH and CNV breakpoint that caused a segmental Chr5 truncation in the common laboratory strain BWP17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Selmecki et al., 2005</xref>) was initiated at a 9 bp sequence (CTAACTTCT) that is almost identical to the sequence found at this breakpoint (AACTTCTT).

SSA that occurs between tandem repeats leads to segmental deletion of the sequence located between the repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). SSA that occurs between inverted repeats can lead to the formation of complex, often unstable dicentric and ‘fold-back’ chromosomes which then enter the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle leading to further genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Croll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McClintock, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McClintock, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McClintock, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">VanHulle et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–7B</xref>). Evidence for dicentric chromosomes may exist in several isolates that acquired a segmental amplification of the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); however, we do not know from these data if the amplification is on the same molecule (generating a dicentric chromosome) or elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>The second HR mechanism we propose is break-induced replication (BIR) which is initiated by DSBs that have only one free end available for repair. During BIR, single-stranded DNA invades a homologous sequence followed by subsequent DNA synthesis which can copy long, chromosomal-sized DNA segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kramara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malkova and Ira, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>). If templating and synthesis occurs on a homologous chromosome, BIR can lead to long-range homozygosis of a chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Processes similar to BIR have been proposed for CNV generation in a diverse set of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). These predominantly micro-homology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) events use short regions of homology to repair DSBs in a Rad51-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>). One caveat is that the repeat sequences involved in generating genome rearrangements observed in this study are much longer than those involving MMBIR. While repair by BIR is rare in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> model systems, the selective benefit of the resulting genotypes generated by BIR could increase the apparent frequency with which these types of mutations are recovered in certain environments, for instance the acquisition of i(4R) in the presence of FLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> repeat copy length and spacer length</title><p>The repeat copy length associated with observed breakpoints in <italic>C. albicans</italic> are similar in copy length to transposable (Ty) elements in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (~6 kb) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) in the human genome (~6–7 kb), which are a major source of genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Higashimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Selmecki et al., 2015</xref>). Both Ty and LINE elements are high copy number repeats; LINE elements are present in thousands of copies in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rodić and Burns, 2013</xref>). However, beyond the similarity in copy length, we rarely found high copy number repeats, like lone LTRs or retrotransposons, associated with CNV and inversion breakpoints (5.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These breakpoints predominantly occurred at repeats containing ORFs that are often present in only two copies per genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). LOH breakpoints, on the other hand, were associated more often with LTRs (22.6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which may be a result of selection or may suggest a preference for a different repair mechanism when a DSB occurs near these loci.</p><p>The repeat copy length and spacer length associated with the observed breakpoints in <italic>C. albicans</italic> are much longer than typically observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Segmental amplification events in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are often mediated by short inverted repeat sequences, for example, 8 bp long and separated by 40 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Payen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sunshine et al., 2015</xref>). The presence of a short, inverted repeat sequence within a replication fork can stimulate ligation between the leading and lagging strands, which results in replication and formation of an extra-chromosomal circle. This extra-chromosomal amplification may continue to replicate independently if it contains an origin of replication (defined as origin-dependent inverted-repeat amplification [ODIRA]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Payen et al., 2014</xref>). It seems unlikely that such a mechanism operates at the long distances observed between repeat sequences in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However, it is possible that a different origin-dependent mechanism is mediating some of the rearrangements we observed (see centromere discussion below). A future challenge is to determine if/how this occurs.</p><p>The spacer length, especially between inverted repeats, has been a major focus of genome instability research. Identification and characterization of inverted repeats in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has primarily focused on those repeats that are separated by very short (~80 bp) spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Strawbridge et al., 2010</xref>). Inverted repeats that were engineered to have variable repeat spacer lengths identified a correlation between repeat and spacer length and DSB repair. Increasing repeat copy length (from 185 bp to ~1.5 kb) and/or decreasing repeat spacer length (from ~8.5 kb to 0 bp) increased the recombination rate between repeats by up to 17,000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lobachev et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, spacer length alone could affect the choice of DSB repair pathway; DSB repair via inter-molecular SSA predominantly occured with a spacer length of 1 kb, while intra-molecular SSA predominantly occured with spacer length of 12 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Astoundingly, the <italic>C. albicans</italic> CNV and inversion breakpoints are associated with much longer repeat spacer lengths than those described in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, ranging from ~3.1 kb to ~1.6 Mb (median ~30 kb) and ~3.1 kb to ~94.3 kb (median ~34.6 kb), respectively. Recombination between such long distances requires a naturally occurring, long-distance homology search. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>C. albicans</italic> may have a mechanism for long-distance resection, particular chromatin features, or a 3D-nuclear structure that facilitates recombination between inverted repeats separated by long distances.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inverted repeat sequences directly associated with the CENP-A-binding centromere core sequences facilitate isochromosome formation</title><p>Centromeres were common breakpoints for CNV, LOH and inversion. Twelve of the 33 isolates had breakpoint events that occurred within centromeres, including those described at <italic>CEN4</italic> and <italic>CEN5</italic>, as well as two additional centromeres that contained one copy of a long repeat sequence, <italic>CEN2</italic> and <italic>CEN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, <italic>C. albicans</italic> centromeres are the earliest firing centers of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, errors in DNA replication may be a common source of DSBs that are repaired via HR between long repeat sequences.</p><p>Repair of a DSB within or near a centromere-associated inverted repeat can result in isochromosome formation or centromere inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> centromeres that are flanked by long inverted repeat sequences (<italic>CEN4</italic> and <italic>CEN5</italic>) can form isochromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Selmecki et al., 2009</xref>). Exposure to the antifungal drug FLC selected for isochromosome formation at both <italic>CEN4</italic> and <italic>CEN5</italic>. If a DSB occurs near the inverted repeat sequence, DNA synthesis via BIR will copy the entire arm of the broken chromosome, resulting in the homozygous isochromosome structures that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Selmecki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Selmecki et al., 2009</xref>). Acquisition of either isochromosome i(4R) or i(5L) was both necessary and sufficient for increased fitness in the presence of FLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, there was no fitness cost associated with either isochromosome in the absence of FLC: i(4R) was stable for ~300 generations in 12/12 populations in the absence of FLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data are in contrast to other, often whole chromosome and multiple chromosome aneuploidies that cause significant fitness defects in the absence of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Torres et al., 2007</xref>), but support observations that aneuploidy in general has less of a fitness cost in diploid and polyploid fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Selmecki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, repair of a DSB within or near a centromere-associated inverted repeat can result in centromere inversion. Inversions are the result of intra-chromosomal non-allelic homologous recombination between inverted repeats flanking the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Here, we detected an inversion that occurred between inverted repeats flanking <italic>CEN4</italic>. The impact of these inversions on localization of the centromeric histone CENP-A, or of the recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52, which are thought to recruit CENP-A, are not known. Whether or not inversion of the centromere affects chromosome stability will be important to test in future experiments.</p><p>In this study, Illumina short-read datasets were used to identify genomic features that were driving structural and allelic variation across diverse <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates. The use of both new and previously published short-read datasets highlights the utility of this bioinformatic approach for the analysis of structural variants within this and other species. However, short-read data are unable to provide a key understanding of the molecules containing the long repeat sequences. For example, the definitive structure of chromosomal inversions, including the heterozygous <italic>CEN4</italic> sequence, is difficult to determine with short-read data. PCR enabled rapid validation of these inversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); however, it required knowledge of the repeat location and unique surrounding sequences. Future long-read sequencing is needed to address the definitive structure of existing DNA molecules and potential DNA intermediates involved in recombination and resolution of CNV, LOH, and inversions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Long repeats containing ORFs were significantly more common at breakpoints resulting in CNV, LOH and inversion than any other genomic feature</title><p>One hypothesis is that active transcription may promote DNA DSBs, due to the formation of R-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguilera and Gaillard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015</xref>). Additionally, increased transcription in certain environments may increase the probability of a DNA DSB that result in genome rearrangements, as was observed at the <italic>S. cerevisiae CUP1</italic> locus in high-copper environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fogel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomas and Rothstein, 1989</xref>). Several indirect results are consistent with this hypothesis in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. First, all ORFs within a long repeat that were associated with a breakpoint were indeed actively transcribed in the reference isolate SC5314 during growth in rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bruno et al., 2010</xref>). Second, some breakpoint ORFs have increased expression in the selective environment from which the isolate with the breakpoint was obtained. For example, two different in vivo isolates, one bloodstream clinical isolate and one murine OPC-evolved isolate, have the same breakpoint on Chr1 at the inverted repeat that includes <italic>HGT1</italic> and <italic>HGT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Both <italic>HGT1</italic> and <italic>HGT2</italic> are induced during OPC, biofilm production and adaptation to serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Horák, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pitarch et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, increased transcription of these repeat ORFs in vivo is a potential source of DNA damage that resulted in DSB repair.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, genome rearrangements resulting in segmental aneuploidies, sequence inversions, and LOH are associated with long repeat sequence breakpoints on every chromosome. These genome rearrangements can arise rapidly, both in vitro and in vivo, and can provide an adaptive phenotype such as improved growth in antifungal drugs. Importantly, long repeat sequences are hotspots for genome variation across diverse selective environments. Indeed, several repeats were involved in all three types of genome rearrangements in different isolates. These data support the idea that the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome is one of the most rapidly evolving genomes due to disruption of conserved syntenic sequence blocks via genome rearrangements between long repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, given the frequency of long repeat sequences in the human genome, studies of <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome rearrangements can contribute to understanding the mechanisms that facilitate CNV, LOH, and inversions associated with human disease and cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

To further refine CNV breakpoints, fastq files were aligned to the reference genome as above (Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing), read depth was calculated for every base pair in the nuclear genome using Samtools (samtools depth -aa) (v0.1.19), and normalized by read depth of the total nuclear genome using R (v3.5.2). The two consecutive 45.5 kb windows were further sub-divided into 5 kb windows. The average normalized read depth was determined for these 5 kb windows and a rolling mean of every two consecutive 5 kb windows was determined.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Anderson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We appreciate how your study details the role of repetitive sequences in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome on production of genetic variation, which is a significant step towards understanding how genetic variation is produced in the plastic <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome. More specifically, they show that changes in copy number and loss of heterozygosity associate with the repeats, which often exist as multi-copy sequences found at a range of distances across the genome. Repeats covering ORFs are enriched for LOH, CNV breakpoints, and inversions.</p><p>As you can see in the individual reviewer's reports (below), all reviewers agree that your study is solid and interesting. After discussing the reviews among the reviewers and editors, we suggest the following essential changes to the manuscript.</p><p>1) We think it is important to add a more detailed description (in the Materials and methods section) and critical discussion (in the Results or Discussion section) on how the repeats were mapped starting from short-read sequences.</p><p>2) We suggest more elaborate statistical testing and/or a clearer description of what exactly is tested, and how, to assess the significance of repeat enrichment.</p><p>While the other issues and suggestions raised by the individual reviewers were not deemed crucial, we suggest you still consider adapting the manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study investigates the occurrence and sequence context of structural variation in the <italic>Candida albicans</italic> genome. The authors find several instances of inversions, deletions, LOH and translocation events that are associated with repeat sequences spread across the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome, including centromeric and telomeric repeats, as well as repeats in ORFs. The breakpoints of these events were often at regions of higher and longer sequence identity.</p><p>Overall, this is a nice comprehensive study describing the importance of repeated sequences in genome plasticity.</p><p>My only concern is that the study does perhaps not offer much novel biological insight – repeats / regions with high sequence identity have already often been reported to form the breakpoints of structural variation in genomes. That said, the strength of this paper is that it gives a more comprehensive view on the phenomenon, which in itself has merit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Todd et al. details the role of repetitive sequences in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome on production of genetic variation, which is a significant step towards understanding how genetic variation is produced in the plastic <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome. More specifically, they show that changes in copy number and loss of heterozygosity associate with the repeats, which often exist as multi-copy sequences found at a range of distances across the genome. Repeats covering ORFs are enriched for LOH, CNV breakpoints, and inversions.</p><p>The inverted CEN4 breaks apart the CENP-A binding site. It would be interesting to know if CENP-A still binds the fragment of the binding region not disrupted during inversion in Chr4B and which homolog (A or B) built the i(4R) chromosome. This has implications in the potential for future recombination and accurate segregation of the i(4R), which, as the authors noted, is quite high compared to other trisomies. While it is stated in the Discussion that knowing this could be of interest in the future, it has implication on the current study.</p><p>A statistical test to show enrichment of CNBs within repeats would be helpful when introduced. While it is expected there to be enrichment, if repeat regions span a significant portion of the genome, 13 events may not be sufficient to see enrichment. A CNB between two repeats spaced by 70 kb is not particularly unexpected if when taking into consideration the distance between all repeats begins to approach the full genome size. What may help the reader see the association of the CNB better to the repeats themselves is to zoom in to ~nucleotide resolution and using a sliding window to show that the general copy number changes occur over the repeat as would be expected if they are involved in the recombination itself. Figure 3C does this well but Figure 3B does not. It is difficult to discern any of this from Figure 3—figure supplement 1. An amalgamated panel of all CNBs or LOH relative to their repeat may be best to summarize the findings concisely.</p><p>CNBs such as that displayed for AMS3053 on Chr3L that occur across long repeated sequenced with very high (99+%) identity would be hard to map by Illumina short-read sequencing. This is seen somewhat in the IGV snapshot where the repeat regions have an increase in read coverage compared to the internal unique sequence. It would worth including long-range sequencing (MinION or otherwise) for a few select events such as this to demonstrate that the proposed rearrangements are reflected in contiguous pieces of DNA that can span these repeats. Additionally, if these repeats contain genes and are 99+% identical, are the CDS within these regions similarly identical, indicating parologous gene duplications?</p><p>Segmental duplications including centromeres are unexpected as this may promote chromosome instability by including multiple kinetochore attachments on the same DNA molecule. Give that 2 strains contained these or their novelty; it would be worth testing if chromosome segregation is distorted in these strains as a result of centromere duplication. Alternatively, one may be activated, which could be tested by CENP-A ChIP-PCR. These events should be tied more closely to the SSA mechanism described in the Discussion.</p><p>A critical piece of information missing from the Materials and methods is how reads that could be mapped to multiple places were dealt with during alignment. As some repeats are 99+% identical, it would be hard to map those regions uniquely. The spike in heterozygosity at repeats could be due to random assignment of reads to one or the other repeat resulting in a het call at a homozygous position for each.</p><p>The selective pressures promoting retention of segmental deletions are interesting as these are often expected to have greater deleterious consequences than segmental amplifications. While not necessary, it would be helpful to know the fitness consequences of this deletion in the context of OPC in which AMS3420 or CEC2871 was obtained, a bloodstream model of infection, or a commensal colonization model. In short, why would loss of HGT1 and HGT2 benefit the cell during infection enough to be observed?</p><p>Breakpoints removed from <italic>ALS</italic> genes may be due less to poor mapping than rearrangements. How similar was the frequency of called breakpoints in comparable regions encoding tri- or di-nucleotide repeats as are found in the <italic>ALS</italic> sequences?</p><p>Are there features that distinguish between repeat-rich (Chr3R) and repeat-poor (Chr7L) chromosome arms? E.g., GC content, gene density, UTR length, etc., this will be begin to provide predictive correlates to repeats and recombination potential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this paper Todd et al. analyse of the role that multi-copy genes play in generating structural variation in the <italic>Candida albicans</italic>genome. Through a comprehensive annotation of the reference genome and an analysis of structural variation in &quot;evolved&quot; strains the authors convincingly show that various repetitive elements have created genomic variation, some of which are associated with adaptive traits.</p><p>Overall, the authors have used appropriate methods, drawn reasonable conclusions and produced a well-written manuscript. I think the results will be an important contribution to the study of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in particular and genome evolution in general. I do have a number of small issues that I think could improve the paper, which I detail below.</p><p>Much is made in both the Results and Discussion section about thelarge 'spacer distance' between intra-chromosomal repeats (e.g. subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, second paragraph). This is certainly an interesting result, and the raw data makes it clear this is a real phenomenon. However, I think the manuscript could do with some more clarity about:</p><p>a) Why this statistic is of interest;b) Precisely what hypothesis is being tested in this &quot;1-way ANOVA withposttest…&quot;</p><p>I suggest a sentence in the Results section describing the motivation forcalculating this distance. I am not sure what we are mean to glean from the factspacer-distance is not (significantly) correlated with chromosome size (given the small number of chromosomes). It would be good to make the biological motivation for this test explicit or reconsider the test. If the implication is that the repeat-copies are approximately uniformly distributed across chromosomes then a statistical test for this (rather than trend with chromosome size) may be a better test? Alternatively, it may be helpful to simply visualize the distribution of spacer-sizes in each chromosome via a histogram or 1-D kernel estimate).</p><p>I found myself being slightly tripped up by terminology re LTRs andretrotransposons. Presumably, the large number of repeats identified as &quot;LTRS&quot;</p><p>(e.g. subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, last paragraph) are long terminal repeats that lack ORFs (non-autonomous or &quot;lone&quot; LTRs) while the small number of retrotransposons will include complete LTR retrotransposons. Perhaps a statement or edit to the Results section making this clear will help readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45954.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you can see in the individual reviewer's reports (below), all reviewers agree that your study is solid and interesting.

Substantial details were added to the Materials and methods section (subsections “Identification of Aneuploidy and Copy Number Breakpoints”, “Identification of Long-Range Homozygosity Breakpoints”, “Identification of Inversion Breakpoints” and “Identification of Long Repeat Sequences”) regarding how we mapped the initial repeat positions from the reference genome assembly (Fasta file), and how we mapped all breakpoints (CNV, LOH, and inversions) using Illumina short-read sequence data. As we discuss below for reviewer 2, these breakpoints were defined within 2 kb of repeat sequences and were supported by unique, non-repeat sequences, since short-reads within the repeat sequences can map with high quality to multiple places in the genome. Analysis of short-read datasets (including previously published datasets) highlights the importance of this approach in identifying genomic features that are driving structural and allelic variation across <italic>C. albicans</italic> and future genome datasets. A critical discussion of short-read sequencing was added to the Discussion (subsection “Inverted repeat sequences directly associated with the CENP-A-binding centromere core sequences facilitate isochromosome formation”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We suggest more elaborate statistical testing and/or a clearer description of what exactly is tested, and how, to assess the significance of repeat enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-evaluated all of the statistical methods and added new statistical analyses of both existing data and newly generated figures. All raw data and statistical analyses were updated in the source data files (Figure 2—source data 1-4 and Figure 6—source data 1). We included the null hypothesis for all statistical tests within the source data files and provided a clearer description of each test within the main text. We included tests of distributions and post hoc analyses, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-E, Figure 6A and B, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B). For example, to visualize the distribution of spacer lengths between repeat matches on each chromosome we generated new Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and Figure 2—source data 2, and found there was a significant difference in the distribution of spacer lengths across all chromosomes (p &lt; 0.035, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison). Finally, we determined the fraction of the genome covered by long repeat sequences and assessed the significance of repeat enrichment using Bedtools (new Materials and methods subsection “Enrichment of CNV Breakpoints at Long Repeat Sequences”). There was significant enrichment for CNV breakpoints within long repeat sequences (p &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed Fishers Exact Test).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the other issues and suggestions raised by the individual reviewers were not deemed crucial, we suggest you still consider adapting the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Below we include a point-by-point response to the individual reviewer’s comments.

First, one point of clarification: there are 26 copy number variation breakpoints in 13 isolates. The fraction of the genome covered by long repeat sequences was 2.87% (409129 bp/14280189 bp), excluding the complex tandem repeat genes. This calculation was added to the Results (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, first paragraph) and Materials and methods sections (subsection “Identification of Long Repeat Sequences”, last paragraph). Again, all CNV breakpoints occurred within 2 kb of these long repeat sequences. Therefore, we performed a Fisher’s Exact Test to determine the probability that a breakpoint in the genome would overlap with a long repeat sequence (p &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s Exact Test). Given the small p-value, we can reject the null hypothesis that long repeat sequences and observed breakpoints are independent of one another. The manuscript has been updated as follows: “Strikingly, every CNV breakpoint occurred within 2 kb of a long repeat sequence, ranging from 248 bp to ~4.76 kb in length. Observed breakpoints had significantly more overlap with long repeat sequences than expected given the total genome coverage of long repeat sequences (p &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed Fishers Exact Test, See Materials and methods).” Additionally, a new Materials and methods subsection, “Enrichment of CNV Breakpoints at Long Repeat Sequences” was added for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What may help the reader see the association of the CNB better to the repeats themselves is to zoom in to ~nucleotide resolution and using a sliding window to show that the general copy number changes occur over the repeat as would be expected if they are involved in the recombination itself.

We intended Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to highlight the size and structure of diverse repeats found on each chromosome (1-R), highlighting repeat sequences that contain multiple ORFs and intergenic sequences. Nucleotide resolution is provided in Figure 3B and C and Figure 4B and C to support that all breakpoints are occurring within 2 kb of a repeat sequence. Additionally, we updated Figure 3B to better show copy number changes across this region. In doing so, the allele ratios are now less obvious, but the conclusion remains the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CNBs such as that displayed for AMS3053 on Chr3L that occur across long repeated sequenced with very high (99+%) identity would be hard to map by Illumina short-read sequencing.

A new paragraph was added to the Discussion section to address this point (subsection “Inverted repeat sequences directly associated with the CENP-A-binding centromere core sequences facilitate isochromosome formation”, last paragraph). However, we do not think that this is necessary to support the current findings – the observations and conclusions are supported by short read sequence data and the reference genome sequence. Indeed, part of the novelty of the current study is that these repeat sequences and breakpoints were identified using many published Illumina datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, if these repeats contain genes and are 99+% identical, are the CDS within these regions similarly identical, indicating parologous gene duplications?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, ORF CDSs contained within a long repeat sequence shared a similarly high sequence identity with the entire repeat (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, fifth paragraph). Pairwise sequence analyses (EMBOSS WATER) for repeats containing multiple ORFs and single complete ORFs supported that these CDSs are paralogs resulting from duplication events. For example, repeat family 124 (99.53% sequence identity), contains four ORFs and intergenic sequences. The paired ORF CDSs shared similarly high sequence identity (99.3%, 99.8%, 99.5%, 99.7%, respectively) supporting paralogous duplication of multiple contiguous ORFs. Repeats containing single complete ORFs also had similarly high sequence identity between the entire repeat and the CDS contained within the repeat. For example, repeat family 52 had a sequence identity of 99.57%, while the CDSs had sequence identity (99.8%) that was even higher than the entire repeat.</p><p>Additionally, we now clearly state that repeat sequences that contain single complete ORF sequences or multiple ORFs and intergenic sequences are paralogs resulting from duplication events. These statements have been added to the Introduction, Results and figure legends (Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, fourth paragraph and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Segmental duplications including centromeres are unexpected as this may promote chromosome instability by including multiple kinetochore attachments on the same DNA molecule. Give that 2 strains contained these or their novelty, it would be worth testing if chromosome segregation is distorted in these strains as a result of centromere duplication. Alternatively, one may be activated, which could be tested by CENP-A ChIP-PCR. These events should be tied more closely to the SSA mechanism described in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have tied these examples more clearly to the proposed SSA mechanisms described in the Discussion (subsection “DNA double-strand breaks are repaired using long repeat sequences found across the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, third paragraph). However, we think that a detailed characterization of centromere silencing and dynamics of chromosome stability in specific isolates is beyond the scope of this current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A critical piece of information missing from the Materials and methods is how reads that could be mapped to multiple places were dealt with during alignment. As some repeats are 99+% identical, it would be hard to map those regions uniquely. The spike in heterozygosity at repeats could be due to random assignment of reads to one or the other repeat resulting in a het call at a homozygous position for each.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting clarification of these details. All reads were mapped to the reference genome with the same parameters (Materials and methods subsection “Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing”). We agree that because Illumina short-reads within the repeat sequence can map, with high quality, to multiple positions in the genome, they cannot be used for allele ratio analyses. For this reason, unique, non-repeat sequences were used to determine breakpoint positions and all breakpoints were thus defined as occurring within 2 kb of a long repeat sequence. We have updated the Materials and methods section with a more detailed explanation of all breakpoint analyses (subsections “Identification of Aneuploidy and Copy Number Breakpoints”, “Identification of Long-Range Homozygosity Breakpoints” and “Identification of Inversion Breakpoints”). Additionally, we revised the Results section on heterozygosity islands caused by repeat sequences to better highlight our findings. This section now includes: “As expected, levels of heterozygosity were high within long repeat sequences due to the ability of short-read (Illumina) sequences to map to multiple positions in the genome (e.g. the heterozygous bases within repeat sequences in Figure 4B and C)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The selective pressures promoting retention of segmental deletions are interesting as these are often expected to have greater deleterious consequences than segmental amplifications. While not necessary, it would be helpful to know the fitness consequences of this deletion in the context of OPC in which AMS3420 or CEC2871 was obtained, a bloodstream model of infection, or a commensal colonization model. In short, why would loss of HGT1 and HGT2 benefit the cell during infection enough to be observed?</p></disp-quote><p>First, a point of clarification: the fitness effect of these large CNVs is a combination of the copy number of many genes within the segmental aneuploidy that are either amplified or deleted (e.g. AMS3420 has a whole Chr1 amplification with a 400 kb truncation), and not only a consequence of the ORFs within the repeat sequence. In the Discussion (subsection “Long repeats containing ORFs were significantly more common at breakpoints resulting in CNV, LOH and inversion than any other genomic feature”), we highlight how increased transcription of the HGTs in vivo may cause a DNA DSB that is repaired via HR. The viable outcomes of this recombination event (involving many genes) are what are then selected in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Breakpoints removed from ALS genes may be due less to poor mapping than rearrangements. How similar was the frequency of called breakpoints in comparable regions encoding tri- or di-nucleotide repeats as are found in the ALS sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, breakpoints that occurred within the <italic>ALS</italic> gene families were included in Supplementary files 2, 3, and 4 (previously Tables 2, 3, and 4) and comprise one CNV and one LOH breakpoint. For the analysis of inversion breakpoints, the positions that occurred within the <italic>ALS</italic> gene family were removed because the BreakDancer and NUCmer coordinates obtained from Hirakawa et al., 2015 did not support a consistent length of sequence inversion. In these examples, there is likely a structural rearrangement, but high confidence breakpoint positions could not be mapped from these data and were excluded from the final list. The Materials and methods section was modified (subsection “Identification of Inversion Breakpoints”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there features that distinguish between repeat-rich (Chr3R) and repeat-poor (Chr7L) chromosome arms? E.g., GC content, gene density, UTR length, etc., This will be begin to provide predictive correlates to repeats and recombination potential.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. First, as shown in Figure 2B, the frequency of all long repeat sequences (intra- and inter-chromosomal repeats) correlated with whole chromosome size (excluding the tandem repeat genes, for which we could not accurately determine copy number). The graphical representation of only intra-chromosomal repeat matches (Figure 2A) identified chromosome arms that were repeat-rich or -poor. Therefore, to address this question, we analyzed the repeat density of all repeat matches (intra- and inter-chromosomal) as a function of GC content, ORF density, and chromosome arm size (new Figure 2—source Data 1). No correlation was observed between the number of repeats on a chromosome arm and GC content (linear regression, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.063, p &gt; 0.32). Similarly, no correlation was observed between the number of repeats on a chromosome arm and the normalized ORF density (ORFs per Mb) (linear regression, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, p &gt; 0.59). A correlation remained between the number of all long repeat sequences and chromosome arm size (linear regression, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58, p &lt; 0.0007). In the text we now highlight ChrRR and Chr7L as two examples that deviate most from the linear model (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Much is made in both the Results and Discussion section about thelarge 'spacer distance' between intra-chromosomal repeats (e.g. subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the C. albicans genome”, second paragraph). This is certainly an interesting result, and the raw data makes it clear this is a real phenomenon. However, I think the manuscript could do with somemore clarity about:</p><p>a) Why this statistic is of interest;b) Precisely what hypothesis is being tested in this &quot;1-way ANOVA withposttest…&quot;</p><p>I suggest a sentence in the Results section describing the motivation forcalculating this distance. I am not sure what we are mean to glean from the factspacer-distance is not (significantly) correlated with chromosome size (given the small number of chromosomes). It would be good to make the biological motivation for this test explicit or reconsider the test. If the implication is that the repeat-copies are approximately uniformly distributed across chromosomes then a statistical test for this (rather than trend with chromosome size) may be a better test? Alternatively, it may be helpful to simply visualize the distribution of spacer-sizes in each chromosome via a histogram or 1-D kernel estimate).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these very helpful suggestions.</p><p>The motivation for characterizing the repeat spacer length was added to the Results and Discussion (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, third paragraph and subsection “<italic>C. albicans</italic> repeat copy length and spacer length”, last two paragraphs). Briefly, the spacer length is important for understanding the origin and evolution of these duplication events in a yeast species that did not undergo an ancient whole genome duplication event. Intra-chromosomal repeats are often generated in tandem by recombination between sister chromatids or replication slippage, and these repeats can move further away from each other by chromosomal rearrangement events (including chromosomal inversions) (Achaz et al., 2000; Reams and Roth, 2015). Therefore, we hypothesized that the repeats would be predominantly tandem, comprised of shorter spacer lengths, and that the distribution of spacer lengths would be the same on each chromosome. The test of these hypotheses found that the median spacer length was very large (~82.8 kb) and that distribution of spacer lengths was significantly different between chromosomes (p &lt; 0.035, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison).</p><p>Previously, the ANOVA with posttest for linearity was used to analyze spacer lengths, normalized for chromosome size, to determine if there was a significant ordered trend (longest chromosome to shortest chromosome) between the spacer lengths located on each chromosome. As the reviewer suggested, when repeat spacer length is plotted according to true chromosome size the two are correlated (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.06, p &lt; 0.0001, Figure 2-source data 2). This indicated that repeat spacer length is only limited by chromosome size, however as suggested by the reviewer, this analysis did not provide information about the underlying distribution of spacer length.</p><p>To visualize the distribution of spacer lengths on each chromosome we generated new Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and new Figure 2—source data 2. There was a significant difference in the distribution of spacer lengths across all chromosomes (p &lt; 0.035, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison).</p><p>The text has been updated to reflect these new analyses (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found myself being slightly tripped up by terminology re LTRs andretrotransposons. Presumably, the large number of repeats identified as &quot;LTRS&quot;</p><p>(e.g. subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the C. albicans genome”, last paragraph) are long terminal repeats that lack ORFs (non-autonomous or &quot;lone&quot; LTRs) while the small number of retrotransposons will include complete LTR retrotransposons. Perhaps a statement or edit to the Results section making this clear will help readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We clarified the nomenclature for LTRs and retrotransposons. The two category names were derived directly from the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome feature file (.gff). Nonetheless, we agreed that additional clarity was needed. We now include “lone” when we introduce LTRs in the Introduction (fourth paragraph), Results (subsection “Identification of long repeat sequences throughout the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome”, fourth paragraph), and Materials and methods (subsection “Annotation of Repeat Sequences”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
