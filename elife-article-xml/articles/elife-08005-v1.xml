We propose a new concept by which tumor progression can be suppressed by manipulating tumor cell identity. In this study, we examined the effect of ER stress on apoptosis resistant tumorous cells in a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline tumor model. We discovered that ER stress suppressed the progression of the lethal germline tumor by activating the ER stress sensor IRE-1. This suppression was associated with the induction of germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells. Strikingly, transdifferentiation of the tumorous germ cells restored their ability to execute apoptosis and enabled their subsequent removal from the gonad. Our results indicate that tumor cell transdifferentiation has the potential to combat cancer and overcome the escape of tumor cells from the cell death machinery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08005.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08005.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08005.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If a cell in the body becomes damaged or stops working properly, it can trigger its own destruction. This helps to prevent the accumulation of damaged cells. However, cancer cells can often tolerate much greater damage than normal cells. Toxic chemotherapies, which are often used to treat cancer, work by severely damaging the cells to help trigger their self-destruction. Unfortunately, chemotherapy does not work on all cancer cells, and the remaining treatment-resistant cells may continue to grow and spread in more aggressive ways.</p><p>Now, Levi-Ferber et al. have found a way to change the identity of cancer cells, which makes them more likely to self-destruct. The experiments used roundworms called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that had a genetic mutation that causes them to develop tumors in their reproductive organs. Normally, the cells in these tumors do not self-destruct. Levi-Ferber et al. exposed tumor cells from the worms to chemicals or to genetic modifications that cause unfolded proteins to accumulate inside the cell. This build-up of proteins stresses a structure in the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Normally, if endoplasmic reticulum stress gets too high, the cell activates various pathways to relieve the stress, and if these fail, the cell self-destructs.</p><p>Levi-Ferber et al. showed that a protein called IRE-1, which senses endoplasmic reticulum stress, caused the tumor cells to change into a type of non-cancerous cell. After the change, the cells were also more sensitive to self-destruction. This meant that tumors grew more slowly and ended up smaller, allowing the animals to survive longer.</p><p>Together, the experiments suggest that treatments that force cancer cells to become a different cell type might be one way to prevent the emergence of treatment-resistant tumor cells. Future research will be needed to investigate exactly how IRE-1 causes the identity of the cell to change, and to see if this process could treat other kinds of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08005.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08005.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>tumor suppression</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>IRE-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Israel Science Foundation 1749/11 to SHK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henis-Korenblit</surname><given-names>Sivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IRE-1 manipulates tumor cell identity to restore apoptosis sensitivity and suppress an aggressive germline tumor in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major challenge in the tumor therapy field is the development of new strategies to eliminate tumors and cancer cells. Whereas most of the current therapeutic strategies are based on apoptosis induction in the tumor cells, the effectiveness of these approaches is limited due to acquired apoptosis resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>). Thus, deciphering ways to restore apoptosis sensitivity to tumorous cells that acquired apoptosis resistance may revive ‘old’ tools with therapeutic potential to eliminate tumor cells.</p><p>The <italic>gld-1</italic> (GermLine Development defective) gene encodes a germline-specific QUAKING-like RNA binding protein, which represses the translation of a variety of germline transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jungkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, GLD-1 regulates many aspects of germ cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Francis et al., 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>). One of the striking consequence of a deficiency in <italic>gld-1</italic> is the formation of a proximal germline tumor that fills the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Francis et al., 1995a</xref>). This germline tumor is the result of re-entry of meiotic germ cells into the mitotic cell cycle instead of maturing into oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Francis et al., 1995a</xref>). Importantly, some aspects of tumorigenesis are exhibited in the <italic>gld-1</italic> germline tumor model. These include the ability of the tumorous germ cells to proliferate in a growth factor–independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Francis et al., 1995a</xref>) and their regulation by genes homologous to known human oncogenes or human tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pinkston-Gosse and Kenyon, 2007</xref>). Notably, these tumorous germ cells acquired resistance to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gumienny et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, some precocious germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells has been reported to occur at a low frequency in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>). This transdifferentiation of the germ cells can be further enhanced by manipulation of RNA binding proteins, P granule components, transcription factors and histone modifiers; all of which regulate gene expression within the transdifferentiating germ cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Updike et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether cellular and organismal stress can affect germ cell fate and tumorigenicity in the <italic>gld-1</italic> tumor model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ER stress induces apoptosis in the gonads of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals</title><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, chemically or genetically-induced ER stress promote germ cell apoptosis in normal (i.e., non-tumorous) germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the germ cells in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals were reported to be resistant to physiological and DNA damage-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gumienny et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that they may have acquired global resistance to apoptosis promoting signals, a common phenomenon of transformed cells. To directly test whether ER stress succeeds or fails to induce apoptosis in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals, we exposed the animals to ER stress, and assessed the presence of apoptotic corpses within the gonad using the SYTO12 apoptotic dye. ER stress was induced either by treating the animals with tunicamycin (a specific inhibitor of N-glycosylation) or by treating the animals with <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi (<italic>tfg-1</italic> encodes a component of COPII-coated vesicles required for the export of cargo from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Witte et al., 2011</xref>]). Both treatments specifically induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gumienny et al., 1999</xref>), no apoptotic corpses representing physiological germ cell apoptosis were detected in the tumorous gonads in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

First, in terms of location within the gonad—whereas in non-tumorous gonads apoptotic germ cell corpses were usually detected at the turn of the gonad, where oogenesis occurs, those detected in ER-stressed tumorous gonads were located in the proximal region of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). In addition, in terms of size, both the SYTO12-labeled nuclei and the CED-1::GFP-engulfed cells in the tumorous gonads exposed to ER stress were significantly larger than those detected in non-tumorous animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C,D,E</xref>). Furthermore, unlike engulfed germ cell corpses that are typically round, the CED-1::GFP engulfed cells in the ER-stressed tumorous gonads displayed a variety of shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To this end, <italic>ced-3</italic> expression was inactivated to prevent apoptosis and the pattern of the nuclei in the gonad was assessed by DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole‎) staining. Strikingly, blocking apoptosis resulted in the accumulation of cells with large and misshaped nuclei occupying nearly 40% of the stressed gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Even without exposing the animals to ER stress, blocking apoptosis resulted in the accumulation of ectopic cells with large and misshaped nuclei in the gonads of the <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals. However, in the absence of ER stress, the abnormally large nuclei occupied only 10% of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), indicating that ER stress promotes their induction. Interestingly, blocking apoptosis enabled the detection of ectopic cells within the gonads of nearly 90% of the <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals examined, both under normal growth conditions as well as under ER stress, albeit to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The enhanced accumulation of ectopic cells in the ER stressed gonads was not due to altered efficiency of the <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi as the GLD-1 protein levels were similarly reduced upon <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi treatment in combination with control/<italic>tfg-1</italic> and <italic>ced-3</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Analysis of the fluorescence pattern of a <italic>Pelt-2::NLS::gfp</italic> intestinal somatic marker, which by virtue of its NLS signal specifically labeled the nuclei of the corresponding somatic cells, revealed that these nuclei were larger than those of typical germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, Hoechst-nuclei staining of a strain expressing the neuronal <italic>Punc-119::gfp</italic> somatic marker was used to assess whether the pattern of the ectopic somatic cells in the gonad overlapped with the cells harboring small germline-like nuclei or whether it overlapped with the ectopically large nuclei. We found that under ER stress conditions, the cells that expressed the neuronal marker co-localized with the cells in the gonad that had atypically large nuclei. No expression of the <italic>Punc-119::gfp</italic> somatic marker was detected in regions of the gonad devoid of large-nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we examined whether the cells that undergo apoptosis in the stressed tumorous gonad are the ones that express the somatic markers.

Indeed, some of the engulfed cells also expressed the somatic marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Likewise, why weren't all the large-nucleated cells co-localized with the cells in the gonad that expressed the neuronal marker? These phenomena are likely the consequence of the fact that the teratoma contains somatic cells of the different germ-layers, implying that only a fraction of the teratoma cells can be detected using somatic markers of specific tissues or germ layers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The ectopic cells in the gonad of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals are germ cell-derived somatic cells</title><p>The somatic cells in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals arise by precocious differentiation and loss of pluripotency of the germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>).

To this end, we treated animals with a normal germline or <italic>glp-1(lof)</italic> mutants, whose primary germ cells do not proliferate at non permissive temperatures, with a mixture of <italic>gld-1, tfg-1</italic> and <italic>ced-3</italic> RNAi, in order to generate optimal conditions for the detection of ectopic somatic cells in the gonad (RNAi efficacy was confirmed as described in ‘Materials and methods’).

These findings are consistent with the possibility that the ectopic somatic cells induced by ER stress in the tumorous gonad are derived from the germ cells themselves, uncovering ER stress as a potent regulator of germ cell pluripotency. Importantly, unlike previously identified regulators of germ cell pluripotency, all of which act at the final steps of the transdifferentiation process by directly regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Updike et al., 2014</xref>); ER stress and ER homeostasis likely act further upstream, linking between cellular and organismal physiology and germ cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>ire-1</italic> promotes ER stress-induced germ cell transdifferentiation in the gonad of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals independently of <italic>xbp-1</italic></title><p>After establishing that ER stress promotes germ cell transdifferentiation in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals we examined whether this induction is mediated by one of the ER stress sensor proteins.

We hypothesized that if <italic>ire-1</italic> promotes germ cell transdifferentiation by activating the transcription factor <italic>xbp-1</italic>, then ER stress would fail to induce germ cell transdifferentiation in <italic>xbp-1</italic>-deficient animals. Initially, we used DAPI staining to assess the levels of germ cell transdifferentiation in two strains deficient in <italic>xbp-1- xbp-1(zc12) and xbp-1(tm2457)</italic>.

Previous studies in mice and in <italic>C. elegans xbp-1(zc12)</italic> mutants have demonstrated that the mere deficiency in XBP1 leads to activation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Safra et al., 2013</xref>) Thus, we hypothesized that this high basal level of germ cell transdifferentiation in <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutants may be due to the increased activity of IRE-1 in these mutants. Consistent with this interpretation, the high level of germ cell transdifferentiation in <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutants was completely dependent on <italic>ire-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To this end, we analyzed the progression of the germline tumor in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals in the presence or absence of ER stress. We found that <italic>xbp-1</italic> inactivation, not only induced germ cell transdifferentiation but also suppressed the germline tumor; demonstrating that the two phenomena are tightly correlated. The physiological improvement was manifested in several ways: (a) the density of the germ cells in the germline tumor was reduced in the tumorous animals exposed to ER stress such that the germline tumor that occupied the proximal gonad did not fill the entire gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). (b) as the germline tumor progresses, the gonad becomes over-packed with proliferating germ cells, resulting in increased rigidity of the gonad. Consequently, the motion of animals with a packed gonad germline tumor is limited resulting in paralyzed animals that can move their heads but cannot move their body. We find that ER stress significantly delayed the paralysis of the tumorous animals and allowed the animals to move freely at time-points where most of the non-stressed tumorous animals were paralyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1, 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—Figure supplement 1A</xref>). This implies that the gonad of the animals subjected to ER stress were not as packed with germ cells as the non-stressed animals. (c) as the germline tumor progresses it ultimately kills the animal. We found that in wild-type animals, treatment with <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi shortened the lifespan by more than 30%, whereas it shortened the lifespan of ER stressed-<italic>xbp-1</italic> mutants by only 13% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We wondered whether such stresses that induce germ cell apoptosis in non-tumorous gonads would induce germ cell transdifferentiation in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals, similarly to ER stress. To address this, wild-type or <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals were exposed to ER stress, genotoxic stress, mitochondrial stress or osmotic stress. These stresses were induced by manipulating genes whose inactivation is known to induce only one specific stress response, without globally stressing the animals. <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi was used to activate the ER stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>rad-51</italic> RNAi, which targets a DNA recombinase required for the repair of dsDNA breaks was used for the induction of genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gartner et al., 2000</xref>). Mitochondrial stress was induced by RNAi targeting <italic>ddl-3</italic>, which encodes a kinesin light chain whose inactivation specifically activates the mitochondrial stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shore et al., 2012</xref>). Osmotic stress was induced by inactivation of a negative regulator of the osmotic stress response, <italic>osm-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rohlfing et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed that all of these treatments significantly increased the amount of apoptotic corpses in the gonads of animals with a non-tumorous germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and white bar graph). We found that although some treatments induced more germ cell apoptosis than <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi, only treatment with <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi led to the detection of cells with large nuclei in the gonads of <italic>gld-1; ced-3</italic>-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and black bar graphs). Thus, although ER stress induces germ cell apoptosis in normal gonads and hinders germ cell pluripotency in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals, the latter does not occur upon exposure to other severe cellular stresses, including genotoxic stress. This indicates that the transdifferentiation of the germ cells is not simply a side-effect or a default fate of apoptosis-resistant tumorous cells under proapoptotic stress which they fail to execute. Moreover, since only treatment with <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi suppressed the progression of the germline tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), this lends further support to the notion that induction of germ cell transdifferentiation is a prerequisite for the suppression of the germline tumor.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08005.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Loss of germ cell pluripotency in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals does not occur in response to all stresses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative micrographs (x400) of gonads of <italic>ced-3(+)</italic> day 2 animals which were stained with SYTO12 to detect apoptotic cell corpses.

In this study, we gained new and fascinating insights into the complex coupling between ER stress and germ cell fate in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline tumor model. We find that while severe stress limits organismal survival and well-being under most circumstances, ER stress is beneficial for the animals' healthspan in <italic>gld-1-</italic>deficient animals, as it suppresses their lethal germline tumors. This is in accordance with previous findings that a stress-inducing interference such as knockout of hsf1 in mice, which has deleterious impact on organismal survival under normal growth conditions as well as under stress, actually benefits the same organism in the case of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>How does ER stress suppress the tumor in the <italic>gld-1</italic>-germline tumor model? Our findings indicate that the suppression of the germline tumor is the combined effect of germ cell transdifferentiation coupled with a limited half-life of the transdifferentiated germ cells (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The latter is achieved by restoring the responsiveness of the tumorous cells to apoptosis once they transdifferentiate into ectopic somatic cells and the subsequent removal of their ectopic somatic corpses from the gonad.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08005.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model—tumor progression and germline fate in ER stressed tumorous gonads.</title><p>In animals with a normal germline, ER stress induces germ cell apoptosis. Inactivation of the <italic>gld-1</italic> genes alters many aspects of germ cell fate: differentiation of germ cells into oocytes is abrogated, germ cell proliferation is enhanced, a germline tumor is formed and the germ cells lose their responsiveness to execute physiological and stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient animals the germ cells are prone to generate teratoma as they become sensitized to precociously transdifferentiate into somatic cells. Under these conditions ER stress can suppress and limit the germline tumor. This suppression is achieved by enhancing germline transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells. Soon after the transdifferentiation, these ectopic cells undergo apoptosis, and are removed from the gonad, suppressing the germline tumor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08005.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08005.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08005-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Importantly, although germ cell transdifferentiation normally occurs in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>), its extent is not sufficient to effectively suppress the tumor by itself. Effective suppression is only achieved under conditions that further enhance germ cell transdifferentiation beyond its basal level, as in the case of ER stress. All in all, our results indicate that tumor cell transdifferentiation may serve as a protective anti-tumor mechanism. This implies that transdifferentiation-promoting genes may effectively suppress tumors.</p><p>Many cellular stresses that induce germ cell apoptosis in normal gonads failed to affect germ cell pluripotency and tumor progression in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals. This suggests that the regulation of these processes in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals is specifically associated with ER stress, and is not simply a side-effect of apoptosis-resistant cells under stress. How might ER stress promote germ cell transdifferentiation? A major consequence of ER stress is interference with ER functions, which may directly impinge upon the production of a variety of signaling molecules such as secreted peptides, hormones, cholesterol and lipids which are metabolized in the ER. However, it is unlikely that this directly accounts for ER stress-induced germline transdifferentiation and apoptosis of the germ cells as these do not occur in animals under severe ER stress in the absence of <italic>ire-1</italic>. This suggests that it is the activation of the ER stress sensor IRE-1, rather than a non-specific consequence of ER stress per se, that regulate germ cell pro-differentiation and tumor progression in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals. Furthermore, since germ-cell transdifferentiation is promoted in animal deficient in <italic>xbp-1</italic>, this indicates that it is mediated by an <italic>ire-1-</italic>dependent <italic>xbp-1</italic> independent signal. What are the signaling molecules produced? Is it a single molecule or an arsenal of signaling molecules that regulate germ cell fate? These are all open questions to be addressed in future studies. Interestingly, in humans, mutations that compromise the activity or the expression of RNase L, an IRE1-related endoribonuclease, have been implicated with increased susceptibility to prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carpten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casey et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike IRE1, RNase L has lost specificity to <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA. Nevertheless, it shares with IRE-1 its promiscuous RNase activity. This similarity may be sufficient as the tumor-suppressive properties of <italic>ire-1</italic> described herein are independent of <italic>xbp-1</italic>. This implies that tumor-suppressive properties of IRE-1-related endoribonucleases may be evolutionarily conserved, and may not be specifically associated with one specific type of prostate cancer.</p><p>One hallmark of aggressive tumors is their adaptation to their natural primary niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>). Thus, transformation into an ectopic kind of cell, rather than differentiation into a type of cell which can normally be found in the same primary niche, may have an added value in suppressing aggressive tumors. Strikingly, in 95% of human ovarian germline tumors, the totipotent germ cells precociously differentiate into a variety of ectopic somatic cells generating teratoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koonings et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ulbright, 2005</xref>). These naturally occurring teratoma are usually benign whereas the remaining 5% are usually malignant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ulbright, 2005</xref>). This suggests that teratoma may be a preferential germline tumor in terms of survival and fitness of the organism. As in other tumor-suppressive mechanisms, cancer cells may evolve to bypass this line of defense. Accordingly, some of the ovarian teratoma undergo a malignant transformation which occurs after the development of the teratoma. Nevertheless, this occurs only in 1.5% of teratoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Comerci et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayhan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ulbright, 2005</xref>). This suggests that the conclusions derived from our studies in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tumor model system are already naturally applied for human germline tumor biology, as if they were selected to do so by evolution.</p><p>The potential to suppress tumors by forcing their transdifferentiation requires the tumor cells to have differentiation potential. This raises the question whether transdifferentiation-mediated tumor suppression is relevant only for germline tumors, or is it relevant to a wider range of cell types? In mammals, in addition to the totipotent germ cells, subpopulations of stem cells, which maintain differentiation potential (i.e., pluri or multi-potent) exist in many organs and tissues, albeit at low numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reya et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, within tumors and hematological cancers, one can find a subpopulation of cancer stem cells that possess stem cells characteristics, including the ability to give rise to a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reya et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, differentiation therapy has been used in the clinic and is proven to be effective in limiting some kinds of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sell, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, whereas these treatments induce differentiation of cells within the same lineage, induction of transdifferentiation into a completely different cellular lineage may be even more effective by creating a discrepancy and maladaptiveness between the tumorous cells and their surrounding niche. Thus, induction of tumor cell transdifferentiation has the potential to be applied as a novel approach to combat cancer and overcome the escape of tumor cells from the cell death machinery in a wide variety of tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell corpse assays</title><p>The number of apoptotic cells in the gonads of day-2 or day-3 animals was assessed by scoring the number of SYTO12/CED-1::GFP labeled cells in the gonad.

The review process was followed by consultations between these three that led to consensus presented below.</p><p>The importance of your paper's subject matter and the significance of your discovery that manipulating ER stress and the response to it affects differentiation and tumor formation in the <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient <italic>C. elegans</italic> model were recognized by all three reviewers. However, the review process unearthed certain limitations pertaining to the strength of your conclusions that need to be addressed prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The Abstract and Title claims that ER stress suppresses tumor formation, however the experiments displayed merely show that elimination of <italic>xbp-1</italic> suppresses tumor formation in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient worms. To support the claim made in the Abstract, it would be important to present evidence that manipulations that lead to ER stress indeed suppress tumor formation (and not merely lead to trans differentiation, as is presently shown). The interest of the observations would not be diminished were it to turn out that elimination of <italic>xbp-1</italic> is a pre-requisite to tumor suppression; for example if compromising <italic>tfg-1</italic> by RNAi further suppresses tumors of <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient worms in an <italic>ire-1</italic> dependent manner only when <italic>xbp-1</italic> is also missing, but the Title, Abstract and Discussion would need to accommodate such a finding.</p><p>The Ploegh and Glimcher labs have shown that elimination of XBP1 in mouse leads to higher levels of IRE-1 protein and enhanced phosphorylation of this UPR effector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in PMID 19407814 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> in PMID: 22291093). Your case for an <italic>ire-1</italic> mediated tumor suppression mechanism in worms would be strengthened by evidence that something similar is going on in the <italic>xbp-1</italic> deficient worms; if this is experimentally unfeasible it remains an important discussion point. RNaseL, an IRE-1 descendent (evolutionarily-speaking), which has retained its promiscuous RNase activity but has lost specificity to XBP1, has been implicated in tumor suppression in mammals (PMID: 11799394 and 12415269). These facts stand to inform the discussion of your findings. More broadly, the three reviewers of your paper feel that it might be improved if its thrust were to be shifted from the role of ER unfolded protein stress in trans differentiation and tumor suppression to a role for <italic>ire-1</italic> (hyper) activity in these processes.</p><p>The emergence of cells with large nuclei and the acquisition of differentiation markers in stressed/<italic>xbp-1</italic> deficient worms are correlated phenomena. An attempt should be made to establish if these processes affect the same cells (do the cells expressing the differentiation markers have larger nuclei?) and the outcome of this attempt presented and discussed.</p><p>In this vein, <italic>ire-1</italic> dependent trans differentiation and tumor suppression are correlated phenomena but a causal link between them has not been established in your study. This point should be emphasized for reader edification.</p><p>The above consensus statement should serve as the basis for revision of your paper. However in the interest of complete transparency, in this case the unedited original reviews are provided below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The key observation made here as non-trivial: The authors claim to have discovered that pharmacological (tunicamycin) and genetic (<italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi) manipulations that impede protein folding homeostasis in the ER lead to trans-differentiation of “tumorous” germ cells in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient worms. Left there, this would subject to many different interpretations. But what makes their findings potentially interesting is the observation that such stress-induced trans-differentiation is dependent on IRE-1 signaling but is independent of IRE-1's main known effector XBP1. In fact, inactivation of XBP1 on its own promotes such salutary trans-differentiation of the “tumorous” germ cells in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient worms. These observations argue against trans-differentiation reflecting a non-specific feature of mounting levels of ER stress and rather suggest that some aspect of IRE-1 signaling that is independent of XBP1 sets up this anti-tumour defense mechanism. The echoes to RNaseL, which is a derivative of IRE-1 with tumour suppressive properties, are interesting.</p><p>The story more or less ends there, but this may be enough of a new insight into oncogenesis to merit consideration as brief report.</p><p>There are obstacles to this path: The authors feel they have made not one but three important discoveries (as per the cover letter) and they are apparently not aware of the RNaseL cancer connection, which adds important context to what is essentially a one-finding paper.</p><p>Thus the question before the three reviewers is whether this is a sufficient advance and if it can be packaged succinctly to deliver a story worthy of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Tumor cells have acquired resistance to apoptosis that limits the effectiveness of many therapeutic strategies. In this original study, the authors demonstrate in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model how tumor growth can be suppressed by changing tumor cell identity. Prior studies of others showed that deficiency in <italic>gld-1</italic>, encoding a translational suppressor, results in proximal germline tumors in the gonad, and that some of the tumorous germ cells undergo trans-differentiation into ectopic somatic cells. The authors show that activation of IRE-1 by ER stress inhibited progression of a lethal <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient germline tumor through trans-differentiation. Restoration of the ability to induce apoptosis accompanied the cell transition. It is suggested that tumor cell trans-differentiation will counteract the escape of tumor cells from apoptotic cell death with possible therapeutic benefits.</p><p>Results show:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 1-2</xref>. ER stress induced in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient animals by either treatment with tunicamycin or down-regulating <italic>tfg-1</italic> resulted in apoptotic cell corpses in the tumorous gonads. Results were confirmed with CED-1:GFP expression in animals stressed with <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi. The apoptotic cell corpses differed in size, shape and location in tumorous as compared with non-tumorous gonads.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Blocking apoptosis by depleting or preventing <italic>ced-3</italic> expression caused ectopic cells with large nuclei to accumulate in <italic>gld-1</italic> depleted ER stressed animals.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The cells with large nuclei in the <italic>gld-1</italic>-depleted apoptosis-defective animals are germ cell-derived somatic cells as determined with differentiation markers.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Interestingly, trans-differentiation in response to <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi was blocked in <italic>ire-1</italic> deficient animals. The conclusion is that trans-differentiation in response to ER stress requires IRE-1. But furthermore, the ER-stress induced trans-differentiation was independent of its splicing target mRNA for the transcription factor, <italic>xbp-1</italic>. The implications are that the IRE-1 mechanism involves other signaling events (besides <italic>xbp-1</italic> splicing) and/or the RIDD pathway involving mRNA decay. [It might be worth mentioning that in humans the IRE-1-related endoribonuclease, RNase L, has been suggested in several studies to have tumor suppressing activities (e.g. PMID: 11799394 and 12415269)].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. ER stress inhibited tumor growth, delaying paralysis and increasing lifespans, but not in IRE-1 deficient animals.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Deficiency in genes that cause different types of cellular stress revealed only <italic>tfg-1</italic> depletion which induces ER stress led to trans-differentiation in <italic>gld-1</italic> deficient animals and suppresses germline tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The concept that trans-differentiation of tumor cells into somatic cells can prevent tumor progress by rendering cells susceptible to ER stress induced apoptosis is well supported by this study. It is particularly interesting that IRE-1 dependent, but <italic>xbp-1</italic> independent signaling is necessary for regulation of germ cell fate. This study is provocative and could lead to many downstream investigations into mechanisms and into whether the general concepts presented here are applicable to cancer in humans.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This paper describes an effect of the UPR on transdifferentiation and apoptosis in a worm germline tumor model. The main conclusions are: 1. Activation of Ire-1 induces germ cell transdifferentiation into ectopic somatic cells, 2. This effect leads to apoptosis of the ectopic cells (which would normally by resistant to apoptosis) and 3. This process suppresses the lethal effects of the tumor.</p><p>The evidence that the cells in question are transdifferentiated somatic cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where several somatic cell markers are shown to increase with ER stress. The authors conclude that “the cells with abnormal large nuclei, which are detected in apoptosis-defective <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi-treated animals, and which are further induced by ER stress, appear to be of somatic nature” (subsection headed “The ectopic cells in the gonad of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals are germ cell-derived somatic cells”). I would have liked to see more evidence that these are indeed the same cells. The units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> are relative fluorescence rather than % gonad filled like the other figures, so it is difficult to discern whether these transdifferentiated cells can account for the all of the large-nuclei cells that accumulate in the tumor model when apoptosis is inhibited. Perhaps a double-labeling experiment with the somatic cell markers and dapi would clear this up.</p><p>The fact that the accumulation of the ectopic cells is dependent on Ire-1 but not XBP-1 is interesting. The authors discuss at several points that ER stress promotes transdifferentiation/tumor suppression etc., but in the Discussion suggest that it is not ER stress per se but Ire-1 signaling that causes this effect. This seems consistent with the data. The authors should point out that in <italic>xbp1</italic> mutants (at least in several tissue-specific examples in mice), IRE-1 is often over-activated. Does this occur in the <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms as well? This could further explain why the <italic>xbp1</italic> mutants suppress the tumor lethality.</p><p>The tumor suppression referred to in the Title of the manuscript is actually shown only for <italic>xbp1</italic> mutants, and not in cases of induced ER stress. In the subsection headed “ER stress-induced germ cell transdifferentiation suppresses the germline tumor”, the authors state that inactivating <italic>tfg-1</italic> or <italic>xbp-1</italic> suppressed the germline tumor, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not have any data for <italic>tfg-1</italic>. In order to support the claim made in the Title, I think the authors should either show tumor suppression in a more clear-cut case of ER stress (chemical or genetic), or they should show tumor suppression in a more clear-cut case of IRE-1 activation (e.g., overexpression of IRE) and change the Title to reflect this.</p><p>Finally, is anything known about the molecular pathways and genes that underlie transdifferentiation in this system? More discussion is warranted if so- could the authors propose possible targets of <italic>ire-1</italic> that could mediate this effect (either JNK signaling or RIDD)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08005.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The Abstract and Title claims that ER stress suppresses tumor formation, however the experiments displayed merely show that elimination of</italic> xbp-1 <italic>suppresses tumor formation in</italic> gld-1 <italic>deficient worms.
