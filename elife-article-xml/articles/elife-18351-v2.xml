Here, we demonstrate that BRAF serves a crucial function in formation of limb skeletal muscles during mouse embryogenesis downstream of MET and acts as a potent inducer of myoblast cell migration. We found that a fraction of BRAF accumulates in the nucleus after activation and endosomal transport to a perinuclear position. Mass spectrometry based screening for potential interaction partners revealed that BRAF interacts and phosphorylates PAX3. Mutation of BRAF dependent phosphorylation sites in PAX3 impaired the ability of PAX3 to promote migration of C2C12 myoblasts indicating that BRAF directly activates PAX3. Since PAX3 stimulates transcription of the <italic>Met</italic> gene we propose that MET signaling via BRAF fuels a positive feedback loop, which maintains high levels of PAX3 and MET activity required for limb muscle precursor cell migration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18351.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18351.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Skeletal muscle development</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>endosomal trafficking</kwd><kwd>intracellular signaling</kwd><kwd>B-Raf</kwd><kwd>Pax3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB TRR81 TP02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Center for Cardiovascular Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MolCellCard</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical approaches identify a new component of the cellular signaling machinery driving migration of limb muscle precursor cells during mouse embryogenesis and reveal the underlying molecular mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs originate from condensations of the paraxial mesoderm, the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckingham and Relaix, 2007</xref>). Epaxial muscles are derived from the dorso-medial part of the somatic dermomyotome while the ventro-lateral part gives rise to hypaxial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ordahl and Le Douarin, 1992</xref>). Hypaxial muscles of the body wall and intercostal muscles are generated by elongation of the dermomyotomal epithelium. In contrast, muscles of the limbs, the diaphragm and the tongue are generated from a population of long-range migrating muscle precursor cells, which delaminate from the ventral dermomyotome at specific positions along the cranial-caudal axis after epithelial-mesenchymal transition, allowing them to form muscles far away from somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevallier et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ and Brand-Saberi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christ et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Several genes including <italic>Pax3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bober et al., 1994</xref>), <italic>Met</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>Cxcr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasyutina et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Gab1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sachs et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Six1;Eya1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heanue et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Lbx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brohmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schäfer and Braun, 1999</xref>) have been identified to control somite maturation and compartmentalization, delamination of muscle precursor cells from the dermomyotomal epithelium as well as muscle precursor cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. More specifically, <italic>Pax3</italic> is required for correct formation of the ventro-lateral dermomyotome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bober et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daston et al., 1996</xref>) as well as for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>) and migration of limb muscle precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daston et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Met</italic> is necessary for de-epithelialization and migration of limb muscle precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bladt et al., 1995</xref>) but also for myocyte fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Webster and Fan, 2013</xref>). It is also known that PAX3 controls expression of <italic>Met</italic> in the ventro-lateral dermomyotome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 1996</xref>) by direct binding to the <italic>Met</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 1996</xref>), thereby enabling delamination and migration of limb muscle precursor cells. However, the full complexity of the interactions within the genetic network orchestrating limb muscle precursor cell migration and the functional regulation of the activity of PAX3 and its multiple isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) has not been uncovered yet.</p><p>MET signaling is highly complex and involves several scaffolding adaptors and surface signal modifiers, which allows MET to activate multiple different biochemical pathways including the MAPK (ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs) pathway, the PI3K-AKT axis, the STAT pathway and the IkB-NFkB complex (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birchmeier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>)). Importantly, mutants of MET unable to bind the adaptor GRB2, which is considered to act as the primary mediator of RAS-RAF activation, does not affect migration of limb muscle precursor cells but inhibits proliferation of fetal myoblasts and formation of secondary myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, inactivation of the adaptor <italic>Gab1</italic> severely impairs migration of limb muscle precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sachs et al., 2000</xref>). GAB1 acts as a docking platform for several molecules including PI3K, PLC, CRK, and SHP2 but also activates the RAS-RAF route after activation by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birchmeier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>). This raises several questions: Does the RAS-RAF pathway contribute to migration of limb muscle precursor cells? If RAF is involved in regulation of limb muscle precursor cell migration, which of the three serine/threonine kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) does the job? Are potential effects of RAF transmitted via the canonical MEK-ERK pathway or by different means?</p><p>To answer these questions we inactivated the <italic>Braf</italic> gene specifically in limb muscle precursor cells, since germ line inactivation of <italic>Braf</italic> results in embryonic lethality between E10.5 and E12.5 and causes multiple defects including growth retardation, vascular and neuronal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wojnowski et al., 1997</xref>). We found that <italic>Braf</italic> is required for muscle precursor cell migration and skeletal muscle formation in the forelimbs. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that BRAF phosphorylates and activates PAX3 after endosomal trafficking to a perinuclear position and translocation into the nucleus. Our results suggest a positive feedback loop, which drives skeletal muscle formation by maintaining high levels of PAX3 and MET activity in migrating limb muscle precursor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BRAF mediates growth factor induced muscle precursor cell migration in vitro</title><p>The tyrosine kinase receptor MET is instrumental for delamination of limb muscle precursor cells from the dermomyotome and subsequent migration. To identify the branches of the MET signaling network driving migration of myogenic cells, we turned to the muscle cell line C2C12, since evaluation of signaling processes in migrating limb muscle precursor cells is difficult due to the small size of the cell population and its transient appearance. We found that HGF, the ligand of the MET receptor, robustly induced migration of C2C12 cells. Stimulation of migration was blocked by knockdown of <italic>Met</italic> demonstrating that C2C12 cells can be utilized to study the mechanisms of MET receptor signaling for migration of myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Systematic analysis of the role of potential downstream effectors of MET signaling by siRNA-mediated knockdown disclosed an important role of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase BRAF, which essentially phenocopied the effects of <italic>Met</italic> receptor knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>Pax3</italic> did also inhibit HGF-mediated stimulation of C2C12 cell migration suggesting a functional involvement of PAX3 in MET signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether expression of BRAF alone is sufficient to promote migration we transfected WT Braf and the constitutively active (CA) Braf (V600E) mutation into C2C12 cells. We observed a strong stimulation of migration by CA BRAF (V600E) and -to a lesser extent- WT BRAF while expression of CRAF had only minor effects on muscle cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CA BRAF (V600E) and WT BRAF also stimulated expression of <italic>Pax3</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> in C2C12 cells adding further evidence to the putative role of BRAF in the regulatory loop controlling migration of myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we investigated whether BRAF and PAX3 also promote migration of primary dermomyotomal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mennerich et al., 1998</xref>). We found that RCAS virus-mediated expression of BRAF and PAX3 but not human alkaline phosphatase (AP) increased cellular migration out of somitic explants isolated from chicken embryos and cultivated in matrigel further corroborating the results obtained with C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18351.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BRAF mediates muscle precursor cell migration independent of MEK/ERK signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of migrating muscle cells (C2C12) after knock down of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (siMet), <italic>Braf</italic> (siBraf) and <italic>Pax3</italic> (siPax3) or after transfection of cultures with Craf, Braf, a dominant negative form of Braf (DN Braf) and CA Braf (V600E) in the presence or absence of HGF.

Surprisingly, addition of the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 had only minor effects on migration, although the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation after transfection of WT and CA BRAF (V600E) was efficiently prevented by the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) indicating a MEK/ERK independent mechanism of BRAF signaling. Since MET undergoes rapid endocytosis in a process called ‘endosomal signaling’ and traffics through peripheral endosomes to a perinuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow-McGee and Kermorgant, 2014</xref>), we investigated whether inhibition of endosomal trafficking abrogates the effects of BRAF on migration of C2C12 muscle cells. Interestingly, addition of Dynasore, a pharmacological inhibitor of endosomal trafficking, significantly prevented BRAF dependent stimulation of migration when the constitutively active form of BRAF was used in the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BRAF is required for migration of limb muscle precursor cells and formation of forelimb muscles</title><p>Although C2C12 cells represent a useful model to study mechanistic aspects of muscle cell migration, the inhibition of HGF-stimulated migration after knockdown of <italic>Braf</italic> does not prove that <italic>Braf</italic> is also instrumental to regulate limb muscle formation in the embryo in vivo. We therefore took advantage of a mouse strain (Braf<sup>nfl</sup>) in which three <italic>loxP</italic>-sites had been inserted to flank exon three as well as a neomycin selection cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pfeiffer et al., 2013</xref>). Breeding with MeuCre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leneuve et al., 2003</xref>) yielded Braf<sup>fl</sup> mice, in which the neomycin cassette was removed but exon three is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic>-sites, and Braf<sup>del</sup> mice lacking exon 3, which encodes parts of the Ras-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Deletion of exon three created a functional null allele of <italic>Braf</italic> leading to embryonic lethality of Braf<sup>del/del</sup> mice consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pfeiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wojnowski et al., 1997</xref>). Braf<sup>fl</sup> mice were crossed to the Pax3-Cre strain allowing specific inactivation of <italic>Braf</italic> in the dermomyotome and limb muscle precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining using an anti-BRAF antibody confirmed the absence of BRAF protein in the dermomyotome of Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup> mutant embryos at E10.5 while the dermomyotome of WT control embryos was strongly positive for BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, germ line inactivation (Braf<sup>del/del</sup>) as well as deletion of <italic>Braf</italic> in <italic>Pax3</italic>-expressing limb muscle precursor cells (Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup>) resulted in arrest of cell migration as indicated by the absence of PAX3<sup>+</sup>-cells in the developing forelimb buds at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), which was further validated by immunofluorescence analysis of PAX3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and RT-PCR analysis of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Pax3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Closer inspection of the PAX3 immunofluorescence staining revealed that only very few <italic>Braf</italic>-deficient PAX3<sup>+</sup>-cells delaminated from the dermomyotome and initiated migration suggesting a requirement of <italic>Braf</italic> for epithelia-mesenchymal transition of dermomyotomal cells and/or migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Staining for <italic>Lbx1</italic> expression, which is also expressed in limb muscle precursor cells and needed for targeted migration, confirmed this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also found a virtually complete absence of <italic>Myod</italic> and <italic>Myf5</italic> expressing myogenic cells in limb buds of E10.5 Pax3-Cre//Braf<sup>del/del</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), although we noted a reduced expression at later stages by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicating that a small population of <italic>Braf</italic>-deficient limb muscle progenitor cells was able to reach its target. Accordingly, we observed a major reduction of forelimb muscles at later stages of development (E14.5), which was more pronounced in the distal compared to the proximal parts of the limb, where some residual muscle formation was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

RT-PCR analysis revealed a strong up-regulation of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Pax3</italic> expression indicating that BRAF induced transcription of both genes, most likely by activation of key transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we analyzed whether BRAF might directly increase the transcriptional activity of PAX3. We therefore constructed a luciferase reporter construct containing two PAX3 consensus binding sites in front of a minimal promoter. Co-transfection of the Pax3 reporter plasmid together with Pax3 and Braf or CA Braf (V600E) into HEK293T cells revealed a strong increase of transcriptional activity, resulting in an up to 15-fold change when CA Braf (V600E) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together our data indicate that BRAF is essential for limb muscle formation presumably by mediating MET signaling via PAX3 to enable migration of limb muscle precursor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BRAF physically interacts with PAX3 in muscle precursor cells in vivo and in vitro</title><p>Since our data indicated that the effects of BRAF on migration of myogenic cells are not mediated via the canonical MEK-ERK signaling pathway, we decided to search for additional targets. Importantly, mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated samples from WT limb buds of E10.5 mouse embryos using an antibody against endogenous BRAF identified -among several other proteins- the nuclear transcription factors PAX3 and PAX7 as potential interaction partners of BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar observations were made when BRAF was precipitated from C2C12 cells transfected with the CA Braf (V600E). Reciprocal mass spectrometry experiments, in which we incubated protein extracts from WT limb buds of E10.5 mouse embryos with GST-PAX3 protein followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-PAX3 antibody and immunoprecipitation of PAX3 from extracts of C2C12 cells transfected with HA-tagged Pax3 yielded identical results and also uncovered interactions of PAX3 and BRAF with components of the endocytosis pathway such as ARF5, six and DNM2 along with several other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Coupled immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis of samples from E10.5 limb buds using either BRAF antibodies for IP and PAX3 antibodies for Western blot or vice versa further confirmed the physical interaction between BRAF and 53 kDa PAX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we wanted to know whether activation of BRAF leads to more efficient binding to PAX3. Comparative GST pull-down assays of extracts from C2C12 cells transfected either with WT Braf or CA Braf (V600E) revealed a significantly stronger interaction of the constitutively active compared to the WT form of BRAF with GST-PAX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Identical results were obtained when endogenous PAX3 was immunoprecipitated from C2C12 cells after transfection with WT Braf or CA Braf (V600E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Finally, we performed cross-linking experiments with NHS-diazirine cross-linker (SD) in C2C12 cells transfected with CA Braf (V600E) followed by immunoprecipitation with BRAF or PAX3 antibodies. Western blot analysis using corresponding antibodies detected the 95 kDa BRAF and the 53 kDa PAX3 proteins as separate bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, either antibody detected an additional single band at ca. 150 kDa, which corresponds to the cross-linked BRAF-PAX3 heteromer.

Hence, we analyzed specifically whether a fraction of BRAF is transported into the nucleus. Subcellular fractionation of C2C12 cells disclosed the presence of a minor amount of endogenous BRAF in the nucleus although the major share of BRAF was present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, PAX3 was exclusively found in the nuclear fraction, even after expression of large amounts of HA-tagged Pax3. The concentration of BRAF in the nuclear fraction increased when CA Braf (V600E) was transfected into cells irrespective of the presence or absence of HGF. Interestingly, the nuclear level of BRAF decreased when endosomal trafficking was blocked by administration of Dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also conducted additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments using only the nuclear fraction of transfected C2C12 cells, which corroborated the interaction of nuclear BRAF with PAX3 in the absence of cytosolic BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The co-immunoprecipitation experiments also revealed enhanced interaction of CA BRAF (V600E) with PAX3, which might be due to increased transport of CA BRAF (V600E) into the nucleus.

Subsequent fractionation of FASP-digested PAX3 peptides by cation-exchange liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis using a quadrupole-based Q Exactive instrument identified multiple new phosphorylation sites at serine and threonine residues as well as five phosphorylation sites (at Ser180, Ser187, Ser201, Ser205 and Ser209), which had already been reported before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The majority of the phosphorylation events corresponded well to sites predicted by NetPhos 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos</ext-link>), PHOSIDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosida.de">www.phosida.de</ext-link>) and PhosphoVariant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phosphovariant.ngri.go.kr">http://phosphovariant.ngri.go.kr</ext-link>). To understand whether enhanced BRAF activity increases phosphorylation of PAX3, we quantified the increase of serine and threonine phosphorylation by quantitative mass spectrometry after expression of CA Braf (V600E). HEK293T cells were SILAC labeled (Light: Arg0, Lys0; Heavy: Arg10, Lys8) for five passages and then transfected with Pax3 (light condition) or Pax3 plus CA Braf (V600E) (heavy condition). Protein extracts were prepared from each condition, combined at equal concentrations, processed and used for Titan (TiO<sub>2</sub>) bead-based extraction of phosphorylated peptides. This approach allowed us to calculate the relative abundance of phosphorylated sites in PAX3 in response to CA BRAF (V600E) due to differential labeling with separate stable isotopes. We found that transfection of Braf primarily increased PAX3 phosphorylation at Ser222 while phosphorylation at the other sites was not prominently enhanced when normalized to PAX3 protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18351.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of PAX3 phosphorylation sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of PAX3 phosphorylation sites determined by mass spectrometry.

To analyze whether any of these phosphorylation sites are instrumental for the ability of PAX3 to stimulate muscle cell migration, we replaced the respective serine residues by alanine. As expected neither WT Pax3 nor the S201A, S205A, S209A and S222A mutant constructs increased the rate of migration without activation by BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) but co-transfection with CA Braf (V600E) revealed important differences. The S205A Pax3 mutant failed to stimulate muscle cell migration while S201A, S209A and S222A mutants had no discernable effects compared to WT Pax3 indicating that phosphorylation of Ser205 is instrumental for PAX3-dependent stimulation of muscle cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Since only mutation of Ser205 reduced the ability of BRAF to induce PAX3-dependent muscle cell migration, we wondered whether we had failed to detect BRAF-dependent up-regulation of PAX3 phosphorylation at this site in our quantitative mass spectrometry experiments. Therefore, we transfected Pax3 together with CA Braf (V600E) into HEK293T and C2C12 muscle cells, but this time monitored phosphorylation of PAX3 using an antibody specific for p-Ser205. We found that BRAF clearly induced phosphorylation of PAX3 at Ser205 in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant BRAF and bacterially produced, affinity-purified GST-PAX3. Western blot analysis using the p-Ser205 specific PAX3-antibody corroborated that BRAF directly phosphorylates PAX3 at Ser205 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, upper panel). To analyze the specificity of the p-Ser205 PAX3-antibody we performed in vitro kinase assays using the S201A, S205A, S209A and S222A PAX3-mutants as substrates. As expected all mutant PAX3 proteins, with the exception of S205A, reacted with the p-Ser205 PAX3 antibody after incubation with BRAF demonstrating specificity of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, lower panel). Taken together, our results suggest that BRAF phosphorylates PAX3 at multiple sites but that phosphorylation at Ser205 is critical for efficient PAX3-dependent stimulation of muscle cell migration.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18351.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of PAX3 at Ser205 is critical for stimulation of muscle cell migration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exchange of serine by alanine in PAX3 at Ser205 reduces C2C12 myoblast migration after transfection with CA Braf (V600E).

Targeted mutation of <italic>Braf</italic> in migrating limb muscle precursor cells partially phenocopied effects of inactivation of the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>Met</italic> and its large adaptor protein GAB1 indicating that BRAF acts downstream of GAB1 to mediate intracellular MET signaling. Furthermore, we show that a fraction of BRAF enters the nucleus, where it binds and activates the transcription factor PAX3 thereby creating a shortcut bypassing established signaling pathways.</p><p>The crucial role of BRAF in transmitting signals downstream of MET and GAB1 does not rule out the contribution of other signaling pathways linked to GAB1 such as PI3K/AKT or PLCγ/PKC for regulation of limb muscle progenitor cell motility, proliferation and survival but firmly establishes BRAF as essential signaling hub conveying migratory signals. Interestingly, previous studies demonstrated that G-protein coupled receptor CXCR4 and GAB1 cooperate to control the development of migrating muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasyutina et al., 2005</xref>). Since CXCR4 signaling, including induction of the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), relies on activation of RAS/RAF while MET associated GAB1 activates the RAS-RAF route via the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birchmeier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>), we would like to propose that important aspects of the cross-talk between the CXCR4 and MET/GAB1 signaling pathways are mediated by BRAF. However, we do not want to claim that BRAF solely exerts its effects downstream of MET. BRAF might also play an important role in other cellular signaling pathways, which is also supported by reduced expression of <italic>Lbx1</italic> in <italic>Braf</italic> mutant embryos but not after inactivation of <italic>Met</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sachs et al., 2000</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Braf</italic> impairs but does not completely abolish delamination of muscle progenitors as indicated by the appearance of small numbers of committed myoblasts and the formation of residual myofibers in limbs. Hence, additional experiments are needed to determine the contribution of other signaling pathways downstream of MET and CXCR4 and to unravel the whole complexity of signaling network required for migration of limb muscle precursor cells.</p><p>Our study primarily focused on early steps of limb muscle formation ignoring potential later functions of <italic>Braf</italic> for myogenesis after migration is completed. Analysis of a <italic>Met</italic> mutant mouse strain, in which the adaptor GRB2 is unable to bind to MET, revealed that GRB2 is dispensable for migration of limb muscle precursor cells but required for proliferation of fetal myoblasts and formation of secondary myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). Since GRB2 is a well-known activator of RAS-RAF signaling it seems possible that loss of BRAF might also play a role at later stages of myogenesis, e.g. for generation of secondary myofibers. Moreover, PAX3, which is a target of BRAF mediated phosphorylation in the nucleus, was shown to activate the enhancer of the myogenic control factor <italic>Myf5</italic> in limb muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajard et al., 2006</xref>), which raises the possibility that the MET-BRAF cascade affects muscle differentiation via <italic>Pax3</italic>-dependent control of <italic>Myf5</italic> expression. Time-controlled inactivation of <italic>Braf</italic> during fetal myogenesis will probably resolve these issues.</p><p>Our results indicate that stimulation of myogenic cell migration and translocation of BRAF into the nucleus requires intact endosomal trafficking. Both administration of Dynasore and knockdown of <italic>Eea1</italic> abrogated the effects of BRAF on migration of myogenic cells and prevented accumulation of BRAF in the nucleus. Traditional models favor the view that receptors only signal at the plasma membrane and are inactivated by internalization. However, it has become clear that several receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, PDGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miaczynska et al., 2004a</xref>), the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ceresa et al., 1998</xref>) and MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kermorgant et al., 2004</xref>) signal after internalization from endosomal compartments. In fact, MET endocytic trafficking is required for the full activation of signals requiring GAB1, ERK 1/2, STAT3 and RAC1 (reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow-McGee and Kermorgant, 2014</xref>)). Upon ligand binding, MET undergoes rapid endocytosis and traffics through peripheral endosomes to accumulate on perinuclear endosomes. MET-induced activation of STAT3 within the perinuclear compartment allows efficient activation and nuclear accumulation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kermorgant and Parker, 2008</xref>) suggesting that trafficking and ‘endosomal signaling’ of MET enables direct transfer of signaling complexes to their intended target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miaczynska et al., 2004b</xref>) thereby favoring distinct signaling events. Our finding that MET co-localizes with BRAF in EEA1<sup>+</sup> endosomes after HGF stimulation and that blockage of endosomal trafficking prevents accumulation of BRAF in the nucleus indicates that internalization and perinuclear accumulation of MET is instrumental for transport of a fraction of BRAF into the nucleus.</p><p>BRAF is commonly viewed as a cytoplasmic kinase and was not considered to undergo intracellular transport. Motivated by our mass spectrometry-based screening for potential interaction partners of BRAF, which resulted in the identification of the nuclear transcription factor PAX3, we used several different techniques to prove the localization of BRAF in the nucleus including subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence using both endogenous and transfected BRAF. We reason that the low expression level of BRAF, the relatively low amount of BRAF in the nucleus and the dynamic regulation of intracellular localization might have prevented a prior detection of BRAF in the nucleus so far. In this context it is interesting to note that also other components of the signaling pathways downstream of MET undergo a cytoplasmic-nuclear transport including MKP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karlsson et al., 2004</xref>), ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow-McGee and Kermorgant, 2014</xref>), and STAT3, which in part rely on MET-induced activation within the perinuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kermorgant and Parker, 2008</xref>) suggesting a common theme in the transfer of signaling complexes to their intended targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miaczynska et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>The PAX3 protein is posttranslationally modified by acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichi et al., 2011</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutet et al., 2007</xref>), and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amstutz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyengar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 2008</xref>). The functional relevance of PAX3 phosphorylation is largely unknown although the presence of phosphorylation sites at Ser201, Ser205 and Ser209 near the octapeptide domain, a region crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and DNA binding suggests important regulatory functions. So far, two different kinases were identified to phosphorylate PAX3: GSK3β and CK2. CK2 seems able to phosphorylate Ser205 and Ser209 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyengar et al., 2012</xref>) while GSK3β was found to phosphorylate Ser201, Ser205 and possibly Ser197 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubic et al., 2012</xref>). Since inhibition of GSK3β in melanoma cells leads to cellular changes paralleling PAX3 inhibition, it was claimed that GSK3β regulates proliferation and morphology of melanoma cells through phosphorylation of PAX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubic et al., 2012</xref>). We disclosed that BRAF phosphorylates Ser205, which is part of a cluster of serine residues (Ser187, Ser193, Ser197, Ser201, Ser205, and Ser209) required for efficient DNA binding of PAX3-FOX1A fusion proteins and necessary to institute the full transactivation potential of PAX3 in reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amstutz et al., 2008</xref>). Serine to aspartate conversions at these sites render the transcriptional activity of PAX3/FOX1A fusion proteins insensitive to the inhibitory actions of the kinase inhibitor PKC412, which inhibits growth of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas carrying a <italic>Pax3/Fox1A</italic> translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amstutz et al., 2008</xref>). Using a different assay to monitor activity of PAX3, we found that the S205A mutation significantly inhibited PAX3-dependent C2C12 muscle cell migration while S201A, S209A and S222A mutants had no discernable effects. Based on the published observation and our own findings it seems reasonable to assume that phosphorylation of Ser205 plays an important role in regulating the biological activity of PAX3. In fact, the octapeptide domain close to Ser205 mediates interaction of PAX3 with GROUCHO, which prevents transcriptional activation of PAX3 targets during melanocyte and neural cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muhr et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it seems possible that phosphorylation of Ser205 or other nearby sites prevents binding of GROUCO and thereby facilitates transactivation of PAX3 target genes, although we did not investigate this possibility. Since Ser205 is phosphorylated both by CK2, GSK3β and BRAF, it is also tempting to speculate that several different signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation of Ser205 and/or that a certain fraction of Ser205 is constitutively phosphorylated assuring a basic activity of PAX3, which is further enhanced by MET-dependent BRAF phosphorylation. However, we have to point out that we have demonstrated the critical role of Ser205 phosphorylation only in vitro in C2C12 cells and not in limb muscle progenitor cells in vivo. It is possible that different mechanisms operate in limb muscle progenitor cells than in C2C12 muscle cells, which differ in many aspects (e.g. expression of myogenic factors).</p><p>The identification of BRAF as a kinase phosphorylating PAX3 establishes a new pathway, which offers MET a direct route to regulate PAX3 activity in migrating muscle cells, independent of other intracellular phosphorylation cascades. We found that inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase did not affect BRAF-dependent stimulation of muscle precursor cell migration adding further support to the idea that BRAF exerts its activity on muscle cell migration not via the classical RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade but by direct phosphorylation and activation of PAX3. On the other hand, it seems possible that RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade contributes to the regulation of proliferation of fetal myoblasts and formation of secondary myofibers, which depends on MET adapter protein Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maina et al., 1996</xref>). The stimulation of PAX3 activity by MET via BRAF together with the previously reported activation of the <italic>Met</italic> promoter by PAX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 1996</xref>) suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop, which might be instrumental to maintain high levels of MET and PAX3 activity during limb muscle precursor cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Importantly, we found that activation of PAX3 by overexpression of WT and CA Braf (V600E) in C2C12 muscle cells results in marked up-regulation of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Pax3</italic>. Similarly, WT and CA Braf (V600E) increased the transcriptional activity of PAX3 in Luciferase reporter assays on HEK293T cells, which fits to the proposed role of PAX3 to stimulate <italic>Met</italic> expression in myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 1996</xref>) and to activate its own expression by direct positive autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, activation of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Pax3</italic> expression by BRAF underscores the importance of BRAF in maintaining the MET-PAX3 feedback loop. It will be interesting to determine whether this loop and the signaling bypass created by BRAF-dependent PAX3 phosphorylation is also operative in other tissues and in cancer cells such as rhabdomyosarcoma and melanoma cells, which would offer new refined therapeutic approaches.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18351.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of the MET-BRAF-PAX3 feedback loop enabling migration of limb muscle precursor cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activation and subsequent internalization of MET leads to activation of BRAF and transport via endosomal trafficking to a perinuclear position.

Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate and 1:100 protease inhibitor cOmplete (from Roche)). Protein extracts were purified by centrifugation and incubated with the antibody against endogenous BRAF in presence of Sepharose G beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). Precipitated proteins were then centrifuged and washed several times using ice-cold RIPA buffer. Finally, antibody–antigen complexes were eluted by boiling in LDS buffer (Novex by Life Technologies) and samples were subjected to in-gel digestion. Immunoprecipited proteins were separated according to their molecular weight by subjecting them to SDS-PAGE (4–12% NuPage BisTris Gel, Invitrogen) followed by Colloidal Blue staining (Expedeon, San Diego, California). Gel lanes were cut into equal pieces and digested in the gel as described by Shevchenko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>). In brief, gel pieces were washed, de-stained and dehydrated. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested with the endopeptidase sequencing-grade Trypsin (Promega) overnight. Generated peptides were extracted using an increasing acetonitrile concentration. Collected peptide mixtures were concentrated and desalted using the Stop and Go Extraction (STAGE) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein digestion and phosphopeptide enrichment</title><p>HEK293T cells were SILAC labeled (Light: Arg0, Lys0; Heavy: Arg10, Lys8) for at least five passages and then transfected with pcDNA-Pax3 (light condition) or pcDNA-Pax3 plus mutant Braf (pEFm-V600E in heavy condition). After 36 hr of transfection, the cells were homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (4% SDS/0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 7.6) followed by sonication and boiling at 70°C for 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (13,000g, 10 min) and protein concentration was determined using DC assay (Bio-Rad). Approximately 5 mg protein of each labeling condition were pooled and reduced using 100 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 10 min at 56°C and then subjected to the FASP digestion technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, samples were washed with 8 M urea, alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and digested overnight in 20 mM ammoniumbicarbonate/trypsin (Promega), at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100. For fractionation by SCX, the FASP-digested peptides were collected by multiple washing of filter units, acidified to pH 2.67 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and filled up with ACN to a final concentration of 30%. The samples were loaded on a ResourceS 1 ml SCX column (Äkta Purifier, GE Healthcare). Flow-through was collected and peptides were separated according to their charge in acidic conditions using a linear increase in salt concentration in a binary buffer system: buffer A 7 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> in 30% acetonitrile (ACN) (pH 2.65) and B 7 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 350 mM KCl in 30% ACN (pH 2.65). All fractions were pooled conducting absorbance at 280 nm to a total of 8–10 fractions, concentrated and adjusted to binding conditions for Titan sphere (TiO<sub>2</sub>) bead-based extraction of phosphorylated peptides (93% acetonitrile, 7% TFA). Fractions were incubated twice with 2.5 mg of TiO<sub>2</sub> beads and flow-throughs were incubated three times with 5 mg of TiO<sub>2</sub> beads (SLSC Science, St. Louis, Missouri). Beads were washed several times with decreasing content of TFA (6–3%) and loaded on C8 material-containing tips. Peptides were eluted with 40% ammonia/acetonitrile (pH 11.6), concentrated in a speedvac at room temperature to almost complete dryness and diluted in acidified (0.1% formic acid or 0.5% acetic acid) H<sub>2</sub>O before mass spectrometry. The experiment was performed in duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry</title><p>Instrumentation for LC-MS/MS analysis consisted of a NanoLC 1000 coupled via a nano-electrospray ionization source to the quadrupole-based Q Exactive benchtop mass spectrometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michalski et al., 2011</xref>). Peptide separation was carried out according to their hydrophobicity on an in-house packed 50 cm column with 1.9 mm C18 beads (Dr Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a binary buffer system consisting of solution A: 0.1% formic acid (0.5% acetic acid) and B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid). Linear gradients from 7–38% B in 150 were applied with a following increase to 80% B within 5 min and a re-equilibration to 5% B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kruger et al., 2008</xref>). MS spectra were acquired using 1E6 as an AGC target, a maximal injection time of 20 ms and a 70,000 resolution at 200 m/z. A Top10 method was applied for subsequent acquisition of higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation MS/MS spectra of the top 10 most intense peaks. Resolution for MS/MS spectra was set to 35,000 at 200 m/z, AGC target to 5E5, max injection time to 120 ms and the isolation window to 1.7 Th.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mass spectrometry data analysis</title><p>All acquired raw files were processed using MaxQuant (1.5.3.12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) and the implemented Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2011</xref>). For protein assignment, spectra were correlated with the Uniprot human database (v. 2015) including a list of common contaminants. Searches were performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS spectra. Carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while oxidations at methionine, acetylation at the N-terminus were defined as variable modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids, and the false discovery rate for proteins and peptide-spectrum matches to 1%. The match-between-run feature with a time window of 1 min was used. For further analysis, the Perseus software (1.5.0.31) was used and first filtered for contaminants and reverse entries as well as proteins that were only identified by a modified peptide. The SILAC Ratios were logarithmized and grouped into duplicates and a one-sample t-test was performed. Probability values (p)&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with the Graph Pad Prism 5.0a (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) using the Mann-Whitney-U test or ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc comparison test as indicated.

The authors show that BRaf interacts with Pax3 leading to Pax3 phosphorylation which is required for myogenic cell migration and limb muscle formation. The conclusions are based on careful work using sophisticated technologies. However, before acceptance the following points should be addressed:</p><p>Major point requiring presentation of further data:</p><p>The phenotype of the conditional BRaf mutant should include documentation of the state of the hypaxial dermomyotome at limb level at E9.5 and E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The deficit in limb muscle formation may be due to failure to migrate or to a change in progenitor cell survival/proliferation. Please provide better resolution pictures of the dermomyotomal lip in the mutant, and provide data on the absence of apoptosis. Do the progenitors remain in the dermomyotome? The expression of BRaf in the dermomyotome should be documented.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure I</xref> requires clarification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Does CA BRaf affect proliferation or migration? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, (also 6C) what do the numbers on the vertical axis refer to? What is the meaning of the different type of fillings in the bars? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, please explain what these inhibitors do in the figure legends. On the graph in 1C, there is a ** significant only for the Dynasore + V600E. This would indicate that the reduction of migration is only significant when the CA BRaf is used (V600E). This is not clear in the text, or in the figure legend.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, co-localization of Pax3 and BRaf in nuclei in vivo should be shown with a wider field to include more than a single Pax3+ nucleus.</p><p>3) &quot;Statistical analysis was performed with the Graph Pad Prism software using the t-test&quot;. The T-test is used for normal populations. In cases where the population is not normal (which is most likely the case, given the low n) non-parametric statistical analysis should be used. More information on the method of cell counting underlying the graphs in A would be useful. Was this based on counting cell nuclei using DAPI? On the graphs, are the numbers on the left indicating cell number? This should be indicated.</p><p>4) Pax3 is a poor transcription factor in transactivation studies on target promoters or polymerised Pax3 binding sites. It would be interesting to see the effect of CA B-Raf (V600E) on Pax3 target activation in vitro, for example on c-Met regulatory elements. If the authors perform such experiments, they should be careful to use the PAX3 binding sites described by Cao et al. in the PAX3-FOXO1A ChIP-seq study.</p><p>5) A paper from Yvergoneau et al. (2012) (see also Mayeuf et al., 2016) has shown that when VEGFR2 is knocked out in paraxial mesoderm, muscle progenitors from the lateral dermomyotome do not migrate into the limb bud. This paper thus assigned a seemingly crucial role to endothelial precursors in the subsequent migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. VEGFR2 signals among other things through Raf and the endothelial precursors present in the lateral dermomyotome would certainly be affected in the Pax3-Cre/B-Raf del/del. Can the authors rule out that the effect they observe here is not due to a problem of signaling downstream of Flk1? Obviously, the &quot;inhibition of HGF-mediated migration of myogenic cells by knockdown of Pax3&quot; (subsection “B-Raf regulates muscle precursor cell migration through Pax3 phosphorylation”) is not really a strong argument, since Pax3 is probably upstream of VEGFR2 as well.</p><p>6) One should be very cautious about over-expression studies. Although the subcellular fractionation experiments seem to indicate that BRaf goes into the nucleus, it would be important to show data on the purity of these fractions, (the subcellular fractionation technique does not appear to be in the Materials and methods section). The authors indicate that the Met receptor traffics from the plasma membrane to perinuclear endosomes. Is it possible that the IF staining observed with BRaf lights up perinuclear endosomes? Could the authors either nail down this possibility or be more careful on the wording.</p><p>7) The finding that B-Raf phosphorylates Pax3 at sites located in the octapeptide sequence, a domain previously described as mediating interaction with Groucho repressor proteins suggests a possible interplay between repression and activation. This could be discussed.</p><p>8) In a number of figures, please provide data on the efficiency of siRNAs.</p><p>9) In Met mutants, Lbx1 is induced, indicating that the effects the authors observe in vivo are not solely downstream effects of Met. Please discuss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18351.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This paper provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the Pax3 dependent regulatory cascade that leads to the migration of myogenic progenitor cells from the dermomyotome of the somite into the limb.

We performed additional immunofluorescence analysis of B-Raf mutant embryos at E10.5 using antibodies directed against Pax3, which labels cells in the dermomyotome and migrating muscle progenitor cells. We found that inactivation of B-Raf in Pax3-expressing cells resulted in a dramatic reduction of the number of delaminated Pax3-positive cells migrating towards the muscle anlagen in the limb. The delamination of muscle progenitor cells was not completely blocked as indicated by the presence of few Pax3-positive cells outside of the dermomyotomal epithelium, which corresponds nicely to the reduction of limb muscles in B-Raf mutant embryos.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted a TUNEL staining of WT and B-Raf mutant embryos at E10.5, which did not reveal a significant increase of apoptotic cells suggesting that inactivation of B-Raf did not lead to a major increase of programmed cells death. In addition, we investigated the distribution of B-Raf protein in WT and B-Raf mutant embryos at E10.5. We found that B-Raf is strongly expressed in the dermomyotome of E10.5 WT embryos. As expected, we did not find B-Raf expression in somites of Pax3-Cre//B-Raf mutants.</p><p><italic>Other points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure I</xref> requires clarification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Since re-initiation of cell proliferation occurs several hours later (after 12-16 hours), we concluded that the increase of cells in the scratched area is due to migration and not due to proliferation. We have now clearly indicated the time point when the samples were taken in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, (also 6C) what do the numbers on the vertical axis refer to?</italic> </p><p>The number on the vertical axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> refers to counted nuclei in the scratched fields.

Noco (Nocodazole) is an agent that reversibly interferes with the polymerization of microtubules. U0126 is a small molecule that specifically inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway. Dyna (Dynasore) is a GTPase inhibitor that targets dynamin-1, dynamin-2 as well as Drp1 (mitochondrial) and blocks dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Colch (colchicine) is an alkaloid that binds to tubulin preventing microtubule polymerization. Colchicine inhibits mitosis and endocytosis. MßCD (methyl-β-cyclodextrin) removes cholesterol from cultured and disrupts lipid rafts thus blocks formation of endocytic vesicles. Paclit (paclitaxel) binds to tubulin and disrupts the disassembly of microtubuli thereby preventing mitosis and endocytosis.

In cases where the population is not normal (which is most likely the case, given the low n) non-parametric statistical analysis should be used.</italic> </p><p>We assumed a normal distribution of measurements, which is common practice. In fact, I have rarely seen manuscripts in which normal distributions of measurements were calculated, although the authors used a parametric t-test. However, the reviewers are of course right that such an assumption cannot be taken for granted. We have therefore repeated the calculations using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test leading to essentially the same conclusions, although the significance level was lower in some experiments when compared to parametric t-tests. The corresponding figures were changed accordingly.</p><p><italic>More information on the method of cell counting underlying the graphs in A would be useful. Was this based on counting cell nuclei using DAPI? On the graphs, are the numbers on the left indicating cell number? This should be indicated.</italic> </p><p>C2C12 cells contain single nuclei prior to fusion. We therefore determined the number of cells by counting the number of DAPI-positive nuclei. The numbers at the graphs indicate the relative number of nuclei (or cells), which has been now clearly indicated.</p><p><italic>4) Pax3 is a poor transcription factor in transactivation studies on target promoters or polymerised Pax3 binding sites. It would be interesting to see the effect of CA B-Raf (V600E) on Pax3 target activation</italic> in vitro<italic>, for example on c-Met regulatory elements. If the authors perform such experiments, they should be careful to use the PAX3 binding sites described by Cao et al. in the PAX3-FOXO1A ChIP-seq study.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raised an interesting point, which we were happy to address. We generated a luciferase reporter construct containing two consensus Pax3 binding sites in front of a minimal promoter and performed co-transfection experiments together with a Pax3 expression construct either in the presence of absence of constitutively active B-Raf. Importantly, we observed a dramatic increase in reporter gene activity when constitutively active B-Raf was co-transfected. Co-transfection of WT B-Raf did also stimulate transcription of the reporter construct but to a lesser extent than the constitutively active B-Raf version.</p><p><italic>5) A paper from Yvergoneau et al. (2012) (see also Mayeuf et al., 2016) has shown that when VEGFR2 is knocked out in paraxial mesoderm, muscle progenitors from the lateral dermomyotome do not migrate into the limb bud. This paper thus assigned a seemingly crucial role to endothelial precursors in the subsequent migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. VEGFR2 signals among other things through Raf and the endothelial precursors present in the lateral dermomyotome would certainly be affected in the Pax3-Cre/B-Raf del/del. Can the authors rule out that the effect they observe here is not due to a problem of signaling downstream of Flk1? Obviously, the &quot;inhibition of HGF-mediated migration of myogenic cells by knockdown of Pax3&quot; (subsection “B-Raf regulates muscle precursor cell migration through Pax3 phosphorylation”) is not really a strong argument, since Pax3 is probably upstream of VEGFR2 as well.</italic> </p><p>Our analysis focused on the migration of muscle progenitor cells downstream of Pax3 and B-Raf and not on the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, VEGFR2 (commonly known as Flk1 or KDR) is assumed to signal via the PKC-MAPK and the PI3K pathway although some evidence exists that Flk1 indeed might also activate MAPK via C-Raf and MEK in some cells types. Hence, it does not seem very likely that B-Raf plays a major role downstream of Flk1. Nevertheless, we investigated the possibility that indirect effects of B-Raf in endothelial precursor cells downstream of Flk1 might be important for migration of muscle progenitors into the limb. To approach this problem, we performed immunostaining of WT and B-Raf mutant embryos at E10.5 using antibodies against CD31, which identifies endothelial cells in the developing embryo. Similar to the situation in Pax3 mutant embryos, we did not observe a significant reduction of endothelial cells in B-Raf mutant limbs suggesting that B-Raf does not play a crucial role downstream of Flk1 for migration of endothelial precursor cells.</p><p><italic>6) One should be very cautious about over-expression studies. Although the subcellular fractionation experiments seem to indicate that BRaf goes into the nucleus, it would be important to show data on the purity of these fractions, (the subcellular fractionation technique does not appear to be in the Materials and methods section). The authors indicate that the Met receptor traffics from the plasma membrane to perinuclear endosomes. Is it possible that the IF staining observed with BRaf lights up perinuclear endosomes? Could the authors either nail down this possibility or be more careful on the wording.</italic> </p><p>Of course, the reviewers are right that overexpression studies need to be viewed with caution and are a source of potential artifacts. We have also added an additional sentence to emphasize the limitations of overexpression studies. However, we would like to emphasize that in addition to the overexpression studies we performed co-IPs of endogenous Pax3 and B-Raf and demonstrated the presences of B-Raf in nuclei using sections of embryonic fore limbs. The reviewers might have noticed that we controlled the purity of subcellular fractions by probing for GAPDH (a cytosolic protein) and lamin a/c (nuclear proteins). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the nuclear fractions do not even contain traces of GAPDH indicating that the nuclear fractions are indeed “clean”. We are sorry that we did not describe the method used for subcellular fractionation in the Methods section. We have used the NE-PER kit for cultured cells from Thermo Fischer Scientific for this purpose, which is now described in the Methods section.</p><p>Moreover, we have performed additional confocal microscopy using antibodies directed against B-Raf and the endosomal marker EEA1, which demonstrates that the B-Raf signal in the nucleus is not associated with the endosomal marker (new panel in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution of endosomes, as visualized by staining for EEA1, partially overlaps with the perinuclear accumulation of B-Raf but not with the presence of B-Raf within the nucleus. In addition, we would like to point out that the confocal z-stacks of B-Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) clearly indicate the presence of B-Raf WITHIN the nucleus. Taken together, we believe that we did everything we could to demonstrate the presence of B-Raf within nuclei.</p><p><italic>7) The finding that B-Raf phosphorylates Pax3 at sites located in the octapeptide sequence, a domain previously described as mediating interaction with Groucho repressor proteins suggests a possible interplay between repression and activation. This could be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this hint. Of course, it is possible that phosphorylation of Pax3 by B-Raf in the octapeptide domain results in decreased binding of Groucho repressor proteins thereby leading to increased Pax3 activity. However, we did not investigate this possibility, which needs careful and detailed studies that seem outside of the scope of the current manuscript. Nevertheless, we have added a short paragraph to discuss such a scenario.</p><p><italic>8) In a number of figures, please provide data on the efficiency of siRNAs.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the omission. Of course, we determined the efficiency of siRNA knockdowns for individual target RNAs. We have now state the knockdown efficiencies in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>9) In Met mutants, Lbx1 is induced, indicating that the effects the authors observe</italic> in vivo <italic>are not solely downstream effects of Met. Please discuss.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this hint. We do not claim that B-Raf exerts its effects <italic>solely</italic> by mediating downstream effects of the c-met receptor. It is certainly possible that the downregulation of Lbx1 in B-Raf mutants is due to reduced activity of other pathways, which might explain why Lbx1 expression is reduced in B-Raf but not in c-met mutants as shown e.g. in the paper from (Sachs et al. JCB 150, 1375-1384, 2000). We now discuss this issue in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
