Understanding of the mechanisms that govern germline differentiation lags behind other plant developmental processes. This is largely because the germline is restricted to relatively few cells buried deep within floral tissues, which makes them difficult to study. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a methodology for live imaging of the germ cell lineage within floral organs of Arabidopsis using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. We have established reporter lines, cultivation conditions, and imaging protocols for high-resolution microscopy of developing flowers continuously for up to several days. We used multiview imagining to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of a flower at subcellular resolution. We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing male and female meiosis, asymmetric pollen division, movement of meiotic chromosomes, and unusual restitution mitosis in tapetum cells. This method will enable new avenues of research into plant sexual reproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>flower</kwd><kwd>live cell imaging</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>SPIM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REMAP CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000479</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riha</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomancak</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMBF-FKZ 031B0188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckmann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riha</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Light sheet microscopy was used to establish a method for live imaging of cellular events within Arabidopsis flower and for constructing a 3D model of flower at subcellular resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is characterized by the alternation of haploid and diploid life forms. Transitions between these phases are marked by meiosis, the specialized cell division that produces haploid cells from diploid precursors, and fertilization, when haploid gametes fuse and reconstitute the diploid zygote. In multicellular organisms, this process involves differentiated germ cells that form in dedicated organs. In higher animals, the germline segregates from the soma early during embryogenesis, presumably to permit the emergence of complex developmental processes to form a staggering variety of cells and organs, while protecting the cells destined for reproduction from mutation load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radzvilavicius et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to animals, the germline in higher plants differentiates from somatic cells at late stages of the life cycle. In angiosperms, gametogenesis occurs in the anthers and ovaries of developing flowers, resulting in the formation of pollen and the embryo sac that harbor male and female gametes, respectively.</p><p>Plant germline differentiation includes a number of remarkable cellular events. The formation of the male germ cell lineage begins with the differentiation of pollen mother cells (PMCs) from mitotically amplified sporogenous cells. PMCs undergo meiosis, a reductional cell division in which paired homologous chromosomes segregate in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II. Chromosome segregation during meiosis requires extensive remodeling of the cell cycle machinery to permit recombination of homologous chromosomes during the extended prophase I, co-segregation of sister chromatids and protection of centromeric cohesion in anaphase I, and inhibition of DNA replication in interkinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petronczki et al., 2003</xref>). After meiosis, haploid microspores divide through asymmetric mitosis producing a highly compact generative nucleus and a diffuse vegetative nucleus. This is thought to coincide with epigenetic reprograming of the generative nucleus, which subsequently divides to produce two identical sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). In the female germline, one archesporial cell per ovule differentiates into a so called megaspore mother cell (MMC) that enters meiosis. Three of the four resulting haploid spores degenerate, while the remaining one undergoes three mitotic divisions to form an syncytial female gametophyte with eight nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Further cellularization produces seven-celled mature embryo sac containing two female gametes, two synergids and three antipodal cells.</p><p>Plant reproduction has been extensively studied since the dawn of modern biology. Genetic approaches combined with traditional morphology, histology, and cytogenetics have provided a wealth of data on the genetic framework governing sexual reproduction in model plant species, with the most comprehensive pictures available in Arabidopsis, maize, and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>). This information has been further expanded by transcriptomics and proteomics, though use of these approaches is hindered by difficulties in obtaining pure fractions of germ-cells in sufficient quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Honys and Twell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Pawlowski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sánchez-Morán et al., 2005</xref>). Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics promise break-throughs also on this front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelms and Walbot, 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, further understanding of germline differentiation requires methods allowing description of the accompanying molecular and cellular processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. Live cell imaging represents an important tool for capturing dynamics of cell growth and division, protein expression and localization, as well as responses to environmental and genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roeder et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Live cell imaging has been instrumental in research into root growth and development. Due to its simple structure with stereotypical cell patterning, transparency, and ease of cultivation within microscopy chambers, the root has become a key model for cell biology in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovečka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grossmann et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, relatively little has been done with time-lapse microscopy of cellular processes within the flower. This is because flower imaging is technically much more challenging. Flowers develop on adult plants and reproductive tissues are hidden deep within the floral organs. This challenge has been partially overcome by using semi in vitro systems in which reproductive tissues such as ovules and anthers were dissected from flowers, grown on cultivation media and examined by confocal or multi-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurihara et al., 2013</xref>). This approach enabled live imaging of double fertilization, early embryogenesis, and chromosome pairing during male meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hamamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gooh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feijó and Cox, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheehan and Pawlowski, 2009</xref>). However, these semi in vitro systems have several limitations including a low survival rate of excised tissues, aberrant development which limits duration of live imaging, and altered physiology due to in vitro cultivation that may affect some cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurihara et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, there is a need to develop imaging methods in the context of whole organs or plants. Confocal live imaging of emerging floral buds attached to a short stem embedded in media was described for Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prunet et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, this protocol was modified for live cell imaging of male meiosis in which two anthers in larger buds were exposed to microscopy by removal of a sepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prusicki et al., 2019</xref>). This allowed observation of PMCs for up to 48 hr, although movies longer than 30 hr were usually not informative due to loss of the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prusicki et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful imaging technique for real time visualization of complex developmental processes at subcellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keller, 2013</xref>). In LSFM, a sample is excited with a thin sheet of laser light and the generated single optical section is captured by a perpendicularly oriented detection lens. This arrangement results in low phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Icha et al., 2016</xref>), because only the plane of the specimen that is imaged gets illuminated. 3-dimensional data (3D) are obtained by moving the sample through the light sheet. In some types of LSFM, the sample can be rotated in front of the detection lens to acquire 3D image data of the same specimen from multiple angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huisken et al., 2004</xref>). The LSFM acquisitions are invariably fast because of the entire illuminated plane is captured at once with digital cameras. In combination, these features allow long term imaging of highly dynamic cellular processes within complex biological samples such as developing embryos and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovečka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber and Huisken, 2011</xref>). In plants, LSFM has mainly been used for imaging root growth and development with only sporadic attempts in other plant structures, such as seedlings and flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maizel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ovečka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovečka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grossmann et al., 2018</xref>). Here we describe the establishment of live cell imaging of Arabidopsis flowers and its applications in investigating diverse aspects of plant germline differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3D-reconstitution of the Arabidopsis flower at cellular resolution</title><p>To assess the suitability of LSFM for imaging cellular processes within flowers, we decided to establish a protocol for imaging male meiosis using a lightsheet microscope. Meiosis is cytologically the most easily distinguishable stage of plant germline differentiation. An Arabidopsis flower contains approximately 600 PMCs within six anthers, each harboring four loculi. Meiosis is highly synchronous within a loculus and its onset is tightly coupled to development, typically occurring at flower developmental stage 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma, 2006</xref>). At this stage, reproductive organs are fully enclosed by sepals while petals are still relatively rudimentary structures that do not cover the anthers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth et al., 1990</xref>). To visualize meiosis, we used an Arabidopsis line harboring an <italic>HTA10:RFP</italic> reporter construct that marks chromatin with fluorescently tagged histone H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dumur, 2019</xref>) (Yelagandula and Berger, personal communication, 2019). Growth and development of flowers in plants carrying the construct is comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Floral buds ranging in width from 0.3 to 0.7 mm were detached from inflorescences at the main inflorescence bolt, sepals were carefully removed to expose anthers, and flowers were embedded in low melting point agarose within a capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ovečka et al., 2015</xref>). The capillary was attached to a holder in the microscope and the capillary was rotated to find the best angle for imaging. LSFM showed that the <italic>HTA10:RFP</italic> reporter is uniformly expressed in nuclei throughout the entire flower, including PMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although we used only 10x objectives for imaging, this magnification was sufficient to distinguish the major meiotic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Determination of the cell cycle stage was further guided by autofluorescence in the GFP channel, which allowed visualization of certain cellular landmarks such as the organellar band and cell wall in microspores. We next determined how the width of a floral bud correlates with the presence of individual meiotic stages. This is a very practical parameter which enables pre-selection of appropriate buds based on their size prior to continuing with the rather laborious sample preparation. LSFM micrographs showed that 0.3 mm buds contained mainly pre-meiotic or leptotene PMCs, meiotic divisions were detected in 0.5 mm buds, and microspores with centrally or laterally localized nuclei were present in 0.7 mm buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Two of the six anthers in Arabidopsis are shorter than the others. Our staging experiment indicated that meiosis in the shorter anthers is slightly delayed compared to the remaining four.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Imaging Arabidopsis flower using LSFM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of sample preparation.

To reveal the structure of entire Arabidopsis flowers at subcellular resolution, we generated an Arabidopsis line harboring <italic>H2B:mRuby2</italic> for visualization of somatic nuclei and <italic>ASY1:eYFP</italic> that is expressed specifically in meiocytes. We scanned the flower from eight views differing by 45° increments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Signals from nuclei were used to register all views by the Fiji Multiview reconstruction plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Preibisch et al., 2008</xref>). The registered data were combined into a single output image using a weighted average fusion implemented in the Multivew reconstruction plugin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The resulting 3D-model of the flower showed that while outer structures, such as developing petals and the outer loculi of anthers, were clearly visible, LSFM did not provide sufficient penetration to resolve inner loculi and the pistil. Nevertheless, the 3D model can be rotated to display features that are not apparent from individual scans. For example, we used the ASY1 signal to determine the 3D arrangement of PMCs in outer loculi and applied the spot detection wizard in Imaris to count them automatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The 3D reconstruction permits precise quantification of male germ cells in anther lobes, and in combination with time-lapse imaging, it will enable tracking differentiation of individual germ cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The 3D reconstruction of Arabidopsis flower from multiview imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MIPs of a 0.5 mm floral bud expressing ASY1:eYFP (green) and H2B:mRuby2 (magenta) viewed from eight different angles.

Our next goal was to establish live cell imaging for examining different stages of germline differentiation in the developing flower. The male germline separates from other cell lineages with the formation of sporogenous cells at flower developmental stage seven and its differentiation is completed with the second pollen mitosis resulting in trinuclear pollen at stage 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the entire development of the male germline lasts approximately 7 days, based on the duration of individual stages as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth et al. (1990)</xref>.</p><p>To continuously image germ cells over several days, we had to overcome several technical obstacles. First, we empirically determined that proper development of the detached flower within the capillary requires media with a high sugar content. However, the presence of such rich media in the microscopy chamber quickly led to contamination. We solved this problem by cultivating flowers in a sealed capillary that was submerged in 6% glycerol in the microscopy chamber. The glycerol served to equalize the refractive index of the media in the chamber with the cultivation media in the capillary; using only water resulted in suboptimal images. Under these conditions, we were able to image Arabidopsis floral buds for up to five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). To capture the entire male meiosis, we started with 0.3 mm-wide floral buds of the <italic>H2B:mRuby2 ASY1:eYFP</italic> reporter line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 0 h) and performed continuous imaging in 1 hr increments for over 4 days. ASY1 is expressed in early meiosis where it associates with the axial elements of prophase I chromatin. By diplotene it is depleted from chromatin, forming cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2002</xref>). In our LSFM experiment, the ASY1 signal appeared after approximately 24 hr of imaging and prominently stained PMC nuclei for the next 30 hr. At 55 hr, ASY1 began to form cytoplasmic speckles that persisted in the cytoplasm beyond cytokinesis and tetrad formation at 78 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). This data demonstrates that meiosis was initiated and successfully completed under our experimental conditions. We observed a gradual enlargement of floral organs over the entire period of imaging, indicating that the detached flowers were able to grow and develop within the microscopy chamber. We determined that long-term LSFM imaging has a negligible effect on meiotic progression by comparing imaged flowers with non-imaged controls cultivated under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, this experiment showed that the growth of floral buds cultivated in the capillary is only slightly delayed relative to flowers that developed on plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Time lapse imaging of a growing flower.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MIPs of a flower (upper panel) expressing ASY1:eYFP (green) and H2B:mRuby2 (magenta) and one of its anther lobes (bottom panel) at indicated time points (scale bar 100 µm).

Within this time, PMCs developed from the premeiotic stage to tetrads and microscpores with centrally localized nuclei.

The growth dynamics experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows that on plant, floral bud grows from the size of 0.3 mm to 0.6 mm approximately 84 hr. Thus, floral buds grown on plants and in the capillary reach the same developmental stage after 84 hr and 96 hr, respectively, indicating that cultivation in capillary leads to only a slight delay in anther development. Furthermore, there is no major difference in the development of floral buds that are continuously imaged (S01, S03, and S04) and the controls grown in capillaries outside the microscope (C01-04).

Images of flowers taken at different stages of development showed a prominent signal in vascular tissues within the pistil and a massive activation of auxin signaling in the tapetum in postmeiotic anthers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Furthermore, we detected strong auxin signaling in approximately four cells at the very tips of the anthers.

This is a unique cellular process in which binuclear cells enter mitosis but metaphase chromosomes from the two nuclei form a single metaphase plate; the subsequent anaphase results in two nuclei with a duplicated set of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oksala and Therman, 1977</xref>). The restitution mitosis in tapetum cells occurred asynchronously over an approximately 4 hr window that coincides with the diplotene stage of PMCs.</p><p>Another remarkable event in germline differentiation is the asymmetric pollen mitosis I that occurs approximately 2–3 days after completion of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth et al., 1990</xref>). Because of its poorly defined timing and relatively short duration, pollen mitosis I is difficult to detect by classical cytology in fixed tissues. Entry into pollen mitosis I is preceded by the movement of microspore nuclei from a central to a lateral position. We managed to capture pollen mitosis I by imaging anthers harboring microspores with laterally located nuclei. It occurs relatively synchronously in neighboring microspores and lasts for about 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video3">Figure 5—video 3</xref>). Chromosomes that segregate towards the cell periphery form the generative nucleus, while the less condensed vegetative nucleus arises from chromosomes that move to the cell interior.</p><p>To further explore the utility of LSFM for imaging rapid processes within a flower, we examined the movements of meiotic chromatin that occur during zygotene and which facilitate the pairing of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Link and Jantsch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheehan et al., 2013</xref>).

This experiment highlights two key advantages of LSFM: the ability to capture large cell volumes within relative short time intervals and limited photobleaching; even after 20 min of imaging we did not notice a substantial loss of signal.</p><p>While plant meiosis is an intense area of research, most studies focus on male meiosis while female meiosis remains mostly ignored. There are roughly 50 ovules in the Arabidopsis flower, each of which carries a single MMC that can only be distinguished from the surrounding somatic cells by its central location within the nucellus at the tip of the developing ovule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>). The rarity of MMCs together with their morphological resemblance to somatic cells makes female meiosis experimentally less accessible than male meiosis. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to develop a protocol for live imaging of female meiosis. Because developing ovules are inside ovaries under multiple layers of cells, they are invisible to LSFM in the context of an entire flower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Therefore, we used exposed ovules for imaging. MMCs differentiate later than PMCs and female meiosis occurs at floral stage 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneitz et al., 1995</xref>). We dissected 0.85 mm floral buds by carefully detaching all sepals, petals, and stamens, cut off the stigma, and removed valves to expose ovules attached to the septum. Dissected flowers were embedded in low melting point agarose within a capillary and imaged for up to 24 hr in 10 min increments. We could readily detect MMCs due to the presence of the <italic>ASY1:eYFP</italic> signal and were able to record the first and second meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5">Figure 5—video 5</xref>).

To illustrate the utility of LSFM in protein localization studies, we analyzed the timing of ASY1 expression relative to S-phase. S-phase in Arabidopsis can be monitored by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA exhibits a disperse nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle but forms nuclear foci ranging from small dots to large nuclear speckles during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yokoyama et al., 2016</xref>). Live imaging of pre-meiotic cells expressing <italic>ASY1:eYFP</italic> and <italic>PCNA:TagRFP</italic> markers showed a reorganization of PCNA from a diffused signal to nuclear speckles, which were detectable for approximately 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). Cells with speckles likely represent later S-phase. Cells in early S-phase, characterized by small PCNA dots, could not be clearly distinguished under our imaging conditions. Nevertheless, the duration of the speckle-stage is comparable to mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yokoyama et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the pre-meiotic S-phase is not substantially longer than the S-phase of mitotic cells. This is in contrast to observations in other organisms, where pre-meiotic S-phase was reported to be at least twice as long as mitotic S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2012</xref>).

Our protocol enables visualization of an entire floral bud with subcellular resolution over the period of days. One of the major hurdles in long-term live imaging of multicellular structures is their growth out of the field of view. For example, rapid growth of the root tip, the most favorite cell biology model in plants, limits live imaging by conventional microscopes to several hours. Longer imaging requires more sophisticated solutions with automated tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Wangenheim et al., 2017</xref>). In this respect, developing Arabidopsis flower represents an attractive system to study differentiation of an entire plant organ at the subcellular level. Development of an Arabidopsis flower, from the emergence of the floral primordia until flower opening, takes less than two weeks. During this period, a majority of the cell- and organ-differentiation processes, including formation of male and female germlines, are completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneitz et al., 1995</xref>). A mature floral bud still fits within the field of view of a standard light sheet microscope, which enables continuous recording of long segments of flower development. We routinely performed continuous imaging for up to five days, which is sufficient to capture the entire male and female sporogenesis or the differentiation of tapetum cells.</p><p>A great advantage of LSFM is its flexibility in terms of sample positioning and multiview imaging. This permits the position of the sample to be adjusted in order to acquire the best view of the area of interest. Furthermore, multiview imaging increases the chance of successfully recording the sample even when its orientation changes upon growth during experiment. In addition, it allows 3D models to be built, which can enhance features that are not apparent from a single view. We implemented multiview imaging to reconstruct a 3D model of the Arabidopsis flower at unprecedented resolution and used it to extract information on the number of PMCs within a loculus. When combined with time lapse recording, this approach results in sufficiently detailed datasets for quantitative analysis of 4D morphology of flower differentiation at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel and Smith, 2016</xref>). We found that the 10x objective provides sufficient resolution to visualize Arabidopsis subcellular structures, such as chromosomes, PCNA speckles and axial elements of paired chromosomes. If needed, the resolution can further be increased by using higher magnification objectives (20x). Nonetheless, this requires using higher power of excitation lasers to achieve a similar signal intensity, which may increase phototoxicity. In addition, a higher resolution will generate larger data volumes for downstream processing.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the power of LSFM to provide qualitatively novel information by capturing several cellular processes that were not previously studied by time-lapse microscopy. One of these is the restitution mitosis that leads to polyploidization of tapetum cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oksala and Therman, 1977</xref>). Previous cytogenetic analysis in Arabidopsis could not distinguish whether this polyploidization occurs through endomitosis or restitution mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weiss, 2001</xref>). We have also recorded the entire process of male meiosis in a single movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). The duration of male meiosis was recently determined to be 26 hr from late leptotene to telophase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prusicki et al., 2019</xref>). This study used landmark features of meiotic progression as anchors to compile information from multiple movies covering different segments of meiosis. Here we show that expression of ASY1 is an excellent marker for labeling meiotic cells. ASY1 starts being expressed about 5.5 hr ahead of late meiotic S-phase and is still detectable after tetrad formation. Based on the ASY1 signal, we estimate that the entire meiosis, from the end of S-phase until cytokinesis, lasts about 47 hr. This is longer than 33 hr estimated from a DNA labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>), which warrants further investigation whether the difference reflects used methodology, or whether in vitro cultivation during imaging delays meiotic progression. A unique feature of LSFM that distinguishes it from conventional confocal microscopy is its ability to simultaneously record cells in the entire organ. This opens new possibilities to study phenomena such as the synchrony of meiosis within and between anthers within a flower. Indeed, we recorded a time gradient of chromosome segregation within a loculus, as well as different timing of meiosis between short and long anthers. We have also performed live imaging of female meiosis. Plant male and female meiosis differ in many aspects including rates of recombination, and mutations in numerous meiotic genes have different phenotypic consequences in PMCs and MMCs, but the mechanisms underlying these differences are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melamed-Bessudo et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our successful implementation of a live imaging protocol for female meiosis represents a major advancement for this neglected area of plant cell biology. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LSFM is well suited for live imaging of cellular processes occurring in Arabidopsis flowers and the method developed in this study will be broadly applicable in the research on plant sexual reproduction and flower development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and reporter constructs</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accession Columbia-0 harboring the reporter constructs described below were used in this study.

Sample preparation for light sheet microscopy is illustrated in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>. Floral buds were detached from the main inflorescence bolt and their width was measured under a binocular microscope with a glass ruler (Dalekohledy a mikroskopy, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dalekohledy.com">www.dalekohledy.com</ext-link>). For imaging in open system, samples were prepared according to modified protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ovečka et al., 2015</xref>). Sepals were carefully removed by tweezers and dissected buds were put into capillaries (glass capillary size 4, inner diameter 2.16 mm, Zeiss) containing medium (½ MS, 5% sucrose, pH 5.8) with 1% low melting point agarose (Sigma Aldrich). The capillary was fixed into the standard metal holder for the Zeiss Z1 microscope (Zeiss) and placed directly into the microscope chamber, which was filled with liquid medium (½ MS, 5% sucrose, pH 5.8). For imaging, the solidified medium with the floral bud was pushed out from the capillary in front of the objective. This open imaging system was used for short term imaging (up to 12 hr) and multiview 3D reconstruction. A closed cultivation system within FEP (Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene) tubes was used for long-term imaging. FEP tubes with an inner diameter of 2.80 mm, outer diameter 3.20 mm, and wall thickness of 0.20 mm (Wolf-Technik) were cut into ~4 cm pieces, boiled in the microwave, and sterilized in 70% ethanol. The tube was mounted onto the glass capillary. Medium and sample were placed inside the tube as described for the open system. The piston was removed and the bottom of the FEP tube was sealed using a hot glue gun (Flying Tiger). The capillary with the attached FEP tube was then fixed in a metal holder and placed into the microscopic chamber which was filled with 6% glycerol (refractive index 1.33999, correcting the refractive index of 5% sucrose 1.3403). Glycerol was continually replaced using a peristaltic pump (GE HealthCare) with a flow rate of one chamber volume per hour. The temperature of the microscopy chamber was set up at 21°C. We routinely cultivated flowers in the closed system for up to five days with no exchange of the cultivation media.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-52546-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Preparation of a sample for imaging by LSFM.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging</title><p>Microscopy was performed with the Lightsheet Z1 (Zeiss) using detection objective 10x (0.5 NA W Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.5 M27 75 mm_4934000045), 2.5 zoom and Illumination objective 10x (Illumination Optics Lightsheet Z1 10x/0.2). We used two track imaging (frame fast setting) with 488 nm and 561 nm excitation lasers for GFP/YFP/autofluorescence and RFPs/mRuby2, respectively.

Multi-view reconstruction and multi-view fusion were performed using the Multi-view Reconstruction plugin in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>). The labeled nuclei in one of the two imaged channels were used as fiduciaries to form the descriptors necessary to match and register the views. The parameters for this so-called ‘segmentation-based registration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>) were as follows: Interest points (nuclei) were detected using Difference of Gaussian (sigma = 1.3075, threshold = 0.0244), registered by the Iterative-Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and aligned using regularized affine transformation model (lambda = 0.1). Following the registration, whose quality was accessed by examining the reconstructed volume in Fiji’s BigDataViewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietzsch et al., 2015</xref>), weighted-average image fusion with blending turned on was performed within the Multi-view Reconstruction plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Preibisch et al., 2008</xref>). Before the fusion, the reconstructed volume was cropped to a minimal size. Nevertheless, the size of the image data at full resolution still exceeded the typical RAM available on a Desktop computer. Therefore, the processing was outsourced to a computer node at the IT4Innovation supercomputing center in Ostrava, Czech Republic. In order to facilitate processing on a remote High Performance Computing (HPC) resource, Fiji plugins for remote cluster execution of SPIM multiview reconstruction were deployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmied et al., 2016</xref>).

Light sheet fluorescent microscopy is both much faster and gentler (low bleaching and phototoxicity) than point-scanning optical sectioning techniques like confocal or multi-photon, and has emerged as a powerful tool for live imaging of cellular and developmental processes. LSFM has been extensively used in animals. In plants it has been particularly successful in the study of roots. Early attempts (e.g. Ovecka et al., 2018) at using LSFM to study plant aerial tissues, and flowers met limited success, mostly due to the strong absorption of photosynthetic tissues, which limits the penetration of the light sheet. This is the first study to successfully use LSFM to investigate developmental processes that occur beneath several cell layers in flowers, and that in itself is a major accomplishment. They visualized a number of processes occurring in the buds and inside the floral tissues, including whole-organ growth. They were able to monitor mitotic and meiotic divisions in both the male and female germ lines and made some interesting new observations, such as the restitution mitosis in tapetum cells. They could also monitor changes in protein expression and subcellular localization. Recently a similar, but different, approach was presented in <italic>eLife</italic> (Prusicki et al., 2019) based on confocal microscopy. This other approach provides more resolution, but has two limitations: phototoxicity (short imaging windows) and limited field of view. The approach presented in this new study by the Riha lab is perfectly complementary to Prusicki et al. One might argue that the experimental set up is not really physiological, as the flower buds are removed from the inflorescence, sepals are removed (as well as a carpel valve when imaging female meiosis) and the specimen is embedded in low-density agarose. However, this is not different from most available protocols that have been used to do live cell imaging in flowers, and the authors made sure that, after dissection and embedding, the flower buds kept developing fairly normally.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide further details for sample preparation and imaging. Because light sheet microscopy is less common than, for instance, confocal microscopy, and because it involves fairly challenging sample preparation, providing additional details would be helpful. For example, what capillaries were used (manufacturer, size, what were they made of)? How were the buds inserted into them and when was the solution added? Are the metal holder and the microscope chamber standard for the Zeiss Z1 microscope or were they chosen from a range of choices? Into what-size pieces were the FEP tubes cut? How were they mounted onto a glass capillary? In the &quot;closed system&quot;, was the FEP tube with the sample sealed completely, from both ends? Perhaps adding illustrations or photos of the sample mounting process and of the imaging system to the supplementary materials would be helpful. How was the chamber kept at 21C – is it a feature of the system or some custom modification?</p><p>2) Please address magnification issues, and discuss why you chose a 10X objective. The images showing cellular details of meiosis (e.g. movements of chromosomes and formation of protein speckles) would greatly benefit from higher resolution. Some of the images in Figure 5 to 7 are hard to interpret (although videos definitely help). Would the use of higher-mag objectives – 60x, 100x – be compatible with the setup?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52546.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide further details for sample preparation and imaging.

Would the use of higher-mag objectives – 60x, 100x – be compatible with the setup?</p></disp-quote><p>It is an important issue. The Zeiss Z1 light sheet microscope is usually sold with up to 40x objective and the manufacturer does not recommend purchasing higher magnification, although it is optionally available. The resolution in LSFM is not determined only by detection objectives, but also by the thickness and uniformity of the light sheet. It is technically challenging to produce thin and uniform light sheets in larger specimens (such as a flower), which limits use of high resolution objectives. Therefore, LSFM tends to be used on larger specimens where the desire for the highest possible resolutions is not required, but it is preferred to image fast (and to reduce phototoxicity) and still with reasonable quality.</p><p>Our primary goal was to develop a method for live cell imaging applications. Therefore, phototoxicity was a major issue for us. In our initial experiments we tested 10x, 20x and 40x lenses and found out that 10x lenses provide surprisingly good resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). While we can get slightly better resolution with 20x and 40x objectives, we have to use substantially higher power of excitation lasers and longer scans, which increases phototoxicity (eg with the 10x objective we used 5-10% of laser power, while 40-70% of laser power is required for the 40x lenses). Thus, use of higher resolution objectives may compromise temporal resolution as longer time windows between individual scans may be necessary to limit phototoxicty. Furthermore, scanning the same volume with higher resolution substantially increases amount of data, which is an important consideration for downstream image processing. We now include paragraph in Discussion to make these points (paragraph two).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of different objectives and zooming options.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Field of view when using objectives without zoom (0.36 zoom, upper panel) and with maximal zoom (2.5 zoom, lower panel). <italic>ASY1:YFP HTA10:RFP</italic> flowers were used in the experiment.

For the response to this review, we wanted to perform a rigorous comparison of different objectives on finer subcellular structures (condensed chromosomes, axial elements). Unfortunately, lasers on our LSFM microscope died just before the experiment and waiting for replacement would result in about two months delay in resubmitting the manuscript. Nevertheless, based on our experience we gained so far, we believe that use of 20x lenses may be beneficial in some applications where higher resolution is desired (e.g. studies focused on organization of axial elements or chromosome structures), but one has to consider increased phototoxicity as a trade off. We feel that there is no real point of using 40x lenses – this setting does not seem to provide benefits over conventional confocal microscopy, which still gives better resolution. Thus, choosing appropriate resolution depends on experimental questions and quality of reporter markers. The method we described here should not be perceived as a universal tool for solving all problems in plant cell biology. In many aspects, it is complementary tool to standard confocal microscopy (benefits of LSFM over standard confocal microscopy are discussed in the paper).</p><p>In regards to the interpretation of Figure 7: it is important to realize that the value of live imaging is in providing information in temporal context. Thus, the real informative datasets are supplementary videos. Figures in the main manuscript just attempt to illustrate key points obtained by analyzing the videos. It is true that resolution of chromosomes in Figure 7 is not great, but videos clearly show how chromosome condense and decondense over time. We have now indicated in the Figure 7 chromosomes that are located within one pollen mother cell, so readers can better track how compactness of chromosomes changes over time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
