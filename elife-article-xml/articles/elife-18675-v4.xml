In this study, we have thoroughly characterized a Rab effector domain that is present in proteins of the Mical and EHBP families, both known to act in endosomal trafficking. Within our study, we show that these effectors display a preference for Rab8 family proteins (Rab8, 10, 13 and 15) and that some of the effector domains can bind two Rab proteins via separate binding sites. Structural analysis allowed us to explain the specificity towards Rab8 family members and the presence of two similar Rab binding sites that must have evolved via gene duplication. This study is the first to thoroughly characterize a Rab effector protein that contains two separate Rab binding sites within a single domain, allowing Micals and EHBPs to bind two Rabs simultaneously, thus suggesting previously unknown functions of these effector molecules in endosomal trafficking.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18675.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18675.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Rab effectors</kwd><kwd>Mical</kwd><kwd>EHBP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>Amrita</given-names></name><name><surname>Goody</surname><given-names>Roger S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gazdag</surname><given-names>Emerich Mihai</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Matthias P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1035, project B05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itzen</surname><given-names>Aymelt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB642, project A4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goody</surname><given-names>Roger S</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Matthias P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A human three-helix Rab-binding domain can potentially bind to two Rab proteins simultaneously with different affinities at binding sites generated by gene duplication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rab proteins, the biggest subfamily within the superfamily of small GTPases, are major regulators of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takai et al., 2001</xref>). Like all small GTPases, Rab proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling is tightly regulated and mediated by two families of enzymes: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Additionally, a variety of different effector proteins interact specifically with GTP-bound Rab proteins and mediate their versatile physiological roles in membrane trafficking, including budding of vesicles from a donor membrane, directed transport through the cell and finally tethering and fusion with a target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>). Especially in long-distance vesicular transport processes (e.g. in neuronal axons and dendrites), directed vesicular transport along cytoskeletal tracks appears to be an obvious mechanism and, consistently, different effector proteins have been reported to link Rab proteins to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kevenaar and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One such family of effector proteins that was reported to link Rab proteins and the cytoskeleton is the Mical (molecules interacting with CasL) family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). Most of these Mical proteins contain an N-terminal monooxygenase domain that was reported to regulate actin dynamics via reversible oxidation of a methionine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hung et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, all Mical proteins except the Mical C-terminal like protein (Mical-cL) contain a calponin homology (CH) and a Lin11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain that have been reported to assist the interaction with actin and other cytoskeletal proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giridharan and Caplan, 2014</xref>). Finally, all except Mical-2 contain a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that is also termed domain of unknown function (DUF) 3585 and that is known to interact with different Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giridharan and Caplan, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18675.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain architecture of human proteins containing bMERB domains.</title><p>Besides their C-terminal RBD (referred to as bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab binding (bMERB) domain), most Mical proteins contain an N-terminal Monooxygenase (red), a CH- and a LIM-domain (both orange). EHBPs also contain an actin binding CH-domain and an N-terminal membrane binding C2-domain (yellow) as well as a C-terminal prenylation motif (CaaX-box) following the bMERB domain.

In humans, besides the Mical proteins this includes the family of EH (Eps15-homology) domain binding proteins (EHBPs) and one uncharacterized protein (C16orf45; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, the EHBPs also contain a CH-domain and have been described to couple vesicular transport to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guilherme et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Hitherto, the structural basis and the specificity of interaction between the Rab binding domains of Micals/EHBPs and Rab proteins remained largely unknown. In this publication, we have characterized the interaction of a number of these domains with Rab proteins extensively. Our results indicate preferential binding of this family of effector proteins to Rab proteins of the Rab8 family. Additionally, the results show that at least some of these effector domains can bind two Rab proteins simultaneously, suggesting a possible role as a Rab hub in vesicular trafficking.</p><p>In order to understand the structural basis of the interaction, we solved the first x-ray crystallographic structure of the RBD from the human protein Mical-3 and the first structures of different Rab proteins in complex with the RBDs of Mical-cL in a 1:1 stoichiometry and of Rab10 and the RBD of Mical-1 in a 2:1 stoichiometry.</p><p>This study is the first to show the structural basis of Rab proteins interacting with these RBDs and to systematically characterize the interaction with Rab proteins. Analysis of our data suggests that the second Rab binding site of these RBDs has evolved via a gene duplication event, indicating intriguing and hitherto unknown mechanisms of a concerted action of different Rab-regulated trafficking steps connected by these bivalent effector proteins, which we refer to as “bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab binding” (bMERB) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The study therefore substantially increases our understanding of Rab:effector interactions and will aid future research regarding the function of this diverse effector family.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The bMERB domain preferentially binds Rab8 family proteins</title><p>Previously reported interactions of different bMERB domain containing proteins with Rab proteins included Rab1, Rab8, Rab10, Rab13, Rab15, Rab35 and Rab36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giridharan and Caplan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2010</xref>), although not all possible combinations of the effectors and the different Rab proteins were tested nor interactions quantified.

Additionally, even though all Mical constructs used have a similar molecular weight of ~18 kDa, whereas Mical-1 runs as an apparent monomer in aSEC and binding of a Rab protein induces a clear shift to higher molecular weight, both Mical-3 and Mical-cL run as apparent dimers in aSEC and binding of a Rab protein disrupts the dimer, thus not leading to a shift in retention time upon complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is however not clear at this point whether the dimer formation of Mical-3 and Mical-cL and the disruption of the dimer upon Rab-binding is of functional significance.</p><p>The specificity of effector proteins towards certain Rab families is generally achieved via interaction with regions termed Rab subfamily motifs (RabSFs) 1–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khan and Ménétrey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2000</xref>). In the Rab:Mical-cL structures, we observed extensive interaction of Mical-cL with RabSF1 (Tyr6, Asp7, Leu9, Lys11 in Rab10) and (less interactions) with RabSF2 (Asp31, Ser40 in Rab10). Accordingly, the sequence alignment of different Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) shows strong conservation of the interacting amino acids within these motifs amongst Rab1 (Rab1a/b, Rab35) and Rab8 (Rab8a/b, Rab10, Rab13, Rab15) family members that interact with bMERB domains, but not for other Rab proteins (a comparative scheme of the residues involved in interactions in the different complexes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Since the interacting residues in the RabSF1 and RabSF2 regions are strongly conserved between both Rab1 and Rab8 families, this did not explain the observed preference of the RBD towards the Rab8 family. However, we observed that the main chain atoms of the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif can be traced in the electron density and seem to interact with amino acids within α-helix 1 and 2 of Mical-cL, even though the electron density in this region did not allow a precise localization of the side chains. In contrast to the main interacting helix α3, which adopts a similar position in all three structures, we observed slightly different orientations of the α-helices 1 and 2, adopting a position slightly further away from Rab1 compared to Rab8 and Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, whereas Rab1 contains a glutamate near the N-terminus (Glu4), all Rab8 family members contain one or (in the case of Rab10) two lysine residues in this region that point towards a negatively charged patch in Mical-cL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Additionally, Rab35 contains an Arg residue within this N-terminal region and also displays a slightly higher affinity towards Mical-cL compared to Rab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore tested whether these N-terminal residues of the Rab proteins might determine the specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab8 and its homologues rather than Rab1. We constructed a chimera of Rab1 containing the 4 N-terminal aa of Rab8, thus exchanging the negatively charged glutamate for a positively charged lysine. The x-ray crystallographic structure of this Rab1 chimera (termed Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>) in complex with Mical-cL clearly showed that the helices 1 and 2 move closer and adopt a similar conformation as observed in the structures of Rab8:Mical-cL and Rab10:Mical-cL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Additionally, ITC measurements showed that the chimera had an approximately five-fold increased binding affinity compared to Rab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast to Rab1, the chimera Rab1<sub>R8N</sub> bound both EHBP1 and EHBP1L1 in aSEC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), thus clearly indicating that the N-terminus is important for the interaction and contributes to the observed specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The second Rab binding site has evolved by gene duplication</title><p>Stimulated by the evidence for two Rab binding sites in some bMERB domains (Mical-1, Mical-3 and EHBP1L1), we searched for crystallization conditions of these RBDs with Rabs in a 1:2 stoichiometry.

In addition to the binding site corresponding to the one previously observed in Mical-cL, an additional binding site was identified: Whereas this site is composed of the N-terminal half of the bMERB domain (α-helix 1 and the first half of α-helix 2), the Rab binding site observed in both Mical-1 and Mical-cL comprises the C-terminal half (second half of α-helix 2 and α-helix 3).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18675.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The two Rab binding sites are highly similar.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The structure of Mical-1 in complex with Rab10 shows two molecules of Rab10 bound to Mical-1 at different sites. Whereas one Rab protein binds to α-helix 1 and the first half of α-helix 2 (Mical-1<sub>918-991</sub>, binding site 1, blue), the second molecule of Rab10 binds the second half of α-helix 2 and α-helix 3 (Mical-1<sub>994-1060</sub>, binding site 2, green). Upon superimposition of both binding sites, the strong similarity becomes obvious and the helices from both binding sites adopt very similar positions. Furthermore, the interactions are highly similar in both cases as can be seen in the close-up view on the right (similar Rab-interacting residues within binding site 1 and 2 are shown in blue and green, respectively). (<bold>b</bold>) The strong conservation of interacting residues within both halves of the Mical-1 bMERB domain can also be seen in the sequence alignment of the N- and C-terminal halves. Additionally, the alignment shows that α-helix 1 and the first half of α-helix 2 (binding site 1) correspond to the second half of α-helix 2 and α-helix 3 (binding site 2), respectively (the secondary structure is indicated above and below the corresponding sequences, interacting and conserved residues within binding site 1 and 2 are highlighted in blue and green). (<bold>c</bold>) Whereas the whole bMERB domain of Mical-1 can bind two Rab molecules (left), deletion of either α-helix 1 (middle) or α-helix 3 (right) impairs binding to binding site 1 or 2, respectively.

(<bold>d</bold>) Based on the observations made above, we propose that both binding sites must have evolved from a common ancestor by gene duplication of a 200 bp DNA fragment coding for the original gene product, a single α-hairpin.

The results show that the domains probably constitute a Rab8-effector family involved in endosomal trafficking, and the Rab-binding specificity can be well explained from the 3-dimensional structures of complexes determined in this work. Furthermore, we show that at least some of these domains contain two separate binding sites for Rab-proteins, suggesting previously unknown functions, as discussed below. The strong similarity between the 2 binding sites within one effector domain strongly suggests an evolutionary development via gene duplication.</p><p>The high specificity of the effector domains towards Rab8 family members can be well explained from the structural analysis of Rab:bMERB complexes. Specificity-determining interactions were seen between the effector domains and the RabSF1 and RabSF2 motifs. However, additional interactions were required to increase the specificity even further, thus allowing the proteins to distinguish Rab1- and Rab8-family members. In this regard, we showed that the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif contribute to this specificity, an observation that has previously not been made in other Rab:effector interactions. However, as alluded to in the introduction, the presence of multiple isoforms (e.g. Mical-1, Mical-L1 etc.) of the proteins, as well as the demonstrated presence of two separate binding sites, might also point towards a broader and more diverse Rab-binding spectrum and is the subject of ongoing research in our work.</p><p>The 3-dimensional structures of the effector domains solved in this work showed a solely α-helical fold common to many other Rab effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oesterlin et al., 2014</xref>). Further comparison with other known Rab:effector structures showed that the main interacting helix in Rab:bMERB complexes (e.g. α-helix 3 in Mical-cL) adopts a similar position to that of the main interacting helix in the structures of Rab27:Slp2-a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chavas et al., 2008</xref>), Rab27:Slac2a/melanophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kukimoto-Niino et al., 2008</xref>) and Rab3:Rabphilin-3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> for a comparison). Interestingly, in all three examples, the Arg/Lys contacting Asp45 in our Mical:Rab structures is also conserved in these effector proteins, and the Asp/Asn following this basic residue and contacting Gln61 in Rabs is conserved in both Slp2-a and Slac2a. Intriguingly, these effector domains also display similar binding affinities as bMERB domains towards their cognate Rabs (K<sub>D</sub> = 13.4 nM for Rab27:Slp2-a, K<sub>D</sub> = 112 nM for Rab27:Slac2-a/melanophilin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukuda, 2006</xref>), and these are amongst the highest affinities observed for Rab:effector interactions.</p><p>Both the biochemical as well as the structural analysis identified a second binding site in Mical-1, Mical-3 and EHBP1L1, thus allowing these effectors to bind Rab proteins in a 1:2 stoichiometry. In contrast to the bMERB domain proteins, Rab:effector complexes that were previously characterized display either a 1:1 or 2:2 stoichiometry, where the 2:2 complexes are usually formed by a central effector dimer with symmetrical binding interfaces on both sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oesterlin et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, multivalent Rab effector proteins have been described previously (examples are Rab4 and Rab5 binding to Rabaptin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitale et al., 1998</xref>), Rab6 and Rab11 binding to Rab6IP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2007</xref>) or the extreme case of Gcc185 with five sites binding to Rab1a/b, Rab2a/b, Rab6a/b, Rab9a/b, Rab15, Rab27, Rab30, Rab33, Rab35 and Rab36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>). However, all of these effectors contain separate Rab-binding domains, each in turn only binding one Rab protein. The work presented constitutes the first description of two Rab proteins binding a single effector domain.</p><p>The separate binding sites within one domain not only represent a novel finding for Rab effector molecules, but also suggest intriguing and hitherto unknown functions of these proteins. Such functions could include linking Rab-decorated vesicles to a target membrane or other vesicles via a central bivalent effector. On the other hand, concerted Rab cascades and feedback loops have been observed with effector domains fused to GEFs or GAPs of one Rab acting upstream or downstream of a second Rab, helping to recruit or remove Rab proteins from a certain membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>). Bivalent effectors could act in a similar manner in a positive feedback loop, initially being recruited by activated Rab proteins and subsequently helping in the recruitment and stabilization of further Rabs at this site to establish Rab membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>). In fact, the presence of one high affinity and one low affinity Rab binding site as observed in some bMERB effectors could further enhance the formation of Rab microdomains: Whereas the Rab bound to the high affinity site would essentially stay bound within physiologically relevant timescales, the additional Rab protein recruited by the low affinity site could dissociate again and recruit another effector molecule via the high affinity site, thus helping to concentrate Rabs within small areas on the membrane.</p><p>Additionally and similar to the suggested function of Rab6IP linking Rab6 and Rab11 mediated vesicular trafficking events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2007</xref>), bMERB domain containing effectors might fulfill analogous functions in vesicular trafficking and act as effector Rab hubs. The possible importance of such concerted membrane recruitment cascades of Rabs and other proteins involved in membrane trafficking has been previously highlighted for Mical-L1 connecting Rab35 and Rab8, and this was aptly referred to as a membrane hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rahajeng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giridharan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies on Mical-L2 dependent GLUT4 translocation showed that trafficking was dependent on a concerted action of Rab8 and Rab13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2016</xref>). In another study it was shown that Mical-L1 is recruited to recycling endosomes by Rab35 and subsequently recruits other Rab proteins (Rab8, Rab13 and Rab36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>). In this work, the authors concluded that dimerization of Mical-L1 allows a concerted recruitment and binding of two separate Rabs to an effector dimer. However, our data now show how the 2 separate binding sites presumably also present in Mical-L1 and Mical-L2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) could help in establishing this concerted action of two Rabs by connecting them via one bivalent effector protein in an (intermediate) 1:1:1 complex, thus explaining for the first time the structural and biochemical basis of the Rab hub function. The strong sequence homology of different bMERB domains including both binding sites and the fact that all Rab8 family proteins reported to interact with Micals/EHBPs are implicated in different steps of endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>) as well as previously published data thus points towards an important function of Micals/EHBPs in sorting of endocytic cargo with different destinations in the cell.</p><p>Another possible functional implication of the separate binding sites follows from the observation of an auto-inhibited state within Micals. Previous studies have shown that the bMERB domains in Micals can bind to their CH/LIM domains, forming an auto-inhibited intramolecular interaction that can be released by competitive binding of Rab proteins, thus allowing for the interaction with actin only after binding of Rabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). The structural basis as well as the functional significance of this competitive binding will be an interesting topic for future research, especially regarding the binding region at the RBD responsible for auto-inhibition. The two binding sites might therefore also have separate functions, serving as a membrane recruitment site by Rabs via one site (presumably the high-affinity binding site) and release of the auto-inhibition due to competitive binding of the CH/LIM domains and Rabs at the second binding site.</p><p>In the last part of the study, we have shown that the two binding sites share a strong similarity and bind Rab proteins via similar residues within the interaction surfaces, thus indicating that the RBD have evolved via duplication of a common ancestor supersecondary structure element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Söding and Lupas, 2003</xref>). The underlying single α-hairpin motifs making up the separate Rab-binding sites are known from other Rab-effectors such as Rabenosyn-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khan and Ménétrey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eathiraj et al., 2005</xref>), and the resulting fused α-hairpins observed in Micals and EHBPs strongly resemble the architecture of spectrin repeats, each being connected via one continuous helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pascual et al., 1997</xref>). Because of the strong similarity between the repeats of the different isoforms of Micals and EHBPs, but less similarity between both repeats within the bMERB domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>), we suggest that the duplication must have occurred early in evolution in one common ancestor bMERB domain. The two repeats have since diverged in terms of overall sequence, but the ability to bind Rab proteins has remained in at least some cases, as shown in this study. Exploration of the binding specificity of both binding sites of the bMERB proteins towards Rabs (and possibly other GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rahajeng et al., 2012</xref>]) will therefore be of great interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Rab proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (Rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoebel et al., 2009</xref>] and other Rab proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bleimling et al., 2009</xref>]) and preparatively loaded with GppNHp (Guanosine-5’-[β-γ-Imido]-triphosphat) for interaction studies with their effector proteins.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;bMERB domains are bivalent Rab8 effectors evolved by gene duplication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Reinhard Jahn, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript includes a thorough biochemical and structural characterization of the interaction between Rab8 family proteins and an effector domain shared by the MICAL and EHBP1 protein families. All reviewers agree that the work is of very high quality and that the manuscript is excellent. For these reasons, the reviewers do not request additional experiments but rather ask for considering the (rather minor) issues raised by Reviewers 2 and 3. This also includes a possible change of the title of the manuscript as suggested by Reviewer 3. Please note, however, that none of these suggested changes is mandatory for acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>a) The authors state in the Abstract that their study is &quot;the first to thoroughly characterise a Rab effector domain that contains two separate binding sites&quot;. This is potentially confusing as of course several Rab effectors are dimeric and so contain two separate binding sites in the dimer. The text needs to be clarified.</p><p>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Are all eight proteins from separate genes or are some alternatively spliced transcripts from the same gene? This should be made clear in the text and figure.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The Mical-3 bMERB domain is a dimer in the crystal. Is it also a dimer in solution? Also, is it still a dimer when co-crystalised with the Rabs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>?

All reviewers agree that the work is of very high quality and that the manuscript is excellent. For these reasons, the reviewers do not request additional experiments but rather ask for considering the (rather minor) issues raised by Reviewers 2 and 3. This also includes a possible change of the title of the manuscript as suggested by Reviewer 3. Please note, however, that none of these suggested changes is mandatory for acceptance.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>a) The authors state in the Abstract that their study is &quot;the first to thoroughly characterise a Rab effector domain that contains two separate binding sites&quot;. This is potentially confusing as of course several Rab effectors are dimeric and so contain two separate binding sites in the dimer. The text needs to be clarified.</italic> </p><p>In order to clarify this point we have rephrased the sentence in the Abstract:</p><p>“This study is the first to thoroughly characterise a Rab effector protein that contains two separate Rab binding sites within a single domain, allowing […]&quot;.</p><p> <italic>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Are all eight proteins from separate genes or are some alternatively spliced transcripts from the same gene? This should be made clear in the text and figure.</italic> </p><p>They are all from separate genes. To clarify this we have added the following information in the figure legend:</p><p>“For proteins with multiple known splice variants, domain boundaries are indicated for isoform 1 (Mical-1: Uniprot ID Q8TDZ2, genomic location 6q21; Mical-L1: Uniprot ID Q8N3F8, genomic location 22q13.1; Mical-L2: Uniprot ID Q8IY33, genomic location 7p22.3; Mical-3: Uniprot ID Q7RTP6, genomic location 22q11.21; Mical-cL: Uniprot ID Q6ZW33, genomic location 11p15.3; EHBP1: Uniprot ID Q8NDI1, genomic location 2p15; EHBP1L1 Uniprot ID Q8N3D4, genomic location 11q13.1).”</p><p> <italic>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The Mical-3 bMERB domain is a dimer in the crystal. Is it also a dimer in solution? Also, is it still a dimer when co-crystalised with the Rabs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>? This is an important point which needs to be discussed clearly in the text.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, both Mical-3 and Mical-cL appear to form dimers in solution, whereas Mical-1 does not. However, we can currently not comment on any physiological significance of this. We have added one paragraph in order to clarify this point:</p><p>“Interestingly, the Rab-binding interface in Mical-cL has a substantial overlap with the dimer interface observed in the structure of Mical-3 above. Additionally, even though all Mical constructs used have a similar molecular weight of ~18 kDa, whereas Mical-1 runs as an apparent monomer in aSEC and binding of a Rab protein induces a clear shift to higher molecular weight, both Mical-3 and Mical-cL run as apparent dimers in aSEC and binding of a Rab protein disrupts the dimer, thus not leading to a shift in retention time upon complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is however not clear at this point whether the dimer formation of Mical-3 and Mical-cL and the disruption of the dimer upon Rab-binding is of functional significance.”</p><p><italic>d) Results section: The &quot;non-exhaustive list of conserved interactions&quot; could instead be presented as a table rather than in a long sentence.</italic></p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion we have added <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and changed the manuscript accordingly:</p><p>“A non-exhaustive list and a close-up view of several of these interactions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, respectively.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>As currently written the title implies that bMERB8 proteins are Rab8 effectors, rather than effectors for the wider Rab8 family of GTPases (8/10/13/15).

However, the presence of two separate binding sites implies that (for as yet unknown reasons) these effectors bind two different Rab proteins simultaneously. As we discuss later in the manuscript, this might include functions “in sorting cargo and/or linking different endosomal trafficking pathways regulated by different Rab proteins”, however we have no experimental data at this point that would allow us to do more than speculate.</p><p><italic>Why was Rab35 not investigated? Given the extensive characterisation of interactions with the related Rabs this is an obvious omission.</italic> </p><p>Rab35 was actually investigated, however upon preparative nucleotide exchange of Rab35 with GppNHp, the protein selectively bound and enriched an impurity present in the commercially available GppNHp, the hydrolysis product GppNH<sub>2</sub>. Because of these problems with preparative loading of the protein with GppNHp the data was not included in the first version of the paper.
