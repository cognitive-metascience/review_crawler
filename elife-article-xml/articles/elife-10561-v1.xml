intracellular contractile proteins. However, the molecular cues directing intranodal cell migration remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) produced by LN fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) acts locally to LPA<sub>2</sub> to induce T-cell motility. In vivo, either specific ablation of LPA-producing ectoenzyme autotaxin in FRCs or LPA<sub>2</sub> deficiency in T cells markedly decreased intranodal T cell motility, and FRC-derived LPA critically affected the LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent T-cell motility. In vitro, LPA activated the small GTPase RhoA in T cells and limited T-cell adhesion to the underlying substrate via LPA<sub>2</sub>. The LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis also enhanced T-cell migration through narrow pores in a three-dimensional environment, in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that FRC-derived LPA serves as a cell-extrinsic factor that optimizes T-cell movement through the densely packed LN reticular network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10561.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10561.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10561.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Small organs called lymph nodes are found throughout the body and help to filter out harmful particles and cells. Lymph nodes are packed with different types of immune cells, such as the T-cells that play a number of roles in detecting and destroying bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing microbes. Within the lymph node, T-cells crawl along a meshwork made up of cells called fibroblastic reticular cells. The T-cells appear to move in random patterns, but the signals that drive this movement remain ill-defined.</p><p>Now, Takeda et al. reveal that a lipid called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which is produced by the fibroblastic reticular cells, is responsible for regulating how T-cells move around inside the lymph nodes. T-cells are able to detect LPA via certain receptor proteins on their surface. Takeda et al. engineered mice that were either unable to produce a particular LPA receptor on their T-cells, or that produced less LPA than normal. The T-cells of these mice moved around less than T-cells in normal mice.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that LPA signaling also affects the signaling pathway that alters how well the T-cells stick to nearby surfaces. This suggests that LPA helps to optimize T-cell movement to allow the cells to navigate the small spaces found between the fibroblastic reticular cells. In the future, targeting the processes involved in LPA signaling could help to develop new treatments for disorders of the immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10561.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10561.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Fibroblastic reticular cell</kwd><kwd>Lysophospholipid</kwd><kwd>Lymphocyte migration</kwd><kwd>Lymph node</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24111005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyasaka</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Umemoto</surname><given-names>Eiji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24590252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umemoto</surname><given-names>Eiji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugiura</surname><given-names>Yuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Suematsu</surname><given-names>Makoto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) derived from fibroblastic reticular cells regulates T-cell movement through the densely packed reticular network in lymph nodes in a manner dependent on the LPA receptor LPA<sub>2</sub>-ROCK-myosin II.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood-borne naïve lymphocytes migrate along the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network in lymph nodes (LNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Andrian and Mempel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miyasaka and Tanaka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Girard et al., 2012</xref>). B cells then migrate into LN follicles, whereas T cells remain in the paracortex and migrate continually along the FRC network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajénoff et al., 2006</xref>). This intranodal migration provides critical opportunities for T cells to encounter cognate antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Two-photon microscopic analysis has shown that naïve T cells crawl along the FRC network in an apparently random pattern of motion, at an average velocity of 10–15 μm per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okada and Cyster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Worbs et al., 2007</xref>). FRCs promote intranodal T-cell motility by signaling naïve lymphocytes with CCL21/CCL19 via CCR7, thus activating the small GTPase Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okada and Cyster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Worbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faroudi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), although CCR7 signaling only partially account for the interstitial T cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okada and Cyster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>LPA is a bioactive lysophospholipid produced both extracellularly and intracellularly. Extracellularly produced LPA is involved in such diverse biological functions as vascular remodeling and cell growth, survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yanagida et al., 2013</xref>). Intracellularly produced LPA is an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids, and thought to act as a 'housekeeper' inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Extracellular LPA is predominantly produced by autotaxin (ATX, also referred to as ENPP2 [ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2]), an ectoenzyme that was originally identified as a tumor-cell motility-enhancing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stracke et al., 1992</xref>). ATX is a lysophospholipase D that produces LPA by hydrolyzing lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okudaira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moolenaar and Perrakis, 2011</xref>). We and others have reported that ATX is strongly expressed in HEV endothelial cells (ECs), and that ATX regulates lymphocyte migration into the LN parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Umemoto et al., 2011</xref>). We also demonstrated that LPA enhances lymphocyte detachment from ECs and promotes lymphocyte transmigration across the HEV basal lamina, at least in part by acting on HEV ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). LPA also acts on naïve T cells to induce chemokinesis and cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katakai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).While a study using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that ATX/LPA promotes intranodal lymphocyte motility in an ex vivo LN explant model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katakai et al., 2014</xref>), the physiological significance of the ATX/LPA axis in interstitial lymphocyte migration remains unknown.</p><p>To date, six LPA receptors (LPA<sub>1</sub>–LPA<sub>6</sub>) have been identified. LPA receptors couple to multiple G proteins, including G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>12/13</sub>, G<sub>q</sub>, and G<sub>s</sub>, and upon ligand binding, these G proteins activate diverse intracellular signaling components including Rho and Rac. Although LPA<sub>2</sub> has recently been reported to play a role in intranodal T-cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowlden et al., 2014</xref>), it remains unclear how LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling affects interstitial T-cell motility and whether LPA is the prime activating ligand.</p><p>Leukocyte migration in a confined environment is regulated at least partly by cell contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobelli et al. (2010)</xref> reported that a contractile protein, myosin IIA, is required for T-cell amoeboid motility in confined environments such as LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobelli et al., 2010</xref>). Myosin IIA cross-links actin, thus limiting surface adhesion and allowing T cells to exert contractile force. Myosin IIA’s activity is regulated by RhoA and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling. While the cell-extrinsic factor(s) that regulate myosin II’s activity during T-cell migration in a confined environment have been poorly defined, a recent study using zebrafish germ progenitor cells showed that LPA induces cell polarization in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner, which enables rapid cell migration in a confined environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, by using mice conditionally deficient for the LPA-generating enzyme ATX in FRCs and those deficient in LPA<sub>2</sub>, we demonstrated that bioactive LPA species are produced by FRCs in an ATX-dependent manner and that LPA acts locally on LPA<sub>2</sub> on T cells. This LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling activates the RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway and promotes confinement-optimized interstitial T-cell migration. The FRC-derived LPA thus serves as a cell-extrinsic factor that optimizes T-cell movement through the densely packed LN reticular network, to fine-tune T-cell trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FRCs express the LPA-generating enzyme ATX in a lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)-signaling-dependent manner</title><p>Although CCR7 ligands are reported to stimulate intranodal T-cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okada and Cyster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Worbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), they are not sufficient to account for effective T-cell migration in LNs. Given that ATX, which generates the motogenic lysophospholipid, LPA, is expressed in HEV ECs to modulate lymphocyte motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2013</xref>), we speculated that ATX and its product LPA are also expressed in other stromal cell subsets in the LN parenchyma and may control intranodal lymphocyte migration. Indeed, a recent paper showed that ATX is expressed in CCL21<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> stromal cells in LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katakai et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore subdivided the CD45<sup>-</sup> LN stromal cells into four stromal subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>Enpp2/Autotaxin</italic> was readily detected in GP38<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> FRCs as well as GP38<sup>-</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> blood endothelial cells (ECs), with negligible expression in lymphatic ECs and double-negative cells. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that ATX was expressed in the FRCs surrounding collagen fiber bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, analyses using <italic>Ccl19</italic>-Cre x <italic>R26</italic>-EYFP mice, which constitutively express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in FRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 2013</xref>), revealed that <italic>Enpp2</italic> was selectively expressed in LN FRCs but not splenic FRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This <italic>Enpp2</italic> expression was apparently dependent on LTβR signaling, because blocking LTβR signaling significantly reduced expression of <italic>Enpp2, Cxcl13</italic>, and <italic>Ccl19</italic>, but not <italic>Icam1</italic>, in FRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This blockade also downregulated transcription of HEV marker genes such as <italic>Glycam1</italic> and <italic>Ccl21</italic> in BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2005</xref>).

A similar increase was also observed when purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results suggest two possibilities for the role of LPA<sub>2</sub>: one is that LPA<sub>2</sub> negatively regulates the entry of T cells into LNs across HEVs, and the other is that LPA<sub>2</sub> promotes intranodal T-cell motility and hence their egress from the LNs. To test these hypotheses, we co-injected differentially labeled WT and <italic>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells and examined their intranodal localization after 90 min by whole-mount LN analysis. Among the donor T cells in the LN parenchyma, <italic>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT T cells localized in the vicinity of HEVs (within 50 μm distance) at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), indicating that LPA<sub>2</sub> plays a minor role in T cell entry into LNs across HEVs.

To directly assess the involvement of the LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling in T-cell egress from LNs, we blocked the T cell entry by injecting anti-L-selectin antibody MEL-14 intravenously (T = 0 hr), and measured the number of WT and <italic>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells residing in the LNs 23 hr after the injection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, the blockade of T cell entry (T = 23 hr) resulted in reduction of the cellularity in LNs and increased the ratio of <italic>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells to WT cells compared to that before the injection. These results indicate that retention of <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficient T cells was seen even after blockade of lymphocyte ingress to LNs and are compatible with the hypothesis that <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficiency leads to T cell retention in the LN parenchyma without affecting lymphocyte migration into LNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling regulates intranodal T-cell migration</title><p>To verify that LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling is required for intranodal T-cell motility, we next compared the intranodal migration of <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficient and WT T cells.

Lymphocyte migration in such confined environments is influenced by a delicate balance between actin polymerization/cell adhesion and actomyosin contraction/cell de-adhesion. In this study, we demonstrated that LPA is generated ATX-dependently by FRCs in the LN parenchyma, and that the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signal activates Rho/myosin II in T cells. LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling enhances T-cell migration in confined 3D collagen matrices and promotes interstitial T-cell migration in LNs in a manner dependent on FRC-derived LPA. These results strongly suggest that the LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis critically regulates the confinement-optimized T-cell motility in LNs.</p><p>We previously reported that ATX and LPA are produced by HEV ECs and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study, we found that ATX is also generated by LN FRCs, in agreement with another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katakai et al., 2014</xref>), and that multiple LPA species are present in the LN parenchyma; in particular, we showed that LPA (18:1), LPA (18:2), and LPA (20:4) are produced in the paracortex in a manner dependent on FRC-derived ATX. The enzyme ATX has substrate specificity for LPCs with different acyl-chain lengths and saturations. Recombinant mouse ATX prefers LPC species with relatively short, unsaturated acyl chains, and produces LPA (18:2), LPA (16:0), LPA (20:4), and LPA (18:1) but not LPA (18:0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yukiura et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this observation, crystal structural analysis revealed that ATX accommodates LPA (18:1) and LPA (18:3) but not LPA (18:0) in a stable conformation in its hydrophobic pocket, accounting for ATX's preferences for the number of unsaturated bonds of LPC (18:0 &lt; 18:1 &lt; 18:3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishimasu et al., 2011</xref>). While LPA (18:0) signals were detected in the LN parenchyma, they were ubiquitously found in other tissues independently of ATX expression; these signals are likely to represent intracellularly produced LPA, an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>), which is relatively inert in activating LPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandoh et al., 2000</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that multiple biologically relevant LPA species (18:1, 18:2, 20:4) are produced by FRCs, which may in turn act locally on LPA receptors expressed by adjacent lymphocytes.</p><p>Lymphocyte morphology and migration modes adjust according to the microenvironmental context. T-cell motility on a 2D surface requires integrin-mediated adhesive forces and detachment from the integrin substrates, whereas the 3D T-cell motility in LNs only partially requires LFA-1-mediated interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woolf et al., 2007</xref>). Jacobelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacobelli et al., 2009</xref>) reported that lymphocytes are not restricted to adhesion-dependent motility in 3D environments, and that myosin IIA controls T-cell motility modes—including amoeboid motility, which is dependent on the degree of confinement of 3D environment, and prevents excessive adhesions on non-integrin substrates. In our in vitro model, LPA limited T-cell adhesion area on the fibronectin- and ICAM-1-coated substrate, and promoted chemokine-induced T-cell migration across 3-μm but not 5-μm filter pores and also in a confined collagen gel via LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling. This enhanced migration was inhibited by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or the myosin II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin. In vivo, the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> axis promoted intranodal T-cell migration even in the absence of interaction between LFA-1 and its ligand. These findings indicate that LPA acts on LPA<sub>2</sub> to enhance T-cell motility in chemokine-rich, confined environments at least partly independently of integrin-mediated adhesion or de-adhesion, and this enhancement depends mainly on ROCK/myosin IIA activity.</p><p>The importance of LPA<sub>2</sub> in lymphocyte motility is suggested in recent findings by Knowlden et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowlden et al., 2014</xref>) indicating that <italic>Lpar2</italic> deficiency in lymphocytes is associated with inefficient lymphocyte movement within LNs, although it was not shown how LPA<sub>2</sub>-signaling affects lymphocyte migration and what kind of cells provide the ligand for LPA<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, we showed that LPA activated the Rho GTPase in T cells via LPA<sub>2</sub>, promoting chemokine-induced T-cell migration across 3-μm- but not 5-μm-pore filters in vitro. We further demonstrated that FRC-derived LPA signaled T cells through LPA<sub>2</sub> to sustain optimal T-cell motility in the LN parenchyma. Thus, LPA appears to serve as a cell-extrinsic factor regulating myosin II activity in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and the LPA<sub>2</sub>/ROCK/myosin II signaling pathway is critical for T-cell migration in the confined LN parenchymal environment. In addition, we showed that transferred <italic>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells accumulated in LNs more abundantly than WT counterparts 1.5–2 hr after the cell transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas Knowlden et al showed that <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficiency did not affect T-cell trafficking to LNs significantly 42 hr after cell transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowlden et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown previously that intravenously injected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells swiftly migrate into LNs and a majority of them reside there for only about 12 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mandl et al., 2012</xref>) before they enter the circulation. Therefore, at the time point used by Knowlden et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowlden et al., 2014</xref>), labeled T cells in LNs might have included those that have re-entered into LNs.</p><p>We and others previously reported that LPA locally produced by HEV ECs regulates constitutive lymphocyte transmigration across HEVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This raises the question of whether LPA produced in the HEV area also affects T-cell motility in the LN parenchyma. In this regard, we are currently investigating the effect of EC-specific ATX ablation on lymphocyte behaviors within LNs but do not yet have a definitive answer. Concerning the question of whether LPA produced in the LN parenchyma would affect T-cell extravasation from the HEVs, we found comparable lymphocyte migration across HEVs in <italic>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccl19</italic>-Cre <italic>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (unpublished observation). Given that <italic>Ccl19</italic>-Cre mice express transgenes in FRCs and in the mesenchymal cells ensheathing HEV ECs, but not in HEV ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 2013</xref>), and that biologically relevant LPA species were produced near HEVs at comparable levels in <italic>Ccl19</italic>-Cre <italic>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), it appears that ATX produced outside HEVs plays a minor or dispensable role in the lymphocyte transmigration across HEVs.</p><p>While B cells expressed high levels of <italic>Lpar2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), adoptively transferred <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficient B cells were not retained in the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since B cells, like T cells, showed chemokinesis in response to LPA in an LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner (unpublished observation), B cells may possess functional downstream elements for LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signals. However, whether their intranodal motility depends on motogenic factor(s) other than LPA requires further investigation.</p><p>Naïve T cells continuously search for antigen-bearing dendritic cells in the FRC-rich paracortex, and their random migration creates critical opportunities to encounter cognate antigens. It is possible that LPA promotes immune responses by increasing the T cells' chances of encountering dendritic cells. Once activated by TCR stimulation, T cells reduce their migration speed and S1P<sub>1</sub> expression, and thus gain time to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells within the LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwab and Cyster, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, TCR activation is reported to downregulate LPA<sub>2</sub>expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowlden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2002</xref>), which might reduce the velocity of the T cells and allow them to achieve proper activation.</p><p>Taken together, our work offers direct evidence that multiple biologically relevant LPA species produced by FRCs in an ATX-dependent manner act locally on LPA<sub>2</sub> on T cells. This LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling activates the RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway and promotes confinement-optimized interstitial T-cell migration in LNs at least partly in an integrin-independent manner. Thus, the LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis is an attractive pharmacological target for novel strategies to control immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Japan SLC.

One way to address this issue in vivo is to transfer WT and LPA<sub>2</sub> KO T cells into WT mice, followed by functional blocking of LFA-1 and intravital imaging of lymphoid tissue.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this valuable comment. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we intravenously transferred WT and LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficient T cells, and monitored their migration by intravital two-photon microscopy before and after injecting functional blocking antibody against LFA-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-J</xref>, the blockade of the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 significantly attenuated the motility of WT T cells as reported by others (Katakai et al., JI 2013; Soriano et al., JI 2011, Woolf et al., Nature Immunol. 2007). In the absence of the integrin-ligand interaction, LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficiency reduced T-cell motility, and the extent of reduction in T-cell velocity (19.9 ± 5.5%) and motility coefficient (43.5 ± 16.8%) was comparable to that observed in the presence of the integrin interaction (15.8 ± 4.4% and 43.0 ± 13.6% reduction in velocity and motility coefficient, respectively). These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling promotes T cell motility in LN at least partly in an integrin-independent manner. We added the description in the last paragraph of the subsection “LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling regulates intranodal T-cell migration”. As described below, however, the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> axis appears to affect T cell adhesion on the surfaces coated with LFA-1-ligand or fibronectin.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should perform static adhesion assays to fibronectin and ICAM-1 to confirm that adhesion is affected in LPA<sub>2</sub> KO T cells, as suggested by data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>We analyzed the adhesion of LPA<sub>2</sub><sup>-/-</sup> T cells on the substrate coated with ICAM-1 or fibronectin by TIRF microscopy under static conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, LPA limited the cell surface adhesion area of WT cells on the ICAM-1-coated substrate, which was inhibited by the pretreatment of cells with blebbistatin. This LPA’s effect was not observed in LPA<sub>2</sub><sup>-/-</sup> T cells, which was also the same with cell adhesion to the fibronectin-coated substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-C</xref>). We also observed that LPA induced morphological changes in T cells in an LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner on both fibronectin- and ICAM-1-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, E</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling modulates T cell contact with substrates coated with LFA-1 ligand or non-ligand molecule. We described the results in the third paragraph of the subsection “LPA enhances T-cell migration across narrow pores in an LPA<sub>2</sub>/Rho-dependent manner”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should show that the LPA-effect on T cell 3D migration in a collagen matrix is dependent on ROCK/myosinII (for example by using blebbistatin and the Rho kinase inhibitor).</italic> </p><p>Following this comment, we examined the dependency of ROCK/myosin II in the LPA-mediated T cell motility in a collagen matrix and found that LPA-induced T cell motility was abrogated by the treatment of T-cells with blebbistatin or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and the results are described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “LPA enhances T-cell migration across narrow pores in an LPA<sub>2</sub>/Rho-dependent manner”.</p><p><italic>4) Knowlden et al. (2014) have reported that LPA<sub>2</sub> deficiency does not affect steady state T cell homing to lymph nodes. The authors need to compare their results to this published data in the paper and provide an explanation to why they see increased LPA<sub>2</sub><sup>-/-</sup> T cell numbers in lymph nodes in their homing assay (e.g. timepoint differences).</italic> </p><p>We analyzed T cell migration into LNs 1.5-2 h after injecting donor cells, whereas Knowlden et al. performed their analysis 42 h after the injection. It has been reported previously however that, upon intravenous injection, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells swiftly migrate into LNs and a majority of them reside within the LNs for only about 12 h (Mandl JN et al. PNAS, 109: 18036-41, 2012) before they enter the circulation again. Therefore, at the time point used by Knowlden et al, labeled T cells in LNs might have included those that have re-entered the LNs. Thus, analyses at earlier time points would reflect the bona fide cell trafficking into LNs more precisely. We discussed this issue in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>5) The interpretation of the egress data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>/F is highly speculative because distance from HEVs cannot be assigned to an egress phenotype. If the authors wish to conclude that there is difference in retention time, they have to use different experimental setups. For instance, analysis of T cell number after 24 hr (approximately half of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are expected to have exited; Tomura</italic> et al. <italic>PNAS 2008) combined with CD62L blockade at 2-4 hr post-T cell transfer would be a proper experiment. Alternatively, they may want to re-phrase the text accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this comment. Following this suggestion, we analyzed WT and LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficient T cell numbers at 23 h after the injection of CD62L antibody into the mice, into which the WT and LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficient T cells were injected 2 h before the antibody administration (T=0 h). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, the blockade of T cell entry (T=23 h) increased the ratio of LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficient T cells to WT T cells compared to that observed before injection. These results indicate that retention of LPA<sub>2</sub><sup>-/-</sup> T cells was seen even after blockade of lymphocyte ingress to LNs and are compatible with the hypothesis that LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficiency leads to T cell retention in the LN parenchyma without affecting lymphocyte migration into LNs. We have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and described in the Results section (subsection “Adoptively transferred <italic>Lpar2</italic>-deficient T cells are retained in LNs”).</p><p><italic>6) On a general note, the authors show too many &quot;representative&quot; experiments.
