Here, we provide the solution structures of its two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in complex with short RNA. In addition, we show by NMR that both RRMs of hnRNP A1 can bind simultaneously to a single bipartite motif of the human intronic splicing silencer ISS-N1, which controls survival of motor neuron exon 7 splicing. RRM2 binds to the upstream motif and RRM1 to the downstream motif. Combining the insights from the structure with in cell splicing assays we show that the architecture and organization of the two RRMs is essential to hnRNP A1 function. The disruption of the inter-RRM interaction or the loss of RNA binding capacity of either RRM impairs splicing repression by hnRNP A1. Furthermore, both binding sites within the ISS-N1 are important for splicing repression and their contributions are cumulative rather than synergistic.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

gene expression is a tightly regulated process in higher organisms, which involves a large variety of RNA-binding proteins that associate with newly transcribed messenger RNAs. Among them, hnRNP A1, one of the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins, participates in a wide range of nucleic acid processing events, and hence constitutes a major regulator of gene expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He and Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jean-Philippe et al., 2013</xref>]). For instance, hnRNP A1 participates in the processing of micro-RNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guil and Cáceres, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Michlewski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury and Michlewski, 2012</xref>), in the biogenesis and maintenance of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LaBranche et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flynn et al., 2011</xref>), in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fukuda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campillos et al., 2003</xref>) and in nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Piñol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reed and Hurt, 2002</xref>). However, the best-characterized function of hnRNP A1 resides in its extensive implication in constitutive and alternative splicing, where it generally acts as a splicing repressor in enhancing exon skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mayeda and Krainer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cáceres et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>HnRNP A1 plays a decisive role in the splicing regulation of exon 7 of the survival motor neuron (<italic>SMN</italic>) genes. This splicing event is critically associated with the neuromuscular disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and is one of the most studied examples of a splicing regulated exon. SMA originates from a deletion or a mutation within the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, which impairs the production of the SMN protein. The <italic>SMN2</italic> gene is nearly identical to <italic>SMN1</italic> but fails to rescue the inactive <italic>SMN1</italic> because a critical C-to-U change at position 6 of exon 7 strongly weakens exon 7 splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cartegni and Krainer, 2002</xref>). This C-to-U change transforms an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) into an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cartegni and Krainer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kashima and Manley, 2003</xref>). As a consequence, the large majority (80%) of the transcripts originating from <italic>SMN2</italic> lacks exon 7, resulting in an unstable protein product. The gene still produces 20% full-length transcripts and hence some functional SMN protein necessary for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">1997</xref>). The <italic>SMN2</italic> gene is a major modulator of the severity of SMA. Increasing the amount of functional SMN protein by restoring an <italic>SMN1</italic>-like splicing pattern in <italic>SMN2</italic> is a very promising approach for SMA treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hua et al., 2010</xref>). Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting a strong intronic splicing silencer (ISS) at the beginning of intron 7 (named ISS-N1), which contains a bipartite motif bound by hnRNP A1, have been shown to enhance <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hua et al., 2007</xref>) and in SMA mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hua et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2015</xref>). This ASO has successfully passed a clinical research program for the treatment of children with SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiriboga et al., 2016</xref>) and has recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of SMA licensed under the name SPINRAZA (Nusinersen).</p><p>The mechanisms by which hnRNP A1 participates in splicing are numerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mayeda and Krainer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchette and Chabot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eperon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Okunola and Krainer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tavanez et al., 2012</xref>). It involves direct binding along the mRNA precursor (pre-mRNA) by specific recognition of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. This is achieved by the N-terminal part of the protein, also referred to as unwinding protein 1 (UP1), which contains two closely related RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) responsible for the specific RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maris et al., 2005</xref>). The RRMs are followed by a glycine-rich C-terminal region (G-domain) with both protein- and RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cartegni et al., 1996</xref>). While not essential for RNA binding, the G-domain has been shown to be critical for correct splice site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchette and Chabot, 1999</xref>) and to be involved in liquid droplet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, it is required for cooperative RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>) that can be directional in the 3´−5´direction and extend over tens of bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Okunola and Krainer, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although the two RRMs are highly alike (35% identical and 60% similar), they are neither redundant nor functionally equivalent. Indeed, chimeric proteins constructed by duplication, swapping or deletion of the RRMs affect hnRNP A1 alternative splicing properties differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayeda et al., 1998</xref>). However, it is unclear which specific properties render hnRNP A1 RRMs non-equivalent. So far, hnRNP A1 RRMs have not been studied independently, which impeded a proper description of their individual particularities essential for understanding hnRNP A1 behavior in splicing.</p><p>HnRNP A1 RRMs are interacting with one another and adopt a single defined orientation, as observed by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shamoo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barraud and Allain, 2013</xref>). Since RRMs are asymmetric binding platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maris et al., 2005</xref>), the mode of RNA binding is strongly restricted by the relative orientation of the RRMs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barraud and Allain, 2013</xref>]). Structural insights into the RNA-binding mode of hnRNP A1 are mostly derived from the structure of UP1 bound to single-stranded telomeric DNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). In this structure, two symmetry-related molecules of UP1 interact to form a dimer that binds two strands of DNA in an anti-parallel manner, each strand extending across the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). This peculiar topology could be the result of crystal packing forces or might only be relevant for the binding of hnRNP A1 to telomeric DNA repeats. While a recent structure of UP1 in complex with an RNA trinucleotide has given insights into RNA recognition by hnRNP A1 RRM1, no RNA was observed bound to RRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>). Hence the question of the RNA-binding topology of hnRNP A1 RRMs in solution remains open, especially when encountering a long RNA. In that case, it remains to be determined whether the two RRMs can bind simultaneously to the same pre-mRNA without dimerization.</p><p>To address those questions, we studied each RRM of hnRNP A1 in isolation and showed that both RRMs have similar sequence-specificity and affinity. But while RRM2 specifically recognizes three nucleotides, RRM1 is able to recognize a longer motif. We also investigated how hnRNP A1 RRMs bind the ISS-N1 RNA and showed that both RRMs can bind this RNA simultaneously, RRM2 binding its 5´part. This RNA-binding topology directly depends on the relative orientation of the two RRMs and we showed that disrupting the inter-RRM interface impairs hnRNP A1 function in splicing. We also showed that both RRM binding sites within ISS-N1 are important for <italic>SMN</italic> splicing repression and that their binding contributions are cumulative rather than synergistic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Initial binding studies of hnRNP A1 RRMs with small RNA motifs</title><p>In order to better characterize the differences in terms of specificities of each RRM, we decided to study each hnRNP A1 RRM in isolation. We thus performed NMR titrations of the isolated RRMs with several short RNA ranging from 6 to 8 nucleotides, each containing a core AG dinucleotide central for hnRNP A1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Manan and Williams, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The RNA sequences were derived from the SELEX motifs for full-length hnRNP A1 or for isolated RRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>) as well as from known hnRNP A1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, among the different RNA sequences that we tested, we could find for each RRM one RNA sequence where complex formation is in the slow exchange regime, indicative of a strong binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez et al., 2011</xref>). For RRM1 this was observed with 5´-UUAGGUC-3´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and for RRM2 with 5´-UCAGUU-3´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These RNA sequences differ slightly from the SELEX high affinity selected sequence (5´-UAGGGA/U-3´) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>) obtained with full-length hnRNP A1, and from the single-stranded DNA motif of telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>). Note that our binding sequence for RRM2 is found at the 3´ end of several of the selected sequences obtained with a SELEX done with RRM2 in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>). We therefore decided to structurally characterize hnRNP A1 RRMs in complex with these two RNAs binding in slow exchange.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the solution structure of hnRNP A1 RRM1 bound to 5´-UUAGGUC-3´ RNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NMR ensemble.

Overall, the structure is similar to the crystal structures of UP1 bound to (5´-TTAGGG-3´)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>).

A<sub>3</sub> adopts an <italic>anti</italic> whereas G<sub>4</sub> adopts a <italic>syn</italic> conformation similarly to the conformations observed in the UP1-DNA complexes. However, this differs from the recently reported crystal structure of UP1 RRM1 bound to a short RNA (5´-AGU-3´) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>), where the adenine adopts a <italic>syn</italic> conformation which could be influenced by the fact that the adenine is at the 5´-end of the oligonucleotide. Importantly, the particular orientation of the A<sub>3</sub>G<sub>4</sub> dinucleotide onto RRM1 positions the 2-amino group of G<sub>4</sub> to hydrogen-bond with the 2´-hydroxyl oxygen of A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This intramolecular hydrogen bond might be in part responsible for the pronounced preference of both hnRNP A1 and UP1 for single-stranded RNA versus DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nadler et al., 1991</xref>). In 10 conformers of the ensemble, the side chain of Arg55 is contacting the phosphate group bridging A<sub>3</sub> and G<sub>4</sub>, similarly to the UP1-DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). The flanking nucleotides U<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>5</sub> are recognized via interactions with the side chains of Glu85 and Lys87 for U<sub>2</sub>, and Asp42 and Arg92 for G<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). Although U<sub>1</sub> is not specifically recognized, its position is relatively well defined in the structural ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), possibly due to an interaction with the aromatic ring of Phe23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The nucleotides at the 3´ end, U<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>7</sub>, are not interacting with RRM1 and are therefore highly disordered in the structural ensemble.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NMR structure of hnRNP A1 RRM2 in complex with 5´-U<underline>CAG</underline>UU-3´</title><p>We solved the solution structure of hnRNP A1 RRM2 in complex with 5´-UCAGUU-3´ with 2253 NOE-derived distance restraints including 111 intermolecular ones.

Overall, the structure is similar to UP1 RRM2 bound to (5´-TTAGGG-3´)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>). The central A<sub>3</sub>G<sub>4</sub> dinucleotide stacks onto Phe108 and Phe150 of the RNP motifs and is recognized via a set of hydrogen-bonds from the backbone atoms of Lys179 and Leu181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). A<sub>3</sub> adopts an <italic>anti</italic> conformation whereas G<sub>4</sub> is <italic>syn</italic>. Similarly to RRM1, the 2-amino group of G<sub>4</sub> forms an hydrogen-bond with the 2´-hydroxyl oxygen of A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In 14 structures of the ensemble, Arg146 is contacting the phosphate group bridging A<sub>3</sub> and G<sub>4</sub>, as seen in the crystal structures of UP1-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, the side chain of Met186 in helix α3 stacks over the A<sub>3</sub> ring. This base is therefore sandwiched between Phe108 and Met186. Note that helix α3(Lys183-Ser191) folds into an α-helix only upon binding to RNA. This folding event explains the large chemical shift variations seen for this entire region upon RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This event is driven by the Met186, as shown by the much smaller changes found with a M186A variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The upstream nucleotide C<sub>2</sub> is not specifically recognized but is bound by RRM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The C<sub>2</sub> ring stacks to both the main-chain of Gly111 and the side-chain of Glu176. Glu176 does not hydrogen bond with C<sub>2</sub> unlike its equivalent residue in RRM1. The carbonyl O2 of C<sub>2</sub> also interacts with the side chain of Arg178 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In a few conformers of the structural ensemble, the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr167 is within hydrogen-bond distance from the 4-amino group of C<sub>2</sub>. This provides a pyrimidine-specific contact since the hydroxyl is capable of acting as a hydrogen-bond donor in case of a uracil. Finally, U<sub>1</sub> is not well defined in the structure unlike what was found in RRM1. The NMR signals from the corresponding region in RRM2 (β1-α1 loop) are absent from both the free and bound spectra, reflecting a conformational dynamic for this loop. As a consequence, intermolecular contacts between this region and U<sub>1</sub> cannot be observed in solution, although intermolecular contacts were seen to the equivalent of U<sub>1</sub> in the structure of UP1-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). The nucleotides at the 3´-end, U<sub>5</sub> and U<sub>6</sub> are not interacting with RRM2 and are therefore highly disordered in the structural ensemble. Finally, the side chain of Arg140 is potentially interacting with the phosphate group bridging G<sub>4</sub> and U<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), since this contact is observed in eight conformers of the ensemble.</p><p>Combining our NMR study with the known structural and biochemical information on hnRNP A1 RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Manan and Williams, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruun et al., 2016</xref>), we can decipher that the optimal RNA-binding motifs should be: 5´-YAGG-3´ and 5´-YAGN-3´ for RRM1 and RRM2, respectively, where Y is a pyrimidine and N any nucleotide. Interestingly, motifs of in vivo targets of hnRNP A1 can be fairly different (see for instance the ISS-N1 binding sites 5´-CAGCAU-3´ and 5´-UGAAAG-3´ in the context of <italic>SMN</italic> pre-mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2008</xref>] or the binding sites in <italic>SKA2</italic> exon 3 recently identified by iCLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruun et al., 2016</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RNA specificities and preferences of each individual RRM of hnRNP A1</title><p>Therefore, in order to further confirm or infirm our NMR-derived RNA-binding consensus for each RRM, we measured the affinity of the isolated RRM1 and RRM2 for RNA sequences varying at the two positions flanking the AG core using ITC.

Mutation of Arg92 or Asp42 also resulted in an affinity decrease by 10- and 3-fold, respectively. This confirmed the RRM1 preference for a guanosine 3´ to the AG core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Our structural analysis suggested that Phe23 may contact U<sub>1</sub> and contribute to the RNA-binding affinity. Removal of the side-chain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) as well as shortening or elongating the RNA at the 5´ end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), showed that Phe23 does not contribute significantly to RNA binding for these sequences, at least in terms of detectable affinity.</p><p>Similarly for RRM2, removing contacts to the phosphate backbone by mutating Arg140 led to a two-fold lower affinity underlining its importance for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Also, confirming the contribution of helix α3 for RNA binding, mutation of Met186 resulted in a 3-fold affinity drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). A role for Tyr167 in recognizing C<sub>2</sub> could not be confirmed by ITC, since removal of the hydroxyl group (Y167F) has no effect on RNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Our structure helps in understanding how RRM2 can accommodate a C at the position preceding the AG core. While a U is specifically recognized by Glu176 via a direct hydrogen-bond to the base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>), when a C is present Glu176 stacks under the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Note that as for RRM1, RRM2 prefers a U at this position (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and our complex with RRM2 was thus not determined with the RNA having the best affinity. It had however the optimal exchange properties in terms of NMR and structure determination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our ITC measurements with the isolated RRMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) allowed us to propose simple rules regarding the RNA-binding preferences of the RRMs of hnRNP A1. First, both RRMs have a preference for the 5´-UAGG-3´ motif, which was indeed present in many RNAs found by SELEX or iCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruun et al., 2016</xref>). Second, both RRMs are tolerant to accommodate a cytosine 5´ to the AG core, extending the recognition motif to 5´-U<sub>/C</sub>AGG-3´. Finally, RRM2 is less affected by the replacement of the guanosine 3´ of the AG core than RRM1. Overall, the optimal recognition motif for RRM1 can be finalized as 5´-U<sub>/C</sub>AGG-3´ and for RRM2 as 5´-U<sub>/C</sub>AGN-3´.</p><p>Importantly, for all these ITC measurements, RRM2 appears to consistently have a higher affinity than RRM1. However, the available structures of UP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that the inter-RRM linker (IRL), which is missing from our RRM1 construct, may be equivalent to RRM2 helix α3. We therefore measured the affinity of each RRM in the context of UP1. To do so we prepared mutants of the RNP residues, which are critical for binding the core AG dinucleotide. Mutants UP1-R1r2 (F108A/F150A with RRM2 mutated) and UP1-r1R2 (F17A/F59A with RRM1 mutated) were then titrated with different RNA sequences. In this context, both RRMs have now very similar affinities for all the tested sequences. The affinity of RRM1 for all oligonucleotides was significantly increased (over 5-fold) while RRM2 kept the same affinity for RNA in both contexts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.012</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Isolated RRMs compared with RRMs in the context of UP1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25736.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25736.012</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.013</object-id><label>Table 4—source data 1.</label><caption><title>ITC measurements of protein variants with 5´-UUAGUU-3´.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25736.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25736.013</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25736-table4-data1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD3-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.014</object-id><label>Table 4—source data 2.</label><caption><title>ITC data for evaluation of RNA specificity and affinity of the RRMs of hnRNP A1 in the context of UP1.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25736.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25736.014</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25736-table4-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="2" valign="top">UP1 R1r2</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">RRM1</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">UP1 r1R2</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">RRM2</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">K<sub>d</sub> (nM)</th><th valign="top">N</th><th valign="top">K<sub>d</sub> (nM)</th><th valign="top">N</th><th valign="top">K<sub>d</sub> (nM)</th><th valign="top">N</th><th valign="top">K<sub>d</sub> (nM)</th><th valign="top">N</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">UUAGGUC</td><td valign="top">47 ± 2</td><td valign="top">1.02 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">288 ± 16</td><td valign="top">0.99 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">56 ± 4</td><td valign="top">1.02 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">64 ± 8</td><td valign="top">1.09 ± 0.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UCAGGUC</td><td valign="top">171 ± 12</td><td valign="top">0.97 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">543 ± 33</td><td valign="top">0.90 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">178 ± 11</td><td valign="top">0.90 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">129 ± 11</td><td valign="top">1.01 ± 0.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UUAGUU</td><td valign="top">105 ± 8</td><td valign="top">1.05 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">3000–9000</td><td valign="top">0.97 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">142 ± 9</td><td valign="top">0.99 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">125 ± 9</td><td valign="top">1.04 ± 0.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UCAGUU</td><td valign="top">578 ± 40</td><td valign="top">1.11 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">&gt;10’000</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">637 ± 39</td><td valign="top">1.05 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">541 ± 33</td><td valign="top">1.04 ± 0.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UAAGUU</td><td valign="top">658 ± 44</td><td valign="top">1.05 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">3000–9000</td><td valign="top">0.97 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">685 ± 42</td><td valign="top">1.01 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">543 ± 31</td><td valign="top">1.04 ± 0.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">UGAGUU</td><td valign="top">654 ± 50</td><td valign="top">1.09 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">3000–9000</td><td valign="top">0.99 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">625 ± 41</td><td valign="top">1.04 ± 0.05</td><td valign="top">546 ± 31</td><td valign="top">0.93 ± 0.05</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn5"><p>Values are reported as means ± standard error (S.E.).

After fitting with a 1:1 binding model the obtained N-values of our ITC measurements were robustly ~1. This is indicative of a 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex. Intriguingly, RRM1 in the context of UP1 appears less affected by the replacement of the G following the AG core (~2 fold drop in affinity; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) than in the isolated RRM1 construct (at least 10-fold drop in affinity; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). We cannot rationalize this point, especially because all structures of hnRNP A1, including ours, show multiple specific contacts of RRM1 with this guanine. Apart from this particular point, the preferences observed for the RRMs in isolation as described above are preserved in the UP1 context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Investigating the topology of RNA binding onto hnRNP A1 RRMs</title><p>Using ITC and NMR titrations, we have shown that each individual RRM of hnRNP A1 interacts with RNA motifs of 3 to 4 nucleotides and that both RRM1 and RRM2 have a strong preference and a similar affinity for 5´-UAG-3´ in the context of UP1. However, it remains to be determined how the two tandem RRMs of hnRNP A1 organize themselves when binding longer pre-mRNA stretches. Is only a single RRM binding to the RNA or can both RRMs bind simultaneously? Is there a given directionality? We therefore investigated the topology of binding of hnRNP A1 RRMs to a natural intronic splicing silencer containing two adjacent hnRNP A1 binding motifs. We chose the major regulator of <italic>SMN2</italic> pre-mRNA splicing, that is, the so-called ISS-N1, which is present in intron 7 of <italic>SMN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2008</xref>). It embeds two AG dinucleotides separated by a short spacer of 9 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We titrated ISS-N1 RNA with UP1 and monitored complex formation with NMR. Although both RRMs are seen to interact with ISS-N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), some signals at the binding interface disappeared upon RNA addition. This is indicative of a complex in intermediate exchange for which structure determination is difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez et al., 2011</xref>). We then optimized the sample towards a more favorable exchange regime for structure determination by NMR by minimally mutating either the RNA, the protein, or both, taking advantage of our work with the individual RRMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, we introduced guanines downstream of the AG core dinucleotide to increase the affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), creating the RNA mutants ISS-N1-c14g, ISS-N1-u25g, and ISS-N1-14g25g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alone, this approach was not sufficient to recover narrow NMR line-widths (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and Appendix 2 for details). Since it is not necessarily the complex with the best affinity that will give the best NMR signals, we then took the opposite approach of weakening the overall affinity of the complex with the protein mutant UP1-R140A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Combining this protein mutant with the previous RNA mutants gave NMR spectra of much improved quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), especially for the double mutant ISS-N1-14g25g and the single mutant ISS-N1-u25g. In addition, a detailed analysis of these NMR titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>) strongly suggested that RRM1 binds to the 3´-motif of ISS-N1 irrespective of the point mutations introduced in the RNA and therefore RRM2 binds the 5´-motif (See Appendix 2 for details).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Titration of ISS-N1 variants to UP1 R140A variant.</title><p>Overlays of 2D (<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H)-HSQC spectra of the free UP1 R140A variant (blue) and UP1 R140A in the presence of 1 equivalent of ISS-N1 variants (red).

Overall we observed 87 unambiguous intermolecular protein-RNA contacts with the assigned nucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Unfortunately, due to severe resonance overlap we were limited in our assignments of the RNA resonances. Nevertheless, the obtained network of intermolecular contacts clearly supports the topology of RNA binding suggested by the NMR titrations. Indeed, the residues from RRM1 display many intermolecular contacts to the 3´-end of ISS-N1, namely to A<sub>22</sub>A<sub>23</sub>G<sub>24</sub>G<sub>25</sub> and residues from RRM2 to the 5´-end, namely C<sub>11</sub>A<sub>12</sub>G<sub>13</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).</p><p>However, the determined RNA-binding topology depends strongly on the correctness of the RNA assignments, which were only partial. Hence, to independently confirm our results, we measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments with a nitroxide spin-label attached to the 3’-end of the RNA. For this purpose, we left the two RNA binding motifs unchanged, namely the C<sub>11</sub>A<sub>12</sub>G<sub>13</sub> motif for RRM2 and the A<sub>22</sub>A<sub>23</sub>G<sub>24</sub>G<sub>25</sub> motif for RRM1, and placed a 4-thio-uridine spin-label downstream of G<sub>25</sub>. The spin-label should not perturb RNA binding at this position, but it should affect the resonances of the RRM binding the 3´-AG motif. We know from our structures of the single RRMs, that the spin-label should be capable of sampling multiple conformations resulting in the perturbation of a large area on one side of the domain. In addition, to exclude that the R140A mutation influences the binding topology, the PRE data were also recorded for the modified ISS-N1 bound by UP1 wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>HnRNP A1 RRMs are looping out RNA with RRM2 binding the 5´-motif and RRM1 the 3´-motif.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data from a spin label attached to a 4-thio-U nucleotide near the 3´-end of the ISS-N1 for (<bold>A</bold>) UP1-R140A protein bound to the modified ISS-N1 and (<bold>B</bold>) UP1-WT bound to the same modified ISS-N1.

Comparison of the spectra of the oxidized <italic>vs.</italic> reduced spin label shows that the signals affected by the presence of the paramagnetic probe originated mostly from RRM1 and the interdomain linker matching perfectly our previous experimental data. We observe this local perturbation in RRM1 and the interdomain linker for both UP1 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Altogether, this constitutes an independent evidence that UP1 binds to the ISS-N1 using both RRMs, and that RRM1 binds to the 3´ AG-motif and RRM2 to the 5´ AG-motif, as schematically represented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, these results represent the first clear demonstration that two RRMs of the same hnRNP A1 molecule can bind the same RNA molecule simultaneously. Combining all the structural information obtained on this complex, we could build a structural model showing how hnRNP A1 RRMs can assemble on the same pre-mRNA stretch (see Appendix 2 for details). Our structural model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) differs strongly from the crystal structure of hnRNP A1 RRMs bound to telomeric DNA repeats, where hnRNP A1 dimerizes and binds to two distinct DNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), and where RRM1 binds the 5´-end of a DNA molecule and RRM2 the 3´-end of another DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). With our structural model, the antiparallel organization of hnRNP A1 RRM1 and RRM2 imposes a looping of the RNA molecule, such as suggested for other hnRNP family members with interacting RRMs adopting a single defined orientation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barraud and Allain, 2013</xref>]). To adopt this mode of binding, the RNA spacer between the 3´- and 5´-motifs must be sufficiently long. In the case of the ISS-N1, the RNA spacer between the two AG motifs is 9-nucleotide long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). With various calculations of structural models where we reduced the length of the RNA spacer, we could see that due to topological constraints, the RNA spacer between the two AGs must be at least 4-nucleotide long (see Appendix 2 for details).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The relative orientation of the hnRNP A1 RRMs is essential for its function in cells</title><p>Previous research has underlined the importance and regulatory function of the ISS-N1 for <italic>SMN2</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2008</xref>), and while it has been shown that the two RRMs of hnRNP A1 have distinct roles in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayeda et al., 1998</xref>), our structural work does not prove that the two RRMs effectively bind the bipartite ISS-N1 in vivo.</p><p>Our structural investigation of the mode of binding of the ISS-N1 by hnRNP A1 hints at the importance of both RRMs for interacting with the RNA. For RRM1 to bind with high affinity, the IRL must be positioned such as to sandwich the RNA together with the β-sheet surface of RRM1. This proper positioning of the IRL is achieved by RRM2 contacting RRM1 through a network of interactions including two salt bridges (Arg88-Asp157 and Arg75-Asp155)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barraud and Allain, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>). If the inter-RRM orientation is linked to the function, any disruption of this interaction should impair hnRNP A1 splicing regulation. We therefore prepared an R75A/D157K double-mutant (hnRNP A1 INT1), as well as a D155R/D157K double-mutant (INT2) of FLAG-tagged hnRNP A1. This latter mutant was extended to include an I164A mutation (INT3), which alters the hydrophobic contacts on one end of the interface. For the INT1 double-mutant, we chose not to mutate Arg75 to Asp or Glu, as this might not preserve the cis-Pro76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pal and Chakrabarti, 1999</xref>). Using NMR, we could show that the mutations interfere with the RRMs’ interactions. The determined correlation time τ<sub>c</sub> suggests a significant disruption of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is also reflected by the chemical shift changes observed at the RRM interfaces for the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the mutations do not render the RRMs fully independent (the changes in τ<sub>c</sub> are modest), possibly due to a strong topological constraint imposed by the IRL.</p><p>Wild-type and mutant hnRNP A1 constructs were co-transfected together with an <italic>SMN1</italic> minigene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hua et al., 2007</xref>) into HEK293T cells.

We observed some differences in the amounts of hnRNP A1 in the nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, hnRNP A1 R1r2 is consistently lower expressed.

Although in this context overexpressed hnRNP A1 can also bind to the ESS located in exon 7, its interaction with ISS-N1 was shown to be crucial for splicing of the exon. Indeed, the therapeutic ASO blocking the access of hnRNP A1 to ISS-N1 on <italic>SMN2</italic> (SPINRAZA (Nusinersen)) had a very strong effect on exon 7 inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, to maximize our chance to observe an effect on splicing and better understand the mode of action of this drug, we decided to work with the <italic>SMN2</italic> construct. Protein overexpression levels were again assessed by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) and correspond to our observations of the hnRNP A1 co-transfections with <italic>SMN1</italic>.</p><p>In the absence of hnRNP A1 overexpression, we can observe 36% exon 7 inclusion for <italic>SMN2</italic> WT, which can be significantly lowered to 24% upon hnRNP A1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). Removal of the RNA-binding ability of a single RRM impairs splicing repression (R1r2 49%, r1R2 40%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). However, while r1R2 has a tendency to have no impact on exon 7 inclusion compared to no hnRNP A1 overexpression, the R1r2 mutant results in an even higher exon 7 inclusion. For our experiments in the <italic>SMN1</italic> system the high constitutive exon 7 inclusion precludes any observation of a similar kind, although hnRNP A1 r1R2 was consistently observed to lead to a slightly lower exon 7 inclusion than hnRNP A1 R1r2. Overall, hnRNP A1 overexpression reduces exon 7 inclusion to a minimal level in both <italic>SMN1</italic> and S<italic>MN2</italic>. Additionally, the dominant negative effect observed for the RRM2 mutant in the context of <italic>SMN2</italic> splicing suggests that the RRMs are non-equivalent and that both RRMs of hnRNP A1 are required for <italic>SMN</italic> exon 7 splicing repression. Our structural data proposes the simultaneous binding of both RRMs to the ISS-N1. If binding of two molecules of hnRNP A1 to the ISS-N1 involves each an RRM (similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Shamoo, 2004</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), co-transfection of hnRNP A1 R1r2 and hnRNP A1 r1R2 could in theory rescue splicing. In support of our model, we could not observe any rescue of hnRNP A1 function when co-transfecting with the two RRM mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Mutation of both AG core dinucleotides to AA (ISS-N1-13a24a) raises as expected <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion to 61%. Overexpression of hnRNP A1 can still reduce the level of exon 7 inclusion (45%) but not to the same level as in the wild-type <italic>SMN2</italic>-minigene (24%). Removal of either the upstream or downstream AG (ISS-N1-g13a, ISS-N1-g24a) also increases exon 7 inclusion to 48% and 46%, respectively. This can be partially suppressed to 32% and 30%, respectively, by hnRNP A1 overexpression for both ISS-N1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). To be sure that this observation did not result from a fortuitous enhancer element creation by our mutations, we checked our sequence with ESEfinder for known SR protein binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cartegni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), which did indicate that none were introduced. Similar to the wild-type ISS-N1, hnRNP A1 r1R2 has no effect on exon 7 inclusion levels when compared to the control transfection, whereas hnRNP A1 R1r2 overexpression leads to significantly higher inclusion. This pattern holds over all three ISS-N1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).</p><p>The effect observed for the ISS-N1-13a24a mutant is approximately the sum of the effects of the two single-substitutions, suggesting an additive rather than a synergistic effect of the two motifs for splicing repression. The same holds true when hnRNP A1 is overexpressed, with the RNA double-mutant being less efficient for targeting a splicing repression by hnRNP A1 than the single mutants. Altogether, this shows that both RNA-binding sites of the ISS-N1 are equally important for splicing repression of exon 7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The spacer length does influence exon 7 inclusion</title><p>As stated before, our structural model suggests that a minimal spacer of at least 4 nucleotides is necessary to allow binding of both RRMs of a single hnRNP A1 molecule to ISS-N1. Therefore, we tested the effect of shortening the 9-nucleotide spacer by steps of 2 nt (ISS-N1 −2 to ISS-N1 −8 mutants) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>).</p><p>Transfection of the <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene containing the 2-nt deletions showed a significant increase in exon 7 inclusion for ISS-N1 −6 and ISS-N1 −8. In contrast the ISS-N1 −2 and ISS-N1 −4 <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene mutants showed no aberration of the splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>), although this is only observed in the absence of any overexpression of hnRNP A1. In the presence of hnRNP A1 overexpression, even under a minimal one nucleotide spacer, the ISS-N1 remains a strong response element. Likely because both binding sites are preserved. In support of our model, splicing repression by hnRNP A1 via the ISS-N1 tends to be less effective when the spacer spans less than four nucleotides.</p><p>Altogether, our splicing functional data in cells are in perfect agreement with the proposal that a single hnRNP A1 molecule recognizes both AG-motifs of ISS-N1 using both RRMs (RRM2 binding upstream and RRM1 binding downstream) in a context where both RRMs interact intramolecularly as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we investigated the RNA-binding properties of hnRNP A1 RRMs, and particularly, the RNA-binding mode of hnRNP A1 to the ISS-N1 motif that silences splicing of the <italic>SMN</italic> pre-mRNAs. We could show that both RRMs can bind ISS-N1 in vitro, with RRM2 binding the upstream AG motif. Structure-based mutations and splicing assays in cells are consistent with this mode of binding. Altogether, our findings have important implications for understanding the RNA-binding mode of hnRNP A1 and its mechanism of action in splicing regulation as discussed below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>RNA-binding topologies of hnRNP A1 RRMs</title><p>In this work, we could determine the optimal recognition motif for RRM1 and RRM2 as 5´-U/<sub>C</sub>AGG-3´ and 5´-U/<sub>C</sub>AGN-3´, respectively. The same preference was found by Jain and co-workers using HTS-EQ on the HIV ESS3 hnRNP A1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jain et al., 2017</xref>). Their consensus motif of 5´-YAG-3´ also favored a G immediately 3´ to the motif. Together this matches our findings for a strong preference of 5´-UAG-3´, which can be extended to 5´-U/<sub>C</sub>AGG-3´ for a wider description of the preference. This can explain the increased predilection of hnRNP A1 for <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 caused by the C-to-U mutation at position 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kashima and Manley, 2003</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of the crystal structure of UP1 bound to telomeric DNA repeats, a dimerization of hnRNP A1 RRMs was proposed for binding longer RNA stretches and/or to distant RNA-binding motifs on pre-mRNAs such as alternative 5´-splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). We could show here that hnRNP A1 RRMs can bind to RNA containing two AG-binding sites without dimerization. This simultaneous binding of the same RNA by the tandem RRMs loops out the linker RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). In addition, we show that hnRNP A1 binds ISS-N1 with a directionality, RRM2 contacting the 5´ motif and RRM1 the 3´ one. The mutations that we have introduced in the protein and/or the RNA to improve the quality of the NMR data could potentially influence this mode of binding. The protein mutant UP1-R140A is however unlikely to influence UP1’s topology of binding. The affected side chain does not make sequence specific contacts with the RNA and only reduces the affinity of RRM2 by 2-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In the case of the RNA mutant ISS-N1-u25g, the mode of binding determined with the protein mutant is preserved with the wild-type protein, as revealed by the spin-label experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, as far as we could judge from our NMR titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and Appendix 2), the mode of binding determined here is rather insensitive to variations in the RNA sequence that is recognized. Indeed, several point mutations in the RNA that could potentially affect the binding of one or the other RRM did not appear to change the binding topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that directionality is probably driven by additional contacts from the protein towards the linker RNA. Any binding motifs separated by spacers of a similar length as ISS-N1’s down to four nucleotides could potentially be accommodated in the same manner based on our structural model and our splicing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). While a shorter spacer would prevent the simultaneous binding of both RRMs, a different situation has to be considered for very long spacers. It is perfectly conceivable that hnRNP A1 RRMs could bind to such RNA-motifs simultaneously, but it is rather unlikely that the directionality observed here would be the only one occurring in such situations. This new information can be very helpful to design new ASO therapeutic oligos preventing hnRNP A1 binding to pre-mRNA such as the one developed against SMA (SPINRAZA (Nusinersen)). Our study explains why this FDA approved drug is so efficient in blocking A1 recruitment on ISS-N1 as it targets both RRM binding sites.</p><p>The question still stands on whether dimerization of UP1 monomers may be the preferred mode for binding to telomeric DNA in cells or at least in solution. Experimental evidence could so far not provide a firm answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>). However, in the case of RNA stretches from natural pre-mRNAs, the mode of binding determined here for ISS-N1 is likely to be found in many regulatory binding sites of hnRNP A1. Indeed, since the spacer length gives some leeway to combine either very close or relatively distant RNA-binding motifs, a situation with optimal or sub-optimal hnRNP A1’s binding motifs that associate to build a longer regulatory sequence for both RRMs of hnRNP A1 is certainly occurring many times in pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruun et al., 2016</xref>). As a matter of fact, since individual RNA-binding motifs for single RRMs are short (from 3 to 4 nucleotides), it is highly probable to find two binding motifs next to each other, if one does not shorten the length of the spacer too much. CLIP data for hnRNP A1 as well as other multi-RBD containing proteins might be differentially re-examined in this light, to take into account that binding can occur to a bipartite motif spaced by at least four nucleotides. However, only further structure-function studies with other RNA-targets can reveal whether the mode of binding observed here can be generalized to other hnRNP A1 binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Together, the two tandem RRMs form the functional RNA-binding platform of hnRNP A1</title><p>The close interaction between RRM1 and RRM2 of hnRNP A1 governs how RNA is bound and recognized by the individual RRMs. High affinity binding of RRM1, can only be reached by supplementing RRM1 with the IRL. The importance of this interplay is reflected by the strong evolutionary conservation of both RRM1 and the IRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayeda et al., 1998</xref>). The additional contacts provided by the IRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>) help increasing the RNA-binding affinity of RRM1 by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of a guanine 3´ to the AG core motif is no longer necessary to reach nanomolar affinity.</p><p>It is the inter-RRM interaction that defines and constrains the IRL. Hence, disruption of this interface impedes hnRNP A1 function as a splicing repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Comparable observations have been made upon disruption of the RRM3-RRM4 interface of PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lamichhane et al., 2010</xref>). In previous experiments, out of several chimera, only the double-RRM2 hnRNP A1 construct tested by Mayeda <italic>et al.</italic> was as active as hnRNP A1, most probably because RRM2 is an independent domain and has the same RNA binding properties as within UP1 or hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayeda et al., 1998</xref>). However, to observe such a result it is crucial for the single RRM2 construct to contain the C-terminal helix. Constructs excluding α3 in isolated RRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levengood et al., 2012</xref>) or UP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shamoo et al., 1994</xref>) or with mutations preventing the folding of α3 (M186A, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>) perform similarly to RRM1 in isolation in terms of affinity decrease.

Further less specific binding can occur at the U1 snRNA binding site and extend well into exon 7, where it could join with the hnRNP A1 bound to the ESS motif at position 6 of exon 7. Accordingly, it is known that the distance of the ISS-N1 in respect to exon 7 is important and that moving it further downstream weakens its repressive character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, in a severe SMA mouse model a modified U1 snRNA targeted to bind just downstream of the ISS-N1 can rescue exon 7 splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rogalska et al., 2016</xref>) in agreement with a competition between hnRNP A1 and U1 snRNA for binding at the very start of intron 7. Spreading in the 3´-to-5´ direction could originate from the position of RRM2 at the 5´-end of ISS-N1. Oligomerization of hnRNP A1 along the <italic>SMN2</italic> pre-mRNA is likely to be mediated not only by RRM-RNA binding but also by the G-domain which could interact with other hnRNP A1 molecules and RNA. Hence RRM2 could then be crucial to bring the G-rich tail near the RNA 5´-end to spread from there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together we show that hnRNP A1 splicing repression of <italic>SMN</italic> strongly depends on both RRMs, which must bind RNA, and that the architecture and organization of the two RRMs of hnRNP A1 strongly influences its function.

Reaction progress was followed by checking the s<sup>4</sup>U absorbance at 320 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ramos and Varani, 1998</xref>). The spin-labeled RNA was purified with two successive NAP-10 columns (GE healthcare). Protein-RNA complexes at 0.2 mM were formed at a 1:1 ratio and (<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H)-HSQC spectra were measured before (paramagnetic sample) and after reduction of the spin-label with the addition of 2 mM ascorbic acid (diamagnetic sample). Backbone chemical shift assignment of the complexes was inferred from the assignment of the UP1-R140A:ISS-N1-u25g complex. Residues with a ratio of the intensity in the oxidized or paramagnetic state over the intensity in the reduced or diamagnetic state (I<sup>para</sup>/I<sup>dia</sup>) lower than 0.7 were considered as affected by the presence of the spin label.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Modeling of the UP1-R140A:ISS-N1-u25g complex</title><p>Protein resonances in the complex were assigned using standard methods. The RNA anomeric and aromatic proton signals were assigned using 2D TOCSY and various 2D NOESY spectra (See Appendix 2 for details). Next, using a filtered NOESY experiments measured on a <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein in complex with an unlabeled RNA, we could determine the unambiguous intermolecular NOE for the assigned nucleotides (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref> for a summary of the assigned protein RNA intermolecular NOE).

Models were selected based on their energy of interaction at the protein-RNA interface (including the Van der Waals and the electrostatic terms of the CNS energy function restricted to the inter-molecular interactions). The lowest energy model was chosen for figure preparation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal Inc, Wolverton Mill, UK). Optical density absorbance at 280 and 260 nm was used to determine the concentrations of proteins and RNAs, respectively. Samples were prepared in NMR buffer (replacing 1 mM DTT with 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The measurements were performed using the protein as titrant and the RNA as titrate. All measurements were taken at a cell temperature of 30°C over (40-)44 injections, each 6 µL, with a spacing time of 300 s and a filter period of 2 s. The reference power was set to 10 µCal/s and the initial delay to 60 s. The data was analyzed using the software Origin version 7.0 (MicroCal Inc) and a 1:1 binding model using nonlinear least-squares fitting. For measurements with isolated RRM1 or RRM2 (WT and mutants) the baseline was set manually for all experiments prior to integration, and the data was corrected for nonspecific heats. For measurements with the UP1 mutants no baseline correction was applied and the data was corrected for dilution effects by subtracting the integrated heats of a control experiment of protein titration into buffer prior to fitting.</p><p>The output of the ITC measurements can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Table 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Table 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Table 4—source data 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture and plasmids</title><p>HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC No. 85120602) and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine albumin (FBS) and 1% streptomycin/penicillin.

Single guanine introduction resulted in spectra containing resonances with very broad line width and still many resonances disappearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Titration with ISS-N1-14g25g still resulted in broad line width, but fewer resonances disappeared compared to the wild-type sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Although promising, this first approach did not achieve sufficiently narrow lines. Since it is not necessarily the complex with the best affinity that will give the best NMR signals, we then decided to take the opposite approach of weakening the overall affinity of the complex with the aim of reaching the fast exchange regime with improved NMR signals. We thus titrated UP1-R140A with the wild-type ISS-N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>). The spectrum had improved quality for some regions, but also broader line-width in others. We next decided to combine our two approaches and obtained spectra of much improved quality with overall narrow line-widths and many recovered signals using UP1-R140A bound to ISS-N1-14g25g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,F</xref>). Interestingly, the titrations with the singly mutated RNAs gave also spectra of improved quality. Whereas the ISS-N1-u25g showed overall approximately identical chemical shifts as the double RNA mutant, the ISS-N1-c14g showed some localized differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,G,H</xref>). More importantly, in the case of ISS-N1-14g25g and ISS-N1-u25g, the pattern of signals in the bound form in this particular region resembles those of the isolated RRM1 bound to 5´-UUAGGUC-3´ RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In detail, the residues involved correspond to Ile18, Val45, Met46 and Ala89 in RRM1, among which Val45 and Met46 (β2 strand) interact with the guanosine 3´ to the AG core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>). Our interpretation is therefore the following: since the pattern of the region at 8–9 ppm x 124–130 ppm is similar for the isolated RRM1 bound to 5´-UUAGGUC-3´, and for UP1 bound to ISS-N1-14g25g and to ISS-N1-u25g, we conclude that in these cases RRM1 binds a motif with a G following the central AG core. Correlatively, in the case where the pattern is different, namely for ISS-N1-c14g, we conclude that RRM1 binds a motif with something else than a G following the central AG core. This strongly indicates that RRM1 binds to the 3´-motif of ISS-N1 irrespective of the point mutations introduced in the RNA and therefore RRM2 binds the 5´-motif.</p></sec><sec id="s31" sec-type="appendix"><title>Structural investigation of ISS-N1-u25g bound to UP1-R140A</title><p>Protein resonances in the complex were assigned using 2D (<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC, 2D (<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C)-HSQC, 3D HNCA, 3D CBCA(CO)NH, 3D HNCO, 3D [<sup>13</sup>C; <sup>15</sup>N; <sup>1</sup>H] HCC(CO)NH-TOCSY, 3D [<sup>1</sup>H; <sup>15</sup>N; <sup>1</sup>H] HCC(CO)NH-TOCSY, 3D NOESY-(<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC and two 3D NOESY-(<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C)-HSQC optimized for the observation of protons attached to aliphatic carbons or to aromatic carbons.

The constraints include 4261 intra-protein NOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 87 inter-molecular NOE (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).

Models were selected based on their energy of interaction at the protein-RNA interface (including the Van der Waals and the electrostatic terms of the CNS energy function restricted to the inter-molecular interactions). The lowest energy model was chosen for figure preparation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><sec id="s33"><title>Important remark</title><p>It is important to note that this model only illustrates one possible path of the ISS-RNA from RRM2 towards RRM1. The RNA-spacer separating the two RRM-bound motifs of the ISS-N1 is not restricted in this modelling procedure, and therefore can adopt a large number of different conformations. Nevertheless, this model illustrates that the RNA-spacer is long enough for hnRNP A1 RRMs to loop out RNA and bind simultaneously to the 5´- and 3´-motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s34" sec-type="appendix"><title>Influence of the RNA spacer</title><p>In order to evaluate the influence of the RNA-spacer on the topology of binding observed here, namely RRM1 binding the 3'-motif and RRM2 the 5'-motif, we conducted several structure calculations with CYANA using the same protocol used for the UP1-R140A:ISS-N1-u25g complex. In each of these calculations, we progressively shortened the length of the RNA spacer from 9 nt to 3 nt (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>). As mentioned before, we define the term ‘RNA spacer’ as the number of nucleotides in between the two AG core binding sites. Several lengths were tested, namely 9 nt (the original sequence), 7 nt, 5 nt, 4 nt and 3 nt. The structure calculation with the 3-nucleotide long spacer resulted in a distorted geometry for the protein-RNA complex with large violations, reflecting the fact that the two RRMs cannot bind simultaneously to the two RNA-motifs with the mode of binding used to bind the original sequence. For linkers ranging from 9 to 4 nt, we did not observe such drastic increase in the violations, meaning that the mode of binding observed with the ISS-N1 (9-nucleotide long spacer) is perfectly compatible with shorter spacers in between the two AGs Altogether, we can conclude that due to topological constraints, the RNA spacer between the two AGs must be at least four nucleotide-long.<table-wrap id="A2-tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.033</object-id><label>Appendix 2—table 3.</label><caption><p>List of the RNAs used for in vitro structural studies and in cell splicing assays.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25736.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25736.033</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">ISS-N1 WT</th><th valign="top">(gga)CCAGCAUUAUGAAAGUGC/A</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-c14g</td><td valign="top">(gga)CCAGgAUUAUGAAAGUGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-u25g</td><td valign="top">(gga)CCAGCAUUAUGAAAGgGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-14g25g</td><td valign="top">(gga)CCAGgAUUAUGAAAGgGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-g13a</td><td valign="top">CCAaCAUUAUGAAAGUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-g24a</td><td valign="top">CCAGCAUUAUGAAAaUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1-13a24a</td><td valign="top">CCAaCAUUAUGAAAaUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1 −2</td><td valign="top">CCAGCAUUA-AAAGUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1 −4</td><td valign="top">CCAGCAU-AAAGUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1 −6</td><td valign="top">CCAGCA-AAGUGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ISS-N1 −8</td><td valign="top">CCAGC-AGUGA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25736.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Valcárcel</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff><institution>Centre de Regulació Genòmica (CRG), Barcelona</institution>, <country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

This addresses a long-standing question in protein-RNA recognition and splicing regulation.

The results go beyond successive previous structures by crystallography and NMR describing interactions of hnRNP A1 with nucleic acids and establish the architecture of an RNP complex that is the target of an antisense oligonucleotide that has revolutionized the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The structural data are of high quality and there is overall good correlation with functional data.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The authors characterize HNRNPA1 RRM1 and RRM2 binding to RNA independently by NMR, and identify binding motifs that differ slightly from previous SELEX motifs. The optimal binding sequence for RRM2 was identified as UCAGUU (subsection “Initial binding studies of hnRNP A1 RRMs with small RNA motifs”, <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1–Table 1</xref>). However, ITC measurements listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> show that RRM2 binds to UUAGGUC with 8-fold higher affinity. To investigate how longer strands of RNA interact with UP1 (comprising both RRMs), the authors used a known HNRNPA1 binding site in SMN2 exon 7, with mutations to enhance binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is unclear, however, why UP1 R140A, which has reduced RNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), yielded the strongest signal. The authors explain the ~5-fold increase in RNA-binding affinity of UP1 R1r2, compared to RRM1, by the lack of the inter-RRM linker. Although the mutations in UP1 R1r2 are similar to mutations in UP1 r1R2 that appear not to contribute to RNA binding, the increase in binding could also be explained by residual RNA binding to RRM2 of U1 R1r2, which should be discussed or tested by experiments similar to those listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>2) Further experimental evidence to rule out that multiple HNRNPA1 molecules bind to the same RNA strand could be provided by co-transfecting cells with HNRNPA1 R1r2 and r1R2.

First, the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (which should actually be 5A according to the figure display) should state that nuclear lysates (not cell lysates) were used. More important, the authors simply conclude that &quot;The amounts of hnRNP A1 WT and mutants appear comparable&quot;, while the amounts of flagged hnRNP A1 are clearly different (e.g. compare lanes 3, 4 and 5) and in general difficult to assess, given the non-linear nature of Western Blot signals and the difficulty to visually normalize by the (also variable) amounts of the DDX5 loading control. It will be important to quantify these differences more accurately (e.g. analyzing by Western Blot serial dilutions of the nuclear extracts) and report also variations between experiments, particularly considering the considerable effort made by the authors to quantify the ratios between splicing isoforms. For example, mutant INT3 appears to be the most active if the three INT mutants, despite the apparently lower levels of protein expression, which may require a structural explanation if the data stand.</p><p>4) Based on the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors conclude that RRM2 is more important than RRM1 for ISS-N1 binding and SMN splicing. However, this result is not supported by the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, showing that mutations of either 5' AG or 3' AG have similar effects on SMN splicing. In fact, data in Hua et al. 2008 (referenced in the text) show that ASO-mediated steric blocking of the 3' AG (shown here to interact with RRM1) has a stronger effect on SMN2 exon 7 inclusion than steric blocking of the 5'AG (shown here to interact with RRM2). A possible explanation for this discrepancy – related to the previous point – could be different expression levels of hnRNP A1 mutants (based on the loading control) which may account for the difference in SMN1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), rather than RRM2 being more important. If the data are reproducible with comparable R1r2 and r1R2 expression levels, they authors should discuss why mutations of 5' AG and 3' AG in ISS-N1 have the same effect on SMN2 splicing.</p><p>5) A manuscript just appeared in PNAS by Tolbert describing the specificity of hnRNPA1.

The hnRNPA1 protein regulates alternative splicing and microRNA processing and maturation, and has long been studied as a model to understand RNA recognition as well, However, despite successive structures by crystallography and NMR, a structure of the two RRM protein bound to RNA has been missing and, which would come with it, a thorough knowledge of how this protein binds.</p><p>Here the authors make several important advances. First, they fully characterize the structure and specificity of each RRM. Then they use this information to optimize the sequence the didomain construct bind to and use this to determine a model of the complete two RRM-RNA structure.

Much could be moved to supplementary material.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>HNRNPA1 is an abundant RNA-binding protein with important roles in splicing regulation, which involves binding of its two-RRM UP1 domain to RNA splicing silencer elements. Previous results by the Allain lab revealed a different relative orientation of the RRMs in solution, compared to earlier x-ray crystal structures of UP1 bound to telomeric ssDNA. This manuscript characterizes HNRNPA1 RNA binding by solution NMR, and shows that RRM1 and RRM2 can bind to two nearby motifs on the same RNA strand. Cell-based splicing assays with an SMN minigene suggest that disrupting the interaction between RRM1 and RRM2 inhibits HNRNPA1 repressive activity, and both RRMs are necessary for optimal activity. The authors propose a new model for HNRNPA1 binding to RNA, which may help to identify new binding sites.</p><p>I do not have the expertise to judge the technical quality of the NMR results, but overall, the data are described clearly and the figures are easy to understand. The results enhance the understanding of RNA binding and splicing regulation by HNRNPA1. Several aspects of the data require clarification:</p><p>The authors characterize HNRNPA1 RRM1 and RRM2 binding to RNA independently by NMR, and identify binding motifs that differ slightly from previous SELEX motifs.

However, ITC measurements listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> show that RRM2 binds to UUAGGUC with 8-fold higher affinity.</italic> </p><p>It is perfectly correct that we did not determine the structure of RRM2 in complex with the RNA yielding the best affinity, but with the RNA giving the best quality of NMR spectra. We tested several RNAs (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1–Table 1</xref>), and our choice for the structure determination was based on the NMR exchange regime, as explained in the manuscript in the paragraph “Initial binding studies of hnRNP A1 RRMs with small RNA motifs”. UCAGUU was the sole RNA giving a complex in the so-called slow exchange regime, and was therefore chosen for structure determination. In order to make this point clearer for the reader, we have expanded our initial statement as follows:</p><p>“Note that as for RRM1, RRM2 prefers a U at this position (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), and our complex with RRM2 was thus not determined with the RNA having the best affinity. It had however the optimal exchange properties in terms of NMR and structure determination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Appendix 1–Table 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>To investigate how longer strands of RNA interact with UP1 (comprising both RRMs), the authors used a known HNRNPA1 binding site in SMN2 exon 7, with mutations to enhance binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is unclear, however, why UP1 R140A, which has reduced RNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), yielded the strongest signal.</italic> </p><p>As a general principle, we would like to emphasize that exchange regime in NMR complicate the study of complexes. As a result of this, it is not necessarily the complex with the highest affinity that will give the best NMR signals. Similarly, as for the previous point, the choice of the point mutation introduced here (UP1-R140A) was not meant to increase the affinity, but to solely improve the NMR behavior of the complex. In the wild-type complex, some signals at the binding interface disappeared upon RNA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which indicates a complex in the so-called intermediate exchange regime. Structural investigation with such behavior is not possible since signals at the protein-RNA interface are missing. We thus sought for a complex with improved NMR signals at the interface by minimally mutating either the protein or the RNA or both. It turned out that decreasing the affinity with the R140A mutant lead to improved NMR signals, most probably because it shifted the complex from the unfavorable intermediate exchange regime towards the more favorable fast exchange regime. Most of these NMR specific details have been moved to the Appendices, but in order to make this point clearer for the reader, we have expended our initial statement as follows:</p><p>“Since it is not necessarily the complex with the best affinity that will give the best NMR signals, we then decided to take the opposite approach of weakening the overall affinity of the complex with the aim of reaching the fast exchange regime with improved NMR signals.”</p><p>In addition, in the main text, this point is now briefly explained as follows:</p><p>“Since it is not necessarily the complex with the highest affinity that will give the best NMR signals, we then took the opposite approach of weakening the overall affinity of the complex with the protein mutant UP1-R140A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).”</p><p><italic>The authors explain the ~5-fold increase in RNA-binding affinity of UP1 R1r2, compared to RRM1, by the lack of the inter-RRM linker. Although the mutations in UP1 R1r2 are similar to mutations in UP1 r1R2 that appear not to contribute to RNA binding, the increase in binding could also be explained by residual RNA binding to RRM2 of U1 R1r2, which should be discussed or tested by experiments similar to those listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are concerned that the increase in affinity observed for UP1 R1r2 compared to RRM1 could also be explained by residual RNA-binding to RRM2 of UP1 R1r2 despite the mutations in RRM2. In the fitting of ITC data, one of the parameters is the N-value indicative of the stoichiometry of the measured interaction (mentioned on page 17). N is one of the most precisely determined parameters and should be a warning sign for experimental problems, such as a wrong fitting model, when deviations from the expected value do occur (Tellinghuisen, Anal Biochem 2012). Our data robustly fit with a 1:1 stoichiometry (N = 1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Table 3—source data 1</xref>, subsection “RNA specificities and preferences of each individual RRM of hnRNP A1”, last paragraph). Hence, if residual RNA binding to RRM2 occurred we would expect a (substantial) deviation of N from 1. For these reasons we are certain that both in the case of UP1 R1r2 and UP1 r1R2 the introduced mutations strongly dampen RNA binding at the mutated RRM’s binding interface to a level which is too low to perturb the correct measurement of the RNA-binding affinity of the unaffected RRM. Consequently, we are confident that all our data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> represents true dissociation constant measurements for each individual RRM in the context of UP1. In order to make this point clearer for the reader, we have expended our initial statement as follows:</p><p>“Importantly, the mutations were efficient in removing the RNA binding ability of the mutated RRM. After fitting with a 1:1 binding model the obtained N-values of our ITC measurements were robustly ~1. This is indicative of a 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex.”</p><p><italic>2) Further experimental evidence to rule out that multiple HNRNPA1 molecules bind to the same RNA strand could be provided by co-transfecting cells with HNRNPA1 R1r2 and r1R2. If each ISS-N1 binding site can only interact with a single hnRNPA1 molecule, there should not be an additive or synergistic effect.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment. We have performed it and the results can now be found as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>. The co-transfection of both hnRNP A1 R1r2 and hnRNP A1 r1R2 resulted in the same exon 7 inclusion rate as for transfection of hnRNP A1 r1R2 alone. We conclude from this that the two mutants cannot complement each other and that it is therefore unlikely that hnRNP A1 acts as a dimer on the ISS-N1 such as was observed in the crystal structure of hnRNP A1 in complex with telomeric repeat DNA. Together with our other experiments we take this as an additional evidence that what we have observed by NMR is a functional state in the cell.</p><p>We comment on these results as follows:</p><p>“Our structural data proposes the simultaneous binding of both RRMs to the ISS-N1. […] In support of our model, we could not observe any rescue of hnRNP A1 function when co-transfecting with the two RRM mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) The protein analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> are of less quality than the rest of the manuscript. First, the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (which should actually be 5A according to the figure display) should state that nuclear lysates (not cell lysates) were used. More important, the authors simply conclude that &quot;The amounts of hnRNP A1 WT and mutants appear comparable&quot;, while the amounts of flagged hnRNP A1 are clearly different (e.g. compare lanes 3, 4 and 5) and in general difficult to assess, given the non-linear nature of Western Blot signals and the difficulty to visually normalize by the (also variable) amounts of the DDX5 loading control. It will be important to quantify these differences more accurately (e.g. analyzing by Western Blot serial dilutions of the nuclear extracts) and report also variations between experiments, particularly considering the considerable effort made by the authors to quantify the ratios between splicing isoforms. For example, mutant INT3 appears to be the most active if the three INT mutants, despite the apparently lower levels of protein expression, which may require a structural explanation if the data stand.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the original protein analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> was of a lesser quality than the rest of the manuscript. The original data was obtained to the best of our knowledge by transfection in HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method. During revision, the analysis of the Western Blots revealed non-reproducible overexpression of hnRNP A1 at times between replicates. To manage this issue we changed the protocol for plasmid purification for transfection (now ZymoPURE Plasmid Midiprep Kit, Zymo Research) and as well exchanged the transfection reagent to Lipofectamine 2000. All Western Blots for all replicates have been attached as figure supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. As can be seen, overexpression of the construct is now reproducible between replicates.</p><p>The only mutant that appears to be expressed at a different level under these conditions is hnRNP A1 R1r2. We have tested for dose effects by increasing the protein level by transfection of increased amounts of hnRNP A1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We can show that the <italic>SMN</italic> splicing response remains the same under increased protein amounts.</p><p>In addition, our Western Blots were recorded by CCD-based detection (Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare), which offers a dynamic range of 4.8 orders of magnitude allowing for detection across a wide dynamic range for precise quantitation. This allows for a linear detection over a broad range of signals and should cover our range according to the manufacturer. The data obtained during the revisions are overall very similar to those previously obtained. Differences are precisely described in response to point #4.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers have raised the concern that INT3 appears most active, despite the apparently lower levels of protein expression. While with the new transfection protocol INT3 amounts do not differ from INT1 and INT2, the reviewers have raised an interesting question. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> we show the overall NMR correlation time (τ<sub>c</sub>) of UP1 WT and UP1 INT1-3 mutants. INT3 has, out of the three mutants, a correlation time in the closest range to the wild-type protein. This suggests, that in INT3 the interaction between RRM1 and RRM2 is less disrupted than in INT1 and INT2. This could explain why the INT3 mutant has a behavior closer to the WT protein, explaining its slightly higher activity in the <italic>SMN1</italic> splicing assay. However, as the same cannot be seen for the INT2 mutant, which is also more active in the splicing assay, we refrained from discussing this potential correlation in the paper to avoid over interpretation of our data.</p><p><italic>4) Based on the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the authors conclude that RRM2 is more important than RRM1 for ISS-N1 binding and SMN splicing. However, this result is not supported by the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, showing that mutations of either 5' AG or 3' AG have similar effects on SMN splicing. In fact, data in Hua et al. 2008 (referenced in the text) show that ASO-mediated steric blocking of the 3' AG (shown here to interact with RRM1) has a stronger effect on SMN2 exon 7 inclusion than steric blocking of the 5'AG (shown here to interact with RRM2). A possible explanation for this discrepancy – related to the previous point – could be different expression levels of hnRNP A1 mutants (based on the loading control) which may account for the difference in SMN1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), rather than RRM2 being more important. If the data are reproducible with comparable R1r2 and r1R2 expression levels, they authors should discuss why mutations of 5' AG and 3' AG in ISS-N1 have the same effect on SMN2 splicing.</italic> </p><p>Our new sets of experiments with new plasmid preparation and transfection protocols, lead to a different conclusion regarding the relative importance of the single RRMs. Previously, both in the <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic> minigene system, hnRNP A1 r1R2 overexpression consistently had an effect and led to a minor repression of exon 7 inclusion compared to the control transfection with an empty plasmid. With the new protocol in place no such effect can be seen in comparison to the control transfection. Taking the new results into account we had to modify our interpretation of the results and their discussion and have now removed any mention of RRM2 being more important than RRM1. In addition, for the set of experiments where the ISS-N1 spacer length was varied, with the new protocol we no longer observe the increase in exon 7 inclusion for <italic>SMN2</italic> ISS-N1 -2 which we could not explain earlier.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers mention the ASO tiling experiment performed by Hua et al. in their 2008 publication where steric blocking of the 3’AG had a stronger effect on SMN2 exon 7 inclusion than blocking of the 5’ AG. We believe that steric blocking will work with a different principle and cannot necessarily be compared to a mutation experiment. In the same publication, a mutational experiment was also performed, where individual positions of the ISS-N1 were mutated. In this case, and like in our experiment, in the absence of hnRNP A1 overexpression, targeting either AG had similar effects on <italic>SMN</italic> splicing.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers have raised the concern that a difference in <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 splicing could be a result of unequal amounts of overexpressed protein. We have responded to this concern as a part of reviewers’ comment #3.</p><p>We understand that each of our experiments only allows us to look at a single part of the UP1:ISS-N1 interaction decoupled from the others. Taking our results together as well as the new experiment added in response to reviewers’ comment #2, we are nevertheless very confident in our interpretation of the experiments.</p><p><italic>5) A manuscript just appeared in PNAS by Tolbert describing the specificity of hnRNPA1. The authors should compare the two sets of results and evaluate them critically.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, a manuscript by Tolbert and co-workers appeared in PNAS at the point of submission of our work. Using HTS-EQ and cross-validation with ITC they have found a consensus motif of 5’-YAG-3’ for hnRNP A1. Furthermore, it was found that an additional guanine immediately 3’ to the motif is favored too. Together this matches our findings for a strong preference of 5’-UAG-3’, which can be extended to 5’-U/<sub>C</sub>AGG-3’for a wider description of the preference.</p><p>We have added this analysis of the manuscript by Tolbert and co-workers to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) It is a bit unclear if the model of the 2 RRM-RNA structure is a model or a formal structure. This could be clarified, perhaps by showing a table with proper statistics to show what the data actually establish.</italic> </p><p>The two RRM-RNA structure is not a formal NMR structure, and we refer to it as a “structural model” throughout the manuscript. Although we did use similar protocols as for regular NMR structure calculations, the ensemble that we have obtained cannot be seen as a formal NMR structure. The main reason for this is that the RNA-spacer separating the two RRM-bound motifs of the ISS-N1 was not restricted in our modelling procedure, since we did not assign intermolecular NOEs to this region. For this reason we do not consider it as an actual structure.</p><p>In order to make this point clearer for the reader, we have expended the statement in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> to: “Please note that the path of the RNA-spacer between the 5´ and 3´ motifs is not restrained by experimental constraints. The present structural model therefore illustrates one possible path of the ISS-N1 on the RRMs and should not be seen as the unique conformation adopted by the RNA spacer.”</p><p>In addition, in the main text, we have added the following sentence: “Combining all the structural information obtained on this complex, we could build a structural model showing how hnRNP A1 RRMs can assemble on the same pre-mRNA stretch (See Appendix 2 for details).”</p><p>And in the Appendix 2 we have added the following paragraph:</p><p>“Important remark: It is important to note that this model only illustrates one possible path of the ISS-RNA from RRM2 towards RRM1. […] Nevertheless, this model illustrates that the RNA-spacer is long enough for hnRNP A1 RRMs to loop out RNA and bind simultaneously to the 5´- and 3´-motifs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
