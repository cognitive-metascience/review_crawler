Here, we describe the first fully synthetic phage display library of humanized llama single domain antibody (NaLi-H1: Nanobody Library Humanized 1). Based on a humanized synthetic single domain antibody (hs2dAb) scaffold optimized for intracellular stability, the highly diverse library provides high affinity binders without animal immunization. NaLi-H1 was screened following several selection schemes against various targets (Fluorescent proteins, actin, tubulin, p53, HP1). Conformation antibodies against active RHO GTPase were also obtained. Selected hs2dAb were used in various immunoassays and were often found to be functional intrabodies, enabling tracking or inhibition of endogenous targets. Functionalization of intrabodies allowed specific protein knockdown in living cells. Finally, direct selection against the surface of tumor cells produced hs2dAb directed against tumor-specific antigens further highlighting the potential use of this library for therapeutic applications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16228.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16228.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibodies are proteins that form part of an animal’s immune system and can identify and help eradicate infections. These proteins are also needed at many stages in biological research and represent one of the most promising tools in medical applications, from diagnostics to treatments.</p><p>Traditionally, antibodies have been collected from animals that had been previously injected with a target molecule that the antibodies must recognize. An alternative strategy that uses bacteria and bacteria-infecting viruses instead of animals was developed several decades ago and allows researchers to obtain antibodies more quickly. However, the majority of the scientific community view these “in vitro selected antibodies” as inferior to those produced via the more traditional approach.</p><p>Moutel, Bery et al. set out to challenge this widespread opinion, using a smaller kind of antibody known as nanobodies. The proteins were originally found in animals like llamas and camels and are now widely used in biological research. One particularly stable nanobody was chosen to form the backbone of the in vitro antibodies, and the DNA that encodes this nanobody was altered to make the protein more similar to human antibodies. Moutel, Bery et al. then changed the DNA sequence further to make billions of different versions of the nanobody, each one slightly different from the next in the region that binds to the target molecules.</p><p>Transferring this DNA into bacteria resulted in a library (called the NaLi-H1 library) of bacterial clones that produce the nanobodies displayed at the surface of bacteria-infecting viruses. Moutel, Bery et al. then screened this library against various target molecules, including some from tumor cells, and showed that the fully in vitro selected antibodies worked just as well as natural antibodies in a number of assays. The in vitro antibodies could even be used to track, or inactivate, proteins within living cells.</p><p>The NaLi-H1 library will help other researchers obtain new antibodies that bind strongly to their targets. The approaches developed to create the library could also see more people decide to create their own synthetic libraries, which would accelerate the identification of new antibodies in a way that is cheaper and requires fewer experiments to be done using animals. These in vitro selected antibodies could help to advance both fundamental and medical research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

the biochemical tools of choice to label antigens in cells or tissues. Over the past 20 years, recombinant methods have been developed to quickly select and improve monoclonal antibodies from highly diverse libraries. Recombinant antibodies can be selected from immune or naïve libraries. Immune libraries provide in general high affinity binders but, depending on the antigen, diversity is sometimes limited. Because natural antibody selection requires animal immunization, very conserved or toxic antigens should be avoided and, in general, only limited control of the immune response is possible. On the contrary, non-immune (naïve) libraries provide a higher diversity of binders even for antigens highly conserved in mammals, but high specificity and affinity can be reached only when selecting from very large functional libraries. Immune and naïve libraries are based on the manipulation of antibody fragment that retain binding capacity and specificity of the entire immunoglobulin G (IgG).</p><p>The smallest IgG portion capable of binding with high specificity an antigen is the Fv fragment consisting of the variable heavy (VH) and the variable light (VL) domains. In the case of single domain antibodies (sdAb), a VH or a VL alone, is able to bind its target antigen. Each variable domain contains four conserved framework regions (FRW or framework) and three regions called CDR (Complementarity Determining Regions) corresponding to hypervariable sequences which determine the specificity for the antigen. VH and VL can be fused together using a synthetic linker and produced as a single protein in the form of a single chain Fv (scFv). Easier to manipulate, they can be produced in several bacteria or eukaryote cell types, fused to various tags or functional domains. Interestingly, antibodies called HCAb in <italic>Camelidae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>) or IgNAR in sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenberg et al., 1995</xref>) have an antigen recognition part composed of only a VH domain. Camelid natural single domain VH, referred to as VHH or nanobodies, can be expressed as recombinant fragments and represent attractive alternatives over classical antibody fragments like scFvs because they are easy to manipulate and they are not limited by potential misfolding of the two domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wörn and Plückthun, 1999</xref>). It is noteworthy that VHH FRWs show a high sequence and structural homology with human VH domains of family III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>) and VHH have comparable immunogenicity as human VH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartunek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holz et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, they further constitute very interesting agents for therapeutic applications, some of them are currently in phase II and Phase III clinical trials (Ablynx Nanobodies; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ablynx">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ablynx</ext-link>).</p><p>Recombinant antibody fragments allowed not only to accelerate the identification of unique binders, but also the development of a novel type of tool: in this case, the antibodies are directly expressed in living cells as intracellular antibodies (intrabodies), to trace or perturb endogenous target at the protein level. Some scFv or sdAb have indeed been directly expressed in eukaryotic cell as intrabodies to target with high specificity intracellular antigens. Several intrabodies have been used as fluorescent protein fusion to highlight endogenous antigen in cells in a spatio-temporal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>). Intrabodies with intrinsic blocking activity have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2005</xref>), and several other approaches have been developed to allow a larger fraction of intrabodies to be used as inhibitory factors: forced co-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>), suicide through proteasome targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melchionna and Cattaneo, 2007</xref>), rerouting or sequestration to cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Böldicke et al., 2005</xref>), degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>). Depending on the target, such inhibitors may have potential in human therapy. Production of functional intrabodies depends on the stability of the antibody fragments in the reducing environment of the cytosol that does not allow disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine. In this context, many advantages of the nanobody scaffold have been reported and, in particular, higher solubility, improved stability in a reducing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wesolowski et al., 2009</xref>), as well as higher expression yield and thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jobling et al., 2003</xref>). For all these reasons, the nanobody scaffold represents an attractive option to generate functional intrabodies.</p><p>Thus, we decided to create a non-immune recombinant antibody library of high diversity, based on a nanobody scaffold that would enable efficient in vitro antibody selection against virtually any antigen. Such a library should provide antibodies usable in conventional immune assays and be enriched in antibodies active in the intracellular environment. First, using a fusion assay in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a family of highly functional VHH scaffolds was isolated, optimized for intracellular expression and high stability. One particularly stable VHH scaffold consensus sequence was chosen from these selected antibodies. Additional changes were then introduced to reduce the distance between the <italic>Camelidae</italic> and human VH3 sequences. We confirmed by CDR grafting that this humanized synthetic scaffold (hs2dAb) was robust and functional. Statistics of amino-acid diversity in the CDRs were computed and these information were used to construct a high diversity phage display library of 3.10<sup>9</sup> independent hs2dAb. The library was then screened against diverse targets of various structures and origin. Highly specific antibodies were selected against EGFP, mCherry, β-tubulin, β-actin, heterochromatin protein HP1α, GTP-bound RHO, p53 and HER2. Affinity measurement indicated that affinities in the nM range can be obtained using this library. As expected from our design, we further showed that hs2dAb are frequently usable as fluorescent intrabodies to track antigens in cells. We also showed that they can be functionalized to induce antigen knockdown. This thus represents the first report of a large and diverse synthetic single domain antibody library enabling fully in vitro selection of highly functional antibodies and intrabodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Library design</title><p>We reasoned that the usual lower quality of these non-immune libraries may come from (1) an antibody scaffold that may not allow robust folding and presentation of CDR region, (2) a lack of control of diversity in the CDR regions and (3) a frequent occurrence of incorrect clones due to the presence of unexpected mutation or empty clones. We designed a pipeline for the development of functional synthetic libraries that aims at overcoming these limitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a first step to construct a single domain antibody library enriched in highly stable and functional antibody fragments, we screened for a robust sdAb scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, we selected from immune or naïve llama VHH libraries several hundreds of clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monegal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</xref>). From this population, we identified a set of robust scaffolds using an assay that discriminates highly stable clones from clones prone to aggregation, or unfolding, in the bacterial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</xref>). This assay is based on the fusion of HA-tagged chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) to the carboxy-terminus of VHH sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In these conditions, only bacteria expressing a functional VHH fusion in the reducing cytosol (non aggregating, non degraded) can grow in the presence of high antibiotic concentration, thus filtrating a sub-library of potential intrabodies. Expression yield in <italic>E.coli</italic> and apparent solubility as EGFP fusion in the mammalian cell cytoplasm were further assessed to select a set of robust antibody scaffolds. Strikingly, the consensus scaffold was matching the sequence of the most robust VHH framework, represented by a single domain antibody D10 (hereafter named sdAb<sup>D10</sup>). When compared to previously reported thermostable nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olichon et al., 2007a</xref>) or intrabodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>) obtained from immune libraries, sdAb<sup>D10</sup> was found to provide higher antibiotic resistance in the chloramphenicol filter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Its expression yield in <italic>E.coli</italic> periplasm was in the higher range of soluble llama VHH fragments, allowing efficient and quantitative purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Purified sdAb<sup>D10</sup> showed excellent solubility, stability after treatment at 70°C and we did not observe aggregation when expressed as an intrabody fused to the EGFP in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of scaffold selection, diversity design, and synthetic production of the NaLi-H1 library.</title><p>The development of the NaLi-H1 library followed three lines of optimization. (i) A novel scaffold was defined by selecting a set of robust nanobodies using a CAT fusion assay (1). A consensus was derived and mutations were introduced to humanize the scaffold (2).

A fixed size of 7 aa was chosen for the CDR1 and CDR2. 4 sizes (9, 12, 15 and 18 amino acids) were chosen for CDR3. Finally, the pHEN2 vector was improved by implementing a triple myc tag and inserting a toxic gene (ccdb) to ensure low frequency of empty clones during library construction (6). Gene synthesis (using a tri-nucleotide approach) was ordered, synthetic sequences cloned into the novel pHEN2+ vector, transformed into bacteria and plated on 430 15 cm plates. 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> clones were obtained. Quality control was carried out using Sanger sequencing of 315 randomly picked clones and large scale sequencing of 56 000 clones. No redundant clone was found. The NaLi-H1 was then screened in various conditions and diversity, efficacy, versatility and affinity evaluated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16228.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16228.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16228-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Robust scaffold identification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase carboxy terminal fusion is a folding reporter allowing for the selection of soluble amino terminal VHH.

Seven residues of the synthetic scaffold sdAb<sup>D10</sup> were altered towards the most represented in human VH3 while five other divergent residues were kept unchanged. The four llama VHH-specific amino acids hallmarks in the framework-2 region (positions 42, 49, 50, and 52), which are essential to increase intrinsic solubility properties, as well as the Glutamine in position 103, were maintained. We named the resulting hybrid single domain VH hs2dAb (<italic>humanized synthetic single domain antibody</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After grafting the CDR of the anti-lamin into these two scaffolds, we analyzed their display on the M13 surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and their production by <italic>E. coli</italic> and by CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Both scaffold showed similarly good efficacy. Importantly, both the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> and hs2dAb scaffolds enabled functional display of the grafted CDRs and robust detection of endogenous lamin was observed by immunofluorescence staining of Hela cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Last, Rothbauer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>) showed that the original anti-lamin VHH recognized its target antigen upon intracellular expression. Similarly, we observed that both the hs2dAb and the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> scaffolds allowed the efficient intrabody use of the synthetic anti-lamin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This further indicated that the synthetic scaffolds were robust, non-aggregating and resisted to the reducing conditions found in the cytosol, while allowing the proper display of CDR loops. As partial humanization did not affect the properties of the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> scaffold, we chose the hs2dAb scaffold as a unique framework to construct a diverse library of synthetic nanobodies endowed with the characteristic stability of these single domain antibodies while displaying an amino acid sequence closer to human VH3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Library construction</title><p>A synthetic diversity was introduced in the three CDRs by rationally controlling each position of the CDR1 and CDR2 using a set of amino acids that recapitulates partially natural diversity (see the Appendix for more details) while reducing the presence of the most hydrophobic residues in order to avoid the aggregation propensity (see Material and methods). A constant length of 7 amino acids was selected for CDR1 and CDR2. A large spectrum of <italic>Camelidae</italic> VHH CDR3 length is naturally observed and this loop is known to contribute strongly to antigen binding selectivity. Thus, we chose to use four different lengths of CDR3 to cover this spectrum (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids) and introduce random amino acid (except cysteine) at each position.</p><p>Synthetic DNA was produced by the trinucleotide DNA assembly and amplification was carried out starting from 2.10<sup>11</sup> different molecules, using only a few cycles of PCR (PCR linearity validated by Q-PCR) to prevent drift during amplification. The synthetic library was inserted into a modified pHEN2 phagemid vector containing a triple myc-tag and suicide gene (ccdB) that allowed positive selection of insert-bearing clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard et al., 1994</xref>). Massive electroporation was carried out using <italic>E. coli</italic> TG1 cells and 430 large agar dishes (140 mm) were used to ensure proper plating of the library. About 3.10<sup>9</sup> individual recombinant hs2dAb clones were obtained. We named this library NaLi-H1 (for Nanobody Library-Humanized 1). We first evaluated the quality of the NaLi-H1 library by sequencing 315 random clones. Only 13 sequences were found to be incorrect (bearing an in-frame stop codon, missing one base, missing a large region [the CDR1 or CDR1-FWR1- CDR2], or being empty). Thus, a total of about 4% of potential default was observed, which is rather low and only marginal in comparison to the 3.10<sup>9</sup> clones obtained. The diversity was then evaluated by sequencing 5.6 10<sup>5</sup> inserts using ion Torrent chips (Life Technologies). This confirmed the quality of the library and showed that the four CDR3 lengths (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids) were present in similar proportions. The diversity and statistical distribution of amino acids in the CDRs were found to be as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To estimate the overall folding of the hs2dAb present in the library, we picked randomly 24 clones and tested their solubility in bacteria medium after secretion. Medium were centrifuged at 250 000 <italic>g</italic> and the supernatant and pellet were analyzed. All tested clones showed essentially complete solubility, at least as good as a natural Lama antibody (GFP4).

Antibodies against tubulin were selected in native conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>) using commercial biotinylated tubulin (Cytoskeleton). After two rounds of selection, 3 out of 40 clones analyzed were shown to detect endogenous tubulin by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, staining was lost in cells treated with the microtubule destabilizing drug nocodazole, with only a few stable microtubules being labelled in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This antibody was recently used to stain microtubules by super-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mikhaylova et al., 2015</xref>). Among phage display methods, selection on antigens directly adsorbed on the surface of immunotube is often used as a cheap and straightforward method, despite the low capacity and the strong denaturation imposed by non-specific adsorption. A screen against coated β-actin led to the identification of 16 unique binders positive in phage ELISA. Seven of these antibodies decorated endogenous actin stress fibers by immunofluorescence in MRC5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) as well as in other cell lines. Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D disorganizes actin fibers. Accordingly, staining with the hs2dAb was strongly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Three of the hs2dAb detected a single band at the molecular weight of β-actin in western blot from HeLa cell extract while one of the anti-tubulin detected a band at the correct molecular weight of tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Actin and tubulin are strongly expressed cellular proteins. Another screen was thus performed to select binders directed against proteins expressed at a lower level. A first screen was carried out against the tumor suppressor p53 protein. The 83 first amino acids of the NP_000537.3 isoform were produced in bacteria fused to a SNAP tag, biotinylated in vitro and used as a target in the phage display selection. Among 12 clones positive in phage ELISA, 6 selected hs2dAb were shown to label endogenous p53 in immunofluorescence on A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The specificity of the staining was confirmed using RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). A low nuclear staining was observed in normal conditions, with some variability between cells. As expected, the intensity was enhanced upon UV-induced DNA damage. Such an increase was not observed in a RPE-1 cell line stably expressing an shRNA against p53. A second screen was carried out against the heterochromatin protein HP1α. HP1α was produced in bacteria fused to an avitag to obtain a biotinylated recombinant protein. Biot-HP1α was then immobilized on streptavidin beads and used as a target for 3 rounds of selection. 5 individual hs2dAb were directly identified by immunofluorescence staining of HeLa cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that selected antibodies were efficiently staining endogenous HP1 in the nucleus. Overexpression of the different HP1 variant followed by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis actually suggested that HP1β/γ were also detected by the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together these results showed that the NaLi-H1 synthetic library can be screened in various conditions against very different purified targets while leading to the rapid identification of diverse and specific binders that can be used in classical antibody-based staining methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Selection of conformation-sensitive antibodies</title><p>One of the main advantages of full in vitro immunization using display technologies is the control of antigen conformation and concentration. It allows to drive selection towards the desired outcome. For example, selection schemes can be devised to improve the recovery of high affinity binders endowed with low off-rate kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), to target specific epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Even-Desrumeaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vielemeyer et al., 2009</xref>), or to identify conformation sensitive-binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haque et al., 2011</xref>). Recombinant antibody fragment library screening have, for example, provided several binders targeting selectively the active conformation of GTP binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitrov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesized that the NaLi-H1 synthetic library had enough diversity and functionality to enable the identification of selective conformational binders. A subtractive panning was performed to select conformation-specific antibodies directed against small GTPases from the RHO subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinestra et al., 2012</xref>). Small GTPases are molecular switch that cycle between an inactive and an active state when bound to GDP or GTP nucleotides, respectively. Mutant of small GTPases can be designed that adopt stably an active or inactive conformation. A constitutively active (CA) mutant RHOA L63 was expressed in HEK293 as a bait then freshly pulled down for panning to preserve its native conformation. To enrich in phage specific for GTP-bound RHOA, a depletion step was introduced from the second round of panning using GDP-bound RHO proteins. After four rounds of selection, clones were analyzed using phage ELISA against either wild type RHOA loaded with GTPγS (a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP) or GDP-loaded RHOA. Forty clones presenting a differential ELISA signal in favor of the GTP loaded RHOA were sequenced. One antibody, represented by clone H12, represented more than 50% of the population. We analyzed H12 binding specificity by ELISA on several purified RHO proteins expressed as GST fusion in <italic>E.coli.</italic> H12 recognized the constitutively active mutant RHOA L63 (RHOA-CA) which is bound to GTP due to impaired hydrolysis activity. A similar signal was obtained with wild type RHOA loaded with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPγS. In contrast, no binding was observed to the dominant negative RHOA N19 mutant RHOA-DN nor to GDP-loaded wild type RHOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The capacity of H12 to specifically immunoprecipitate GTP-loaded RHOA from mammalian cell extracts was then evaluated in comparison to the standard method to assay RHO activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ren et al., 1999</xref>). This pull down method is based on the RHO binding domain of Rhotekin fused to GST (GST-RBD) which is known to bind to the active conformation of RHO GTPase. The hs2dAb H12 bearing a carboxy-terminal CBD (Chitin-Binding Domain) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and immobilized on chitin beads. These beads were then incubated with HeLa cell extracts pre-treated with either GTPγS or GDP to load small GTPases with the respective nucleotide. The H12 hs2dAb was found to be highly selective of RHO loaded with GTPγS as it was unable to precipitate RHO from GDP loaded extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A similarly strong conformation-specificity was found when using H12 for immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). HeLa cells expressing the GFP-RHOA constitutively active mutant carrying the mutation Q63L (GFP-RHOA CA) or the dominant negative mutated T19N (GFP-RHOA DN), were fixed and stained with H12 hs2dAb. Expression of the dominant negative mutant GFP-RHOA DN, did not lead to an increased signal over the background of un-transfected cells. In contrast, a staining with H12 was correlated with the level of GFP-RHOA CA mutant expression. Note that the signal does not fully overlap GFP fluorescence and appeared stronger at the cell border and in large zone where cell shape is strongly retracted by large bundled actin stress fibers induced by a sustained activation of the RHOA/ROCK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>). This CA mutant, like active mutant of many small GTPases related to RAS still need to be activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors to be loaded with GTP and display the active conformation. Thus, we believe that the H12 staining revealed the active form of this mutant in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). All together, these results demonstrated that the H12 hs2dAb is selective for RHO GTPases in their active conformation, highlighting the performance and diversity of the NaLi-H1 library.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Subtractive selection led to conformational or cell type specific hs2dAbs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) H12 is a conformational hs2dAb binding only to the GTP bound, activated state, of the RHOA GTPase: (<bold>A</bold>) ELISA using the H12 or anti-GST antibodies to reveal recombinant GST-RHOA wild type proteins loaded with either 100 µM GTP gamma S (Black) or 1 mM GDP (White), or constitutively active mutant proteins GST-RHOA Q63L (Grey).

Antibodies also represent a unique tool to identify novel targets at the cell surface. Using synthetic libraries like the NaLi-H1 library to carry out direct selection against the cell surface of tumor cells would strongly accelerate the identification of specific antigens while allowing extended control over the conditions of selection. A subtractive selection scheme was set up to identify antibodies selectively detecting the surface of breast tumor cells: phages displaying hs2dAbs were first depleted against a reference cell line before being selected against the target one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As a target cell line, we used the SKBR3 line, which is known to overexpress the HER2 cell surface protein, while the MCF7 cell line, negative for HER2, was used to pre-adsorb the library. After the third round of bio-panning, 88 clones were analyzed by FACS and 58 were found to be positive when tested on SKBR3 cells and negative on MCF7 cells. Sequencing the 58 positive clones revealed that 15 independent binders had been selected. Although the subtractive selection was not performed on identical cell lines expressing or not HER2, we observed strikingly that 12 clones out of 15 recognized HER2 exoplasmic domain by ELISA using HER2-Fc as a target antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that it behaves as a dominant differential epitope. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, these antibodies efficiently detected HER2 at the cell surface by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These experiments demonstrated that the NaLi-H1 library will represent a unique tool to discover, in a rapid and cost effective manner, specific antibodies detecting antigens present at the surface of pathological cells. These antibodies may then be used to identify the corresponding target.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent intrabodies tracking endogenous proteins.</title><p>Intracellular expression of hs2dAb.

Although several studies indeed report efficient use of intrabodies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaiser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lobato and Rabbitts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stocks, 2005</xref>]), this is limited to antibody scaffolds that resist to the reducing environment of the cytosol. We evaluated the use of the hs2dAb scaffold to develop intrabodies. Randomly chosen hs2dAbs were fused to a fluorescent protein and observed in living cells. In comparison to our previous experience with scFv or nanobody libraries in which a majority of tested antibodies showed aggregation when expressed in the cytosol as an EGFP-fusion, most of the hs2dAbs tested here gave a monodispersed fluorescence, and very few were showing aggregates. Monodispersed fluorescence of the EGFP has been proposed to be a convenient indicator of stability and potential use as intrabody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guglielmi et al., 2011</xref>). Several hs2dAb directed against actin, tubulin, EGFP or p53 were tested for their ability to trace intracellular antigens in living cells. None of the anti-tubulin or anti-actin antibodies tested were found localized on microtubule or microfilament, respectively, in living cells. We reasoned that this poor efficiency may be linked to the antigen denaturating conditions used during the selection of antibodies directed against actin. The existence of a large pool of unpolymerized actin and tubulin may also prevent efficient recruitment on the polymers. In contrast, several anti-GFP and anti-mCherry hs2dAbs were found to efficiently label their targets, like for example GFP-Rab6 or Myr-Palm-mCherry fusion proteins, in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, the anti-p53 hs2dAb fused to mCherry were clearly accumulated in the nucleus of SKBR3 cells where endogenous p53 is also localized. This signal was enhanced in cells overexpressing p53-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This further confirmed the binding specificity of the hs2dAb anti-p53 while expressed in the reducing cytosol. Effective intrabodies were also obtained against HP1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (lower panel) shows that anti-HP1 expressed as an EGFP tagged protein in HeLa cells localized in the nucleus where it labels condensed structures similar to HP1 usual staining. In contrast, a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was obtained using non relevant hs2dAbs fused to EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, upper panel).</p><p>These results indicate that functional intrabodies can be obtained at high frequency using the NaLi-H1 library. Intrabodies can be used, upon fusion with a fluorescent protein, to track the dynamics of their target in living cells (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>). Such an application is illustrated in the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> where an hs2dAb directed against mCherry is used to track mCherry-fused Rab6 in living cells. Intrabodies may allow not only to track the dynamics of their cellular target, but also to perturb, or block, their activity. Our results indeed indicate that the H12 antibody was able to perturb endogenous RHO activity when expressed in the cytosol. We could not directly image enrichment of the H12 antibodies in cellular sub-domains in living cells but we observed that H12 may behave as an efficient intrabody carrying out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. H12 carrying a carboxy-terminal myc tag was expressed in HeLa cells together with either the CBD-fused RHOA DN or with the CBD-RHOA CA mutants. H12 was pulled-down by RHOA CA but not by inactive RHOA DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). H12 thus worked as an intrabody and kept its conformation sensitivity in the cytosol. Because RHO GTPases are involved in signaling pathways that promotes the actin cytoskeleton polymerization, we looked at functional effects induced by H12 overexpression. In contrast to un-transfected cells or cells transfected with various non-relevant EGFP fused hs2dAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, upper panel), we observed that cells expressing H12-EGFP were totally devoid of actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lower panel). This alteration in actin filament organization was associated with marked changed in cell shape characteristic of loss of intracellular mechanical forces and tension. As RHOA plays a major role in activating myosin II and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, our results suggested that H12 efficiently perturbed RHO-dependent signaling, mimicking the phenotype induced by the C3 exoenzyme RHO inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16228-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.015</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>mcherry-Rab6 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells together with an anti-mCherry hs2dAb fused to GFP. 24 hr after transfection, cells were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16228.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16228.015</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16228.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Targeting cellular proteins using inhibitory antibodies or by functionalizing antibodies to induce protein knockdown.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells expressing transiently a EGFP-tagged non relevant hs2dAB (top panel) or EGFP-H12 anti RHO-GTP (bottom panel) were fixed 20 hr post transfection and stained using DAPI and Alexa 594 phalloidin to detect actin stress fibers.

However, it is possible to functionalize non-blocking intrabodies to inhibit their target function. One approach relies on the ubiquitinylation and degradation of the recognized target as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caussinus et al. (2011)</xref>. This approach is based on the fusion of intrabodies to an F-box domain which allows interaction with Skip1, a member of the SCF complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the complex E1/E2/E3 ubiquitinylation machinery, that targets proteins to proteasome-dependent cellular degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This approach was efficiently developed to target several EGFP fusion proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using a single anti EGFP intrabody, named GFP4, which is a robust and high affinity EGFP llama intrabody originally isolated from an immune library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>). To get insight into the relative functionality of hs2dAb for such a protein interference approach, several of the anti EGFP hs2dAb selected from the NaLi-H1 library were fused at their amino terminus to the Fbox domain and their efficacy was compared to the efficacy of the Fbox-GFP4 nanobody. To detect cells expressing Fbox-intrabody fusion proteins (F-Ib), we constructed a bicistronic vector driving the co-expression of F-Ib together with a mitochondria-targeted mCherry (Mito-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We expressed the F-Ib antibodies in a HeLa clone stably expressing EGFP fused to histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silljé et al., 2006</xref>) and looked for EGFP-H2B depletion. As expected, F-GFP4, also known as degradFP, induced a strong reduction of H2B-EGFP expression as analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, a strong reduction in nuclear fluorescence intensity was observed in cells expressing F-GFP4 (see mito-mCherry positive cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). No effect was observed when expressing either GFP4 alone or a GFP4 fused to a truncated, nonfunctional, Fbox domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). When anti-EGFP clones selected from the NaLi-H1 library were tested, we observed that some of the hs2dAb that were found to active as fluorescent intrabodies failed to degrade H2B-EGFP when expressed as F-Ib. This highlights the fact that not all intrabodies can efficiently be functionalized with the F-box and that in vivo binding to a target is not the only parameter to consider. However, several hs2dAb anti-EGFP induced a complete disappearance of nuclear H2B-EGFP signal when expressed as F-Ib (F-R3TF3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) while no reduction was observed when using an anti-EGFP that cannot be used as an intrabody (F-R3TG4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). FACS analysis showed a decreased of fluorescence intensity by as much as 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, this effect was reversed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Altogether, these experiments show that the hs2dAb scaffold enables the frequent selection of antibodies that can be expressed in the mammalian cell cytoplasm to be used as functional fluorescent or inhibitory intrabodies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report the construction of the first large fully synthetic single domain antibody library based on a humanized scaffold derived from llama VHH. A set of robust nanobody scaffolds was first identified using a positive expression screening in <italic>E. coli</italic> cytosol. One very robust scaffold (sdAb<sup>D10</sup>) was identified and was used as a base. After introduction of several modifications that aimed at humanizing its primary sequence, we designed the hs2dAb scaffold which is as stable as sdAb<sup>D10</sup> while being closer to human VH3. Our data indicate that the hs2dAb displays partial resistance and/or refolding after treatment for 10 min at 90°C. Using CDR grafting experiments we confirmed the efficacy and the stability of the synthetic scaffold to display CDR regions. Based on our prior experience on phage display libraries, immune or naïve llama VHH libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monegal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</xref>) or from scFv libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitrov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goffinet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>) we then rationally designed CDR diversity with fixed CDR1 and CDR2 size and four CDR3 sizes (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids). The power of modern gene synthesis approach permits to reach very high genetic diversity while controlling codon bias and cloning features. Fully random codon combination using NNN or NNK trinucleotide cannot prevent stop codon, undesired cysteine or hydrophobic residues to be incorporated, and it does not lead to the controlled probability of amino acid occurrence at a given position. Therefore a more rational design was implemented with defined set of codons for each CDR amino acid position so that it does not mimic natural diversity, in contrast to recently developed Fab synthetic libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prassler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>), but is rather optimized for intrinsic hydrophilicity or solubility. After a large-scale cloning of synthetic fragments, 3 billion independent clones were transformed in the bacteria. Library quality was confirmed by Sanger and next generation sequencing.</p><p>The library was validated by screening against various targets and in each case specific and highly functional antibodies were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Various selection schemes yielded a large diversity of high affinity and high selectivity binders. Selections were carried out using purified antigen coated on polystyrene, on magnetic beads or directly on the cell surface. In many cases, two rounds of selection were sufficient to obtain selective binders. We usually analyzed only 80 randomly picked clones because the diversity of specific binders was systemically high. Only a few selections led to antibodies usable in western blotting (anti-actin, ant-tubulin) probably because most screenings were done using natively folded targets.

Because it is a fully synthetic, non immune, library, it does not depend on animal experimentation, it is not limited by natural immunogenicity or toxicity of antigens and allows to develop and adjust the selection without ethic consideration. In addition, because all steps are carried out in vitro, conditions can be tightly controlled. This allowed to develop powerful differential selection and to identify conformation-specific antibodies. This also allowed to directly screen for antibodies directed against antigens specifically present at the surface of a particular cell type. Such a differential selection will be a powerful approach to identify novel antigen at the surface of tumor or infected cells. Such antibodies may also represent powerful tools for diagnostic and therapeutic applications to target cells in human pathologies. For example, after dimerization using Fc domains, hs2dAb antibodies may be used to target tumor cells and benefit from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) for example. They may also be used directly as the smallest antibody-derived domain naked as an agonist or antagonist or armed for enhanced toxicity. Similarly, it may be labeled using radioactive compounds (e.g. <sup>99</sup>mTc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>64</sup>Cu) and used to image tumors in patient using positron emission tomography. Altogether, he NaLi-H1 library may accelerate the identification of novel potent tools to be used in human clinical applications.</p><p>The synthetic scaffold we defined was based on the selection of a set of VHH able to fold properly in the bacteria cytosol. The goal was not only to define a robust scaffold that would be efficiently produced without aggregation but also to allow frequent selection of functional intrabodies. Intrabodies have been isolated from various antibody libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vercruysse et al., 2010</xref>) as well as other protein scaffold like Darpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tamaskovic et al., 2012</xref>) or FN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koide et al., 2012</xref>) which are devoid of cysteine. A peculiar feature of the NaLi-H1 library is that it is based on a humanized nanobody-like robust scaffold, stable in a reducing environment, while it still contains the two canonical cysteine residues. Stabilized nanobodies, human single domain scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christ et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saerens et al., 2005</xref>) and libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mandrup et al., 2013</xref>) were reported before. However, to our knowledge, no synthetic library producing at high frequency functional intrabodies was developed before based on such stabilized scaffolds. Almost every hs2dAb antibodies we expressed in mammalian cytosol showed no sign of aggregation, which further supported the idea that the synthetic scaffold we designed is robust and highly resistant to reduction. Previous studies showed that functional intrabody identification often relied on additional steps of selection in a protein–protein interaction reporter system such as PCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch et al., 2006</xref>) or bacterial 2 hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pellis et al., 2012</xref>), yeast IACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2010</xref>) or F2H assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zolghadr et al., 2008</xref>). Using the NaLi-H1 library, we observed that without using particular selection schemes, functional intrabodies were frequently obtained. Although we did not formally compare the NaLi-H1 library to previous llama naïve or semi synthetic libraries, the functionality of selected hs2dAb was compared to a sub-nanomolar affinity intrabody, the GFP4 nanobody, which has been extensively used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>). We observed by monitoring its signal-to-noise ratio and by using it in a protein knockdown assay that NaLi-H1 can provide highly functional hs2dAb which appeared as good as intrabodies from immune libraries.</p><p>Intrabodies can be used in several applications like tracking of intracellular dynamics of endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizak et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>) but the most appealing application is to use them for rapid protein inactivation in living cells. Intrabodies may be used to directly block their target proteins in cells. One of the conformation-sensitive antibody that was selected can be used to inhibit active RHO GTPase signaling in living cells and is as potent as the C3 exoenzyme toxin. Only few intrabodies have been described to be intrinsically inhibitors of protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vercruysse et al., 2010</xref>), and our results suggest that the NaLi-H1 library may enable rapid selection of inhibitory antibodies. The next challenge will be to select conformational sensors specifically directed against a particular member of closely related RHO subtypes (RHOA/B/C) which share more than 90% similarity in primary sequence. But in any case, our results show that the NaLi-H1 library allows the selection of efficient, conformation-specific, inhibitory intrabodies.</p><p>Another way intrabodies may be used to inactivate their targets in living cells is to fuse the intrabody to a dominant inhibitory domain. Following an idea pioneered by Affolter and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>), we showed here that intrabodies selected from the NaLi-H1 library can be fused to a proteasome-targeting domain to impose the specific degradation of their respective targets. This protein interference approach was validated using anti-EGFP hs2dAb and we believe that this approach will bring disruptive tools to generate rapid protein knockdown both in cell culture and in the animal.</p><p>In summary, we have designed a novel nanobody scaffold endowed with improved stability and created a highly diverse library, the NaLi-H1 library, that was successfully screened to identify highly functional binders directed against very diverse targets. We believe that this library will allow the fast, and fully in vitro, identification of immunological tools usable both for fundamental and medical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>Artificial gene synthesis (Mr Gene, GmbH, Germany) composed of a 6His-Tag and a triple c-myc Tag was inserted into the pHEN2 phagemid vector (Griffin 1. library) between NotI and BamHI sites.

Three general advices can be given here: (1) In roughly 70% of the screen, specific clones were obtained. In many case, when not specific binders were recovered, we identified the antigen that was used as the principal cause of failure. It is often a good idea to insist and use an alternative target preparation and ensure its proper display during the selection phases. (2) A key step to obtain specific clones is the washing step. They should be extensive, numerous and in large volume, changing tubes several times. While it is always a good idea to start washing as quickly as possible, if the affinity of the hs2dAb obtained is too low then extended washing steps may be used in a subsequent screening to select for a low k<sub>off</sub>. (3) We usually test for binders after the second and third rounds of selection, and more rarely after a fourth round. The method used to identify binders at the end of the selection should to be as close as possible to plan usage of the recombinant antibody. If immunofluorescence is planned, it ideally should be used to identify specific binders. If western blotting is the major application, It should be the preferred method to be used.</p><p>Immunotubes (Nunc) were coated with βActin at a concentration of 20 µg/mL in PBS overnight at 4°C.

Efficient recovery was checked analyzing fractions of bound and unbound samples by Western blot using streptavidin-HRP or anti-AviTag antibodies. Antigen coated beads were incubated for 2 hr with the phage library (10<sup>13</sup> phages diluted in 1 mL of PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 2% non-fat milk). Phages were previously adsorbed on naked streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (to remove nonspecific binders). Phages bound to streptavidin-coated beads were recovered on a magnet and beads were washed 10 times (round 1) or 20 times (round 2 and 3) with PBS+Tween 0.1% on a magnet.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describing the generation of a synthetic nanobody library with an optimized humanized scaffold, illustrates its usefulness by showing examples of successful selection of antibodies against different antigens, including conformation-specific nanobodies, and demonstrates the use of some of these antibodies as intrabodies for protein detection and degradation. Previously, immunization of Camelids was necessary to isolate functional nanobodies. With the NaLi-H1 library this immunization step is removed and the screening is entirely performed in vitro, where at each step the conditions can be controlled and manipulated. This has several advantages as no animal experimentation is needed, and binders to highly conserved or toxic antigens can be isolated. The provided data suggest that the library will be a useful and versatile tool for selection of various nanobodies. Some of the described antibodies, such as the conformation-specific nanobody against active Rho, will be directly useful for the cell-biological community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The library is assessed for diversity by sequencing, but not at all for functionality in terms of nanobody expression, folding and solubility. Given that the library only partially attempts to mimic natural diversity, reducing the levels of hydrophobic amino acids, there is a danger that attempts to improve upon nature may lead to increased aggregation/poor folding etc. Consequently, it would be important to assess the levels of functional expression of 24-48 random clones picked from the library. This could be done by assessing the levels of soluble expression levels, or preferably, using protein A (if protein A binds to the scaffold, given that it is VH3-like) to assess the percentage of protein A binding clones – which would provide an assessment of correct folding.</p><p>2) The staining of endogenous proteins with and without knockouts mediated by siRNA or Crispr-CAS9 should be demonstrated for the original anti-lamin nanobodies using the difficult scaffolds, as well as subsequently selected nanobodies. This will show first that the nanobodies are functional against natural proteins at natural levels, and second that there is no off-target binding (if knockout eliminates staining). Furthermore, functional positive control antibodies should also be included as comparisons.</p><p>3) Wherever the phrase &quot;data not shown&quot; is used, either the data should be shown (in the supplementary), or the phrase should be eliminated. Supplementary files attached to primary figures allow all data to be shown.</p><p>4) Where western blots are shown (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) show the whole blot, not just that portion { ± } 5KDa around the expected target size.</p><p>5) During the description of the library the authors mention () that the purified <italic>sdAb<sup>D10</sup></italic> shows stability after heat treatment.

Assessing the folding of non-binding clones is challenging. Although the binding to Protein A and Protein L has indeed been described for some VH3 (Potter, Li and Capra.J Immunol 1996; 157:2982-2988; Rodrigo, Gruvegård and Van Alstine. Antibodies 2015, 4, 259-277), the hs2dAb scaffold cannot bind Protein A nor Protein L. We believe that the synthetic scaffold does not preserve the binding interface of some natural VH3 and mainly does not contain the residues in CDR2 that determine this interaction. Alternatively, to assess the relative folding of hs2dAb, we picked randomly 26 clones and carried out sequential ultracentrifugation. We also analyzed the behavior of a few selected clones directed against GFP, mCherry or lamin, as well as the natural anti-GFP nanobody GFP (also known as Chromobody). All the antibodies we tested were found (~100% ) in the supernatant after a 250 000 g spin. After warming at 90°C for 20 minutes, over 70% stays in the supernatant confirming strong resistance to denaturation. We now provide these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The staining of endogenous proteins with and without knockouts mediated by siRNA or Crispr-CAS9 should be demonstrated for the original anti-lamin nanobodies using the difficult scaffolds, as well as subsequently selected nanobodies. This will show first that the nanobodies are functional against natural proteins at natural levels, and second that there is no off-target binding (if knockout eliminates staining). Furthermore, functional positive control antibodies should also be included as comparisons.</italic> </p><p>A similar point was raised by Reviewer #2. The specificity of the anti-Lamin antibody is quite clear as it is simply a CDR grafting from a published antibody and we obtained the same staining. However, we recognize that we should do a better job showing the specificity of some of the selected binders. We added an shRNA + UV treatment experiment for the anti-p53 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using siRNA was more complicated for HP1 because of inter- dependence that exist between the different isoform of HP1. As it would be beyond the scope of this article to study HP1 we decided not to provide siRNA data. Instead we carried out immunofluorescence upon overexpression of the different isoforms as well as western blotting (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These experiments suggest that the selected HP1 antibody is directed against α, β and γ HP1. We also carried out nocodazole and cytochalasin D experiments to characterize better the anti-tubulin and anti-actin hs2dAb, respectively (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Wherever the phrase &quot;data not shown&quot; is used, either the data should be shown (in the supplementary), or the phrase should be eliminated. Supplementary files attached to primary figures allow all data to be shown.</italic> </p><p>We removed the data not shown statements. In particular, we now show control experiments for p53 and HP1 antibodies.</p><p><italic>4) Where western blots are shown (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) show the whole blot, not just that portion { ± } 5KDa around the expected arget size.</italic> </p><p>We already provided the full blot when we tested our novel anti-tubulin and actin antibodies because it was important in this experiment to see the potential background. For the pull down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) we thought that it would be less important because what we score is whether the protein is pulled-down or not; such an experiments could be done by dot blot with essentially the same precision. In any case, we now provide the full, un-cropped, blots as supplementary data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Note that we performed a new set of pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) because previous un-cropped blots were slightly dirty.</p><p><italic>5) During the description of the library the authors mention () that the purified sdAb<sup>D10</sup> shows stability after heat treatment. They support this observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> panel B. One of the advantages of nanobody is their heat stability so the heat-purification experiment at 70 °C is not sufficient to support the claim that such scaffold is a better &quot;heat-resistant&quot; nanobody. This claim should be better supported or removed.</italic> </p><p>We indeed did not test extensively heat resistance of the new scaffold. However, our conclusions were still mild (&quot;Purified <italic>sdAb<sub>D10</sub></italic> showed excellent solubility, stability after heat treatment<italic>…</italic>&quot;) but it is true that only a 70 °C treatment was used. We now have tested a 90 °C treatment and confirmed partial resistance to heat denaturation. We however clarified our conclusions by removing “heat-resistant” and we now indicate that &quot;<italic>sdAb<sub>D10</sub></italic>showed excellent solubility, stability after treatment at 70 °C and we did not observe aggregation&quot;. In the Discussion we now mention that the hs2dAb displays &quot;the hs2dAb displays partial resistance and/or refolding after treatment for 20 min at 90°C.&quot;</p><p><italic>6) Please explain in a bit more detail how the diversity in the CDR3 was introduced, especially in the Materials and methods section.</italic> </p><p>More details are now provided in the Methods section. Because we thought that it may now be too long to be included in the main text, we now summarize the methods we used for library construction in the main material and methods section and provide more data in the Appendix.</p><p><italic>7) Since this publication is mainly supposed to be a method-based, resource paper, it would greatly benefit from an extended description of a general protocol outline for the isolation of binders (starting from the preparation of the antigen, to the phage display and to the final screening method, with a few tips and tricks at the crucial steps). Researchers that want to use the NaLi-H1 library could use this as a starting point.</italic> </p><p>We used a variety of protocols in this manuscript that we outlined in the previous version. We have now added a sort of generic &quot;tips and tricks&quot; summary as an introduction to the screening methods.</p><p><italic>8) The authors present the success stories, but it would be good to know what percentage of attempted antibody screens was not successful.</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting data indeed but not simple to provide because in some case, the screen fails at first but then, tuning the conditions, it finally succeeds. Probably more than 70% of the screens eventually work. When they failed, we generally identified the antigen as being the main cause. We now indicate these points in the generic &quot;tips and tricks&quot; header (see point #7).</p><p><italic>9) Please make sure that a proper disclaimer regarding your financial interest in the commercial distribution of the library is provided in the published version of the paper.</italic> </p><p>We indicated this in the manuscript (Competing financial interests).
