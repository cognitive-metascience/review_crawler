During adaptation, the Cas1-Cas2 complex integrates fragments of invader DNA as spacers in the CRISPR array. Recently, an additional protein Cas4 has been implicated in selection and processing of prespacer substrates for Cas1-Cas2, although this mechanism remains unclear. We show that Cas4 interacts directly with Cas1-Cas2 forming a Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex that captures and processes prespacers prior to integration. Structural analysis of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex reveals two copies of Cas4 that closely interact with the two integrase active sites of Cas1, suggesting a mechanism for substrate handoff following processing. We also find that the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex processes single-stranded DNA provided in cis or in trans with a double-stranded DNA duplex. Cas4 cleaves precisely upstream of PAM sequences, ensuring the acquisition of functional spacers. Our results explain how Cas4 cleavage coordinates with Cas1-Cas2 integration and defines the exact cleavage sites and specificity of Cas4.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44248.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many people have now heard of CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, as a gene editing technology. Yet CRISPR evolved in bacteria to protect them against viral infections. While parts of the CRISPR system are now being widely used, the research community still does not know everything about how the system operates in its natural setting.</p><p>In bacteria, CRISPR protects against infection by making lasting records of viruses a cell has encountered. It cuts short sections from the viral DNA and keeps them as a way to fight the virus if it ever returns. The key proteins in collecting and storing the virus DNA are called Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4. Previous work suggests that Cas4 is important for cutting suitable lengths of DNA for storage. Yet, how Cas4, Cas1 and Cas2 work together to select, cut and store DNA is not well studied.</p><p>Lee et al. have now used electron microscopy to examine how Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4 cooperate in the CRISPR system. The proteins studied came from bacteria called <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic>. The structure revealed direct links between the Cas1 and Cas4 proteins that likely help to ensure these proteins are coordinated correctly to cut and store the DNA sections. Specifically, it showed that two Cas4 proteins interact with the two key active sites of Cas1. The findings also highlight that Cas4 cuts DNA at specific locations to make sure the resulting DNA sections are suitable for CRISPR protection.</p><p>The close association between Cas1 and Cas4 could be a critical aspect of the reliability of the CRISPR system in protecting bacteria from viruses. There are more bacteria on Earth than any other living thing. Understanding their biology has wide ranging environmental, health and bioengineering applications. In addition, learning more about the CRISPR system could further expand its potential to drive revolutionary biotechnology tools derived from these bacterial immune systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>B. halodurans</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>DNA-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>PAM</kwd><kwd>nuclease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sashital</surname><given-names>Dipali G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During CRISPR adaptation, Cas4 forms a ternary complex with the Cas1-Cas2 spacer integration complex, an interaction that coordinates substrate hand-off following precise, PAM-dependent prespacer processing prior to integration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria and archaea use an adaptive immune system composed of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to defend against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>). Within this system, the CRISPR locus is programmed with ‘spacer’ sequences that are derived from foreign DNA and serve as a record of prior infection events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolotin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mojica et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pourcel et al., 2005</xref>). The host adapts to an infection event when Cas proteins insert short fragments from the invader DNA as new spacers between repeating sequence elements within the CRISPR locus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). The locus is transcribed and processed into short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which assemble with Cas proteins to form a RNA-guided surveillance complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hochstrasser and Doudna, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charpentier et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, the surveillance complex recognizes the target bearing complementarity to the crRNA sequence and a Cas nuclease cleaves or degrades the target during the interference stage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marraffini, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although the machinery and mechanisms involved in CRISPR interference are extremely diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>), the adaptation proteins Cas1 and Cas2 are conserved among most CRISPR systems, suggesting a common molecular mechanism for acquiring spacers. Cas1 and Cas2 form a heterohexameric complex that catalyzes spacer integration via two transesterification reactions mediated by nucleophilic attack of the 3ʹ-hydroxyl on each strand of a double-stranded prespacer substrate at the phosphodiester backbone within the CRISPR array. Integration occurs at the first repeat in the CRISPR array, with one attack occurring between the upstream leader sequence and the repeat and the other occurring on the opposite strand between the repeat and first spacer within the array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arslan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nuñez et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rollie et al., 2015</xref>). These reactions result in the insertion of the prespacer between two single-strand repeats, and this gapped intermediate is repaired by host factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ivančić-Baće et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to form a functional spacer, the adaptation complex must capture and process longer fragments of DNA from the invader containing a flanking sequence called a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nuñez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). The PAM is an essential motif during target recognition by the surveillance complex and must be present next to the target in order for interference to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deveau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sashital et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Semenova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). However, the PAM is not part of the spacer and must be removed from the prespacer prior to integration through a processing step. In addition, integration must occur in the correct orientation to produce a crRNA that is complementary to the PAM-containing strand of the invader.</p><p>In some systems, additional Cas proteins, such as Cas4, are also required during adaptation. Cas4 is widespread in type I, II, and V systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hudaiberdiev et al., 2017</xref>). In in vivo studies, deletion of <italic>cas4</italic> reduced the adaptation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and resulted in the acquisition of non-functional spacers from regions that lacked a correct PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almendros et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kieper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiimori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Some systems have two <italic>cas4</italic> genes that work together to define the PAM, length and orientation of spacers, suggesting that the two Cas4 proteins are involved in processing each end of the prespacer and that they may be present during integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiimori et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, in vitro studies have suggested that Cas4 is involved in PAM-dependent prespacer processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rollie et al., 2018</xref>). Cas4 endonucleolytically cleaves PAM-containing 3ʹ-single-stranded overhangs that flank double-stranded prespacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, Cas4 cleavage activity is dependent on the presence of Cas1 and Cas2, and Cas4 inhibits premature integration of unprocessed prespacers. These observations suggest that Cas4 associates with the Cas1-Cas2 complex, although direct biochemical and structural evidence for this Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plagens et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that Cas4 forms a complex with Cas1-Cas2 in the presence of dsDNA. Using single-particle negative-stain electron microscopy (EM), we determined the architecture of <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic> type I-C Cas1-Cas2 and Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complexes. Unlike the symmetrical Cas1<sub>4</sub>-Cas2<sub>2</sub> structure, we observed a mixture of symmetrical (Cas4<sub>2</sub>-Cas1<sub>4</sub>-Cas2<sub>2</sub>) and asymmetrical (Cas4<sub>1</sub>-Cas1<sub>4</sub>-Cas2<sub>2</sub>) complexes, suggesting a structural mechanism for distinguishing between the PAM and non-PAM end of the prespacer following processing. The positioning of Cas4 places it in close proximity to the Cas1 active site, suggesting a mechanism for substrate handoff following prespacer processing. Surprisingly, the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex processes single-strand DNA when an activator duplex DNA is provided in trans. Using this ssDNA cleavage assay, we show that the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex is highly specific for PAM sequences and cleaves precisely upstream of the PAM. In a duplex substrate, the PAM must be positioned within a single-strand region for optimal cleavage, but Cas4 can cleave at various locations within this single-stranded overhang. Collectively, these findings provide the first structural information of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 adaptation complex and reveal the precision and specificity of prespacer processing prior to integration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>B. halodurans</italic> type I-C Cas4 associates tightly with Cas1 but were unable to obtain the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex due to instability of the Cas1-Cas2 complex in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesized that a CRISPR DNA substrate may help stabilize the complex. To test this possibility, we designed a CRISPR hairpin ‘target’ substrate containing a 10 bp leader, the full 32 bp repeat, and a 5 bp spacer, mimicking the region of the CRISPR at which integration occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We incubated the individually purified Cas1 and Cas2 proteins with hairpin target DNA in equimolar amounts and removed unassociated DNA via ion-exchange chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography to remove free Cas proteins. Incubation of individual components with or without the hairpin target led to different elution volumes from a size-exclusion column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the absence of the target, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins generated two separate peaks, which correspond to the peaks of each individual component. When Cas1 and Cas2 were incubated with the target DNA, the proteins eluted earlier as a single peak, while unassociated Cas2 eluted at the original elution volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).

The segmented density clearly reveals the base Cas1-Cas2 architecture, along with additional density corresponding to two molecules of Cas4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). During 3D classification of particles, we observed two classes containing approximately 50% of Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 particles that appeared to contain density for only a single Cas4 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A subset of these particles was refined as a separate 21 Å 3D reconstruction without symmetry enforced, revealing an asymmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex with 1:4:2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These particles may represent ternary complexes in a partially dissociated state, or incomplete formation of the 2:4:2 stoichiometry complex due to reduced affinity for Cas4 within the ternary complex.</p><p>In both the symmetrical and asymmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 reconstructions, the Cas4 and Cas1 densities are contiguous but Cas4 appears to be distinct from the Cas2 density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This suggests that Cas4 interacts with Cas1 but not Cas2 within the ternary complex, similar to the tight interaction we have previously observed between Cas4 and Cas1 in the absence of Cas2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). However, the interaction surface between Cas4-Cas1 appears to be different in the context of the binary and ternary complexes, suggesting that Cas4 and Cas1 may have two alternative modes of interaction.</p><p>A high-resolution structure of the BhCas4 sequence is not available, and the closest homolog from <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic> (PDB 4R5Q) contains a long N-terminal domain that is likely not present in the BhCas4 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Therefore, for modeling Cas4 into the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 density, we used a predicted structural model (see Materials and methods) that reflects the putatively more compact BhCas4 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Fitting this structural model into the segmented Cas4 density revealed four possible orientations of the protein with respect to Cas1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C–E</xref>). The segmented density for Cas4 is smaller than the structure and parts of the structure fit into the Cas1 density, suggesting that the segmentation between Cas1 and Cas4 densities was incomplete due to low resolution as has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pintilie et al., 2010</xref>). All four orientations position the Cas4 active site with varying degrees of proximity (19–38 Å) to the Cas1 active sites that bind the 3ʹ-OH end of the prespacer in structures of Cas1-Cas2-prespacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D–E</xref>). These active sites act as integrases for the two steps of integration. The proximity between Cas4 and the Cas1 active site suggests that the product of Cas4 cleavage could transit to the integrase active sites following cleavage.</p><p>The Cas1-Cas2 and Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 EM volumes did not contain any obvious cylindrical density corresponding to the hairpin target DNA, consistent with prior observations that DNA is not readily observable by negative-stain single-particle EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hochstrasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nogales and Scheres, 2015</xref>). We also note that the Cas4 density lies along the same surface of Cas1 that is expected to interact with elements within the CRISPR array during half-site and full-site integration, based on crystal structures of these intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that the CRISPR hairpin target is either not present in the complex, or that it is bound in an alternate location. The observation that DNA co-elutes with the complex from the size-exclusion column disfavors the former possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, in the highest-resolution symmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 reconstruction, we observe additional density along the prespacer-binding surface of Cas2, but not the repeat-binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> middle). Although we cannot definitively define this density as DNA, this observation suggests the DNA may be bound on the prespacer side of the complex and that the CRISPR target in our complex is not bound along the same surface as in prior crystal structures. Together, these observations suggest that Cas4 binding may be mutually exclusive with CRISPR binding along the repeat-binding surface, and that Cas4 may dissociate prior to integration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Formation of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex with prespacer substrate</title><p>Although we hypothesized that the CRISPR hairpin target would stabilize the Cas1-Cas2 complex by binding along the repeat-binding surface, our structural studies of complexes formed in the presence of the hairpin target suggest this is not the case. Notably, the prespacer-binding surface of Cas2 interacts with DNA through non-specific backbone contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nuñez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), and no structure of Cas1-Cas2 bound to CRISPR DNA alone has been previously reported. This could suggest that any dsDNA, including the CRISPR target, may preferentially bind along the prespacer-binding surface and that other DNA substrates binding in that location could promote stable complex formation. We therefore attempted to form the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex using a prespacer substrate containing a 24 bp duplex with 15-nt 3ʹ overhangs containing 5ʹ-GAA-3ʹ PAM sequences, which we previously showed is processed by Cas4 in the presence of Cas1 and Cas2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Using a modified protocol (see Materials and methods), we were able to successfully purify a peak containing Cas4, Cas1, Cas2, and prespacer DNA from a size-exclusion column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The peak eluted slightly later than the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-target complex, likely due to the smaller size of the DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As with the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-target complex, all three proteins and DNA were present in the peak fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the prespacer complex has a similar architecture to the complex bound to the CRISPR hairpin target, we performed negative stain EM analysis of Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-prespacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). The 2D class averages revealed fewer symmetrical classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and 3D classification revealed a smaller proportion of particles containing two copies of Cas4 relative to particles containing one or no copies of Cas4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data suggest that Cas4 is less stably bound in the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-prespacer complex than in a complex containing a longer dsDNA. Both EM densities were at a lower resolution than the complexes solved using the hairpin target (symmetrical EM density 22 Å, asymmetrical EM density 24 Å). Although features are less well-defined for these lower resolution densities, the overall architecture is similar between the complexes containing the two different DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), indicating that complex formation occurs similarly regardless of the type of DNA substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cas4 is activated for ssDNA processing in the presence of dsDNA</title><p>The observation that the presence of dsDNA substrates stabilized the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex prompted us to hypothesize that binding to the CRISPR DNA may enhance processing activity by stimulating complex formation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed cleavage of the prespacer substrate containing a 24 bp duplex with 15-nt 3ʹ overhangs containing 5ʹ-GAA-3ʹ PAM sequences, in the absence or presence of CRISPR DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, we tested cleavage of a single 39-nt strand of this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, for the ssDNA substrate, we observed cleavage product in the presence of the CRISPR DNA, while the DNA remained uncleaved in the absence of the CRISPR DNA or Cas4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, we observed similar amounts of cleavage for duplex prespacers with and without the CRISPR, suggesting that the presence of the CRISPR DNA only enhances cleavage of the ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, we previously showed that cleavage of the duplex prespacer is dependent on having a PAM present in the single-stranded overhang, indicating that cleavage occurs in a PAM-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, both the ssDNA substrate and the duplex substrate produced the same length product, suggesting they were cleaved at the PAM site located within the 3ʹ-overhang of the duplex substrate. These data suggest that Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 can cleave PAM sites in ssDNA when a CRISPR DNA is provided in trans, and that the dsDNA region present within the duplex prespacer is sufficient to stimulate complex formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44248.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Single-stranded DNA processing by the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of prespacer cleavage assay for (<bold>B</bold>).

Notably, although the cleavage product for the duplex prespacer was integrated into the CRISPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), no integration product was visible for the single-stranded substrate following processing even at increased image contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the absence of Cas4, a small amount of unprocessed integration product was visible when the image contrast was increased for both the ssDNA and duplex prespacer. Together, these results suggest that although Cas1 can integrate ssDNA, optimal integration requires that the single-stranded region be attached to a duplex, which may facilitate handoff of the processed end from Cas4 to the Cas1 active site.</p><p>Our results suggest that any dsDNA, not just the CRISPR DNA, may enhance ssDNA cleavage activity either when present in cis with the ssDNA region or when provided in trans. To test these possibilities, we performed a cleavage assay with two sets of substrates: a 25 bp duplex with one 25-nt 3ʹ overhang or 5ʹ-end-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled 25-nt ssDNA with an unlabeled blunt-end 25 bp duplex added in trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

For the ssDNA substrate, no cleavage was observed in the absence or at low concentrations of dsDNA, while cleavage product accumulated at higher dsDNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A similar amount of cleavage product was observed at dsDNA concentrations ≥ 100 nM, which is higher than the expected concentration of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex (50 nM). These results are consistent with our model that dsDNA directly stabilizes the complex, and that excess dsDNA should not induce additional activation. Overall, our results show that type I-C Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 adaptation complex can be stabilized by dsDNA and that, within this complex, Cas4 is activated for ssDNA cleavage for substrate provided either in cis or in trans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Precise PAM-specific DNA processing by Cas4-Cas1-Cas2</title><p>We previously showed that Cas4 processes prespacers in a PAM-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), but the exact cleavage sites and specificity of Cas4 remain unclear. The observation that Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 can process ssDNA allowed us to more precisely define the cleavage site. By using ssDNA substrates, we could more readily test sequences containing multiple PAM sites or a variety of sequences, and additionally include primer-binding sites for Sanger sequencing reactions. We first conducted prespacer processing assays using ssDNA substrates containing a 5ʹ-GAA-3ʹ PAM between T-rich sequences in the presence of activating dsDNA. Comparison with ddNTP Sanger sequencing reactions revealed that Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 precisely cleaved the ssDNA directly upstream of the PAM, while Cas1-Cas2 or Cas4 alone failed to cleave the substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To test this possibility, we designed a panel of duplex substrates in which the PAM position was varied within the single-strand overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The four different substrates yielded products of different lengths, indicating that they were cleaved based on the position of the PAM within the single-stranded overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, Cas4 processed these substrates to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). The substrate in which the PAM was located close to the duplex (two nt between duplex and PAM site) was cleaved inefficiently, while the other three substrates were cleaved with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data, along with prior results showing that Cas4 cannot cleave a PAM contained within a dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), suggest that the PAM must be located at a longer distance from the duplex to be accommodated within the Cas4 active site.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44248.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Processing of duplex prespacers with varied PAM positions in single-strand overhangs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Panel of substrates used in processing experiments.

In particular, although there has been some preliminary biochemical evidence that Cas4 directly associates with Cas1-Cas2 to form a higher-order complex, these complexes were either very weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) or formed only under renaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plagens et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we discovered that the presence of dsDNA substrates stabilizes the formation of both Cas1-Cas2 and Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complexes in the <italic>B. halodurans</italic> type I-C system. For the first time, we present the architecture of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex that mediates prespacer selection, processing, and integration during CRISPR adaptation.</p><p>Our structural analysis of <italic>B. halodurans</italic> type I-C adaptation complexes reveals a structure that is mutually exclusive with the previously determined Cas4-Cas1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In the Cas4-Cas1 complex, the two Cas1 dimers are in close proximity and would exclude the Cas2 dimer. In addition, the interaction surface between Cas1 and Cas4 appears different in the two complexes. In Cas4-Cas1, the two Cas4 molecules each interact with one wing tip of the butterfly-like Cas1 dimers. In the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex, Cas4 appears to interact along the length of one Cas1 wing. These results strongly suggest that Cas4-Cas1 must fully dissociate in order for the Cas1-Cas2 and Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex to form. Interestingly, some systems contain Cas4-1 fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hudaiberdiev et al., 2017</xref>), and a recent study indicates that the Cas4 domain performs a similar function in prespacer processing within this fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almendros et al., 2019</xref>). Complexes formed with Cas4-1 fusions would likely have altered stoichiometry from that observed in our study. The impact of this altered stoichiometry will be an intriguing line of future inquiry.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that Cas4 inhibits integration of unprocessed prespacers by Cas1-Cas2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggested that Cas4 sequesters 3ʹ-overhangs of the prespacers away from the Cas1 active site prior to processing. Our structural analysis of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex provides further evidence toward this model. Fitting of structural models into the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 reconstruction suggests that Cas4 and Cas1 interact extensively and that their active sites may be in close proximity. Thus, it is possible that Cas4 blocks binding of the ssDNA in the Cas1 active site prior to processing. Other RecB-like nucleases bind single-stranded DNA by threading the substrate through a hole formed in the donut-shaped nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Similar binding by Cas4 may prevent release of the ssDNA until cleavage, at which point the upstream product would be released, allowing handoff to the Cas1 active site and enabling integration.</p><p>Previously, we showed that Cas4 processes prespacers with duplexes flanked by 3ʹ overhangs, and that processing activity was independent of the duplex or overhang lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Our current results reveal that the duplex region of these prespacers likely activates Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 for cleavage, and that a similar processing activity can be activated when the duplex and ssDNA are provided in trans. Importantly, single-stranded substrates were processed less efficiently and were not integrated into the CRISPR array when provided in trans with the duplex, while single-strand overhangs of duplex substrates were integrated following processing. These results suggest that interactions of the prespacer duplex along the length of the Cas1-Cas2 core anchors the substrate to the complex, facilitating efficient Cas4 cleavage and direct handoff of the 3ʹ overhangs from Cas4 to Cas1. In the absence of the cis duplex, the ssDNA is likely to be released by the complex upon Cas4 cleavage due to the lack of an anchoring interaction with the complex. Therefore, a duplex DNA containing single-strand overhangs is likely the optimal Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 substrate to enable efficient cleavage and substrate handoff. It remains unclear how these types of prespacers are formed. In other CRISPR-Cas sub-types, Cas4 has been demonstrated to have exonucleolytic activity that can lead to dsDNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), although we have not observed robust exonuclease or dsDNA cleavage activity for the type I-C BhCas4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that other host factors or conditions are required to unwind ends of dsDNA, or to expose single-stranded overhangs for precise cleavage by Cas4 in the type I-C system.</p><p>Surprisingly, Cas4 processing can occur at several locations within both trans and cis ssDNA, as long as enough space is available between cleavage sites and the end of a duplex. Importantly, we do not observe Cas4-dependent PAM processing in the absence of Cas1-Cas2. These observations suggest that the Cas4 active site is activated for cleavage based on interactions with Cas1-Cas2. Once activated, Cas4 can sample any region of a single-stranded DNA that is accessible to the active site. This feature could allow more flexibility in defining prespacer substrates due to the ability of Cas4 to search for PAM sequences within single-stranded overhangs.</p><p>Previous in vitro studies have suggested that Cas4 processing is PAM-specific, although the exact position of processing was unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rollie et al., 2018</xref>). We find that processing is highly PAM-specific and occurs precisely upstream of the PAM, consistent with the expected processing position to form a functional prespacer. In these experiments, Cas4 did not appear to have strong cleavage activity at non-PAM sites, suggesting that Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 only processes the PAM-proximal end in type I-C. In type I-A from <italic>Pyrococcus furiousus</italic>, two distinct Cas4 proteins coordinate the processing of each end of the prespacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiimori et al., 2018</xref>). However, most Cas4-containing systems, including type I-C, lack a second <italic>cas4</italic> gene. It is possible that in these systems, Cas4 may define the PAM-distal end of the prespacer through an alternative cleavage activity or that another host factor is required for this processing activity.</p><p>Formation of functional spacers requires that the PAM end of the prespacer must be integrated at the leader-distal end of the repeat following prespacer processing. The precise details of how spacer orientation is defined during integration remain unknown. In type I-E, one nucleotide of the PAM is retained following prespacer processing, and this nucleotide may help to define the PAM end during integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Datsenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swarts et al., 2012</xref>). In the type I-A system, the two Cas4 proteins are required to define orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiimori et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that their presence in an adaptation complex may define the orientation of the spacer after the prespacer is fully processed. Notably, we observed asymmetrical complexes of Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 containing only one Cas4 subunit. This configuration, along with the hypothesis that Cas4 only processes the PAM end of the prespacer, could suggest that only a single copy of Cas4 is required to form a functional adaptation complex. Indeed, the asymmetrical complex may also define prespacer orientation, based on which end of the prespacer is bound at the Cas4-end of the complex. Our structural model also indicates that Cas4 may be mutually exclusive with binding at the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that the end of the asymmetrical complex lacking Cas4 may preferentially bind to the CRISPR array. We previously showed that integration occurs first at the leader-end of the repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), which is also the site of integration for the non-PAM end of the prespacer. Thus, it is possible that an asymmetrical complex may define spacer orientation by ensuring that the non-PAM end is integrated first. Future studies will be required to determine the timing of prespacer processing, CRISPR binding and whether or not Cas4 dissociation is required prior to integration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>The negative-stain EM volumes for the Cas1-Cas2-target, asymmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-target, symmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-target, asymmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-prespacer and symmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2-prespacer complexes have been deposited to EMDB under the accession numbers EMDB-20127, EMDB-20128, EMDB-20129, EMDB-20130 and EMDB-20131, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by Dipali Sashital (sashital@iastate.edu).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3)</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells were used for protein production of Cas1 and Cas2.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Malcolm F White (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While all reviewers recognize that the significance of the biochemical work, the consensus is that the conclusions from the EM work need to be strengthened, either by improving the structure resolution, or through extensive mutagenesis validation. A summary of their review comments can be found below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cas4 is prevalent in many CRISPR systems. The Sashital group and several other labs defined its important function in processing the 3ʹ-end of prespacer in a PAM-dependent and Cas1-Cas2-dependent fashion. The authors previously reported the low-resolution EM structure of the Cas4-Cas1 complex. Important questions remain to be answered. Does PAM-dependent prespacer processing take place in this complex? How does the processing lead to directional spacer integration into the CRISPR array? In this manuscript, Lee et al. reconstituted the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex by including a dsDNA substrate, and presented a 22 Å negative-staining EM structure of the <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic> Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 structure. Cas4 was found to bind Cas1 in either symmetrical or asymmetrical fashion, suggesting that its interaction with Cas1 is dynamic and could be influenced by the presence of a PAM sequence in the ssDNA overhang. The proximity of the nuclease center in Cas4 to the integration active site of Cas1 suggests a mechanism for substrate handoff following PAM-dependent processing. The PAM-dependent prespacer processing more active and precise in the context of this complex,. The authors further propose a mechanism explaining how Cas4-mediated PAM-end processing may lead to directional integration of the mature prespacer into the CRISPR locus.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major points on the negative staining EM work:</p><p>1) The current resolution of the EM structure leaves room for ambiguous interpretations. Reviewers feel that conclusions of this work would be significantly strengthened by improving the resolution to a range (i.e. 6-10 Å) that allows unambiguous docking of high-resolution structures. If it turns out improving the structure resolution is not practical at this point, the authors are strongly encouraged to carry out a set of mutagenesis experiments to support their docking model. Given that two different sets of Cas4-Cas1 contacts were observed in the Cas4-Cas1 and Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 structures, the authors may want to mutagenize the interface residues in each of the structure, and evaluate the functional consequences.</p><p>2) The Figures 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4 were not clear and the reviewers could not get a good handle on the orientation of the Cas4 proteins relative to the DNA. Figure 2 shows 20 Å EM reconstruction of the Cas1-2 and Cas1-2-4 complexes. At this resolution, the Cas1-2 complex model is probably OK and matches known structures. The extra &quot;blob&quot; in the Cas1-2-4 complexes is assigned to Cas4, however it is smaller than the smallest known Cas4, the monomeric protein from <italic>P. calidifontis</italic>. It also does not fit with the EM structure of the Cas1-4 complex previously reported by the same authors (Lee, 2018). Although the FeS cluster appeared to help, this assignment should be treated with caution. In particular, the orientation chosen for the modelled Cas4 looks close to arbitrary and should not be used as a basis for further interpretation about active site positioning.</p><p>3) The absence of density corresponding to the CRISPR DNA is troublesome and needs to be discussed by the authors. What is the rationale of using the CRISPR leader-repeat-spacer instead of the prespacer duplex to promote the formation of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex? It appears that initially the authors reasoned that target-binding may promote complex formation, but their later data seems to argue that the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex contacted the DNA rather nonspecifically, and through the prespacer-binding interface. If this is the case, to avoid possible misconceptions, the authors should make it clear that the contact does not reflect how Cas1-Cas2 recognizes the target sequence.</p><p>Major points on the biochemistry work:</p><p>1) The biochemistry experiments in this manuscript were done using prespacer substrates containing a 'perfect' duplex with ss-overhangs provided either in cis or in trans. Such substrates are rarely found in vivo. In cases when the PAM is buried in the dsDNA region, can Cas4 process the dsDNA and correctly cleave after the 3'-PAM? Can the product be integrated into the CRISPR substrate?</p><p>2) What would happen when a ss-PAM is 1-2 nucleotide away (too far or too close) from the 5-nt spacing? Does the Cas4 cleavage dictate where the integration happens?</p><p>3) Figure 3 presents some nice data showing that prespacers are cleaved by Cas4 and that this is stimulated by the presence of ds CRISPR DNA. The data on ssDNA substrates, which is discussed in depth, is likely not that relevant to the adaptation process and activity is much weaker for these substrates. In the figure legend, part C is not described. This figure does lack an important control – use of a duplex substrate with ss overhangs that lacks a PAM sequence to discriminate between a ruler mechanism and a sequence specific mechanism for cleavage by Cas4 of the relevant prespacer structures.</p><p>4) Figure 4 and 5 show convincing data supporting PAM-dependent cleavage activity by Cas1-2-4 on ssDNA substrates. This provides important new information on PAM removal by Cas4 during the capture process. It is unclear why this work has not been done with the relevant substrate, the gapped duplex shown in Figure 3B, which is cleaved more efficiently that non-relevant ssDNA. It would considerably strengthen the paper if the authors could provide some evidence that the same PAM-specific cleavage is observed with relevant duplex substrates, and this should not be hard to do.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44248.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major points on the negative staining EM work:</p><p>1) The current resolution of the EM structure leaves room for ambiguous interpretations.

Because we were unable to complete these experiments requested by the reviewers, we have made extensive changes to our structural modelling experiments, which are outlined in our response to concern #2.</p><p>1) An improvement in resolution would certainly be beneficial but will require considerable investment of time, as well as resources that are not readily available to us. The resolution range suggested by the reviewers is outside the theoretical limits of negative stain EM and would therefore require cryo-EM. This instrumentation is not currently available to our lab, which is why we pursued negative stain EM. We have also initiated an off-site collaboration in the hopes of obtaining a higher-resolution structure by cryo-EM. Unfortunately, as is often the case when moving from negative stain to cryo, it seems that cryo-EM structure determination from these samples will require considerable sample optimization. Because we are pursuing this work through collaboration, it is not possible to complete this optimization in the timeframe allowed for manuscript revisions. We also want to note that a high-resolution structure of BhCas4 is not available (see next comment) and Cas4 is a compact protein with few distinctive structural features. So, it is unclear whether the resolution range suggested by the reviewers would enable unambiguous docking of the Pcal Cas4 structure in the BhCas4 density. Generally, &lt; 6 Å resolution is required to clearly define all secondary-structural features, especially beta-strands, in a protein. We believe that this goal will have to remain the subject of future studies.</p><p>2) We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion of testing mutations in the predicted Cas4-Cas1 interface. Indeed, prior to our initial submission of this manuscript, we had attempted to predict Cas4 and Cas1 residues that could disrupt interactions upon mutation based on our structural models. However, it is important to note that high-resolution structures are not available for the <italic>B. halodurans</italic> Cas1 and Cas4 sequences. While a structure of a relatively close Cas1 homolog (<italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>, PDB 4N06, 28% identical, 65% similar) is available, the closest available Cas4 homolog structure (<italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic>, PDB 4R5Q, 15% identical, 44% similar) has several predicted structural divergences (Figure 2 —figure supplement 4A and B).</p><p>Most importantly, the entire N-terminal helix of PcCas4 is likely not present in BhCas4, while a ~20 amino acid C-terminal domain in BhCas4 is not present in the PcCas4 structure (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A). In an attempt to resolve these structural differences, we used the Phyre2 server to predict structural models of BhCas1 and BhCas4 (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B). However, we are not confident in the exact placement of amino acid sidechains within these models, especially given the lack of a potential BhCas4 C-terminal domain in the structural model. Cas4-Cas1 disruption experiments would test for negative results (i.e. loss of complex formation or Cas4 processing) and the lack of a high-resolution BhCas4 structure to guide putatively disruptive mutations could lead to false-positive loss of function (e.g. due to protein misfolding) or false negatives (e.g. due to compensatory structural rearrangements). Thus, mutagenesis experiments are premature at this point and could exacerbate the risk of overinterpreting the structural model. We have instead provided more information on potential fits of the BhCas4 structural model in the assigned Cas4 density, as outlined in the response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Figures 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4 were not clear and the reviewers could not get a good handle on the orientation of the Cas4 proteins relative to the DNA. Figure 2 shows 20 Å EM reconstruction of the Cas1-2 and Cas1-2-4 complexes. At this resolution, the Cas1-2 complex model is probably OK and matches known structures. The extra &quot;blob&quot; in the Cas1-2-4 complexes is assigned to Cas4, however it is smaller than the smallest known Cas4, the monomeric protein from P. calidifontis. It also does not fit with the EM structure of the Cas1-4 complex previously reported by the same authors (Lee, 2018). Although the FeS cluster appeared to help, this assignment should be treated with caution. In particular, the orientation chosen for the modelled Cas4 looks close to arbitrary and should not be used as a basis for further interpretation about active site positioning.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we agree with the reviewers that it is important to ensure the reader understands the ambiguity of our structural model. We had attempted to emphasize this ambiguity in the previous version of the manuscript, but the reviewers’ comments indicate that this could be improved further. We have now performed new structural modelling experiments that better emphasize this ambiguity. We have made several changes to Figure 2 and the figure supplements in an attempt to make the structural model clearer.</p><p>First, we would like to note that our data very strongly suggests that the extra density observed in the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex is due to the presence of Cas4. For example, in Figure 1B-D, we show that Cas4 co-elutes with Cas1, Cas2 and DNA, while in Figure 1E-F, we demonstrate clearly visible extra density in 2D class averages that is only present when Cas4 is present in the sample. We therefore feel confident in our conclusion that this density can be assigned to Cas4.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that some of the PcCas4 structure lay outside the density in our previous version of Figure 2. There are multiple possible reasons for why the assigned Cas4 density is smaller than the PcCas4 structure. As noted above, the two structures are likely different as BhCas4 lacks the long N-terminal domain (~50 amino acids) and instead contains a short C-terminal domain (~20 amino acids). Although BhCas4 is overall longer, many of the insertion sequences are predicted to be in loop regions that are likely flexible and not resolved in the EM map (Figure 2 —figure supplement 4). Overall, these differences may result in a more compact BhCas4 structure in comparison to the PcCas4 we used in our previous modeling experiments. In addition, as we previously noted in the text, the Cas4 density segmentation may be incomplete due to low resolution, resulting in the apparently smaller Cas4 density. This effect of low resolution is reported in the publication describing the Segger tool used for our segmentation (Pintilie et al., 2010). It is therefore possible that Cas4 lies at least partially in the “Cas1” density.</p><p>This is now stated more explicitly in the text:</p><p>“The segmented density for Cas4 is smaller than the structure and parts of the structure fit into the Cas1 density, suggesting that the segmentation between Cas1 and Cas4 densities was incomplete due to low resolution as has been observed previously (Pintilie et al., 2010).”</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the previous model based on the Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> cluster should be treated with caution. To ensure that this model did not lead to overinterpretation, we have removed it from the revised manuscript. We have instead included a new set of modelling experiments that better reflect the possible orientations Cas4 may adopt within the assigned density. We made two changes to our prior modeling experiments. First, we now use crystal structures (BhCas2 PDB 4ES3) or structural models (BhCas1 and BhCas4 predicted by Phyre2 server) of the actual <italic>B. halodurans</italic> sequences. As noted above, these predicted structural models may better reflect the size and shape of the actual sequences present in the complex. Second, we now use the “Fit to Segments” tool within the Segger package in UCSF Chimera to perform structural fitting (rather than the “Fit in Map” tool). This tool enables output of multiple possible top fits, allowing us to show several possible orientations for Cas4 to be docked into the assigned density. With our new modeling experiments, much of the BhCas4 structural model fits within the Cas4 density with reasonable cross-correlation scores (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In all orientations, Cas4 is located in close proximity to the Cas1 active site, although the distance between the active sites varies. The new modeling and figures will provide a more comprehensive view of how Cas4 may interact with Cas1, and we hope this will address the reviewers’ concerns about overinterpretation of our structural data. The new modeling is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and described in the Results section and Materials and methods section. Descriptions of how Cas1-Cas2 crystal structures fit into the Cas1-Cas2 density are now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The absence of density corresponding to the CRISPR DNA is troublesome and needs to be discussed by the authors. What is the rationale of using the CRISPR leader-repeat-spacer instead of the prespacer duplex to promote the formation of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex? It appears that initially the authors reasoned that target-binding may promote complex formation, but their later data seems to argue that the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex contacted the DNA rather nonspecifically, and through the prespacer-binding interface. If this is the case, to avoid possible misconceptions, the authors should make it clear that the contact does not reflect how Cas1-Cas2 recognizes the target sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more discussion on the absence of DNA density is important and have added additional information on this in the text in paragraph six of subsection “Architecture of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex”. First, we note that it is well established that it is difficult to visualize nucleic acids by negative stain (e.g. Nogales et al., 2015 and Hochstrasser et al., 2014), so it is not unexpected that DNA is not visible in most of our EM densities. Our biochemical results show that the DNA co-elutes with the protein components of the complex (Figures 1C-D), which strongly suggests that the DNA is part of the complex, even though the density is not visible. The highest resolution Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 EM density (symmetrical complex with CRISPR hairpin target bound) does appear to have additional density along the prespacer binding surface, although we cannot unambiguously assign this density to the target DNA. Although we were not expecting the target DNA to bind along this surface, in hindsight, it seems likely that this is the preferred DNA-binding site for Cas1-Cas2. Interactions with the DNA backbone are non-specific along this surface in all known Cas1-Cas2-prespacer structures (Wang et al., 2015, Nuñez et al., 2015b, Xiao et al., 2017). In contrast, specific interactions with CRISPR DNA may be transient, and only stabilized upon formation of the half-site integration intermediate with the prespacer substrate. Consistently, there are no known structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to only a CRISPR DNA, while structures of half-site and full-site intermediate-bound Cas1-Cas2 are available (Xiao et al., 2017, and PMID 28729350).</p><p>We have included discussion of this possibility in the Results section:</p><p>“Although we hypothesized that the CRISPR hairpin target would stabilize the Cas1-Cas2 complex by binding along the repeat-binding surface, our structural studies of complexes formed in the presence of the hairpin target suggest this is not the case. Notably, the prespacer-binding surface of Cas2 interacts with DNA through non-specific backbone contacts (Nuñez et al., 2015b; Wang et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2017), and no structure of Cas1-Cas2 bound to CRISPR DNA alone has been previously reported. This could suggest that any dsDNA, including the CRISPR target, may preferentially bind along the prespacer-binding surface and that other DNA substrates binding in that location could promote stable complex formation.”</p><p>The reviewers are correct in interpreting our reasoning for using the hairpin target DNA. It has been challenging to isolate a Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex, due to the difficulty of working with Cas4, which is prone to aggregation and precipitation. We previously made extensive attempts to form the complex in the presence of prespacer and other types of dsDNA, and our attempts to do so with the CRISPR hairpin target proved the most successful. However, with recent improvements in our Cas4 purification and complex formation protocol, we have now been able to form the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex in the presence of prespacer, rather than target DNA. These new experiments, including structures of symmetrical and asymmetrical Cas4-Cas1-Cas2prespacer are added to the manuscript in a new section titled “Formation of the Cas4-Cas1Cas2 complex with prespacer substrate” (subsection “Formation of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex with prespacer substrate”, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2 and 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points on the biochemistry work:</p><p>1) The biochemistry experiments in this manuscript were done using prespacer substrates containing a 'perfect' duplex with ss-overhangs provided either in cis or in trans. Such substrates are rarely found in vivo. In cases when the PAM is buried in the dsDNA region, can Cas4 process the dsDNA and correctly cleave after the 3'-PAM? Can the product be integrated into the CRISPR substrate?</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous publication, we tested Cas4 cleavage of several types of substrates, including dsDNA containing a PAM (Figure S2 in Lee et al. Mol Cell, 2018). We do not observe cleavage activity with any substrates except duplexes with 3ʹ overhangs. The new activity described in the current manuscript reinforces the idea that Cas4 only cleaves ssDNA, and indeed this is expected given the nature of the RecB nuclease domain. Thus, in order to cleave a PAM within a dsDNA, Cas4 would require a DNA unwinding activity that we have been unable to detect. These data indicate that additional factors or alternative conditions may be necessary to expose single-stranded DNA for Cas4 cleavage.</p><p>We have added the following sentences to the Discussion section to discuss this idea:</p><p>“Therefore, a duplex DNA containing single-strand overhangs is likely the optimal Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 substrate to enable efficient cleavage and substrate handoff. It remains unclear how these types of prespacers are formed. In other CRISPR-Cas sub-types, Cas4 has been demonstrated to have exonucleolytic activity that can lead to dsDNA unwinding (Lemak et al., 2013, 2014a; Zhang et al., 2012), although we have not observed robust exonuclease or dsDNA cleavage activity for the type I-C BhCas4 (Lee et al., 2018). It is possible that other host factors or conditions are required to unwind ends of dsDNA, or to expose single-stranded overhangs for precise cleavage by Cas4 in the type I-C system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What would happen when a ss-PAM is 1-2 nucleotide away (too far or too close) from the 5-nt spacing? Does the Cas4 cleavage dictate where the integration happens?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of PAM location within single-stranded overhang is interesting, and one we had not previously explored. We addressed the question of the effect of PAM location on single-strand overhang processing with a new set of experiments, described in our response to the next concern. For the second question, we addressed where integration happens in our previous publication (Figure 5 in Lee et al. Mol Cell, 2018). In that publication, we performed highthroughput sequencing experiments of half-site intermediate products to show that integration at the leader-repeat junction is highly precise. That experiment showed that the processing position did not affect the location of integration. However, integration at the repeat-spacer junction is much less specific. It may be interesting to determine whether the PAM position in the overhang affects the location of integration at the repeat-spacer junction. However, due to the relative rarity of integration at the repeat-spacer junction, this experiment requires high-throughput sequencing experiments. These experiments are costly and time consuming and we believe they will have to remain the subject of future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3 presents some nice data showing that prespacers are cleaved by Cas4 and that this is stimulated by the presence of ds CRISPR DNA. The data on ssDNA substrates, which is discussed in depth, is likely not that relevant to the adaptation process and activity is much weaker for these substrates. In the figure legend, part C is not described. This figure does lack an important control – use of a duplex substrate with ss overhangs that lacks a PAM sequence to discriminate between a ruler mechanism and a sequence specific mechanism for cleavage by Cas4 of the relevant prespacer structures.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several points in this concern that we will address individually:</p><p>“In the figure legend, part C is not described.”</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out a typo in the figure legend for Figure 3 (panels C and D were described as panels D and E in the previous version of the manuscript). This is now corrected.</p><p>“Figure 3 presents some nice data showing that prespacers are cleaved by Cas4 and that this is stimulated by the presence of ds CRISPR DNA. The data on ssDNA substrates, which is discussed in depth, is likely not that relevant to the adaptation process and activity is much weaker for these substrates.”</p><p>To clarify, we do not observe stimulation of duplex prespacer cleavage in the presence of CRISPR DNA, although this was what we intended to test with this experiment. As observed in Figure 3B, the amount of product is similar in the 9th and 11th lane of the gel, indicating that CRISPR DNA does not enhance duplex prespacer cleavage. We were instead surprised to find that a dsDNA induces cleavage of a trans ssDNA. Although it is unclear whether this activity is relevant to the adaptation process, we believe that it informs on the mechanism of Cas4-Cas1Cas2, which is why it is emphasized in this figure and throughout the text. The experiments in Figure 3 establish that once the Cas1-Cas2 complex is stabilized by binding to a dsDNA, it can activate Cas4 for cleavage of ssDNA. This cleavage is indeed more efficient when the ssDNA is covalently attached to the Cas1-Cas2-bound duplex, which likely localizes the ssDNA in close proximity to the Cas4 active site. However, the fact that Cas4 can cleave a trans ssDNA demonstrates that the single-stranded substrate is not positioned in the Cas4 active site solely based on the interaction with Cas1-Cas2. Instead, Cas4 can bind and cleave any ssDNA once activated by Cas1-Cas2. We have added more clarification on this point throughout the text.</p><p>We also added the following to the Discussion to emphasize the implications of the ssDNA cleavage:</p><p>“Surprisingly, Cas4 processing can occur at several locations within both trans and cis ssDNA, as long as enough space is available between cleavage sites and the end of a duplex. Importantly, we do not observe Cas4-dependent PAM processing in the absence of Cas1Cas2. These observations suggest that the Cas4 active site is activated for cleavage based on interactions with Cas1-Cas2. Once activated, Cas4 can sample any region of a single-stranded DNA that is accessible to the active site. This feature could allow more flexibility in defining prespacer substrates due to the ability of Cas4 to search for PAM sequences within single-stranded overhangs.”</p><p>“This figure does lack an important control – use of a duplex substrate with ss overhangs that lacks a PAM sequence to discriminate between a ruler mechanism and a sequence specific mechanism for cleavage by Cas4 of the relevant prespacer structures.”</p><p>We performed the control experiment suggested by the reviewers in a previous publication (Figure 3 in Lee et al. Mol Cell, 2018,) and did not observe cleavage when no PAM is present in the single-stranded overhang. We now explicitly mention this in the Results section:</p><p>“Importantly, we previously showed that cleavage of the duplex prespacer is dependent on having a PAM present in the single-stranded overhang, indicating that cleavage occurs in a PAM-dependent manner (Lee et al., 2018).”</p><p>However, the question of a potential ruler mechanism is important and one we had not entirely ruled out in our previous experiments. To address this question, as well as the first question proposed in concern #2, we have performed additional processing experiments using a panel of duplex substrates in which the PAM position is varied within the single-stranded overhang. Consistent with our other data, we observe that the PAM position does determine where processing occurs, indicating a PAM-dependent cleavage mechanism rather than a ruler mechanism. However, the position of the PAM is important for cleavage, as a PAM sequence that is too close to the duplex was not processed efficiently. This suggests that the single-stranded overhang must be long enough to stretch from the end of the duplex-binding region of Cas1-Cas2 to the active site of Cas4, but longer single-stranded regions can be cleaved at any PAM-containing region. This is reminiscent of the trans-ssDNA cleavage observed in our other experiments, and suggests that the Cas1-Cas2 complex does not position the ssDNA in the Cas4 overhang as long as the PAM is far enough away from the duplex. These experiments are described in a new Results section “Cas4 cleavage depends on PAM location within single-stranded overhangs” (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4 and 5 show convincing data supporting PAM-dependent cleavage activity by Cas1-2-4 on ssDNA substrates. This provides important new information on PAM removal by Cas4 during the capture process. It is unclear why this work has not been done with the relevant substrate, the gapped duplex shown in Figure 3B, which is cleaved more efficiently that non-relevant ssDNA. It would considerably strengthen the paper if the authors could provide some evidence that the same PAM-specific cleavage is observed with relevant duplex substrates, and this should not be hard to do.</p></disp-quote><p>We had multiple reasons for using the ssDNA in our sequencing gel experiments. First, using long single-stranded substrates enabled the introduction of primer-binding sites for Sanger sequencing, allowing us to run the sequencing lanes alongside processing reactions for unambiguous detection of the cleavage site. Second, we wanted to demonstrate that the only sites cleaved by Cas4 are PAM sites by using a panel of different sequences. Finally, we wanted to test whether multiple PAM sites could be cleaved within a single substrate. These latter two experiments were more easily done with the ssDNA, where the whole DNA would be subject to potential cleavage by Cas4. In contrast, only the single-strand overhang is subject to cleavage by Cas4 in the duplex substrate, limiting the amount of sequence we could interrogate for cleavage. Therefore, by using this experimental system, we were able to observe Cas4 specificity more effectively. We added the following sentence to better explain our reasoning for this line of experimentation:</p><p>“By using ssDNA substrates, we could more readily test sequences containing multiple PAM sites or a variety of sequences, and additionally include primer-binding sites for Sanger sequencing reactions.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the experiment suggested by the reviewers is not as straightforward as they propose given our recent personnel changes, and we believe we have already demonstrated that the single-strand overhangs are cleaved at the same position as the ssDNA. In Figure 3B, we show that the single-stranded and duplex substrates are cleaved at identical positions, indicating that the duplex is also cleaved in a PAM-specific manner. In addition, we have now performed the experiments described above in which cleavage site within single-strand overhang varies based on the location of the PAM. Overall, these experiments show that Cas4 only cleaves single-stranded sequences in a PAM-dependent manner, and that these substrates are cleaved in the same position regardless of whether they are fully single-stranded or partially duplexed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
