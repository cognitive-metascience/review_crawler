<italic>FAS/CD95</italic>, <italic>Caspase-2</italic> and <italic>AID</italic>. An OCRE (OCtamer REpeat of aromatic residues) domain found in RBM5 is important for alternative splicing regulation and mediates interactions with components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β–sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B’. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B’. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus, RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B’ proteins in <italic>FAS/CD95</italic> alternative splicing regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14707.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The information required to produce proteins is encoded within genes. In the first step of creating a protein, its gene is “transcribed” to form a pre-messenger RNA molecule (called pre-mRNA for short). Both the gene and the pre-mRNA contain regions called exons that code for protein, and regions called introns that do not. The pre-mRNA therefore undergoes a process called splicing to remove the introns and join the exons together into a final mRNA molecule that is “translated” to make the protein.</p><p>Many pre-mRNAs can be spliced in several different ways to include different combinations of exons in the final mRNA molecule. This process of “alternative splicing” allows different versions of a protein to be produced from the same gene. Changes that alter the pattern of alternative splicing in a cell affect various cellular and developmental processes and have been linked to diseases such as cancer.</p><p>The pre-mRNA transcribed from a gene called <italic>FAS</italic> can be alternatively spliced so that it either does or does not contain an exon that enables the protein to embed itself in the cell membrane. The protein produced from mRNA that includes this exon generates a cell response that leads to cell death. By contrast, protein produced from mRNA that lacks this exon is released from cells and promotes their survival. A splicing factor called RBM5 promotes the removal of this exon from <italic>FAS</italic> pre-mRNA.</p><p>RBM5 binds to some of the proteins that make up the molecular machine that splices pre-mRNA molecules. Mourão, Bonnal, Soni, Warner et al. have now used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to solve the three-dimensional structure formed when RBM5 binds to one of these proteins, called SmN. Further experiments introduced specific mutations to the proteins to investigate their effects in human cells. This revealed that mutations that impaired the association between RBM5 and SmN compromised the activity of RBM5 to regulate the alternative splicing of <italic>FAS</italic> pre-mRNA molecules.</p><p>Future research could examine how RBM5 associates with pre-mRNAs and other components of the splicing machinery, and investigate whether proteins that are closely related to RBM5 act in similar ways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>poly-proline</kwd><kwd>OCRE domain</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>NMR-spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordonné</surname><given-names>Rémy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006373</institution-id><institution>Fundación Botín</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valcárcel</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2013-2017, SEV-2012-0208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valcárcel</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Banco de Santander</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolider RNAREG, MICINN, AGAUR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valcárcel</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC AdG - GA670146 - MASCP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valcárcel</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sattler</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sattler</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interactions with Sm proteins can provide a way in which regulatory factors can modulate alternative splice site choices.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An essential step during the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is the removal of non-coding intron sequences from pre-mRNA transcripts through the process of pre-mRNA splicing. The catalytic steps of pre-mRNA splicing are carried out by the spliceosome, a large and dynamic assembly of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes and more than 150 additional splicing factor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Many splicing factors are involved in early steps of the assembly of the spliceosome through the recognition of short regulatory RNA motifs and/or through protein-protein interactions. Alternative splicing is the mechanism by which particular intronic or exonic regions are included or excluded to produce diverse mRNAs from the same gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blencowe, 2006</xref>). It is thought that more than 90% of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The genomic diversity of eukaryotic gene expression is thus greatly expanded by alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts. Often, the protein products of alternative splicing have antagonistic roles in cellular functions and are implicated in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, mutations in splicing factors that modulate alternative splicing decisions have been implicated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David and Manley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A biologically important example of alternative splicing is found in the <italic>FAS</italic> gene (also known as <italic>CD95</italic> or <italic>APO-1</italic>). The <italic>FAS</italic> gene encodes a transmembrane signaling protein that stimulates a pro-apoptotic signaling cascade upon binding of the FAS ligand at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krammer, 2000</xref>). Alternatively spliced <italic>FAS</italic> transcripts that exclude exon 6 encode a soluble Fas isoform that lacks the transmembrane domain. This soluble isoform can be secreted outside of the cell where it sequesters the FAS ligand and inhibits downstream activation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cascino et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, regulation of the alternative splicing of <italic>FAS</italic> can either stimulate or inhibit cell survival. The pro-apoptotic Fas protein plays an important role during T-lymphocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Parijs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roesler et al., 2005</xref>) and additional evidence implicates this isoform in the proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A number of splicing factors have been shown to modulate <italic>FAS</italic> alternative splicing, including RBM5. The multi-domain RNA-binding protein 5 (RBM5) regulates <italic>FAS</italic> splicing by promoting skipping of exon 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). RBM5 is a 92 kDa, multi-domain protein with an arginine-serine (RS)-rich region, two RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), two Zinc-Finger domains (ZF1 and ZF2), a C-terminal OCtamer REpeat (OCRE) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callebaut and Mornon, 2005</xref>) in addition to a glycine patch, and KEKE (lysine/glutamate) repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It belongs to the family of RNA Binding Motif (RBM) proteins, including RBM6 and RBM10, which share a similar domain organization with RBM5 and have 30% and 50% amino acid identity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sutherland et al., 2005</xref>). The RBM5 (also known as H37 and LUCA-15) and RBM6 genes are located in a chromosomal region 3p21.3, which is frequently deleted in heavy smokers and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zabarovsky et al., 2002</xref>). RBM5 is known to regulate the alternative splicing of apoptosis–related genes, such as <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>Caspase-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fushimi et al., 2008</xref>). It has also been reported to suppress metastasis by modulating the expression of Rac1, β-catenin, collagen and laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). However, RBM5 has also been found to be up-regulated in some aggressive forms of breast and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rintala-Maki et al., 2007</xref>). The possible dual role of RBM5 in cancer progression may be linked to its various activities as splicing regulator, including differential recognition of its pre-mRNA targets.</p><p>In the regulation of <italic>FAS</italic> alternative splicing, RBM5 inhibits mature spliceosome formation by blocking association of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex (in complex B) after the splice sites flanking exon 6 have been recognized by U1 and U2 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). RBM5 therefore appears to influence the pairing between the splice sites after complex A formation and thus promote tri-snRNP assembly at the distal splice sites, leading to exon 6 skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that the OCRE domain of RBM5 interacts with components of the tri-snRNP and is essential for the function of RBM5 in regulating <italic>FAS</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>OCRE domains, which are present in different proteins in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>), were identified by bioinformatic sequence analysis as a tandem of five imperfect octameric repeat sequences with triplets of aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callebaut and Mornon, 2005</xref>), expected to predominantly adopt β-strand secondary conformation. Due to the presence of OCRE domain in RNA binding proteins such as RBM5, they were presumed to facilitate RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callebaut and Mornon, 2005</xref>). However, at least in the case of RBM5, the OCRE domain appears to play a role in mediating protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In order to provide molecular insights into the function of the OCRE domain in splicing regulation, we have combined structural and biochemical experiments with mutational analyses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain directly binds to the spliceosomal SmN/B/B’ proteins. Sm proteins are core components of most spliceosomal snRNPs and form a heptameric ring composed of SmD1, SmD2, SmF, SmE, SmG, SmD3 and SmN/B/B’, which jointly recognize the uridine-rich Sm site RNA motif in U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kambach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Will and Lührmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matera and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>). SmB and SmB' are encoded by two transcript variants from the <italic>SNRPB</italic> gene, while a different gene, highly expressed in brain and heart, encodes the homologous protein SmN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmauss et al., 1992</xref>). SmN/B/B’, SmD1, and SmD3 have C-terminal extensions that include symmetrically dimethylated RG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripsianes et al., 2011</xref>). The SmN/B/B’ C-terminal tails contain additional proline-rich sequences, where these regions in SmN, SmB and SmB’ are 93% homologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Dam et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the RBM5 OCRE domain binds to the C-terminal proline-rich motifs present in SmB and SmN. The structure of the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β-sheet fold that recognizes the proline-rich C-terminal tails of the SmN/B/B' proteins through aromatic-CH interactions. We demonstrate that disruption of these interactions by mutations in the OCRE domain or in the proline-rich motifs of its ligands decreases the affinity between SmN/B/B’ and RBM5 <italic>in vitro</italic> and affects alternative splicing regulation of the FAS gene. Our results demonstrate that OCRE is a novel protein-protein interaction domain that mediates interactions with the core spliceosome in alternative splicing regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β-sheet fold involved in splicing regulation</title><p>To gain insights into the molecular functions of the RBM5 OCRE domain, we determined the three-dimensional structure for the human RBM5 OCRE domain using solution NMR techniques. Previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callebaut and Mornon, 2005</xref>) and a multiple sequence alignment of the related splicing factors RBM5, RBM6, and RBM10 indicated that the OCRE domain spans amino acid residues 451–511 of RBM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). NMR chemical shift and <sup>15</sup>N relaxation analyses of a construct with a C-terminal extension (451–532, including the KEKE region) did not reveal additional structural elements, suggesting that residues 451–511 indeed define the OCRE fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). An analysis of <sup>13</sup>C secondary chemical shifts shows that the secondary structure of the RBM5 OCRE domain comprises six β-strands between residues 460 and 505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

An N-terminal extension (residues 452–459) packs against one side of the β−sheet and is connected to the β1 strand by a 3<sub>10</sub> helix (residues 459–461) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C,D</xref>). The six β–strands form a twisted β–sheet where aromatic side chains are exposed on opposite surfaces of the β–sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). On one side, the aromatic side chains of Tyr464 (in strand β1), Tyr 471 (β2), Tyr480 (β3), Tyr487 (β4) form extended aromatic side chain interactions on the surface. Tyr487 forms an additional hydrophobic cluster with Tyr462 and Pro457 from the N-terminal extension. Trp498 and Tyr505 from the C-terminal extension, and the N-terminal Tyr454 are also involved in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This forms a compact fold that is further stabilized by a salt bridge involving Lys453 and Glu503 and thus brings the N- and C-terminal regions of the OCRE domain in close spatial proximity. Due to the interactions with residues from the N-terminal extension this aromatic surface of the OCRE domain is shielded from the solvent. In contrast, on the other side of the β-sheet, the interactions of the aromatic side chains of Tyr470 (β2), Tyr479 (β3), Tyr486, Tyr488 (β4), and Tyr495, Tyr497 (β5) form an aromatic surface with the tyrosine hydroxyl groups exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The N-terminal extension has an extended conformation consistent with secondary <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To assess the functional relevance of these residues, we generated triple and double point mutations (Y495/Y497/E501(YYE)&gt;AAK) and (Y454/458(YD)&gt;AR), respectively.

However, the short peptide containing four consecutive proline residues induces comparable CSPs only at much higher peptide:OCRE ratio compared to the longer Sm tail peptides, thus indicating higher binding affinity for the longer Sm tail constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nearly identical spectral changes are induced by the peptide, suggesting that all PRMs contribute to the overall affinity for the OCRE domain. Thus, the interaction with multiple motifs is enhanced by avidity, e.g., interaction of multiple PRMs within the Sm tails provides increased local concentration of PRM ligand motifs and thereby contributes to the significantly higher affinity of Sm-tails compared to a single PRM.</p><p>In order to assess the sequence requirements of PRMs for binding to the OCRE domain, we compared the amino acid sequences of the SmN/B tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis reveals the presence of multiple (five to six) PRMs harboring three or four consecutive prolines in SmB or SmN, which are flanked by conserved arginine residues within ±3 residues on either side of the poly-proline motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). The role of these conserved sequence features was probed by compared binding affinities of wild type and variant Sm tails to the RBM5 OCRE domain using ITC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Reducing the number or PRMs significantly decreases the binding affinity, consistent with avidity effects and contribution to the overall affinity by the presence of multiple PRMs. Replacing four prolines by four alanines has little effect. This observation is consistent with the fact that consecutive stretches of alanines adopt a poly-proline type II (PPII) helical conformation, as confirmed by CD spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the SmN/B/B’ PRMs adopt a PPII helical conformation when bound to the OCRE domain (see below), the replacement by four alanines can thus be tolerated to some extent. Notably, charge reversal of two arginines flanking the poly-proline motif on either side significantly decreases the binding affinity. These data suggest that a PPII helical conformation flanked by positively charged arginine residues is specifically recognized by the OCRE domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14707.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Proline-rich motif sequence requirements for OCRE binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of the C-terminal tail of human SmN/B/B’ and mutations of proline-rich-motifs (PRMs) tested. Conserved three or four-proline motifs and flanking arginine residues are highlighted.

As the binding affinities of these peptides are beyond the detection limit of ITC, we resorted to a semi-quantitative NMR CSP-based approach. We devised a normalized CSP score for a set of seven amide signals surrounding the binding pocket showing significant CSPs in the OCRE domain to obtain a proxy for the relative binding affinities (see Materials and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3B—figure supplement 2</xref>). As the comparison between different peptides is based on the CSP score derived from the same set of residues, it indirectly reflects their relative binding affinities. Several themes emerge from this comparison suggesting that the OCRE domain has a preferred binding motif, but can also accommodate some sequence variants. First, wild type peptides with three prolines induce smaller CSPs than those with four proline motifs and binding saturation is achieved only at higher peptide concentration, indicating a lower affinity. PRMs harboring only three consecutive proline residues show 2–3-fold reduced affinity relative to four proline motifs. Second, an APAP motif, which disrupts PPII conformations, has a strongly reduced CSP score, suggesting that the structure and composition of the PPII are important for interaction. Third, both arginines flanking the PRM motif are important for the interaction, as a double charge reversal (R→E) strongly reduces the binding affinity. Neutralizing the charge with R→A mutations had a smaller effect, presumably because no charge clashes are introduced with the negatively charged surface of the OCRE domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) as is the case for R→E mutations. Taken together, the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> indicates that a PPII conformation mediated by four consecutive proline residues with flanking positively charged residues is optimal for OCRE binding. Notably, the arginine residue preceding the PRM appears more important for the interaction than the one located C-terminal to the PRM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Solution structure of an RBM5 OCRE/SmN peptide complex</title><p>To determine molecular details of the recognition of SmN/B/B’ by the RBM5 OCRE domain, we determined its structure in complex with a proline-rich peptide derived from the C-terminal region of SmN (GMRPPPPGIRG) corresponding to SmN residues 219–229 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The structure of the OCRE domain does not undergo significant conformational changes upon binding to the SmN peptide, with a backbone coordinate r.m.s.d. of 1.7Å between the free and SmN-bound OCRE domain. However, the tyrosine side chains involved in the SmN interaction slightly rearrange to optimize contacts with the proline-rich SmN ligand.</p><p>To summarize, the RBM5 OCRE domain uses an array of tyrosine side chains that are exposed from one side of its β-sheet to recognize a proline-rich motif in a PPII conformation. Additional specific interactions are mediated by two positively charged side chains flanking the N- and C-terminal sides of the poly-proline helix in the bound SmN peptide, which in part involve the side chain hydroxyl groups of the exposed tyrosines, thus consistent with the strong conservation of tyrosines in the OCRE domain.

The NMR spectra of the Y495F, Y495W and E501K OCRE domains suggest that these proteins are globular folded.

NMR spectra of the Y495A, Y495T, Y497A and the double mutant Y454A/D458K suggest partial unfolding of strand β5 and the N-terminal extension, respectively, even though the overall fold appears to remain intact.

Although the primary sequence signature could suggest a linear sequence of octamer repeats, our structural analysis clearly reveals that the OCRE domain adopts a small globular fold. We show that the twisted β-sheet of the OCRE domain exposes conserved tyrosine residues that provide a platform for the recognition of a proline rich motif (PRM). This interaction is based upon a network of tyrosine residues as well as anchoring residues located in the loops of the β-strands. The SmN PRM is flanked by a positively charged arginine residue preceding the four consecutive prolines, followed by a hydrophobic residue and another arginine. Taking into account the sequence conservation, binding studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the details of molecular recognition of the SmN peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we propose that the OCRE domain recognizes a RPPP(P)GϕR consensus motif. A key feature of the motif is a central PPII helix, which is recognized by a network of parallel and aromatic T-stacking of Tyr470, Tyr479, Tyr482, Tyr488 and Tyr495 with the proline side chains in the PPII helix. These tyrosines are exposed at one side of the OCRE β-sheet and collectively embed the PPII helix. Specific contacts that define the orientation of the bound peptide are mediated by two flanking arginine residues, with a stronger contribution of the N-terminal arginine (SmN Arg221, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The glycine residue may enable an unusual backbone conformation such that hydrophobic residues (ϕ, Ile/Met/Val flanking different PRMs in the SmN/B/B’ C-terminal tails, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) can shield the central hydrophobic PPII motif from solvent exposure. Notably, unbound PRMs harboring 3–4 consecutive prolines already adopt (at least partially) a preformed PPII conformation and thus reduce the entropy loss associated with binding to the OCRE domain. The somewhat reduced affinity for peptides with only three prolines may reflect a smaller propensity of forming PPII conformation in the free ligands and the lack of a preceding arginine, which is consistently present in all four proline PRMs.</p><p>The tertiary fold and the mode of PRM recognition by the OCRE domain is distinct from other PRM binding domains, such as GYF, SH3, and WW domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although – as a common feature – aromatic residues are used to interact with proline residues and to recognize the PPII helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2005</xref>), different secondary structure elements are found in GYF (α-helical), SH3 (α/β fold), WW (β-sheet) and OCRE domains (β-sheet). Interestingly, a somewhat related PRM motif in the CD2 protein (PPPPGHR) was reported to interact with the GYF domain of the CD2BP2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freund et al., 2002</xref>). The CD2BP2 GYF domain and the FBP21 WW domain have been previously implicated in binding to the PRM sequences of SmB, suggesting that interactions between PRMs and these factors may be critical for the function of these proteins in spliceosome regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klippel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14707.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>OCRE is a novel PRM-binding domain that interacts with snRNPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of proline-rich motif (PRM) recognition by PRM binding domains.Cartoon representations of various PRM binding domains (green) with side chains of important residues shown as sticks and annotated.

Thus, also in the tri snRNP the SmN/B/B’ tails are accessible for interactions with the RBM5 OCRE domain.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14707-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>An interesting aspect of the OCRE/Sm interaction is that the presence of multiple PRM motifs greatly enhances the overall affinity ranging from <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> ≈ mM for a single PRM peptide to <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 20–40 µM for complete Sm tails, and thus comparable to other PRM binding domains. The relatively weak affinity of a single PRM found in the Sm tails argues that avidity effects due to the presence of multiple motifs play an important role for high affinity binding by increasing the local concentration of PRM motifs available for OCRE binding. We note that avidity effects provided by multiple binding sites have also been observed for other PRM binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klippel et al., 2011</xref>), and that this feature is reminiscent of the recognition of dimethyl-arginine residues in the Sm tails by Tudor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripsianes et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the weak binding affinity of a single motif indicates that the interaction between RBM5 and SmN/B/B’ may have been selected to be transient, as expected for a regulatory interaction that needs to promote interactions with the spliceosome but also needs to be disrupted at later steps of the splicing reaction.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the splicing regulation by RBM5 acts at the stage of spliceosomal B complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). The role of RBM5 and its OCRE domain in this context could be to attract the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP to the splice sites. The fact that the SmN/B/B’ tails are intrinsically disordered and extend very far away from the seven-membered Sm core ring in U snRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>), is consistent with such an activity. In fact, the recent EM structure of the tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) revealed that the Sm cores of U4 and U5, as well as the LSm ring of U6 are located at the outside of this large RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B’ of the U4 and U5 components are clearly accessible and could scan for possible binding partners of their proline-rich motifs, such as the RBM5 OCRE domain. This could help to localize the tri-snRNP to the splice sites that are regulated by RBM5.</p><p>SmB was described to participate in alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA and many additional genes, including the <italic>FAS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saltzman et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, mutations in SmB were linked to cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacrot et al., 2015</xref>). The multi-domain protein RBM5 promotes <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6 skipping and it has been proposed that for this activity the protein modulates splice site pairing after the competing 5’ and 3’ splice sites have been recognized by U1 and U2 snRNPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). This model is based upon the observation that RBM5 inhibits the transition from A (U2 snRNP binding) to B (U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP binding) complex formation in the introns flanking exon 6. It is conceivable that interactions mediated by the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B’, which are present in U1, U2 and the tri-snRNP, facilitate the transition from A to B complex and that binding of the OCRE domain of RBM5 prevents these interactions and therefore the progression of spliceosome assembly. Direct or indirect association of RBM5 with particular regions of the pre-mRNA – likely involving other regions of the protein including RRM or zinc finger domains – may prevent A to B transition of pre-spliceosomes assembled on the flanking introns of exon 6, but fail to prevent tri-snRNP assembly on the distal splice sites, thus facilitating exon skipping. Alternatively, or in addition, RBM5 interaction with the C-terminal tails of SmN/B/B’ may lead to a general decrease in snRNP function, possibly more acute for U2 snRNP. As decreased activity of U2 snRNP – e.g. by individual knock down of its protein components – is known to result in increased <italic>FAS</italic> exon skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Papasaikas et al., 2015</xref>), RBM5-mediated reduction in U2 function could potentially explain at least part of the effects of the protein on <italic>FAS</italic> splicing regulation.</p><p>Taken together, our study provides a molecular understanding of how the OCRE domain of RBM5 interacts with proline-rich sequences of the SmN/B/B' tail and thus identifies a key interaction essential for regulation of alternative splicing.</p><p>It is interesting to note that, based on primary sequence alignments, the OCRE domains of RBM5 and RBM10 are expected to adopt highly similar structures and possibly functions. In fact, the recently reported structure of the RBM10 OCRE domain is highly similar to RBM5 OCRE (backbone coordinate r.m.s.d. 1.1Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of a conserved tyrosine residue (corresponding to Tyr470 in RBM5, where it contributes to the recognition of the PRMs by the OCRE domain) is frequently found associated with lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imielinski et al., 2012</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that splicing defects that are linked to impaired interactions with PRM in SmN/B/B’ proteins contribute to the pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, protein expression and purification</title><p>RBM5 (Swiss Prot P42756) OCRE domain (451–511) and all the mutants were subcloned into a pETM11 vector (with a N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag) from the corresponding GST-RBM5 full-length DNA.

The plasmids used for amplification have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnal et al., 2008</xref>). All pDonor constructs were sequenced prior to proceed to LR recombination. The sequences of cloning junctions and coding sequences of all plasmids were verified to ensure the absence of any unwanted mutations.</p><p>Yeast strains were grown using standard procedures and media. For 2YH assays, the pGBT-CterSmB plasmid and the appropriate pACT2 plasmids were transformed into the CG1945 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromont-Racine et al., 1997</xref>). Transformants were selected on double selectable media (-Leu -Trp) and further grown in minimal -Trp -Leu liquid medium. Growth of yeast was measured by spotting serial dilutions of liquid cultures on -Leu -Trp -His plates which enables selection of interacting partners.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Accession codes</title><p>The atomic coordinates for the NMR ensembles of the RBM5 OCRE domain and the complex with the SmN (219–229) are deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 5MFY and 5MF9, respectively.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Douglas Black, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper from the Sattler and Valcárcel groups examines the interaction of splicing regulatory proteins of the Rbm5 family with the SmN/B/B' proteins within the core of the Sm snRNPs. There are many regulatory proteins that bind to the pre-mRNA to alter spliceosome assembly, but remarkably few interactions have been described between these regulators and core components of the spliceosome. Such information is key to understanding the mechanisms of splicing regulation. In previous work, the Valcárcel lab has characterized the Rbm5 family of splicing regulators, showing that they control important splicing events for apoptosis and cancer progression. They also reported that the octamer repeat (OCRE) domain of the Rbm5 protein interacts with the tri-snRNP complex that forms part of the mature spliceosome. OCRE domains containing repeats of aromatic residues are found in multiple proteins but their structure and interactions are unknown. Here the authors solve the structure of the Rbm5 OCRE by NMR, showing that it adopts an antiparallel β sheet structure with each repeat comprising a β strand. The conserved tyrosines project from both sides of the sheet. An N-terminal extension interacts with the residues on one face of the sheet to stabilize the domain, while tyrosines on the opposite face are available for other interactions. The authors define repeated proline-rich motifs within the C-terminal domains of the SmN/B/B' proteins as ligands for the OCRE domain. They show this interaction requires particular aromatic residues on the interaction surface of OCRE. They define a consensus proline rich motif (PRM) on the SmN protein that is required for OCRE interaction, and which includes 3 or 4 continuous proline residues flanked by arginines. Solving the structure of the OCRE bound to this motif, they show that the PRM forms a proline type II helix and the OCRE engages the PRM through a combination of aromatic stacking interactions between the prolines and the tyrosines, and both hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the flanking arginines. Through coexpression of mutant Rbm5 with a reporter minigene they show that these OCRE residues are indeed needed for Rbm5 regulatory activity. Finally, they compare OCRE to other domains such as SH3 and WW that also use aromatic residues to recognize poly-proline motifs.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a well-executed study that uses a range of approaches to illuminate new aspects of splicing, including the structure and interactions of OCRE domain and the role of the OCRE/SmB interaction in splicing regulation. A number of issues were raised that need to be addressed before the paper is suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is shown that mutation of the 4 prolines of the polyproline motif to alanines does not impact binding affinity. This is attributed to the alanines' ability to adopt a polyproline type II helical conformation. However, the hydrophobic interactions described should still be weakened upon mutation of prolines to alanines. The authors should test substitutions to other hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, to prove that the backbone conformation is the major determinant of binding affinity.</p><p>2) The results in Figure 3B are surprising. It is well accepted that the extent of chemical shift perturbation does not necessarily correlate with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in mutant analysis, as the mutant ligand can bind in a slightly different orientation. In addition, mutations have a large influence on the extent of the chemical shift perturbations observed for residues in direct contact. Figure 3B needs to be reinterpreted in light of this, and the authors need to demonstrate that much more clearly that their <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> changes are as they describe.</p><p>3) The model for how the Rbm5/SmB interaction is altering spliceosome assembly is not at all clear. They propose based on earlier work that Rbm5 is interacting with SmB within the tri-snRNP. Isn't it also possible that the interaction could occur between Rbm5 and SmB in the U1 and U2 snRNP's? In Bonnal et al., 2008, they show that GST-OCRE interacts with the 220 and 200 kDa proteins of the U5 snRNP when incubated in HeLa nuclear extract. However, the data in that paper is not sufficient to propose that it must be a tri-snRNP interaction that is relevant here. The most prominent protein identified in that study was the U1-70K protein, suggesting that the OCRE domain also binds to the U1 snRNP. OCRE could thus indirectly affect the recruitment of the tri-snRNP via the U1 interaction. Additional bands in the OCRE-domain pulldown were also not identified, and no information was provided about which snRNAs were pulled down. Thus, it is not clear if the OCRE domain can bind all or only some snRNPs containing SmB/B'/N. These questions are not mentioned in the present Discussion but dramatically affect any model for how OCRE alters spliceosome assembly. Given the nicely shown interaction of RBM5's OCRE domain with the proline-rich regions of SmB/B'/N, and the fact that these proteins are present in the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNPs, a more thorough analysis of the interaction partners of the OCRE domain in nuclear extract is needed. The pulldown analysis should be repeated, analyzing all proteins and RNAs that are bound by OCRE, as well as analyzing how the stringency of the buffers used during pulldown and wash affect the spectrum of interacting species.</p><p>4) Also in the previous study (Bonnal et al., 2008), addition of RBM5 to an in vitro splicing reaction led to the accumulation of A complexes, and a block to B complex formation on intron 5 or 6 of Fas pre-mRNA. This indicated that stable recruitment of the tri-snRNP was hindered in the presence of RBM5. What effect does a RBM5 OCRE domain alone, or an RBM5 mutant lacking OCRE or with an inactive OCRE domain have on splicing complex formation in vitro? This experiment would provide additional information about the mechanism whereby RBM5's OCRE domain affects splicing. For example, Rbm5 also interacts with U2AF. It is possible that this U2AF interaction is sufficient to block to tri-snRNP recruitment, and the OCRE/SmB interaction is serving other roles.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14707.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The reviewers agreed that this is a well-executed study that uses a range of approaches to illuminate new aspects of splicing, including the structure and interactions of OCRE domain and the role of the OCRE/SmB interaction in splicing regulation.

We have performed further experiments to test the contribution and properties of the proline side chains by substituting proline by valine and comparing binding affinities <italic>in vitro</italic>. Unfortunately, a 4V version of the peptide (GMRVVVVGIRG) was completely insoluble, and thus no data could be obtained for this variant. Likewise, the SmN protein harboring 4P/3P→4V/3V mutations could not be expressed and purified. Presumably, the bulky and hydrophobic valine side chains cause aggregation of the protein, as observed for the peptide <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>As a perhaps less optimal, but feasible alternative to evaluate the importance of hydrophobic interactions involving the proline side chains for OCRE binding, we tested peptides and SmN variants where prolines were replaced by glycine. CD spectra of the 4G peptide (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1) indicate that it adopts (at least partially) a PPII conformation, consistent with previous reports<sup>1,2</sup>.</p><p>However, the affinity of the 4P/3P→4G/3G variant SmN protein to the OCRE domain is significantly reduced (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 192 ± 66 µM) compared to the wild type SmN protein (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 41 ± 2 µM) (revised Table 2). This is consistent with a reduced PPII propensity but also a contribution of hydrophobic interactions involving proline side chains in the wild type SmN, which are not possible with the glycine mutants.</p><p>Consistent with the reduced affinity for the OCRE domain observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, the activity of the 4P/3P→4G/3G SmN protein to promote <italic>FAS</italic> alternative splicing is significantly impaired (revised Figure 5—figure supplement 3D), comparable to the reduced activity of the APAP mutant.</p><p>The results of the 4P/3P→4G/3G mutant are therefore consistent with the concept that adoption of a polyproline type II helical conformation by the C-terminal tail of SmN, and establishment of a defined set of hydrophobic interactions between proline residues and aromatic side chains in the OCRE fold are necessary for OCRE binding and for alternative splicing regulation.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Brown AM, Zondlo NJ. 2012.

It is well accepted that the extent of chemical shift perturbation does not necessarily correlate with K<sub>D</sub> in mutant analysis, as the mutant ligand can bind in a slightly different orientation. In addition, mutations have a large influence on the extent of the chemical shift perturbations observed for residues in direct contact. Figure 3B needs to be reinterpreted in light of this, and the authors need to demonstrate that much more clearly that their K<sub>D</sub> changes are as they describe.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the comment that an interpretation of chemical shift perturbations (CSP) in terms of affinity is approximate and has to be done with caution. We have resorted to this approach as no other experimental technique is available to provide an – at least semi-quantitative – measure of relative affinities. Given that the peptide ligands do not exhibit aromatic side chains themselves and considering that we know the structural details of the interaction, we believe that changes for the amide signals shown in Figure 3B report on the local changes in chemical shift and depend on the population of bound state, i.e. relative affinities.</p><p>Note, that the signals shown in Figure 3B were carefully chosen as they report on key interactions with the (wildtype) ligand. However, the affinity score was based on analyzing all amide signals that experience significant chemical shift changes (i.e. above a certain cut-off), thereby providing some averaging of local effects, which thus should correlate in a reasonable way with overall binding affinity. To illustrate the changes in CSPs for different amide signals, we show the NMR spectra for representative peptide ligands in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The figure also shows that the CSPs for the different peptides follow a linear vector, which suggests that only a 2-site process is sensed, i.e. free vs. bound states, as otherwise deviations from linearity of the CSP vectors would indicate more local variations depending on the residues analyzed.</p><p>We have carefully updated the description of the approach and added a cautionary statement about its interpretation. Please note that the same mutations were introduced into the complete tail peptide. The very good agreement between relative affinities determined for the complete tails by ITC and those determined for the peptides by our NMR analysis, suggests that the NMR data provide useful information, which was then useful to guide our mutational analysis of the recognition of a single peptide motif.</p><p><italic>3) The model for how the Rbm5/SmB interaction is altering spliceosome assembly is not at all clear. They propose based on earlier work that Rbm5 is interacting with SmB within the tri-snRNP. Isn't it also possible that the interaction could occur between Rbm5 and SmB in the U1 and U2 snRNP's? In Bonnal et al., 2008, they show that GST-OCRE interacts with the 220 and 200 kDa proteins of the U5 snRNP when incubated in HeLa nuclear extract.

OCRE could thus indirectly affect the recruitment of the tri-snRNP via the U1 interaction.

Thus, it is not clear if the OCRE domain can bind all or only some snRNPs containing SmB/B'/N. These questions are not mentioned in the present Discussion but dramatically affect any model for how OCRE alters spliceosome assembly. Given the nicely shown interaction of RBM5's OCRE domain with the proline-rich regions of SmB/B'/N, and the fact that these proteins are present in the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNPs, a more thorough analysis of the interaction partners of the OCRE domain in nuclear extract is needed. The pulldown analysis should be repeated, analyzing all proteins and RNAs that are bound by OCRE, as well as analyzing how the stringency of the buffers used during pulldown and wash affect the spectrum of interacting species.</italic> </p><p>We have worked hard to determine the complement of U snRNAs associated to OCRE in our pull downs. Unfortunately, however, the results were inconclusive because a high background of U snRNAs was observed even in the control pull down samples. After many attempts to improve the signal-to-noise ratio using different pull down and stringency conditions, we were forced to accept that these assays do not provide evidence of consistent enrichment of any particular snRNP. One possibility is that the pull down somehow dislocates the snRNP-associated proteins from other RNP components, including the snRNAs. This is also consistent with the apparent absence of other Sm proteins from the precipitates. It seems likely that our pull-down analyses are a gross simplification of the sophisticated interactions that occur in the context of the spliceosome assembly pathway. Nevertheless, our assays revealed a direct interaction between the OCRE domain and the SmB/B'/N C terminal tail that, on the basis of our structure-function studies, is directly relevant for splicing regulation by RBM5.</p><p>We agree that an interaction with any U snRNP where the SmB/B’/N tails are accessible should be in principle possible. Looking at the recent high-resolution crystal and cryo-EM structures of spliceosomal complexes, we note that the long and flexible tails are predicted to be available for interactions in the tri-snRNP, in U1 snRNP and in complex B. We have expanded the text to discuss these structural insights and how contacts with either U1 / U2 or with the tri-snRNP could accommodate the activity of RBM5 as a repressor of the transition from complex A to B.</p><p><italic>4) Also in the previous study (Bonnal et al., 2008), addition of RBM5 to an in vitro splicing reaction led to the accumulation of A complexes, and a block to B complex formation on intron 5 or 6 of Fas pre-mRNA.

What effect does a RBM5 OCRE domain alone, or an RBM5 mutant lacking OCRE or with an inactive OCRE domain have on splicing complex formation in vitro? This experiment would provide additional information about the mechanism whereby RBM5's OCRE domain affects splicing. For example, Rbm5 also interacts with U2AF. It is possible that this U2AF interaction is sufficient to block to tri-snRNP recruitment, and the OCRE/SmB interaction is serving other roles.</italic> </p><p>We have tested the activity of the OCRE domain alone, as well as of a RBM5 mutant lacking the OCRE domain, in spliceosome assembly and in <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing assays. The results of the new Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2 show that the OCRE domain alone (in a construct that also includes the flanking KEKE domain) fails to inhibit spliceosome assembly in biochemical assays (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and to regulate Fas exon 6 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). In addition, new Figure 6 shows that both the deletion of the C-terminal region of RBM5 and a deletion of the OCRE domain compromise the ability of RBM5 to inhibit the transition from complex A to complex B in spliceosome assembly assays. Collectively, the results indicate that the OCRE domain is necessary but not sufficient to block B complex formation and that additional contributions from other parts in the C-terminal half of RBM5 contribute to this activity. One possibility, now discussed in the manuscript, is indeed that an interaction with U2AF, which has been previously mapped to a C-terminal region in RBM5, is important for regulation by RBM5. Investigating these additional interactions and their specific contributions to the modulation of spliceosome assembly will be the focus of our future work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
