They encompass large genomes and our understanding of their protein coding potential is far from complete. Here, we employ ribosome-profiling and systematic transcript-analysis to experimentally define HHV-6 translation products. We identify hundreds of new open reading frames (ORFs), including upstream ORFs (uORFs) and internal ORFs (iORFs), generating a complete unbiased atlas of HHV-6 proteome. By integrating systematic data from the prototypic betaherpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus, we uncover numerous uORFs and iORFs conserved across betaherpesviruses and we show uORFs are enriched in late viral genes. We identified three highly abundant HHV-6 encoded long non-coding RNAs, one of which generates a non-polyadenylated stable intron appearing to be a conserved feature of betaherpesviruses. Overall, our work reveals the complexity of HHV-6 genomes and highlights novel features conserved between betaherpesviruses, providing a rich resource for future functional studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human herpesvirus 6</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>genome annotations</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005386</institution-id><institution>Israeli Centers for Research Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chromatin and RNA Gene Regulation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1526/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unbiased mapping of viral open reading frames (ORFs) and transcripts in HHV-6 genomes uncovers novel ORFs and lncRNAs that are conserved across betaherpesviruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus. Based on distinct molecular, epidemiological and biological properties, two variants of this virus were declared as two separate, closely related, viral species; HHV-6A and HHV-6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Grady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Telford et al., 2018</xref>). While HHV-6A remains poorly epidemiologically characterized, it was suspected to associate with neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (Allnutt et al., under review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eimer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leibovitch and Jacobson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prusty et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Readhead et al., 2018</xref>). HHV-6B is known to infect more than 90% of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zerr et al., 2005</xref>) and was found to be the causative agent of Roseola Infantum, leading to febrile seizures in more than 10% of acute infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Bolle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamanishi et al., 1988</xref>). Both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, like all herpesviruses, establish a lifelong latent infection in their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luppi et al., 1999</xref>). HHV-6 latency is established in multiple cell types, where the viral genome is integrated into host chromosomes between telomeres and subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbuckle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1997</xref>). Remarkably, in approximately 1% of the population worldwide HHV-6 is integrated in every cell in the body, and inherited, due to integration of the viral genome in germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellett et al., 2012</xref>). HHV-6 reactivation is a common cause of encephalitis, and has been associated with several diseases including multiple sclerosis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and graft-versus-host disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caselli and Di Luca, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Bolle et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, similar to those of other herpesviruses, consist of large linear double stranded DNA molecules, 160 kb in length, containing a unique segment flanked by direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindquester and Pellett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 1991</xref>). The annotation of HHV-6 coding capacity has traditionally relied on open reading frame (ORF)-based analyses using canonical translational start and stop sequences and arbitrary size restriction to demarcate putative protein coding genes, resulting in a list of around 100 ORFs for each virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dominguez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gompels et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gravel et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, genome wide-analysis of herpesviruses using short RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads, and recently also direct and long-read RNA-seq revealed very complex transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balázs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balázs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Depledge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatherer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Grady et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Grady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tombácz et al., 2017</xref>), and combined with genome-wide mapping of translation, revealed hundreds of new viral ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bencun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whisnant et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically for HHV-6, recent work using proteomics, transcriptomics and comparative genomics on HHV-6B enabled re-annotation of several viral gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greninger et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, this unforeseen complexity of herpesviruses suggests the current annotations of HHV-6 genomes are likely incomplete.</p><p>Here, we apply ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA-seq to investigate the genomes of the closely related HHV-6A and HHV-6B. These powerful tools allowed us to accurately determine the translation initiation sites of previously annotated genes, and to identify hundreds of new open reading frames including many upstream ORFs (uORFs) and internal ORFs (iORFs), generating a comprehensive atlas of HHV-6 translation products. Using our RNA-seq data, we were able to map novel splice junctions and to identify novel highly abundant viral long non-coding RNAs. The systematic annotations of two betaherpesviruses together with our previous annotation of the prototypic betaherpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>) created for the first time an opportunity to look at functional conservation of some of these features. We found high levels of conservation between HHV-6A and HHV-6B, and in several cases, the newly identified features were also conserved in HCMV. Our results shed light on the complexity of herpesviruses, point to conserved features and can serve as a valuable resource for future studies of these important viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Profiling the transcriptome and translatome of HHV-6A and HHV-6B</title><p>To capture the full complexity of HHV-6A and HHV-6B genomes, we applied next generation sequencing methods that map genome-wide RNA expression and translation to HSB-2 and Molt-3 cells infected for 72 hr with HHV-6A strain GS and HHV-6B strain Z29, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each virus we mapped genome-wide translation events by preparing three different ribosome-profiling libraries (Ribo-seq). Two Ribo-seq libraries facilitate mapping of translation initiation sites, by treating cells with lactimidomycin (LTM) or harringtonine (Harr), drugs that inhibit translation initiation in distinct mechanisms and lead to accumulation of ribosomes at translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). The third Ribo-seq library was prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), and gives a snap-shot of actively translating ribosomes across the body of the translated ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In parallel, we used a tailored RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) protocol which on top of quantification of RNA levels allows identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) due to a strong overrepresentation of fragments that start at the 5’ end of transcripts, as well as detection of polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). The combination of these methods provides accurate mapping of transcription and translation events, as seen in the example of U54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The different Ribo-seq libraries generate distinct profiles across the coding region, displaying a strong peak at the translation initiation site, which, as expected, is more distinct in the Harr and LTM libraries, while the CHX library provides the distribution of ribosomes across the entire coding region up to the stop codon, and its mapped footprints were enriched in fragments that align to the translated frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–</xref>). These profiles were consistent across coding regions in human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and, as expected, the RNA-seq profiles were uniformly distributed across the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the experimental approach.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viral gene expression was analyzed by performing ribosome profiling (red) and initiation enriched RNA-seq (green).

Comparing to previously annotated ORFs, we found many misannotations (10 and 11, in HHV-6A and HHV-6B respectively) and novel un-annotated ORFs (278 and 227, in HHV-6A and HHV-6B respectively). Importantly, many of these new ORFs are conserved between HHV-6A and HHV-6B, validating our approach, and emphasizing the high similarity between these two viruses. One example of misannotation is the U30 gene, an essential viral gene coding for an inner tegument protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicholas and Martin, 1994</xref>). We found translation of this gene to initiate at an AUG 411 bp downstream of the previously annotated start, in both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, resulting in a 946 amino acid (aa) long protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, the new annotations include the C-terminal domain which was shown to interact with the large tegument protein in the HSV-1 homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richards et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ribo-Seq measurements reveal the architecture of viral coding regions.</title><p>Examples of expression profiles of viral genes that contain novel ORFs conserved in HHV-6A and HHV-6B.

For example, a short 32 aa ORF was found to initiate upstream of the envelope protein gene U48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This ORF partially overlaps the U48 gene, making it an upstream overlapping ORF (uoORF). Since uoORFs are known to have repressive regulatory effects conserved across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnstone et al., 2016</xref>), this novel ORF likely negatively regulates the translation of U48. We did not observe translation of another downstream ORF that could be positively regulated by this uoORF. The packaging gene U36 is an example of a gene for which we found translation of two very short (&lt;20 aa) uORFs from its 5'UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, we identified translation of an internal ORF (iORF), initiating out-of-frame, inside the coding region of U36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), leading to translation of a novel ORF. In the U84 gene we observed two iORFs, one of them out-of-frame possibly regulating the downstream ORF, and another in-frame, starting at an AUG downstream of the U84 start-codon and ending in the same stop-codon, resulting in a truncated version of U84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNA-seq analysis reveals pervasive splicing that is conserved between HHV-6A and HHV-6B</title><p>To systematically map the splice junctions of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, we used two independent splice-aware alignment tools, TopHat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) and STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). We found an intricate set of splice junctions including dozens of novel splice junctions, which were overall positionally conserved between HHV-6A and HHV-6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>). We were able to detect 24 out of 26 annotated HHV-6A splice junctions and all 24 annotated HHV-6B splice junctions. Furthermore, we identified 37 novel splice junctions in HHV-6A and 44 in HHV-6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>). Some of the novel splice junctions identified in HHV-6A were recently reported in HHV-6B and are confirmed here for both viruses (U19, U83, and all splice forms of U79, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greninger et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, many of the novel splice junctions seem to belong to one long transcript composed of several short exons separated by long introns, spanning the U42-U57 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In a few cases, novel splice junctions result in reannotation of ORFs. For example, a splice junction between the HHV-6B U7 and U8 indicates that they are fused to one translation product, similar to the HHV-6A U7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dominguez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gompels et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gravel et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—supplement figure 1A</xref>). Another splice junction in the HHV-6A U13 gene indicates that the U12 and U13 proteins share their N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—supplement figure 1B</xref>). The same junction was also detected at lower levels in HHV-6B.

The short length of these ORFs implies that the RNAs themselves probably constitute functional elements. One lncRNA, designated here as lncRNA1, initiates within HHV-6 origin of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and therefore resembles in synteny to an HCMV encoded lncRNA, RNA4.9 although it is much shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, these intronic reads do not seem to originate from intron retention and rather indicate that lncRNA3 also generates a stable non-polyadenylated intron. To further examine this possibility, we extracted RNA from cells infected with HHV-6A or HHV-6B and measured the abundance of lncRNA3 intron in cDNA synthesized with random hexamers compared to cDNA synthesized with poly(dT) oligomers. Similar to the non-polyadenylated 18S ribosomal RNA, the intron RNA was detected at significantly higher levels in cDNA that was synthesized using random hexamers, while the polyadenylated lncRNA2 was more abundant or unchanged when poly(dT) oligomers were used in HHV-6A and HHV-6B, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The model was trained on a subset of the canonical viral ORFs that had high ribosome footprint coverage (see Materials and methods). Using the trained SVM model, we predicted hundreds of translation initiation sites in each virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">2</xref>). In these sites, we found strong enrichment of translation initiation at the canonical AUG start codon, as well as weaker but still significant enrichment for the near-cognate start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Of the near-cognate start codons, CUG was the most common, similar to what was found in other herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whisnant et al., 2019</xref>) and in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 2015</xref>).

The ORFs missing from the prediction were either reannotated, or hardly translated under the conditions we used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>). Since our detection is affected by the level of expression, it is likely these ORFs are expressed at low levels or translated under different conditions.

We observed similar phenomena in the temporal regulation of several HHV-6B genes. For example, the U53 gene contains newly identified iORFs, one of which initiates at an AUG, and is an orthologue of the annotated HHV-6A U53.5 ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Relative to the main U53 ORF, these iORFs are translated more efficiently at 72hpi than at 24hpi. This could be explained by a temporal shift in the relative frequency of initiation at two TSSs, one of which is upstream of the U53 start codon from which the main U53 can be translated, and another downstream of the U53 start codon allowing translation of the iORFs but not of the main U53 ORF. Notably, we found the same pattern in the HCMV homolog, UL80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A similar form of regulation is seen in the HHV-6B locus coding for the U81 and U82 ORFs in which we found two TSSs. One TSS is immediately upstream of U81 creating an RNA that is mainly expressed at 24hpi, facilitating the translation of U81. At 72hpi a second TSS is also present, giving rise to translation of U82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Temporal regulation of 5' ends was also found for the HHV-6B U51 and its uoORF, which is also conserved in its HCMV homolog UL78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>uORFs are enriched in betaherpesvirus late genes</title><p>Among the newly identified ORFs many are iORFs and uORFs. Since the high abundance of these ORFs may be associated with changes in translation regulation, we examined whether these translation events are enriched in specific kinetic classes. Each uORF and iORF was assigned to a canonical transcript; iORFs were assigned to the canonical ORF in which they reside, and uORFs were assigned to a canonical ORF if they were located upstream of its translation initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). For both HHV-6A and HHV-6B we found an enrichment of uORFs in the 5'UTRs of late genes compared to earlier kinetic classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, p-value &lt; 0.01, proportion test). In contrast, there was no enrichment for the presence of iORFs in any kinetic class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, p-value &gt; 0.3), negating the option that the enrichment we found for uORFs is due to a bias in our approach or to a general increase in our ability to capture translation initiation. We further extended this analysis to HCMV ORFs and found that uORFs but not iORFs are enriched in 5’UTRs of HCMV genes that are expressed with late kinetics, similar to what we see in HHV-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Since the ability to capture uORFs translation might be affected by expression levels, which can skew our analysis, we checked the correlation between RNA expression and the number of predicted uORFs. We identified a positive correlation (Pearson's R = 0.34) for HHV-6B ORFs, but not for HHV-6A or HCMV ORFs (R = 0.04 and R = 0.03 respectively), suggesting expression levels probably do not solely explain the enrichment we see for uORFs in late genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest a potential mechanism for translation regulation of late viral genes, utilizing uORFs, which is conserved among betaherpesviruses. Interestingly, we also observed an increased proportional use of non-canonical start codons late in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), further supporting the possibility that a change in translation regulation might occur at late time points post infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The presence of iORFs and uORFs is conserved among betaherpesvirus genes</title><p>Using our comprehensive transcriptome and translatome data we uncovered hundreds of novel ORFs in HHV-6A and in HHV-6B.

We also found some features that are conserved in HCMV. In five iORF-containing HHV-6 genes and in four uORF-containing HHV-6 genes, the HCMV homologs also contained similar iORFs or uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). One of the HHV-6/HCMV homolog ORF pairs containing a conserved uORF is U51 and its HCMV homolog UL78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), which interestingly also show conserved kinetics along infection suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism conserved between these viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, the conserved presence of several uORFs and iORFs suggests that their occurrence is not random, and it is likely that these represent a functional module that plays a role in regulating herpesvirus protein expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Numerous iORFs and uORFs are conserved between betaherpesviruses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between the number of iORFs and uORFs of canonical ORFs in HHV-6A and HHV-6B (55 shared canonical ORFs in total).

For many herpesvirus genomes, traditional annotations have relied on the identification of canonical translational start codons and arbitrary size restriction to define viral open reading frames (ORFs). Laborious follow-up molecular work revealed the transcriptional architecture of individual genomic loci, but for most HHV-6 genes annotations are still based on these initial in-silico ORF predictions. In recent years, major advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches have revealed that the transcriptome and translatome of herpesviruses are extremely complex, encompassing large numbers of overlapping transcripts, extensive splicing and many non-canonical translation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balázs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bencun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Depledge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatherer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Grady et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Grady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tombácz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whisnant et al., 2019</xref>). Our own work in which we employed ribosome profiling and systematic transcript analysis to decipher HCMV genome complexity revealed a rich collection of coding sequences that include many viral short ORFs (sORFs), uORFs and alternative translation products that generate extensions or truncations of canonical proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling measurements along HHV-6 infection, we provide a comprehensive map of HHV-6A and HHV-6B coding elements over the lytic life cycle. In agreement with the complexity of other herpesviruses that have been analyzed using ribosome profiling approaches, we identified 268 and 216 novel viral ORFs that are expressed during HHV-6A and HHV-6B lytic infection, respectively. Furthermore, our transcriptome analyses enabled mapping of the full landscape of HHV-6 splice junctions and the identification of three virally encoded lncRNAs. Our data further show that in similarity to our findings in HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>), the pervasive use alternative of 5’ ends plays a major role in HHV-6 genomes in production of distinct polypeptides from single genomic loci. Like alternative splicing, this mechanism can expand protein diversity and contribute to virus complexity by allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated from a single genomic locus. Overall, our revised experimental annotations will facilitate functional studies on HHV-6 ORFs and transcripts as well as their regulation.</p><p>This wealth of novel elements requires a more precise dissection of the components that are likely to be functional. The issue of functional relevance still represents a major challenge in these systematic experimental annotations. Our analysis of three betaherpesviruses allowed us, for the first time, to highlight some conserved features that may point towards functional importance. A large portion of the novel translated ORFs we identified are uORFs. uORFs are widely recognized as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and their presence generally correlates with reduced translation of the primary ORF, but there are instances in which they associate with increased translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Young and Wek, 2016</xref>). Despite their pervasiveness, only a few viral uORFs have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geballe et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kronstad et al., 2013</xref>). We show that genes that contain uORFs and the number of uORFs are largely conserved between HHV-6A and HHV-6B. In addition, we reveal that both in HHV-6 and in HCMV, uORFs appear to be especially abundant in late viral genes. The surplus of uORFs and their preferred use specifically at late time points of infection indicate that they may have a functional role in controlling viral gene expression, probably when cellular stress pathways are engaged. The overall high representation of sORFs, iORFs and uORFs in the viral genome, particularly at late stages of infection, is probably driven by several mechanisms; the first is extensive use of alternative transcription initiation, which is highly prevalent at late time point of infection with herpesviruses, and allows the translation of multiple translation products from the same viral loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balázs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whisnant et al., 2019</xref>); the second mechanism may be related to changes in translation permissiveness which can explain the increase in translation initiation from near canonical start codons. Notably, our expression data along infection likely underestimate the true changes in viral protein production as experimental HHV-6 infection inherently creates a mixed population of cells infected at different times (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We identified three conserved HHV-6 encoded lncRNAs, signifying lncRNAs are probably a shared feature of all herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tycowski et al., 2015</xref>). lncRNAs are still an enigmatic group of RNA molecules that do not form a well-defined class of genes, and mechanistically most lncRNAs, including viral lncRNAs, remain poorly characterized. Unlike mammalian lncRNAs, that as a group are significantly less abundant than canonical mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukherjee et al., 2017</xref>), in herpesviruses lncRNAs represent the most abundant group of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gatherer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tycowski et al., 2015</xref>). These high expression levels allude to essential roles for virally encoded lncRNAs during infection. The three HHV-6 encoded lncRNAs we identified are highly expressed but present distinct features; lncRNA1 is relatively short (232 bp in HHV-6A and 424 bp in HHV-6B) and unspliced, lncRNA2 is composed of three exons that are efficiently spliced, and lncRNA3 represents a complex locus with two different TSSs and polyadenylation sites, three alternatively spliced exons and a stable intron.</p><p>Interestingly, by synteny lncRNA1 and lncRNA3 seem related to HCMV encoded lncRNAs. lncRNA1 resembles the HCMV RNA4.9 as both are transcribed from the viral origin of replication at the same orientation. This similarity implies a possible conserved role of lncRNA transcription in betaherpesviruses origin of replication although they are very different in length (RNA4.9 is 4.9 kb long). lncRNA3 is an orthologue of HCMV encoded RNA5.0 both in synteny and in the production of a stable intron. RNA5.0 has previously been shown to generate a stable intron that is not required for HCMV replication in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulesza and Shenk, 2004</xref>). A murine cytomegalovirus 7.2 kb ortholog of RNA5.0 was identified which also generates a stable intronic RNA. Mutant MCMV viruses lacking this stable intron RNA replicated normally in culture, but exhibited a defect in establishing a persistent infection in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kulesza and Shenk, 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that the production of a stable intronic RNA from this locus is a conserved feature of betaherpesviruses, implying a central function. Importantly, the notion that this non-coding region is conserved in betaherpesviruses and therefore likely represents a functional component was already specified 15 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>). The strong expression of the intronic RNA, which is 100-fold higher compared to the spliced RNA, and its conservation in beta herpesviruses points that this intronic RNA is probably the main functional element in this locus. This may also explain the apparent complexity of the locus, if the intronic RNA mediates the function, there will be no selection to maintain a specific RNA isoform or a specific transcription start site as long as the intron is generated, allowing multiple isoforms to arise from the same locus.</p><p>The high abundance of this RNA together with its conservation make the molecular and functional characterization of these viral intronic RNAs highly interesting. There is little known about the mechanisms by which stable intronic RNAs may operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osman et al., 2016</xref>) but one possibility is that these RNAs sequester spliceosomes or specific splicing components that cause changes in the cellular splicing activity. Interestingly, a small non-coding RNA (sncRNA-U77) that is mapped to the intron of lncRNA3 was shown to be expressed by HHV-6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nukui et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that the stable intron is further processed to create additional functional elements. Furthermore, a recent study showed that TSA-mediated HHV-6A transactivation results in increased transcription from a region overlapping the lncRNA3 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prusty et al., 2018a</xref>), implying lncRNA3 may be involved in HHV-6A reactivation.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive annotation of HHV-6 transcripts and ORFs and highlight conserved translation patterns and non-coding RNAs that may have central shared functions in all betaherpesviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

We also included splice junctions that were detected and were previously known but did not pass the threshold (five junctions in HHV-6A and five in HHV-6B). Two additional previously annotated HHV-6B splice junctions that were not detected were added to the final list.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Prediction of translation initiation sites</title><p>Translation initiation sites were predicted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, a support vector machine model was trained to identify initiation sites based on normalized footprint profiles of the CHX, Harr and LTM samples (one sample of each type for each virus). A positive example set was composed of previously annotated translation initiation sites that were also well translated in our data (at least seven read counts in the normalized Harr peak, 39/58 ORFs for HHV-6A and 31/47 for HHV-6B). 10 negative examples were computed for each positive example. 2/3 of the combined set of positive and negative examples was used as a training set for the prediction model. The model was trained using a radial basis kernel, γ = 2, C = 50, relative positive example weighing of 1.0, and without iterative removal and retraining, and used to produce a score for each potential translation initiation site based on their CHX, Harr and LTM footprint profiles. Initiation sites that scored less than 0.5 were discarded. The remaining 1/3 of the example set was used for cross-validation, which showed 37% and 25% false-negative rate, and 2% and 5% false-positive rate for HHV-6A and HHV-6B respectively. The trained classifier was then applied to all plus and minus strand codons that had at least seven normalized Harr read counts. ORFs were then defined by extending each initiating codon to the next in-frame stop codon, and incorporating any intervening splice junctions. Previously annotated ORFs that were not recognized by the trained model but presented observable translation in manual inspection were added to the final ORF list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of uORF and iORF conservation and kinetics uORFs were curated by selecting all ORFs of the predicted ORFs initiating in the 200 bp region upstream of each previously annotated ORF that are shorter than 200 bp. iORFs were curated by selecting ORFs longer than 20aa initiating within each previously annotated ORF. The total number of iORFs and uORFs for each main ORF was summed.</p><p>The comparison of HHV-6 annotations to HCMV was based on previously published Ribo-seq, RNA-seq and annotations of HCMV merlin strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tirosh et al., 2015</xref>).

HCMV kinetic class annotations were taken from a proteomics-based publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>).

By using ribosome profiling and RNAseq, several new open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, and comparison of the data with human cytomegalovirus showed that a number of these ORFs are conserved between these two betaherpesviruses. In addition, three highly abundant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified. This work provides an important basis for future work on these herpesviruses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Comprehensive annotations of human herpesvirus 6A and 6B genomes reveal novel and conserved genomic features&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bhupesh K Prusty (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Comprehensive annotations of Human Herpesvirus 6A and 6B genomes reveal novel and conserved genomic features&quot;, Finkel et al. employed an integrative transcription and translation start site profiling approach to comprehensively characterize the gene products of HHV-6A and HHV-6B in HSB2 and MOLT-3 cells, respectively. They identified hundreds of novel viral transcripts and ORFs, including many uORFs and iORFs. The authors observed conserved patterns of uORF translation across betaherpesviruses. Supporting the role of alternate transcription start sites observed in other herpesviruses, they also observed prevalent non-canonical translation start site usage in both HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Most interestingly, they identified three highly expressed viral large non-coding RNAs that presumably reflect conserved viral large non-coding RNAs known to be expressed by other betaherpesviruses. One of these generated a non-polyadenylated stable intron that seems to be conserved among betaherpesviruses. In summary, this is first systematic study that comprehensively analyses viral gene expression in both HHV-6A and HHV-6B as well as its conservation in HCMV. The respective data will be invaluable not only for the entire HHV-6 community but for the herpesvirus field in general.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, the authors emphasize the comprehensive annotation of human herpesvirus 6A and 6B. Unfortunately, they do not provide a format the research community could use. They should provide a fully annotated GenBank file based on their exciting data (incl. new genes, splice variant and SNPs) that the community can use and cite.</p><p>2) The authors used lactimidomycin (LTM) and Harringtonine (Harr) treatments for mapping translation initiation. In Figure 1 and several other panels they show the LTM data; however, for many other panels they left it out. Was the LTM data not consistent with the Harr data in these analyses? If the LTM data was comparable to Harr, the authors should include this line as done for the other panels. If not, the authors should discuss the differences between the two treatments.</p><p>3) The authors should include a figure that depicts the signal-to-noise ratio of their Ribo-seq data (triplet-shifts of the translating ribosomes (cumulative reads in the three different frames in relation to the transcription start site)).</p><p>4) The authors identified three novel large non-coding RNAs, two of which are heavily spliced. The transcription start site profiling RNA-seq data are very convincing regarding the existence of these viral lncRNAs. As these lncRNAs appear to be highly expressed, it should be relatively straight forward to confirm them by Northern Blot. In particular, this would reveal alternatively spliced isoforms which may differ in function. Moreover, this would provide a much more solid basis of these fascinating novel gene products for future studies.</p><p>5) The continuous increase in viral gene expression throughout lytic infection results in a much broader range of transcripts (transcription start sites) late in infection. This will result in an increased number of uORFs and iORFs late in infection. It is interesting that viral late genes tend to have more uORFs than early genes. How reliable is the current annotation of viral early and late genes? The authors imply that uORFs and iORFs originate from alterations in the fidelity of the ribosomes at late times of infection. However, early viral mRNAs are still transcribed, present and translated at late times of infection. Therefore, it is unclear why viral late genes should be preferentially affected regarding translation of viral uORFs. Could the observed correlation simply result from a higher level of gene expression of the viral late genes compared to viral early genes (and thus a higher sensitivity for picking up uORF translation)? The authors should assess the impact of gene expression levels on their ability to detect viral uORFs and how this relates to their observation that uORFs are more prevalent in viral late genes.</p><p>6) Similarly, iORFs will become more prevalent throughout lytic infection due to the increase in viral gene expression and the increase in the number of different viral transcripts present within the infected cells at late times of infection. While HHV6 iORFs may result from a failure of translation initiation at the upstream AUG, it is equally if not more likely that they originate from alternative transcripts that only initiate downstream of the respective AUG. This was most prevalent for HSV-1. While the RNA-seq approach the authors employed provides a strong transcription start site enrichment, it is not nearly as sensitive (transcription start site enrichment) as other approaches, e.g. dRNA-seq. Therefore, the authors are likely to have missed a decent number of transcription start sites that presumably explain translation of the viral iORFs they observed. This is particularly likely for highly expressed genes, which will mask embedded alternative transcription start sites. The authors should carefully rephrase their discussion to also consider more promiscuous transcription initiation (rather than translational fidelity) at late times of infection explaining novel iORFs and uORFs.</p><p>7) The non-polyadenylated lncRNA3 is particularly interesting as a small non-coding RNA (U77) has previously been reported to be expressed from this region by Nukui, Mori and Murphy, 2015. Moreover, Prusty et al., 2018a, also demonstrated induction of viral transcription from this region immediately after viral reactivation. The authors may want to discuss their results in the light of these previous reports.</p><p>8) Please provide a figure depicting the use of non-canonical start sites during the 3 different stages of infection for HHV-6B.</p><p>9) Please provide more details how sequencing data were processed from the viral repeat regions. Currently, no data is shown from ORFs transcribed from the DR regions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50960.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, the authors emphasize the comprehensive annotation of human herpesvirus 6A and 6B.

This figure is not dramatically different from the analysis that we already presented in Figure 6D and we now added it as Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Both analyses show that around 50% of our footprints data maps to frame 0. Since the RNAse-I digestion of the ribosome-protected fragments is imperfect, each individual footprint provides a limited statistical evidence of the ribosome position. However, averaging multiple reads allows unambiguous determination of the reading frame (in sharp contrast to the 5′ termini of the mRNA reads). The observed level of enrichment in footprints that align to the translated frame is analogous to that observed in previous mammalian cells libraries (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012) and indicate the ribosome profiling data is of high quality. It is important to note this analysis only reflects the signal-to-noise of our P-site mapping but not the signal-to-noise of our ORF predictions as these predictions are not dependent per-se on our single-base resolution mapping as the SVM is trained on the Harr, LTM and CHX ribosome density profiles of a set of well-expressed canonical viral ORFs. Therefore, the signal to noise of the predictions is calculated by false positive and false negative rates of a cross-validation set (2% and 37% for HHV-6A and 5% and 25% for HHV-6B, respectively), as detailed in the Materials and methods section. This means that we are likely missing expressed ORFs in our annotations but our false discovery rate is relatively low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors identified three novel large non-coding RNAs, two of which are heavily spliced.

Since we were not able to obtain a permit for radioactive work in the time-frame for revisions, we have used biotin labeled probes which might be less sensitive. With these, we were able to detect the lncRNA3 intron band at the expected size, but not the shorter and less abundant lncRNAs. Since the reviewers raised the point of relative abundance of the different lncRNA3 isoforms we thought an important issue to address is the true abundance of lncRNA3 intron (which does not have poly-A tail) relative to its spliced poly-adenylated isoforms and the rest of the viral transcripts. We therefore conducted an additional RNA-seq experiment, this time without poly-A enrichment step. This experiment revealed that the intron of HHV-6B lncRNA3 is more than 100-fold more abundant than the spliced lncRNA3 isoforms. We also performed a similar experiment in HCMV infected cells in which we found that the HCMV RNA5.0 intron is 10-fold more abundant than spliced the RNA5.0. While we were not able to probe for the relative expression of the different spliced lncRNA3 isoforms, we think the extremely high abundance of the intron, the uniqueness of a stable intron feature and its conservation in different β herpesviruses points that the intron itself is probably the dominant functional element in this locus. It is therefore possible that the variety of 5’ TSSs and splicing isoforms in this locus, all sharing the same intron, arise from a weaker selection on other features of this locus. This option is now further discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>The Northern blot analysis and RNA-seq results were added as Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The continuous increase in viral gene expression throughout lytic infection results in a much broader range of transcripts (transcription start sites) late in infection.

However, this should be true for both late and early genes that are expressed at late stages of infection. As pointed out by the reviewers, higher expression of a gene at late time points of infection increases the probability for detecting novel uORFs and iORFs related to it. Nonetheless, our data reveals that late genes have relatively more uORFs but not more iORFs. This distinction supports the assumption that there is probably a specific enrichment of uORFs in late genes that does not only stem from differences in their expression. To further explore this issue, we tested for correlation between RNA expression level of each ORF and the number of related uORFs found. As may be expected, some correlation (Pearson's R = 0.34) was found in HHV-6B ORFs, but not in HHV-6A or HCMV ORFs (R = 0.04 and R = 0.03 respectively), suggesting expression levels probably do not solely explain the enrichment we see for uORFs in late genes (this analysis is now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Also, it is worth noting that we are not arguing late genes have intrinsic higher propensity to recruit ribosomes, rather, that late genes probably tend to acquire 5’ UTRs features that support more uORF initiation (i.e. near cognate codons in the right distance and the right Kozak context). As for the reliability of current kinetic class annotation, we present in Figure 7A (and Figure 7—source data 1) the classification of HHV-6B ORFs together with the temporal clusters that are based on our Ribo-seq measurements. As we describe in the Results, the current annotation agrees quite well with our measurements, with few exceptions, some of which are discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Similarly, iORFs will become more prevalent throughout lytic infection due to the increase in viral gene expression and the increase in the number of different viral transcripts present within the infected cells at late times of infection. While HHV6 iORFs may result from a failure of translation initiation at the upstream AUG, it is equally if not more likely that they originate from alternative transcripts that only initiate downstream of the respective AUG. This was most prevalent for HSV-1. While the RNA-seq approach the authors employed provides a strong transcription start site enrichment, it is not nearly as sensitive (transcription start site enrichment) as other approaches, e.g. dRNA-seq. Therefore, the authors are likely to have missed a decent number of transcription start sites that presumably explain translation of the viral iORFs they observed. This is particularly likely for highly expressed genes, which will mask embedded alternative transcription start sites. The authors should carefully rephrase their discussion to also consider more promiscuous transcription initiation (rather than translational fidelity) at late times of infection explaining novel iORFs and uORFs.</p></disp-quote><p>We never intended to imply that iORF initiation are likely stemming from changes in the ribosome fidelity and we fully agree that probably many of the alternative translation products we see stem from alternative transcription initiation (which was also the main feature that stemmed from our previous HCMV publication). This is now more explicitly stated in the Discussion (Discussion, third paragraph). A representative example for that can be found in the HHV-6 gene U53 and the HCMV gene UL80, as seen in Figure 7B of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The non-polyadenylated lncRNA3 is particularly interesting as a small non-coding RNA (U77) has previously been reported to be expressed from this region by Nukui, Mori and Murphy, 2015. Moreover, Prusty et al., 2018a, also demonstrated induction of viral transcription from this region immediately after viral reactivation. The authors may want to discuss their results in the light of these previous reports.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing these results to our attention. We now discuss these results as follows: &quot;Interestingly, a small non-coding RNA (sncRNA-U77) that is mapped to the intron of lncRNA3 was shown to be expressed by HHV-6A (Nukui, Mori and Murphy, 2015). It is therefore possible that the stable intron is further processed to create different functional elements. Furthermore, a recent study showed that TSA-mediated HHV-6A transactivation results in increased transcription from a region overlapping the lncRNA3 locus (Prusty et al., 2018a), implying lncRNA3 may be involved in HHV-6A reactivation. &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please provide a figure depicting the use of non-canonical start sites during the 3 different stages of infection for HHV-6B.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we added Figure 7—figure supplement 4, which is referred to in the subsection “uORFs are enriched in betaherpesvirus late genes”. This figure shows a higher proportion of non-AUG start codons in ORFs that are expressed in late kinetics according to our clustering analysis. This increased use of non-canonical start codons at late time points may further point on potential changes in the translation apparatus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please provide more details how sequencing data were processed from the viral repeat regions. Currently, no data is shown from ORFs transcribed from the DR regions.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis, we ignored reads that were aligned to multiple locations in the genome therefore the repeat regions were not included in our analysis. We now clearly state this in the Materials and methods section: &quot;Reads aligned to multiple locations were discarded, therefore, repeat regions of the genome were not included in our analysis&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
