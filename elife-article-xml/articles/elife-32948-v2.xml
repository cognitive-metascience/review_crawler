To resolve the origins of stable inheritance of repression, we probed the intrinsic character of spreading events in fission yeast using a system that quantitatively describes the spreading reaction in live single cells. We show that spreading triggered by noncoding RNA-nucleated elements is stochastic, multimodal, and fluctuates dynamically across time. This lack of stability correlates with high histone turnover.

Most heterochromatin formation occurs by a sequence-indifferent spreading reaction that propagates heterochromatic marks, structural proteins, and associated effector proteins outwards from nucleation sites. The precise extent of the spreading reaction has critical heritable consequences for cell identity. For example, in early pluripotent precursors, pre-existing heterochromatin domains spread, sometimes over megabases, to repress specifiers of inappropriate fates. Importantly, the final extent of spreading from a locus depends on the lineage pathway, hence it varies across different precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>) and has to be precise to achieve a stable cell fate and avoid disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceol et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, spreading also specifies cell type in yeasts, where the cell type is maintained by repressing the mating cassettes at the mating type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekwall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rusche et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the centrality of the spreading reaction in shaping cell identity, its native and intrinsic cellular characteristics, as well as mechanisms for its inter-generational propagation, have remained opaque.</p><p>We have some understanding of how cells inherit silencing at nucleation sites, which constitute the DNA-sequence driven component of heterochromatin. Recent results in heterochromatin systems signaled by Histone 3 Lysine 9 and Lysine 27 methylation (H3K9me and H3K27me) indicate that several mechanisms act together to ensure intergenerational inheritance: continuous DNA-mediated recruitment of the histone methylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laprell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Moazed, 2017</xref>), low histone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aygün et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taneja et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the positive ‘read-write’ feedback loop for histone methylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, studies suggest that either the histone mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaydos et al., 2014</xref>) or the histone methylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petruk et al., 2012</xref>) can persist trans-generationally.</p><p>These insights concerning nucleation sites do not necessarily account for how regions of heterochromatin distal to these sites are maintained. Unlike nucleation, which depends on DNA-based enzyme recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdel et al., 2004</xref>), spreading depends on the ability of the system to propagate along the chromosome, independent of the underlying DNA sequence. Such propagation requires the ‘read-write’ positive feedback function of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To determine how the spreading reaction acts in the maintenance of cell fate, it is central to understand the native behavior of two interconnected but separable phases of spreading: The initial spreading event, and the propagation of the states formed by this initial event through cell divisions. There is evidence that the initial spreading, at least in contexts outside the native chromosomal position, is stochastic, that is only some nucleation events result in a spreading event. This was first demonstrated by observing position effect variegation (PEV) in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muller, 1930</xref>). Such stochastic behavior would have to be mitigated across cells to achieve a coherent specification outcome.</p><p>Intergenerational propagation of spreading is straightforward to conceptualize when epigenetic information is strongly reinforced, but more challenging in situations where modified nucleosomes are less likely to persist. This is the case for H3K9me-signaled heterochromatin in the fission yeast system, which lacks DNA methylation that can reinforce the epigenetic state. Persistence of the modified state is opposed by an anti-silencing protein Epe1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ayoub et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>), which acts by antagonizing retention of H3K9me histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aygün et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>), and passage through S-phase, which significantly weakens heterochromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). For fission yeast, there is evidence in favor of both high fidelity and stochastic propagation of the state formed by spreading. In support of a high fidelity model, theoretical work suggests that heterochromatin can display fundamentally bistable behavior, indicating that the ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ states are intrinsically highly stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodd et al., 2007</xref>). Similar bistable behavior has also been experimentally observed in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2015</xref>). Conversely, the telomere position effect (TPE) observed in budding and fission yeast supports a model where intergenerational inheritance is fundamentally stochastic. In TPE the heterochromatic state is switched at high frequencies in the inheriting generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nimmo et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish whether spreading shapes and enables epigenetic maintenance of a cell identity locus via either of those modes, or combinations thereof, we focused on one of the most well understood heterochromatin loci, the fission yeast MAT locus, as a model. This locus remains tightly repressed to avoid simultaneous expression of both mating cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekwall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noma et al., 2001</xref>). The MAT locus contains two <italic>cis</italic> elements that directly recruit H3K9me. (1) <italic>cenH,</italic> which is related to the <italic>dg</italic> and <italic>dh</italic> repeats at the pericentromere and <italic>tlh2</italic> at the subtelomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grewal and Klar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2006</xref>). These sequences nucleate H3K9me by at least two pathways, which depend on transcription of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs): the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Volpe et al., 2002</xref>), and at least one separate pathway dependent on nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, which requires the budding yeast Nrd1 homology Seb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marina et al., 2013</xref>) (collectively ‘ncRNA-nucleation’). Separately and unique to the MAT locus, (2) a region downstream of <italic>cenH</italic> including the <italic>REIII</italic> element, which recruits the H3K9 histone methylase, HP1 proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This is dependent on <italic>REIII-</italic>bound transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>), but is independent of RNA processes. Heterochromatin formation within the MAT locus is confined by boundary elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noma et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2006</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we probe heterochromatin spreading nucleated both at the MAT locus as well as ectopically in the genome with a ‘heterochromatin spreading sensor’ (HSS), which enables quantitative examination of spreading separately from nucleation in single <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells. Using the HSS, we show that ncRNA-dependent elements trigger epigenetically unstable spreading that is stabilized by an accessory RNA-independent <italic>cis-</italic>ating element. Both elements collaborate to form a high fidelity domain. The strategy we uncover has important implications for how heterochromatin spreading achieves and maintains ‘epigenetic’ character and can safeguard cell identity against environmental perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single-cell heterochromatin spreading sensor (HSS) controls for nucleation and cellular noise</title><p>To assess the intrinsic behavior of heterochromatin spreading and what shapes its precise re-establishment with respect to position and extent of repression (‘fidelity’), we employed transcriptionally encoded fluorescent reporters to read silencing by heterochromatin at a given locus, as previously reported. Several critical improvements over prior systems enable documentation of the spreading reaction at high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bintu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hathaway et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Obersriebnig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). First, our system has high signal to noise and minimized delay from epigenetic changes to fluorescent output. We accomplish this using the weak, well-characterized <italic>ade6</italic> gene promoter (<italic>ade6p</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allshire et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kagansky et al., 2009</xref>) to drive production of bright, fast-folding fluorescent proteins (XFPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2016</xref>). Second, our system provides separate sensors for nucleation, spreading, and cellular noise. We used <italic>ade6p-</italic>driven recoded super-folder GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>) (‘green’) and monomeric Kusabira Orange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>) (‘orange’) to report on nucleation and spreading, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A third XFP, an <italic>ade6p</italic>-driven triple fusion of E2Crimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strack et al., 2009</xref>) (‘red’, noise filter), is fully uncoupled from heterochromatin and inserted in a euchromatic locus. Here it reports on intrinsic or extrinsic noise that arises from cell-to-cell variation in the content of specific and general transcription factors and also translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate this reporter system, we characterized the non-heterochromatic state, via null mutation of <italic>clr4</italic> (<italic>Δclr4</italic>), encoding the only <italic>S. pombe</italic> H3K9 methyltransferase. We show that in the absence of heterochromatin, expression of the noise reporter (‘red’) correlates well with that of reporters for both nucleation (‘green’) and spreading (‘orange’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), especially when all cells in the population are considered without applying a size gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, ρ ~0.83–0.93). This analysis mode is required when cell number is limiting. When a smaller subset is considered where all the cells are of similar size and stage of the cell cycle, the correlation still provides useful noise filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which becomes evident when the normalization is applied to <italic>clr4+</italic> cells that fall in the size gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, cellular noise is mitigated by dividing the signals from the proximal ‘green’ and distal ‘orange’ heterochromatic reporters by the signal of the ‘red’, euchromatic reporter (‘green’/‘red’; ‘orange’/‘red’). Together, these elements constitute our heterochromatin spreading sensor (HSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32948.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterochromatin spreading from ncRNA-nucleated elements is stochastic and produces intermediate states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of heterochromatin spreading sensor.

We replaced the <italic>ura4+</italic> open-reading frame (ORF) with ‘green’ to track nucleation element-proximal events. Then, to track distal events, we inserted ‘orange’ at one of several sites downstream from ‘green’ (<italic>ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>1kb</sup><italic>, ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>3kb</sup><italic>, ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>5kb</sup> <italic>ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>7kb</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

All strains were initially constructed in a <italic>Δclr4</italic> background, and we initiated heterochromatin formation by crossing in <italic>clr4+</italic>. We assessed heterochromatin formation after ~80–100 generations by quantifying the production of ‘green’ and ‘orange’. This period is significantly longer than ~25 generation timeframe required for full formation of a heterochromatic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Obersriebnig et al., 2016</xref>), ensuring that the population is at equilibrium.</p><p>To quantitatively assess the products of heterochromatin formation, we performed steady-state flow cytometry on log-phase cells, which were size-gated for small, recently divided cells (~91% G2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplemental experimental materials) to remove size- and cell cycle-related effects. At this stage, we only normalize the cells by the ‘red’ noise filter and scale the signal in each channel to <italic>Δclr4</italic>, giving us a broad overview of the possible expression states of ‘green’ and ‘orange’. We observe no cells that express ‘green’ but repress ‘orange’ (insets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), instead, all cells that are fully or partially ‘orange’ repressed are also robustly ‘green’ repressed. This observation, together with our finding that ‘green’ repression kinetically anticipates ‘orange’ repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), is consistent with heterochromatin spreading outward from the <italic>ura4::dh</italic> nucleator. Considering ‘green’ repression thus a proxy for nucleation, we observed that cells populate a wide range of nucleation states rather than a single state, with the distribution of repressed states varying among the HSS distance sensor strains (<italic>ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>1-7kb</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To specifically examine cells that have fully nucleated, we applied a computational ‘nucleation clamp’ that isolates cells with a ‘green’ signal that is lower than the median plus two standard deviations of wild-type cells containing no XFPs (see Appendix 1-Supplemental Materials and methods). Using ‘orange’ as a spreading proxy, we found spreading to be stochastic in nucleated cells, with some cells exhibiting full repression, but others partial repression or full de-repression (<italic>Δclr4</italic>, x = 1) of the ‘orange’ spreading sensor. The proportion of cells that are fully repressed by spreading declines linearly with distance (scheme, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, cells that are not fully repressed mostly exhibit intermediate levels of repression, which are neither at values of full repression or de-repression.</p><p>We next assessed the nature of these intermediate states in the 3 kb distance reporter strain, where ~30% of cells had maximal repression at the ‘orange’ locus and the remainder had intermediate states ranging from strongly to weakly repressed. Using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), we gated for successful nucleation in the ‘green’ channel and then binned the ‘orange’ channel for fully repressed (low), intermediate and de-repressed (high) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, cartoon). We queried each bin for molecular events associated with heterochromatin formation, using RT-qPCR to determine the expression levels of ‘orange’, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to query the presence of the marks H3K9me2 and H3K4me3. These marks are thought to be mutually exclusive, associating with repressed heterochromatin and active promoters, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noma et al., 2001</xref>). The message level of ‘orange’ is tightly repressed in the ‘low’ population (0.05 of max), partially repressed in the intermediate population (0.3 of max), and nearly fully ‘de-repressed’ (0.8 of max) in the ‘high’ population. Thus, cells with intermediate fluorescence also exhibit partial gene repression, demonstrating that fluorescence accurately reports on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, RT primers indicated in diagram in 1C, solid line). Histone modification levels also correlated well with the HSS signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, ChIP primers indicated in diagram in 1C, dashed line). The ‘low’ fluorescence population has high H3K9me2 (0.9 of <italic>dh</italic>, positive control) and low H3K4me3 (0.09 of actin, positive control); the intermediate population had intermediate H3K9me2 (0.49 of <italic>dh</italic>) and H3K4me3 (0.23 of actin), and the high population had low H3K9me2 (0.2 of <italic>dh</italic>) and higher H3K4me3 (0.44 of actin). Hence, successfully nucleated cells with intermediate fluorescence also exhibit intermediate amounts of the mRNA for ‘orange’ and histone marks reflecting heterochromatin (H3K9me2) and transcriptional activity (H3K4me3). These results support the notion that intermediate states of repression observed by cytometry represent intermediate states of spreading.</p><p>These observations are not due to the particularities of the ectopic site chosen or the behavior of the XFPs, as our results are recapitulated at the <italic>his1</italic> locus (<italic>his1::dh</italic>HSS<sup>3kb</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which contains only one gene (<italic>rec10</italic>) in the ‘spreading zone’, rather than several transcriptional units. Additionally, switching the nucleation and spreading reporter fluorophores produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results suggest that ncRNA-driven heterochromatin spreading at ectopic sites is intrinsically stochastic and multimodal, producing intermediate states of repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct forms of heterochromatin spreading at MAT</title><p>We next examined spreading behavior at the endogenous mating type locus (MAT), which is tightly repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grewal and Klar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thon et al., 2002</xref>) and a <italic>bona fide</italic> high-fidelity locus, as it can behave in a bistable manner with stable epigenetic inheritance even when disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>).

To our surprise, the high fidelity that the MAT locus exhibits in the repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>) disappeared. Instead, <italic>cenH</italic> nucleated spreading in the <italic>ΔREIII</italic> strain behaved similarly to spreading from the ectopic ncRNA-nucleated strains, showing high stochasticity and predominantly intermediate repression states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We wanted to address if this stochastic silencing is reflected in weakened heterochromatin assembly. We preformed ChIP for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, marks signaling heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>) and repression or spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jih et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), respectively. We found that these marks decline progressively towards the distal ‘orange’ reporter in <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), compared to the wild-type (WT) MAT<sup>HSS</sup>. This is consistent with the observed tight repression for WT MAT<sup>HSS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and weakened silencing at the distal ‘orange’ in <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is possible that this difference in spreading results from an altered heterochromatin structure at <italic>cenH</italic> in <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup>. However, H3K9me2 and me3 accumulation does not differ between <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> and WT MAT<sup>HSS</sup> at the <italic>cenH</italic> nucleator, or the leftward <italic>REII</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the observed behavior of <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> is consistent with stochastic and multimodal spreading, rather than compromised nucleation at <italic>cenH</italic>.</p><p>To examine heterochromatin formation independent of <italic>cenH</italic>, we used the historical <italic>ΔK</italic> strain, where the entire <italic>cenH</italic> nucleation element is deleted and replaced with a <italic>ura4+</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>). We introduced the HSS into this context (<italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), placing the ‘green’ reporter proximal to <italic>REIII</italic> and the ‘orange’ reporter distally, replacing <italic>ura4</italic>. We then introduced <italic>clr4+</italic> by cross and directly cultured colonies derived from germinated <italic>clr4+</italic> spores. We found that although <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> has very weak nucleation compared to strains with intact ncRNA nucleators, the distribution of cells is sharply bimodal: Cells were either repressed at both reporters (‘OFF’, lower left corner) or de-repressed at both reporters (‘ON’, upper right corner; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We note that isolation of single colonies on nonselective media from original spores of the cross yields mostly ON (<italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup>) or OFF (<italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup>) colonies, consistent with each state being metastable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thon and Friis, 1997</xref>).

Additionally, the bimodal behavior does not require the H3K9me-independent gene-repressive <italic>REII</italic> element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>), as <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> <italic>REII::LEU2</italic>, containing a deletion of <italic>REII</italic>, behaved similarly to <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and is further independent of reporter placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). We next characterized the molecular signature of the locus. While in our two color plots cells that were repressed in ‘green’ did not show any de-repression in ‘orange’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, cells in bottom left corner), we wanted to test if the heterochromatic state at these loci correlated with this silencing pattern. Since we can isolate <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup> and <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> alleles by simple plating of <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> cells, we performed H3K9me2 ChIP on both and H3K9me3 ChIP for <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> cells (not detectable for <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup>). We found that methylation correlates with the repression state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and importantly, does not significantly differ between ‘green’ and ‘orange’.

Under this constraint, the three strains exhibit vastly different behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). WT MAT<sup>HSS</sup> cells maintained ‘orange’ repression for the majority of their measured lifespans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). However, we documented transient loss of ‘orange’ silencing for 20% of the cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In contrast, while most cells stay similarly nucleated in <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) 83% of the cells imaged experienced at least half-maximal ‘orange’ de-repression at some time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For this strain, 30% of the cells transited through the fully ON state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>). In fact, cells sampled a wide range of values from OFF to fully ON, indicating that cells do not occupy ON or OFF states exclusively, but adopt intermediate values across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> cells, just as <italic>ura4::dh</italic>HSS<sup>3kb</sup> cells, fluctuate in their ‘orange’ values, indicating that spreading is unstable and adopts a random walk type behavior. To analyze <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> cells, which exist predominantly in fully ‘green’ and ‘orange’ ON state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we analyzed <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> cells (see above). <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> behaved markedly differently from <italic>ΔREIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup>: in all the cells analyzed, ‘green’ and ‘orange’ reporters remained OFF throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video5">Figure 3—video 5</xref>), up to 25 generations, revealing a fundamentally different dynamic behavior between <italic>cenH-</italic> and <italic>REIII-</italic>dependent heterochromatin. We note it remains possible that isolation of a <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> colony may bias our analysis against potentially more frequent OFF-ON switching events in the primary mixed population derived from continuous propagation of the germinated spore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, since the mixed population resolves spontaneously into ON and OFF states once plated, and OFF cells behave similarly in either the mixed <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> or <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> isolated populations (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and Figure 5C), we believe the stability of <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> is intrinsic to the <italic>ΔK</italic> MAT locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Epigenetic stability at MAT is dependent on <italic>REIII</italic></title><p>To probe memory capacity (i.e. the ability of cells to retain information of an ancestral state established many generations prior), we compared cells containing an intact MAT locus to those lacking either ncRNA- or <italic>REIII</italic>-dependent heterochromatin. We established two ancestral states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); one with unperturbed heterochromatin, and a second treated with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), known to fully disrupt the heterochromatin state ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2002</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following production of the ancestral states, we grew cells either in rich media alone or in a TSA concentration gradient (0–50 µM) for 25 generations and then measured the fraction of fully nucleated cells that effectively silence the ‘orange’ spreading marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cells exhibit memory if the fraction of the population with full spreading (‘orange'<sup>OFF</sup>) depends on the ancestral state, which would be indicated by separation of the unperturbed (light orange) and perturbed (red) lines. In contrast, no memory is indicated by convergence of the two lines (graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). We further measure a second parameter we term relative ‘resistance’, which is defined as the TSA concentration at which the fraction of cells with ‘orange'<sup>OFF</sup> declines to 50% of the no TSA pretreatment value.

Very small ON populations are more apparent in a growth selection based assay as only the targeted population survives, as opposed to our assay, which captures all cells. We note a formal possilibty remains that selection of OFF colonies yields higher apparent stability. To get a closer view of the behavior of individual isolates from the population, after 288 hr of continuous passage, we streaked for single colonies and measured the resulting populations. While 5/6 isolates behaved like the broader population, we found 1/6 isolates that experienced more severe breakdown in its heterochromatic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> RIGHT).

In this work, we were able to directly measure the heterochromatin spreading reaction in single <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, separate from DNA-directed events at nucleation elements, and probe its behaviors and memory characteristics. The central principle that emerges form this work is that heterochromatin spreading in fission yeast, driven predominantly by ncRNA elements, is epigenetically unstable and requires stabilization by accessory elements for high fidelity epigenetic inheritance.

Additionally, the linear distance-dependent behavior we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is reminiscent of the continuous spreading model in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renauld et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D and E</xref>). In a key result, we find ncRNA-triggered spreading to be epigenetically unstable. This is evidenced by highly dynamic behaviors over time and across generations, little discernable memory, and low resistance to chemical or environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Those behaviors are not necessarily predicted by the stochastic induction spreading, given that PEV in flies results in clonally inherited patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>). This result opens the question how high fidelity can be achieved with ncRNA nucleators at loci that carry critical cell type specification information. The most likely cause for this instability is elevated and near-euchromatic levels of histone turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This implies that while elevated histone turnover is compatible with heterochromatin formation per se, it is incompatible with epigenetic memory.</p><p>In contrast to the behavior of <italic>ΔREIII</italic>, <italic>ΔK</italic> cells, dependent on <italic>REIII</italic> for heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A&amp;B</xref>), do not display stochasticity in spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>), and instead repress MAT uniformly across nucleated cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

A <italic>REIII</italic> nucleated spreading model is favored by results presented here and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Moazed, 2017</xref>) that demonstrate that Atf1 and Pcr1 proteins or their binding sites are absolutely required for established of heterochromatin in <italic>ΔK</italic> cells, yet not for <italic>ΔREIII</italic> cells.

We speculate that reduced turnover increases retention of H3K9me3 nucleosomes, promoting methylation across nucleosomes by Clr4 via its H3K9me-dependent ‘read-write’ functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jih et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), thus facilitating re-establishment in the next generation.

We speculate that since Atf1/Pcr1 recruits silencing factors such as Clr4 and HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>), heterochromatin originating from <italic>cenH</italic> might stabilize this recruitment. This hypothesis is supported by our observation for nucleation during TSA recovery. Although <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> cells very rarely renucleate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), <italic>REIII</italic> at the intact MAT locus must be active in most cells, as the heterochromatin reformed after erasure has much higher resistance to perturbation than that nucleated from <italic>cenH</italic> alone (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>Activated <italic>REIII</italic> in turn stabilizes the MAT locus most prominently when the heterochromatin state is perturbed. We infer this from the difference between the initial challenge and recovery from growth at high temperatures. When initially challenged, heterochromatin spreading at the wild-type MAT locus resembles that of ncRNA-nucleated heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>REIII</italic> or other nearby elements plays a minor role under normal circumstances at MAT. However, the heat recovery experiment suggests that changes in the <italic>REIII</italic>–dependent heterochromatin stabilization or assembly, not <italic>cenH</italic> nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), takes on a major role in the accelerated recovery of the collapsed heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, <italic>REIII</italic> is required under perturbation conditions to protect or quickly re-establish the heterochromatin state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,F</xref> and model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Multi-channel fission yeast lifespan microdissectors (multFYLM) contained six independent devices (channels), each of which is capable of capturing up to 392 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bio-protocol.org/e2783">https://bio-protocol.org/e2783</ext-link>). In brief, the devices were cast in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) using conventional soft lithography methods. Master structures were fabricated from P-doped silicon wafers (ID#452, University Wafers) and SU-8 photoresists 3005 and 2010 (Microchem, Westborough, MA). MultFYLMs were cleaned and adhered to glass coverslips (48 × 65 mm #1, Gold Seal), and then connected to syringes (60 mL, Becton-Dickson) containing YES 225 liquid media (Sunrise Science) via PFA tubing and microfluidic fittings (IDEX Health and Science). The multFYLM was maintained at 30˚C in a custom staged-mounted environmental chamber on an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon) equipped with NIS Elements software (Nikon), a 60X air objective (CFI Plan Apo λ, 0.95 NA, Nikon) fitted with an objective heater (Bioptechs), a motorized stage (Proscan III, Prior), and an active feedback-based focusing system (Perfect Focus System, Nikon). An LED lamp (Sola II, Lumencorp) and a scientific-grade CMOS camera (Zyla 5.5, Andor) were used for fluorescent imaging. Multi-color fluorescent imaging of sfGFP, mKO2 and E2Crimson fluorophores was carried out by alternating between three filter sets mounted in a computer-controlled filter ring (Chroma 49002, 49010 and 49015, respectively). To help with the semi-automated cell identification, each channel was imaged every ten minutes via brightfield imaging (100 ms exposure, both in focus and 4 μm below the focal plane). Fluorescent images of each of the three fluorophores were taken every 30 min (150 ms exposure). This illumination scheme was well below the phototoxicity limit, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2016</xref>). Raw images were saved as uncompressed 16 bit ND2 files and further analyzed using a custom-written image analysis pipeline (see below).</p><p>Cells were grown overnight (30°C with 225 rpm shaking) to saturation in YES media, then diluted in YES to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.1 and allowed to grow for approximately 5 hr to reach an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5. Cells (60 μL at OD 0.5 in YES + 2% Bovine Serum Albumin, BSA) were loaded at the entry port of the multFYLM. After cells entered individual channels, media lines were reattached and YES media was pumped through on a pulse cycle (14 min: 5 µLmin<sup>−1</sup>, 1 min: 55 µLmin<sup>−1</sup>) for the entire experiment. This flow regime was optimized to flush out occasional cell clumps that grew at the device inlets and other fluidic interfaces. Four genotypes were imaged simultaneously for 60 hr in each channel of a multFYLM device to ensure identical imaging and growth conditions. In all cases, we only analyze the innermost cell, which was the oldest cell pole (see below). Cells that were ejected or died within the first 12 hr after loading were not included in the downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Single-cell image analysis</title><p>Single-cell imaging data was processed using an updated version of the custom-written FYLM Critic analysis package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spivey et al., 2017</xref>). The source-code is available via GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/fylm">https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/fylm</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rybarski et al., 2015</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/fylm">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/fylm</ext-link>). FYLM Critic performs the following automated processing on the raw images: (1) rotation; (2) jitter removal via a cross-correlation algorithm; and (3) generation of kymograph and individual cell images. The latter were used to create videos of individual cells in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The final outputs of FYLM critic are the position and contour of each dividing cell, as well as the time-dependent fluorescence intensities for each cell. These fluorescence intensities are obtained by averaging the intensity across all pixels that fall within the cell volume, as defined by the bright-field images. This normalization also ensures that the fluorescence intensity is corrected for the size of the rapidly dividing cells. Time-dependent fluorescent intensities were analyzed via custom-written MATLAB scripts (version 2017a Mathworks, available upon request). Background fluorescence from the PDMS device was subtracted using catch tubes that did not receive a cell. The maximum heterochromatin reporter (GFP, mKO2) fluorescence intensity was calculated using <italic>∆clr4</italic> cells in the same reporter construct background. To control for expression variation across the cell cycle, the fluorescence from heterochromatin reporters was also reported as a ratio of the control fluorophore, E2Crimson. Similarly, cells fluorescing in the clamp channel were removed from analysis for MAT-locus-derived strains (see Appendix 1-Supplemental Materials and methods).</p><p>Single-cell images generated by the FYLM Critic analysis were compiled into stacked movies using Fiji. Images in bright field and for each color channel were processed separately in batch and then later combined into a vertical stack. For each channel, 0.2% of pixels were allowed to become saturated and pixel values were normalized to the maximum range for the whole sequence in that channel. For bright field, every third image was included to match the imaging frequency of the fluorescent channels. Movies were edited for length to include contiguous imaging sequences without loss of focus and for size to remove non-cellular debris and cells from the opposite side of the channel that entered the field of view. After combining all color channels and bright field, the brightness and contrast were increased for cell 407 to match the red channel brightness of the other strains. Image sequences were saved as uncompressed. avi files with a rate of 15 frames/s.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32948.022</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Yeast strains used in this study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Strain</th><th valign="top">Genotype</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">PAS075</td><td valign="top">Locus2<italic>::ade6p::3xE2C:hygMX</italic> at Locus2 (between SPBC1711.11 andSPBC1711.12)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PM03</td><td valign="top">Wild-type strain: h(+); ura4-D18; leu1-32; ade6-M216; his7-366</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PM1035</td><td valign="top"><italic>ura4::natMX:dh</italic> fragment 1, <italic>clr4::KAN</italic> as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marina et al.

They report that spread of silencing from RNAi-nucleated elements is stochastic and multimodal and fluctuates over time. This is also supported by recent work by Obersriebnig et al. The authors also find another form of spreading, nucleated by the cis-acting element <italic>REIII</italic>, that they term deterministic, and that appears to show greater memory and fidelity in local spreading, being better buffered. This finding is novel. However, in the absence of a mechanism for <italic>REIII</italic> -mediated spreading, the work remains preliminary and there may be other interpretations of the data presented, as highlighted in the reviewers' comments. In summary, the authors do not really address the questions of heterochromatin spreading fidelity or memory as they set out to. In particular, evidence for actual &quot;spreading&quot; of heterochromatin from the so-called nucleation site and the genes assayed for silencing at some distance from it, is lacking. Based on the reviewers' comments, the overall conclusion is that this work is potentially of great interest and could be worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in the future. However, in its current version it would require too much work and thus it cannot be deemed appropriate for revision within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The fundamental problem conceptual with this paper is that the experiments are designed and interpreted in the context of a model in which spreading is assumed to be a process that emanates from a regulatory site and progressively reaches a detector site or sites. There is no evidence that &quot;spreading&quot; of heterochromatin of this type actually occurs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> or its relative <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The crucial missing datum for all spreading models is some kind of time resolution between events at the cis-regulatory site, called the nucleation site in this study and others, and the genes at a distance that fall under the control of this regulatory site. Moreover, the way the experiments are conducted, for example by starting with cells and colonies that are preselected to be nucleated (green off) prevents the authors from the opportunity to observe the very data that could falsify the hypothesis (i.e. observing cells in which green is on and orange is off.)</p><p>The second major problem in the paper is the assertion of being able to distinguish between stochastic spreading and deterministic spreading. Let's for the moment imagine that spreading actually occurs. The distinction the authors make between stochastic and deterministic spreading is based upon the range of expression of the detector genes that are positioned to be under the influence of the nucleation site. If that range of expression is narrow, spreading is defined to be deterministic. If it is broad, spreading is defined to be stochastic. The competing model, never mentioned nor tested, is that heterochromatin formed in once case is more stable than heterochromatin formed in the other, but &quot;spreading&quot; is identical in both. Distinguishing between these two models would be easier than some of the experiments in the manuscript, but one needs to acknowledge the competing model before it can be tested.</p><p>The concept of fidelity of spreading is never defined and is less than obvious, yet experiments are interpreted in the context of this fidelity entity.</p><p>The &quot;memory&quot; experiments are interesting but again memory implies a time over which something is remembered. The experiments in Figure 4 may bear upon memory, but they are done in a rather complicated way show the sensitivity of those cells that have been pregrown for 25 generations to a subsequent challenge of various concentrations of TSA with respect to the stability of their expression state at that one time. A demonstration of memory requires a time component over which the thing of interest is remembered, but this experiments design precludes that. To be sure, there is some interesting biology behind the curves in this figure, but at present the experimental design would allow the authors to make interesting claims about the contribution of the various elements to the efficiency of re-establishing heterochromatin…. interesting in itself, but it isn't memory. It seems to me that the issue of memory would be resolved by the kind of clever experiments performed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by the Broach and Gartenberg labs in which the nucleation sites is removed and then the persistence of a state is measured over time in the absence of the element that &quot;nucleated&quot; it. Alternatively, the microfluidic technology behind Figure 3 could be used to address this issue.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The assembly of heterochromatin domains involves nucleation and spreading of silencing factors. However, the degree of fidelity and heritable stability among heterochromatin domains throughout the genome can vary. Here, the authors dissect the origins of the intrinsic high-fidelity and memory capacity associated with stable epigenetic heterochromatin states. To do this, they utilize a system that simultaneously monitors nucleation and spreading driven by individual regulatory elements. They find that heterochromatin spreading driven by an RNAi nucleation site (<italic>cenH</italic>) is multimodal and occurs stochastically. This finding is consistent when measured at ectopic sites as well as at the endogenous MAT locus. By contrast, they argue that spreading driven solely from the endogenous <italic>REIII</italic> element at the MAT locus shows no intermediate levels and is complete (&quot;deterministic&quot;). They conclude that the <italic>REIII</italic> element is required to preserve the epigenetic memory of an ancestral state, as well as to ensure heterochromatin domain maintenance during environmental stress.</p><p>A major strength of this article is the use of a system that quantitatively measures heterochromatic silencing in living cells. The development of such tools has allowed them to tackle key questions in the field of heterochromatin assembly. The conclusion that the spreading of heterochromatin from an RNAi nucleated element is stochastic is also supported by recent work by Obersriebnig et al., 2016, which also used single cell assays. A key new finding here is that a cis-acting element, <italic>REIII</italic>, promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin that has high memory capacity. However, in the absence of a mechanism for the <italic>REIII</italic> -mediated spreading, this aspect of the work remains preliminary. Moreover, the evidence suggesting deterministic spreading from <italic>REIII</italic> needs further careful evaluation.</p><p>1) Regarding the mechanism for the role of <italic>REIII</italic> in epigenetic memory, previous studies have provided important insights that are highly relevant to this story and deserve to be addressed clearly as part of the main discussion. <italic>REIII</italic> (a binding site for ATF-CREB proteins Atf1-Pcr1) was initially shown to be critical for the stability of heterochromatin at MAT, particularly when heterochromatin nucleation by RNAi is compromised (Jia et al., 2004). A recent study confirmed this function of <italic>REIII</italic> (Wang and Moazed, 2017). However, more relevant to this paper are subsequent studies that revealed the mechanism as follows:</p><p>Yamada et al., 2005 found that <italic>REIII</italic> recruits an HDAC Clr3 (see Figure 2), the activity of which is critical for the stability and spread of heterochromatin. Further work showed that Clr3 is a component of the SHREC complex that localizes to <italic>REIII</italic> (see Figure 4 in Cam et al., 2008). These studies set the stage for a critical finding that explained the role of <italic>REIII</italic> /Clr3 in heterochromatin stability. Aygun et al., 2013 discovered Clr3 HDAC as a unique factor that promotes heterochromatin stability by suppressing turnover of histones. Indeed, loss of Clr3 is linked to loss of tri-H3K9me (see Figure 5A in Yamada et al., 2005), which provides the binding site for the chromodomain of Clr4 to reinforce a feedback loop in which tri-H3K9me recruits Clr4 HMTase to promote heterochromatin spreading/maintenance (Zhang et al. 2008; also, Al-Sady et al., and Jih et al., 2017).</p><p>In short: <italic>REIII</italic> → Atf1-Pcr1 → Clr3/SHREC → Suppresses histone turnover/stabilizes tri-H3K9me → Clr4 chromo binding to tri-H3K9me → Heterochromatin spreading/maintenance via feedback loop.</p><p>In light of these previous findings, an important possibility is that mutations in <italic>REIII</italic> impair the recruitment of Clr3 HDAC (e.g. see Figure 3 in Yamada et al., 2005), which in turn results in increased in turnover of H3K9 methylated histones that are required for the spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin. The authors shall test whether ∆<italic>REIII</italic> cells show an elevated level of histone turnover, hence affecting spreading and epigenetic memory.</p><p>2) An important assumption in this study is that cells carrying ORANGEON or ORANGEoff states contain comparable levels of heterochromatin at the nucleation site. However, it is possible that ORANGEON cells contain a relatively lower level of heterochromatin (but still sufficient to repress GREEN with a weak promoter) than ORANGEoff cells (e.g. in WT and ∆<italic>REIII</italic> cells). This should be tested experimentally by assaying H3K9me levels by ChIP at GREEN and ORANGE loci. Also, GREEN inserted in <italic>cenH</italic> is likely silenced post transcriptionally (transcripts of markers inserted near centromeric repeats are converted to siRNAs) and its silencing might not provide an accurate measure of silencing caused by heterochromatin modifications. If true, this would complicate the interpretation of the results.</p><p>3) This reviewer is concerned that the evidence that <italic>REIII</italic> causes deterministic spreading is an artifact of the system. Unlike WT or ∆REII cells that contain GREEN at a bona fide nucleation site, from which heterochromatin is known to spread outward, GREEN in ∆K cells is likely not placed at a nucleation site (there is no evidence that <italic>REIII</italic> alone can nucleate heterochromatin, and no evidence is presented to show that heterochromatin spreads from <italic>REIII</italic> toward ORANGE). In cells with GREEN located closer to the edge of the heterochromatin domain, the silencing of ORANGE located in the middle of the silenced domain might precede GREEN. In this situation, when silencing of ORANGE is assayed in GREENoff cells it would give the false impression of deterministic spreading. Consistent with this, markers inserted near mat3 are known to be silenced less efficiently. Similarly, if nucleation in ∆K cells occurred on the left side of ORANGE, all cells showing GREENoff will carry the ORANGEoff state. Can they confirm that heterochromatin in ∆K cells is indeed nucleated at <italic>REIII</italic>, or if <italic>REIII</italic> simply stabilizes heterochromatin (for example by recruiting Clr3 HDAC Yamada et al., 2005 and Aygun et al., 2013)? Moreover, it is also possible that heterochromatin in ∆K cells is formed in such as a way that it does not involve stepwise mechanism of nucleation and spreading and that the entire domain is silenced simultaneously.</p><p>4) The authors argue in the abstract that the epigenetic capacity contributing to heterochromatin spreading and maintenance is not encoded in the spreading reaction itself, but rather requires specialized memory elements. This statement is misleading. The factors involved in spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin, such as HDACs, are known to be loaded across silenced domains by HP1, which is also required for heterochromatin spreading. However, these same factors (HDACs) can be also loaded by so called specialized/memory elements, further enhancing the stability of heterochromatin. In this respect, the epigenetic capacity is at least partially encoded in the spreading reaction and can be further strengthened by elements that also load activities, such as HDACs, promoting heterochromatin stability.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The fidelity and robustness are two essential characteristics to epigenetic inheritance, which is important both for chromatin structure and cell differentiation in many species. Its full establishment comprises of two stages: nucleation and spreading, which can be executed through RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent and RNAi-independent pathways.</p><p>In this study, Greenstein and colleagues set up an elegant and sensitive single-cell reporter system to dissect these two characteristics. They have used it for population studies and cell-lineage tracking for trans-generation memory. Consistent with previous findings, they showed spreading of heterochromatin nucleated by RNAi alone is robust but low on fidelity, as compared to that nucleated by wild-type locus. Importantly, they have attributed the fidelity in heterochromatin spreading to an RNAi-independent DNA element <italic>REIII</italic>. Further, they have tested the persistence of &quot;memory&quot; as nucleated by RNAi or <italic>REIII</italic> with and without perturbations. The biological importance and complicated nature should make it appealing to a broad audience.</p><p>In Figure 2B and 2C, where modified nucleators of RNAi-alone or <italic>REIII</italic> -alone are tested, the fidelity in spreading and robustness in nucleation segregated clearly in these population studies. However, one concern still remains. As spreading is greatly affected by the distance from the nucleator to the reporter, the actual distance for <italic>REIII</italic> -nucleated spreading should be measured between <italic>REIII</italic> and &quot;orange&quot; reporter, rather than between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; reporter as they are on different sides of the <italic>REIII</italic> nucleator, and to be consistent with Figure 2A and 2B. If the genome feature in Figure 2C is drawn to scale, it is around 1-2 kb in distance. At this distance, even RNAi-nucleated heterochromatin is demonstrating high fidelity in spreading as in the top panel of Figure 1C. At least one testing should be done with the reporter cassette moved further away from <italic>REIII</italic> nucleator by inserting &quot;inert&quot; DNA sequence (from a euchromatic region), to the similar 3-4 kb distance scale as Figure 2A and 2B. It is necessary to exclude the possibility that higher fidelity as in Figure 2C is due to a shorter loop for spreading. If the experiment is not possible, it shall be clearly explained in the text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A memory element imposes epigenetic behavior on intrinsically labile ncRNA-induced heterochromatin spread&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In the previous submission of this manuscript, the work presented was found to be potentially of great interest, particularly the discovery of a novel form of putative heterochromatin spreading, nucleated by the cis-acting element <italic>REIII</italic> that the authors claim has a deterministic role. However, direct evidence for <italic>REIII</italic> -mediated heterochromatin spreading was found to be lacking, and there was no mechanism. In their revised manuscript, the authors have provided several lines of new evidence to address some of the reviewers' comments. In particular, by deleting the <italic>REIII</italic> element, they show that this leads to increased turnover of histones which provides some insight into how <italic>REIII</italic> may be promoting epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. However, the conclusion that <italic>REIII</italic> promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin is still not really supported, as pointed out by reviewer 2. Furthermore, the argument that ∆K cells have better &quot;memory&quot; than WT cells is not supported by previous findings that ∆K cells contain metastable heterochromatin, with frequent conversion from the OFF to the ON state compared to WT. As both reviewers point out, it remains possible that bias may be introduced in the &quot;memory&quot; determinations, due to preselection for ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> colonies.</p><p>Despite these limitations, and given the new work included in this manuscript on this <italic>REIII</italic> -based heterochromatin process, we would be willing to consider a revised text, that focused on the single cell assay showing that loss of <italic>REIII</italic> affects the stability of heterochromatin. In this revised manuscript, specific references to « memory elements » and « deterministic » spreading should be removed, as suggested by reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors performed several experiments that addressed the reviewers' comments and strengthened their conclusions. For example, the extensive chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses performed to assay H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 levels in different strains now correlates changes in gene silencing with heterochromatin levels. Also, this reviewer suggested that they investigate the effects of <italic>REIII</italic> deletion on histone turnover, which has implications for heterochromatin spreading and epigenetic memory. They do indeed find that deletion of <italic>REIII</italic> causes increased turnover of histones. Together with previously published findings showing that <italic>REIII</italic> recruits HDAC Clr3 (Yamada et al., 2005), which is involved in the suppression of histone turnover (Aygun et al., 2013), this finding provides a possible mechanistic insight into how <italic>REIII</italic> promotes epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. With the new additions, this part of the story has improved significantly.</p><p>However, their conclusion that <italic>REIII</italic> promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin remains ambiguous. In particular, unlike <italic>cenH</italic> that has been shown to nucleate heterochromatin, there is no clear evidence presented that heterochromatin spreads outward from the <italic>REIII</italic> element in ∆K cells. Rather, given the bistable nature of heterochromatin at mat in ∆K cells, the assembly of heterochromatin in ∆K cells cells might involve cooperativity between yet unknown elements, as opposed to reliance on the <italic>REIII</italic> element alone. In presenting their case for deterministic spreading from <italic>REIII</italic>, the authors mention previous work showing that loss of <italic>REIII</italic> affects heterochromatin in ∆K cells. However, it is important to note that previous studies (such as Jia, Noma and Grewal, 2004 and Wang and Moazed,.2017) and this article only show that <italic>REIII</italic> is <italic>required</italic> for the stability of heterochromatin (most likely via recruitment of HDAC Clr3 that suppresses histone turnover to prevent loss of H3K9me) but is not <italic>sufficient</italic> to nucleate heterochromatin. Similarly, their argument that ∆K cells have better &quot;memory&quot; than WT cells contrasts with a previous finding that ∆K cells contain metastable heterochromatin, as indicated by the frequent conversion from the OFF to the ON state at a rate many fold higher than in WT. Moreover, it remains possible that bias may be introduced in the &quot;memory&quot; determinations, due to preselection for ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> colonies (see subsection “Multi-generational single cell imaging reveals ncRNA-driven spreading to be unstable”), in which entire mat locus is known to be coated with heterochromatin (Nakayama, Klar and Grewal, 2000).</p><p>My recommendation is to prepare a revised manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> that focuses on the results from their elegant single cell assays showing that the loss of <italic>REIII</italic> affects the stability of heterochromatin and that this behavior of <italic>REIII</italic> is mechanistically linked to the suppression of histone turnover at mat. The discussion would be focused on succinctly describing this feature of <italic>REIII</italic> in the context of previous findings, including the results showing that <italic>REIII</italic> recruits the HDAC Clr3 (Yamada et al., 2005) that also suppresses histone turnover to promote epigenetic stability of heterochromatin (Aygun et al., 2013). Indeed, suppression of histone turnover by <italic>REIII</italic> /HDAC Clr3 may promote retention of methylated histones that are critical for the recruitment of Clr4; thus, promoting the efficient spreading of heterochromatin. Framing the results in this way would avoid the problematic issues raised by applying the terms &quot;memory element&quot; or &quot;deterministic&quot; spreading to <italic>REIII</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have addressed all the critiques raised by this reviewer. In particular, they have now provided more compelling evidence of &quot;spreading&quot; of heterochromatin from corresponding nucleation sites with a more complete testing cassette of different distances, directions, nucleation factors, etc. They have used these testing cassettes to demonstrate the stochasticity of ncRNA-mediated spreading and stability of <italic>REIII</italic> -mediated memory.

We have made major additions to this work to address the reviewers’ comments. The experiments we have included here resulted in a more robust view of spreading in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and enable us to make mechanistic inferences about how the divergent spreading types we describeare enacted. Additionally, the data point to mechanisms underlying memory of repression that is required at a cell type specification locus like MAT. Together, they have made this a much stronger manuscript. The most important additions are as follows.</p><p>1) Establishing directionality of spreading: We have added an additional single cell tacking experiment in the ectopic strain, which together with our previous data, allows us to address the directionality of spreading using the FYLM device. We are happy to report that our data is consistent with a successive nucleation and spreading model. Additionally, we clarify our analysis method, which does not pre-filter cells of any nucleation proximal (“green”) or distal (“orange”) reporter values. We can now report that our cytometry without proximal or distal gating supports a nucleation seeded spreading model.</p><p>2) Tracking heterochromatin structure in our MAT locus strains: We have performed a suite of Chromatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) experiments to address the following issues: a. correlation of repression and heterochromatin structure, b. the stability of nucleation elements in strong and weak spreading strains and c. <italic>REIII -</italic>dependent heterochromatin formation. We can report that the new data support the conclusion that differences in spreading manifest as weaker heterochromatin but are not rooted in weak nucleation.</p><p><italic>3) REIII</italic> mechanism and memory: We added an additional experiment, where we remove nucleation factors post-establishment, which more directly addresses the differences in memory over time in our strains. We provide a mechanistic explanation for increased or decreased memory by tracking histone 3 turnover at euchromatic and MAT locus heterochromatin sites. We can report that <italic>REIII</italic> confers a high degree of memory that is linked to very low histone turnover compared with strains nucleated by RNA-processes that show more euchromatic levels of histone turnover.</p><p>We have additionally adopted the reviewers’ suggestions to simplify and clarify the writing. Finally, both reviewer #1 and #2, compared our findings to those of Obersriebnig et al., a previous study of heterochromatin in single fission yeast cells. This was an important study and we would like to clarify the differences in experimental design and conclusions that distinguishes the two reports.</p><p>In the Obersriebnig work, heterochromatin formation was tracked either by following one color, at <italic>cenH,</italic> near <italic>REII</italic> or <italic>REIII,</italic> or with two colors, one at <italic>cenH</italic> and one near <italic>REIII</italic> in wild-type MAT. Since in all cases both <italic>REIII</italic> and <italic>cenH</italic> nucleators were intact, silencing of either color cannot be ascribed to spreading. In our work, we both inactivate one of the nucleators at a time and track nucleation behavior with one color and spreading with a second. The use of one color can yield silencing kinetics, but by design, the nucleation and spreading events cannot be untangled. The authors make claims about the stochasticity of heterochromatin establishment, which is novel, but not spreading, as is consistent with their experimental design. Conclusions they draw about establishment kinetics are noteworthy, yet those about spreading kinetics again are complicated by having both nucleators intact. This is important, because we believe the novelty of our work, beyond the novel behavior of <italic>REIII,</italic> is the ability to isolate any type of spreading event from the DNA/RNA sequence-driven nucleation component and define its characteristics, including in real time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The fundamental problem conceptual with this paper is that the experiments are designed and interpreted in the context of a model in which spreading is assumed to be a process that emanates from a regulatory site and progressively reaches a detector site or sites. There is no evidence that &quot;spreading&quot; of heterochromatin of this type actually occurs in S. pombe or its relative S. cerevisiae. The crucial missing datum for all spreading models is some kind of time resolution between events at the cis-regulatory site, called the nucleation site in this study and others, and the genes at a distance that fall under the control of this regulatory site.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments which helped improve this work.</p><p>Spreading outward from nucleation sites, linearly or via loops, is the paradigm for propagating heterochromatin along the chromosome in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Hall et al., 2002; Li et al., 2009; Noma et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2008), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (reviewed in (Kueng et al., 2013)), flies (reviewed in (Elgin and Reuter, 2013)), plants (Yang et al., 2017) and humans (Tchasovnikarova et al., 2015). However, we agree that experiments documenting kinetic separation of nucleation and spreading are rare. One example is vernalization of the <italic>FLC</italic> locus in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where nucleation and spreading are separated in time (Yang et al., 2017). Our single cell tracking data already contained information that addresses this question directly, which we expanded in the revision:</p><p>Three lines of evidence establish that heterochromatin spreads outward from nucleation sites in our assays. First, we examined the kinetics of proximal and distal silencing in cells where the system switches from full derepression to repression. Our 3kb ectopic strain afforded us an opportunity to do so, (~5% of the cells in FYLM single cell tracking data of our 3kb ectopic strain, new Figure 3—figure supplement 1), while the MAT locus strains remain near uniformly repressed in the “green” nucleation proximal color. Full silencing of the “green” nucleation-proximal color almost exclusively precedes the distal “orange” spreading color in time (N=15/270 cells with repression events where “green” and “orange” start out fully de-repressed, see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). We find only one example (cat 4, 1/270) with “orange” repression preceding “green”, with the green closely following orange. This small kinetic gap therefore may suggest a fast spreading event.</p><p>Second, in the FYLM data, we did not observe any cells (N=0/270) where “green” becomes de-repressed while “orange” stays repressed (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). In contrast we find many cells in which “orange” fluctuates while “green” is OFF for the entire measured lifespan (N=36/270, new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,C) and more cells where “orange” is fully de-repressed while “green” is at least repressed partially for the entire measured lifespan (N=61/270, new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,D). This reinforces the notion that silencing is directional with “green” preceding “orange”.</p><p>Third, using our steady state flow cytometry data for all RNA- nucleated strains, both ectopic and at MAT, gating for “green”<sup>OFF</sup> (nucleation site) yields a distribution of orange repression, OFF to ON, while gating in “orange”<sup>OFF</sup> (spreading site) only yields “green”<sup>OFF</sup>, supporting the above single-cell dynamics with a broader, population-based snapshot (see 2D-hexbins below as well as Figure 1C insets, Figure 2B,C,D). Therefore, we interpret this to indicate that spreading follows nucleation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the way the experiments are conducted, for example by starting with cells and colonies that are preselected to be nucleated (green off) prevents the authors from the opportunity to observe the very data that could falsify the hypothesis (i.e. observing cells in which green is on and orange is off.)</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our analysis method was not sufficiently clear, and we have now clarified the text. In fact, we do not preselect “green”<sup>OFF</sup> cells for analysis: All the 2D histogram and scatter plots in the paper show cells normalized only by “red”. No “green” or “orange” value filter is applied at this stage. Even for the Δ<italic>K</italic> strain, which can be isolated as ON or OFF alleles (Grewal and Klar, 1996), we describe the overall distribution of cells after introduction of <italic>clr4+</italic> in Figure 2E. Since we established from our data (cytometry and single cell tracking) that nucleation indeed precedes spreading, we produce 1D “orange” histograms with an additional “green”<sup>OFF</sup> gate to isolate fully nucleated cells (Figure 1C, insets Figure 2B, C, E). Importantly, in the cytometry data, we do not observe cell populations that are “orange”<sup>OFF</sup> and “green”<sup>ON</sup> (Figure 1C inset plots are not pre-filtered and almost contain no cells in bottom right quadrant, highlighted for ectopic strains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We believe our data is consistent with directional spreading from nucleation to distal sites and hope this clarification highlights that we include all cells with respect to “green” and “orange” expression for analysis.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32948.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Exceedingly few cells are “green”ON and “orange”OFF.</title><p>2D hexbin plots of cells (max and min bin cell numbers indicated) with ectopic nucleation site (“green” nucleation proximal, “orange” distal at indicated distances, see Figure 1C).

Let's for the moment imagine that spreading actually occurs. The distinction the authors make between stochastic and deterministic spreading is based upon the range of expression of the detector genes that are positioned to be under the influence of the nucleation site. If that range of expression is narrow, spreading is defined to be deterministic. If it is broad, spreading is defined to be stochastic. The competing model, never mentioned nor tested, is that heterochromatin formed in once case is more stable than heterochromatin formed in the other, but &quot;spreading&quot; is identical in both. Distinguishing between these two models would be easier than some of the experiments in the manuscript, but one needs to acknowledge the competing model before it can be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer points out an alternative possible scenario for differences in spreading, which we now address in the text. It could be envisaged that the spreading probability depends primarily on the how stability of heterochromatin the nucleation site. In such a scenario the frequency of spreading would correlate precisely with the stability of the nucleation site. This model predicts that a narrow range of repression should therefore correlate with very robust heterochromatin, and conversely that spreading that has a wider range of states when the heterochromatic state is less stable or robust. Two lines of evidence argue against this possibility:</p><p>We examined the stability of the relevant nucleation sites to test this hypothesis, <italic>cenH</italic> in the wild-type (“orange” mostly repressed) or <italic>REIII -</italic>disrupted context (Δ<italic>REIII</italic>, stochastic spreading) and <italic>REIII</italic> in the <italic>cenH</italic> deleted context (Δ<italic>K</italic>, deterministic spreading).

Since factors assembling the heterochromatin structure are directly or indirectly attracted by these marks, we believe that they are the central features to examine. We observe that at all nucleation sites, the degree of both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 methylation is extremely robust (around the value of the pericentromeric <italic>dh</italic>) and nearly invariant between the nucleation sites. Critically, there is no difference in H3K9me2 and me3 methylation at <italic>cenH</italic> between wildtype MAT and Δ<italic>REIII,</italic> strainswhich feature very different distributions of distal “orange” repression (Figure 2B, C).

The experiments in Figure 4 may bear upon memory, but they are done in a rather complicated way show the sensitivity of those cells that have been pregrown for 25 generations to a subsequent challenge of various concentrations of TSA with respect to the stability of their expression state at that one time. A demonstration of memory requires a time component over which the thing of interest is remembered, but this experiments design precludes that. To be sure, there is some interesting biology behind the curves in this Figure, but at present the experimental design would allow the authors to make interesting claims about the contribution of the various elements to the efficiency of re-establishing heterochromatin…. interesting in itself, but it isn't memory. It seems to me that the issue of memory would be resolved by the kind of clever experiments performed in S. cerevisiae by the Broach and Gartenberg labs in which the nucleation sites is removed and then the persistence of a state is measured over time in the absence of the element that &quot;nucleated&quot; it. Alternatively, the microfluidic technology behind Figure 3 could be used to address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Measuring events over time is a central way to assess memory in a system, and we have provided additional measurements in this vein in the revised version. However, it is only one of several approaches to probe memory. The TSA experiments borrow conceptually from hysteresis measurements, which are a rigorous means to probe the memory capacity in the system, illustrated by Ferrell and colleagues (Bagowski and Ferrell, 2001). In this analysis, memory is manifested by the system behaving differently depending on its starting state. A stimulant-responsive system exhibits hysteresis (memory) if the behavior along the stimulant gradient is divergent between a fully stimulated or naïve starting condition. The similarity in molecular architectures, cooperativity and positive feedback, which drive both the biochemical systems traditionally subjected to hysteresis analysis and epigenetic systems (see (Angel et al., 2015; Dodd et al., 2007)), motivated us to perform hysteresis-type experiments. Here, we are probing whether the ancestral state biases the decision of system to undergo a spreading event. We measure the retention of this bias along a gradient of inhibitor, which is conceptually similar to measurements for a stimulant. We chose this course because stimulants are not readily available for heterochromatin. We believe this analysis is both rigorous and valid for probing memory capacity.</p><p>However, inspired by the reviewer’s invocation of the Gartenberg experiments, we probed the effect of removing <italic>trans-</italic>acting nucleation factors on the retention of the state originally formed by spreading. These experiments are conceptually similar to removal of <italic>cis-</italic>acting sites but avoid the caveat of low induced Cre-lox recombination frequency in <italic>S. pombe.</italic> We crossed our reporter strains to mutants required for either the <italic>cenH</italic> or <italic>REIII</italic> nucleator. Immediately following detection of cross progeny colonies, we proceeded with flow cytometry analysis. We find indeed that <italic>REIII</italic> nucleated heterochromatin can maintain itself after removal of a required <italic>trans-</italic>acting nucleation factor for ~ 200 generations, while <italic>cenH</italic>-nucleated heterochromatin cannot, and appears to require continual nucleation to maintain the state. These new data support our overall conclusions and are presented in the new Figure 5 and new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Finally, we also believe that our single cell tracking data in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 lend independent support for the conclusion that <italic>REIII</italic> spreading is remembered, while <italic>cenH-</italic>spreading is not.

However, the degree of fidelity and heritable stability among heterochromatin domains throughout the genome can vary. Here, the authors dissect the origins of the intrinsic high-fidelity and memory capacity associated with stable epigenetic heterochromatin states. To do this, they utilize a system that simultaneously monitors nucleation and spreading driven by individual regulatory elements. They find that heterochromatin spreading driven by an RNAi nucleation site (cenH) is multimodal and occurs stochastically. This finding is consistent when measured at ectopic sites as well as at the endogenous MAT locus. By contrast, they argue that spreading driven solely from the endogenous REIII element at the MAT locus shows no intermediate levels and is complete (&quot;deterministic&quot;). They conclude that the REIII element is required to preserve the epigenetic memory of an ancestral state, as well as to ensure heterochromatin domain maintenance during environmental stress. A major strength of this article is the use of a system that quantitatively measures heterochromatic silencing in living cells. The development of such tools has allowed them to tackle key questions in the field of heterochromatin assembly. The conclusion that the spreading of heterochromatin from an RNAi nucleated element is stochastic is also supported by recent work by Obersriebnig et al,. 2016, which also used single cell assays. A key new finding here is that a cis-acting element, REIII, promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin that has high memory capacity. However, in the absence of a mechanism for the REIII -mediated spreading, this aspect of the work remains preliminary. Moreover, the evidence suggesting deterministic spreading from REIII needs further careful evaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Regarding the mechanism for the role of REIII in epigenetic memory, previous studies have provided important insights that are highly relevant to this story and deserve to be addressed clearly as part of the main discussion. REIII (a binding site for ATF-CREB proteins Atf1-Pcr1) was initially shown to be critical for the stability of heterochromatin at MAT, particularly when heterochromatin nucleation by RNAi is compromised (Jia et al., 2004). A recent study confirmed this function of REIII (Wang and Moazed, 2017). However, more relevant to this paper are subsequent studies that revealed the mechanism as follows: Yamada et al., 2005 found that REIII recruits an HDAC Clr3 (see Figure 2), the activity of which is critical for the stability and spread of heterochromatin. Further work showed that Clr3 is a component of the SHREC complex that localizes to REIII (see Figure 4 in Cam et al., 2008). These studies set the stage for a critical finding that explained the role of REIII /Clr3 in heterochromatin stability. Aygun et al., 2013 discovered Clr3 HDAC as a unique factor that promotes heterochromatin stability by suppressing turnover of histones. Indeed, loss of Clr3 is linked to loss of tri-H3K9me (see Figure 5A in Yamada et al., 2005), which provides the binding site for the chromodomain of Clr4 to reinforce a feedback loop in which tri-H3K9me recruits Clr4 HMTase to promote heterochromatin spreading/maintenance (Zhang et al. 2008; also, Al-Sady et al., and Jih et al., 2017). In short: REIII → Atf1-Pcr1 → Clr3/SHREC → Suppresses histone turnover/stabilizes tri-H3K9me → Clr4 chromo binding to tri-H3K9me → Heterochromatin spreading/maintenance via feedback loop In light of these previous findings, an important possibility is that mutations in REIII impair the recruitment of Clr3 HDAC (e.g. see Figure 3 in Yamada et al..,2005), which in turn results in increased in turnover of H3K9 methylated histones that are required for the spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin. The authors shall test whether ∆REIII cells show an elevated level of histone turnover, hence affecting spreading and epigenetic memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points. We had included a description of possible mechanisms in our supplemental discussion in the original submission, including a number of the references cited by the reviewer. However, we recognize that the mechanistic arguments should be highlighted more prominently in the paper and have included them now in the main discussion.</p><p>We have now addressed the role of histone turnover as a possible mechanism for the differences in spreading and epigenetic memory by performing additional experiments. We adopted the published (Audergon et al., 2015; Svensson et al., 2015) Recombination Induced Tag Exchange system (RITE) to probe H3 turnover. Given the labile nature of heterochromatin at elevated temperatures (Figure 4E,F and Figure 4—figure supplement 2), replication stalling was performed with hydroxyurea as published (Aygun et al., 2013). We address turnover in the ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup>, ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup> and ∆<italic>REIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> strains to address the role of <italic>REIII,</italic> with ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup> serving as an isogenic non-heterochromatic control for ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup>. We measured H3 turnover at two euchromatic control loci and find no difference between the strains. However, when we examined turnover at MAT using amplicons that are shared by all strains, we found significantly decreased histone turnover in ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup>, while ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-ON</sup> and ∆<italic>REIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup> consistently display elevated turnover, more consistent with euchromatic behavior. These new data are included in the new Figure 6 A,B. The data that histone turnover is elevated in the absence of nucleated <italic>REIII</italic> thus presents a mechanistic explanation for the strongly reduced memory we see in <sub>∆</sub><italic>REIII</italic> and stochastic spreading, while the exceedingly low turnover in the presence of <italic>REIII</italic> accounts for the deterministic spreading and robust memory. The robust memory is underlined by a new experiment we include, where we remove by cross factors required for nucleation following establishment (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An important assumption in this study is that cells carrying ORANGEON or ORANGEoff states contain comparable levels of heterochromatin at the nucleation site. However, it is possible that ORANGEON cells contain a relatively lower level of heterochromatin (but still sufficient to repress GREEN with a weak promoter) than ORANGEoff cells (e.g. in WT and ∆REIII cells). This should be tested experimentally by assaying H3K9me levels by ChIP at GREEN and ORANGE loci. Also, GREEN inserted in cenH is likely silenced post transcriptionally (transcripts of markers inserted near centromeric repeats are converted to siRNAs) and its silencing might not provide an accurate measure of silencing caused by heterochromatin modifications. If true, this would complicate the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now performed extensive Chromatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) analysis for the heterochromatin assembly mark H3K9me2 and repressive/spreading mark H3K9me3 across the MAT locus.</p><p>Specifically, we find:</p><p>1) H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks accumulate to similar extents at the <italic>cenH</italic> nucleation site (“green” in WT and ∆<italic>REIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup>), even though this strain, unlike WT, features a high proportion of “orange”<sup>ON</sup> (new Figure 2D). We also find very similar proportion of H3K9me2 and me3 at “green” in ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup>, see the new data in Figure 2E. H3K9me2 and me3 marks accumulate to very high extents at these sites in the three strains, which is not consistent with heterochromatin spreading behaviors being solely the result of different level of heterochromatin assembly at nucleation regions.</p><p>2) H3K9me2 and me3 marks decline rightwards of <italic>cenH</italic> only in the ∆<italic>REIII</italic><sup>HSS</sup>, but not wild type stain. This is evident even at the edge of <italic>cenH,</italic> and more strongly at the more distal “orange” (Figure 2D). However, H3K9me2 and me3 do not significantly decline at “orange” in ∆<italic>K</italic><sup>HSS-OFF</sup> versus “green” (Figure 2E). We note that for H3K9me3 only there is a small, but not significant, difference between “green” and “orange”.</p><p>Together, these data are consistent with differences in heterochromatin spreading, as opposed to weakened nucleation, driving the differences in distal “orange” repression, and further that our single cell silencing data for “orange” accurately reflects differences in the spreading of heterochromatin outwards from nucleation sites.</p><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, heterochromatin assembled via noncoding RNA (ncRNA)* processes triggers co-transcriptional silencing as the reviewer states. However, transcriptional silencing also plays important roles (Fischer et al., 2009) at these sites, and silencing broadly correlates well with H3K9me2 accumulation, a read-out of heterochromatin structure. Yet, it remains possible that placement within an RNAi generating element affects the behaviors we track. We believe the reviewer’s concern ought to be mitigated by a difference in the placement of “green” at ectopic loci versus the MAT locus. In ectopic strains, “green” (for <italic>ura4</italic>, “orange” for <italic>his1</italic>) is placed immediately adjacent but not within the <italic>dh</italic> element, reporting on silencing at the nucleation locus, while for MAT strains “green” is within <italic>cenH.</italic> As we find the behavior with respect to spreading to be similar (e.g. Figure 1C 3kb versus Figure 2C) we conclude that the nature of H3K9me- dependent silencing at the nucleation marker not to interfere with our interpretation.</p><p>*We now use this more general descriptor for <italic>cenH</italic> and <italic>dh</italic> rather than RNAi</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This reviewer is concerned that the evidence that REIII causes deterministic spreading is an artifact of the system. Unlike WT or ∆REII cells that contain GREEN at a bona fide nucleation site, from which heterochromatin is known to spread outward, GREEN in ∆K cells is likely not placed at a nucleation site (there is no evidence that REIII alone can nucleate heterochromatin, and no evidence is presented to show that heterochromatin spreads from REIII toward ORANGE). In cells with GREEN located closer to the edge of the heterochromatin domain, the silencing of ORANGE located in the middle of the silenced domain might precede GREEN. In this situation, when silencing of ORANGE is assayed in GREENoff cells it would give the false impression of deterministic spreading. Consistent with this, markers inserted near mat3 are known to be silenced less efficiently. Similarly, if nucleation in ∆K cells occurred on the left side of ORANGE, all cells showing GREENoff will carry the ORANGEoff state. Can they confirm that heterochromatin in ∆K cells is indeed nucleated at REIII, or if REIII simply stabilizes heterochromatin (for example by recruiting Clr3 HDAC Yamada et al., 2005 and Aygun et al., 2013)? Moreover, it is also possible that heterochromatin in ∆K cells is formed in such as a way that it does not involve stepwise mechanism of nucleation and spreading and that the entire domain is silenced simultaneously.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that in the absence of <italic>cenH,</italic> Atf1/Pcr1 binding sites at <italic>REIII</italic> are absolutely required for heterochromatin formation (Figure 3C in (Wang and Moazed, 2017)). Independently of these studies, three lines of evidence from our work suggest that <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> reports specifically on <italic>REIII -</italic>nucleated spreading, detected by “green”, towards “orange”:</p><p>1) Deletion of both Atf1/Pcr1 binding sites at <italic>REIII</italic> blocks any silencing in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (in 34/34 strains examined) and H3K9 methylation at “green” or “orange”. This new data is presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B. Because <italic>ΔREIII</italic> does not abolish heterochromatin at MAT, i.e. it is not required to stabilize heterochromatin formed elsewhere (Figure 2C), the above result points to <italic>REIII</italic> nucleating heterochromatin in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>.</p><p>2) No repressive elements other than <italic>REII, cenH</italic> and <italic>REIII</italic> have been identified at MAT. Technically, it possible that in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>, which lacks <italic>cenH</italic>, silencing is due to <italic>REII</italic>. We had addressed this in the original submission by probing <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> <italic>REII::LEU2</italic>, in which the <italic>REII</italic> element is deleted. This strain behaved similarly to <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), strongly suggesting that in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>, <italic>REIII</italic> is the only functional nucleator.</p><p>3) We should note that in our 2D histogram and scatter plots (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 5) cells are not gated for “green”<sup>OFF</sup>. Rather, all cells within the size gate are plotted normalized by “red”. In those 2D plots, no significant de-repression of “green” is evident in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> in the repressed population. We only use the “green”<sup>OFF</sup> gate for 1D histograms, to plot spreading in cells that fully nucleate. To address the point concerning spreading from leftwards of the “orange” nucleator, we moved “green” 2.1 kb towards the right <italic>IR-R</italic> boundary in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>. This did not lead to the appearance of significant de-repression of “green” in “orange”<sup>OFF</sup> cells, which might be expected if spreading emanated from a site leftwards of “orange” in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup>. This new data is presented Figure 2—figure supplement 2 C,D.</p><p>Together, we believe these lines of evidence and previously published data affirms that <italic>REIII</italic> is indeed the nucleating element in <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> and that it spreads heterochromatin outward.</p><p>As to the comment about a non-stepwise mechanism, this is entirely possible for <italic>ΔK</italic><sup>HSS</sup> and we had discussed this possibility in the previous supplemental, and now moved it to the main discussion. Heterochromatin spreading can occur by a number of theoretical mechanisms (Talbert and Henikoff, 2006), such as linear “oozing”, skipping or looping. Looping mechanisms have been invoked for the polycomb system (Bantignies and Cavalli, 2011). Looping is one possible mechanism to account for deterministic behavior of <italic>ΔK</italic>, while linear “oozing” is more consistent with our observations for ncRNA-nucleated spreading (Figure 1, Figure 2C). In experiments outside the scope of this work, we look forward to testing this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors argue in the Abstract that the epigenetic capacity contributing to heterochromatin spreading and maintenance is not encoded in the spreading reaction itself, but rather requires specialized memory elements. This statement is misleading. The factors involved in spreading and maintenance of heterochromatin, such as HDACs, are known to be loaded across silenced domains by HP1, which is also required for heterochromatin spreading. However, these same factors (HDACs) can be also loaded by so called specialized/memory elements, further enhancing the stability of heterochromatin. In this respect, the epigenetic capacity is at least partially encoded in the spreading reaction and can be further strengthened by elements that also load activities, such as HDACs, promoting heterochromatin stability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have modified the language in the Abstract to reflect that the ncRNA-nucleated spreading reaction specifically does not confer the epigenetic fidelity required for robust and precise epigenetic inheritance, which additionally requires memory elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3: The fidelity and robustness are two essential characteristics to epigenetic inheritance, which is important both for chromatin structure and cell differentiation in many species. Its full establishment comprises of two stages: nucleation and spreading, which can be executed through RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent and RNAi-independent pathways. In this study, Greenstein and colleagues set up an elegant and sensitive single-cell reporter system to dissect these two characteristics. They have used it for population studies and cell-lineage tracking for trans-generation memory. Consistent with previous findings, they showed spreading of heterochromatin nucleated by RNAi alone is robust but low on fidelity, as compared to that nucleated by wild-type locus. Importantly, they have attributed the fidelity in heterochromatin spreading to an RNAi-independent DNA element REIII. Further, they have tested the persistence of &quot;memory&quot; as nucleated by RNAi or REIII with and without perturbations. The biological importance and complicated nature should make it appealing to a broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the favorable assessment of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2B and 2C, where modified nucleators of RNAi-alone or REIII -alone are tested, the fidelity in spreading and robustness in nucleation segregated clearly in these population studies. However, one concern still remains. As spreading is greatly affected by the distance from the nucleator to the reporter, the actual distance for REIII -nucleated spreading should be measured between REIII and &quot;orange&quot; reporter, rather than between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; reporter as they are on different sides of the REIII nucleator, and to be consistent with Figure 2A and 2B. If the genome feature in Figure 2C is drawn to scale, it is around 1-2 kb in distance. At this distance, even RNAi-nucleated heterochromatin is demonstrating high fidelity in spreading as in the top panel of Figure 1C. At least one testing should be done with the reporter cassette moved further away from REIII nucleator by inserting &quot;inert&quot; DNA sequence (from a euchromatic region), to the similar 3-4 kb distance scale as Figure 2A and 2B. It is necessary to exclude the possibility that higher fidelity as in Figure 2C is due to a shorter loop for spreading. If the experiment is not possible, it shall be clearly explained in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>While <italic>REIII</italic> contains two potential nucleation sites (s1 and s2), only the distal (s2) sites has been implicated as the dominant nucleation element (Thon et al., 1999). The distance in <italic>ΔK<sup>HSS</sup> </italic>from the end of the spreading sensor ORF to s1 is ~1kb, and to s2 ~2.2kb. In comparison, the comparable distance in <italic>ΔREIII HSS</italic> is ~3.8kb. To mitigate the concern that the spreading distance in <italic>ΔK</italic> may be much shorter than in <italic>ΔREIII</italic> (i.e., from the ORF end to s1), we deleted s1 in the <italic>ΔK</italic> strain (<italic>ΔKΔs1</italic>) and inserted two different ~700bp sections of the <italic>sib1</italic> gene ORF between the spreading sensor and the s2 site in the <italic>ΔKΔs1</italic> background, increasing the spreading distance to ~3kb. Importantly, in both of these strains, we see the same deterministic behavior as in the <italic>ΔK</italic> parent. One of the <italic>ΔKΔs1</italic> +700bp insertions, representative of two behaviorally indistinguishable insertion strains we constructed, is shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 2E. Larger insertions where not compatible with heterochromatin nucleation in <italic>ΔK</italic>. Given these data, and the observation that significant stochastic spreading and intermediate states are detected for the 3kb, and even 1kb spreading distance with ectopically placed ncRNA nucleators (Figure 1), we conclude that the deterministic behavior is <italic>ΔK</italic> in intrinsic to nucleation from the <italic>REIII</italic> element.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: In the previous submission of this manuscript, the work presented was found to be potentially of great interest, particularly the discovery of a novel form of putative heterochromatin spreading, nucleated by the cis-acting element REIII that the authors claim has a deterministic role. However, direct evidence for REIII -mediated heterochromatin spreading was found to be lacking, and there was no mechanism. In their revised manuscript, the authors have provided several lines of new evidence to address some of the reviewers' comments. In particular, by deleting the REIII element, they show that this leads to increased turnover of histones which provides some insight into how REIII may be promoting epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. However, the conclusion that REIII promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin is still not really supported, as pointed out by reviewer 2. Furthermore, the argument that ∆K cells have better &quot;memory&quot; than WT cells is not supported by previous findings that ∆K cells contain metastable heterochromatin, with frequent conversion from the OFF to the ON state compared to WT. As both reviewers point out, it remains possible that bias may be introduced in the &quot;memory&quot; determinations, due to preselection for ∆KOFF colonies. Despite these limitations, and given the new work included in this manuscript on this REIII -based heterochromatin process, we would be willing to consider a revised text, that focused on the single cell assay showing that loss of REIII affects the stability of heterochromatin. In this revised manuscript, specific references to « memory elements » and « deterministic » spreading should be removed, as suggested by reviewer 2. Reviewer #2: The authors performed several experiments that addressed the reviewers' comments and strengthened their conclusions. For example, the extensive chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses performed to assay H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 levels in different strains now correlates changes in gene silencing with heterochromatin levels. Also, this reviewer suggested that they investigate the effects of REIII deletion on histone turnover, which has implications for heterochromatin spreading and epigenetic memory. They do indeed find that deletion of REIII causes increased turnover of histones. Together with previously published findings showing that REIII recruits HDAC Clr3 (Yamada et al., 2005), which is involved in the suppression of histone turnover (Aygun et al., 2013), this finding provides a possible mechanistic insight into how REIII promotes epigenetic stability of heterochromatin. With the new additions, this part of the story has improved significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, their conclusion that REIII promotes deterministic spreading of heterochromatin remains ambiguous. In particular, unlike cenH that has been shown to nucleate heterochromatin, there is no clear evidence presented that heterochromatin spreads outward from the REIII element in ∆K cells. Rather, given the bistable nature of heterochromatin at mat in ∆K cells, the assembly of heterochromatin in ∆K cells cells might involve cooperativity between yet unknown elements, as opposed to reliance on the REIII element alone. In presenting their case for deterministic spreading from REIII, the authors mention previous work showing that loss of REIII affects heterochromatin in ∆K cells. However, it is important to note that previous studies (such as Jia, Noma and Grewal, 2004 and Wang and Moazed,.2017) and this article only show that REIII is required for the stability of heterochromatin (most likely via recruitment of HDAC Clr3 that suppresses histone turnover to prevent loss of H3K9me) but is not sufficient to nucleate heterochromatin.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. In ∆K cells, formation of H3K9me- marked heterochromatin is dependent on the action of <italic>REIII</italic> Atf1 and Pcr1 binding sites. Since there is no pre-existing H3K9me before introduction of <italic>clr4+</italic> in our experiments, heterochromatin nucleation must occur in some fashion in ∆K cells. However, sufficiency of Atf1 and Pcr1 binding sites for nucleation remains to be demonstrated. Specifically, <italic>REIII,</italic> unlike <italic>cenH (</italic>e.g. Hall el al., 2002) cannot effect significant repression when placed ectopically in the genome (references cited and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This result can be interpreted in at least two ways: <italic>REIII</italic> is not by itself sufficient to nucleate and requires other, yet to be defined elements, or, the local genomic context/or chromatin organization of <italic>REIII</italic> within MAT is required for its nucleation activity, hence it cannot function ectopically. Since it cannot be easily resolved which case is correct, we now soften the conclusion that <italic>REIII</italic> drives spreading in ∆K cells in the text and remove the term “deterministic spreading” in favor of <italic>REIII -</italic>dependent heterochromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, their argument that ∆K cells have better &quot;memory&quot; than WT cells contrasts with a previous finding that ∆K cells contain metastable heterochromatin, as indicated by the frequent conversion from the OFF to the ON state at a rate many fold higher than in WT. Moreover, it remains possible that bias may be introduced in the &quot;memory&quot; determinations, due to preselection for ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> colonies (see subsection “Multi-generational single cell imaging reveals ncRNA-driven spreading to be unstable”), in which entire mat locus is known to be coated with heterochromatin (Nakayama, Klar and Grewal, 2000).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. Here, we (1) Clarify our observations in the context of the literature, (2) Revise our interpretation of Figure 4D, and (3) Clarify our ∆K selection process.</p><p>Broadly, our results from ∆K cells are consistent with the published literature, namely a very low transition rate form OFF to ON per generation, about 10<sup>-4</sup>, (for example Thon and Friis, 1997; Grewal and Klar, 1998). The continuous growth in non-selective media of OFF cells over &gt; 25 generations resulted in the appearance 1-2% ON colonies, consistent with these low transitions (Grewal and Klar, 1996). A key difference between our and some previous experiments is observing the entire population without selection (our assays) versus selection assays that permit survival of either the ON or OFF state. Thus, the appearance of very small ON populations may be less obvious in our experiments.</p><p>The memory experiments in Figure 4 reveal the key contribution of <italic>REIII</italic> to resistance and memory of MAT heterochromatin. The comparison of wild-type to ∆<italic>REIII</italic> cells here is central and valid in our view. However, we recognize that in Figure 4D, the results on its face point to stronger memory in ∆K cells than wild type. The “extreme” aspect of this memory is most likely due to the fact that ∆K cells, once ancestrally TSA treated, cannot efficiently re-nucleate. Given this caveat, we now refrain from interpreting Figure 4D as indicative of the degree of memory in ∆K. Overall, we did not intend to advance the notion that ∆K cells have more/stronger memory than wild-type and wherever this is ambiguous, have clarified the language. We note that unlike for ∆K cells, it is not possible to select for WT cells with active <italic>REIII,</italic> thus the population may contain some cells with <italic>REIII</italic> in an inactive state, which likely are more labile than the bulk of cells with active <italic>REIII</italic>. Hence, ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> populations can appear somewhat more stable as a result.</p><p>As to ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> selection, our approach is consistent with the literature (Grewal and Klar, 1996 and 1998; Jia et al., 2004; Thon and Friis, 1997 and others). We produce ∆K<sup>HSS</sup> strains in a ∆<italic>clr4</italic> background and introduce <italic>clr4+</italic> by cross. The population resulting from the germinated spore is often mixed, with both ON and OFF cells as shown in Figure 2E. Simply plating this population on nonselective media predominantly yields colonies that are ON or OFF. This reflects the metastable nature of ∆K cells, with some cells nucleating heterochromatin and some not, but then maintaining the state. In that sense, we do not isolate ∆K<sub>OFF</sub> cells using a directed selection process, promoting a given state, and do not feel that there should be any bias introduced by this method. Isolation of ON/OFF is required in some cases, for example, due to the insufficient number of OFF cells in the mixed population. However, we now qualify our results pertaining to memory clearly and state that bias may have been introduced by picking OFF colonies.</p><p>In general, as suggested, we re-focused our conclusions on ∆<italic>REIII</italic>. Together with our reinterpretation of the ∆K result in Figure 4, we believe we addressed remaining concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My recommendation is to prepare a revised manuscript for publication in eLife that focuses on the results from their elegant single cell assays showing that the loss of REIII affects the stability of heterochromatin and that this behavior of REIII is mechanistically linked to the suppression of histone turnover at mat. The discussion would be focused on succinctly describing this feature of REIII in the context of previous findings, including the results showing that REIII recruits the HDAC Clr3 (Yamada et al., 2005) that also suppresses histone turnover to promote epigenetic stability of heterochromatin (Aygun et al., 2013). Indeed, suppression of histone turnover by REIII /HDAC Clr3 may promote retention of methylated histones that are critical for the recruitment of Clr4; thus, promoting the efficient spreading of heterochromatin. Framing the results in this way would avoid the problematic issues raised by applying the terms &quot;memory element&quot; or &quot;deterministic&quot; spreading to REIII.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. Indeed, we have re-written the manuscript, most prominently the Abstract and Discussion section, to focus on the overall result that ncRNA spreading is unstable and stabilized by <italic>REIII</italic> via suppression of histone turnover.
