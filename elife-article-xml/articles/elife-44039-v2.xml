To template these cilia, each MCC produces between 100-600 centrioles by a process termed centriole amplification. Yet, how MCC regulate the precise number of centrioles and cilia remains unknown. Airway progenitor cells contain two parental centrioles (PC) and form structures called deuterosomes that nucleate centrioles during amplification. Using an ex vivo airway culture model, we show that ablation of PC does not perturb deuterosome formation and centriole amplification. In contrast, loss of PC caused an increase in deuterosome and centriole abundance, highlighting the presence of a compensatory mechanism. Quantification of centriole abundance in vitro and in vivo identified a linear relationship between surface area and centriole number. By manipulating cell size, we discovered that centriole number scales with surface area. Our results demonstrate that a cell-intrinsic surface area-dependent mechanism controls centriole and cilia abundance in multiciliated cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>basal body</kwd><kwd>multiciliated</kwd><kwd>deuterosome</kwd><kwd>airway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL128370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Steven L</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahjoub</surname><given-names>Moe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK108005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahjoub</surname><given-names>Moe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell-intrinsic surface area-dependent mechanism establishes centriole-cilia abundance in airway multiciliated cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, multiciliated cells (MCC) are terminally differentiated epithelia that line the respiratory tract, brain ventricles and segments of the female and male reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spassky and Meunier, 2017</xref>). Each MCC contains hundreds of motile cilia, microtubule-based organelles that generate the motive force to move fluid over the surface of the cell. In the airway, motile cilia of MCC beat directionally to propel mucus and inhaled contaminants out of the lungs. Ciliary motility of ependymal MCC lining the brain ventricles is key for movement of cerebrospinal fluid through the central nervous system, while cilia on MCC in the reproductive tracts are important for ovum and sperm transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spassky and Meunier, 2017</xref>). Thus, the proper assembly of hundreds of motile cilia is critical for the functions of MCC, and the overall health of the associated tissues. Mutations that result in reduced cilia abundance cause human diseases due to aberrant cilia-based fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amirav et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">NÃºnez-OllÃ© et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallmeier et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that establishment of the correct number of cilia per cell is important for function. MCC in different tissues display significant variability in motile cilia number, ranging from 30 to 600 cilia per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spassky and Meunier, 2017</xref>). However, a major unresolved question is how each cell regulates the precise number of its motile cilia during differentiation.</p><p>To template these cilia, each MCC undergoes a process termed centriole amplification to produce hundreds of centrioles, barrel-shaped microtubule structures that form the base upon which cilia are assembled. In the airway, proliferating progenitors (called basal cells) initially contain a single centrosome with two parental centrioles (PC), which they maintain via the canonical centriole duplication mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorokin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</xref>). During MCC differentiation, the post-mitotic basal cells undergo massive centriole production that was thought to occur through two parallel pathways: a parental centriole-dependent pathway whereby the original PC template the assembly of multiple procentrioles simultaneously, and an acentriolar or âde novoâ pathway mediated by dozens of deuterosomes, spheroidal electron-dense structures that are capable of producing multiple procentrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalnins and Porter, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorokin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinman, 1968</xref>). Deuterosomes are transient structures that are absent in proliferating progenitor cells, are formed during early centriole amplification, and mostly disappear after centriologenesis is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klos Dehring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Although both PC-dependent and deuterosome-dependent pathways have been known for decades, the molecular mechanisms that govern the two pathways and their relative contributions to the total complement of centrioles has remained enigmatic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44039.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parental centrioles are dispensable for centriole amplification.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the proliferation and differentiation steps of multiciliated respiratory epithelia.

This indicates that centriole duplication in cycling cells and centriole amplification in MCC share common and conserved molecular mechanisms despite their morphological differences. However, recent studies have characterized proteins that are uniquely associated with deuterosomes. For example, Deup1 was recently identified as a deuterosome-specific protein that is essential for the formation of deuterosomes and, subsequently, centriole amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, a number of deuterosome-enriched factors have since been shown to play key roles in deuterosome biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klos Dehring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Revinski et al., 2018</xref>). These data support the theory that the PC-dependent and deuterosome-dependent centriole amplification pathways act in parallel, but use unique molecular components to produce all of the centrioles in a cell. It has been estimated that the deuterosome-dependent pathway contributes the majority (80â90%) of the total centrioles assembled during amplification, while the PC-dependent pathway contributes roughly 10â20% towards the final number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorokin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spassky and Meunier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study found that deuterosomes themselves are nucleated from the original PC, indicating that these two pathways may not be independent of each other after all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>). If true, this would suggest that all centrioles produced in MCC are ultimately dependent on the PC. Yet, a number of important questions have remained unanswered: are parental centrioles necessary for deuterosome biogenesis? What is the actual contribution of the PC to final centriole number? How do cells that start with exactly two parental centrioles generate such a variable number during differentiation?</p><p>In this study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which airway MCC establish centriole number, using an ex vivo airway culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vladar and Brody, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">You and Brody, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">You et al., 2002</xref>). We began by testing the hypothesis that parental centrioles are essential for deuterosome formation. To ablate PC during proliferation, we used a small molecule inhibitor and shRNA-mediated depletion of Plk4, the major kinase involved in centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, loss of parental centrioles did not affect deuterosome formation, indicating that PC are dispensable for deuterosome biogenesis. Moreover, the loss of PC and Plk4 function did not disrupt centriole amplification nor decrease the total number of centrioles per cell. Thus, establishment of centriole abundance is regulated by a different cellular property. Airway MCC vary in size and surface area, and display a wide range in centriole number. Quantification of centriole abundance in vitro and in vivo highlighted a direct relationship between cell-surface area and centriole number. To determine if cell size was a major determinant of centriole abundance, we cultured basal cells on an extracellular matrix of increasing density to manipulate size. We found that centriole number scales with increasing surface area, but not volume, of multiciliated cells. Together, our results point to a cell-intrinsic, surface area-dependent mechanism that establishes centriole-cilia abundance in airway multiciliated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Parental centrioles are dispensable for centriole amplification</title><p>We previously established a mouse tracheal epithelial cell (MTEC) culture system to study centriologenesis and ciliary assembly in MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahjoub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">You and Brody, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">You et al., 2002</xref>). This airway model entails seeding freshly isolated mouse tracheal basal cells onto a porous filter suspended in medium, and allowing the progenitors to proliferate into a confluent, polarized layer. Cells are induced to differentiate into MCC and other cell types found in the airway (for example, secretory cells) by exposure to an airâliquid interface (ALI). During proliferation, basal cells contain two centrosomal centrioles that are maintained via the canonical centriole duplication mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). During post-mitotic MCC differentiation, the centriologenesis program proceeds in distinct stages from ALI days 0 to 12: centriolar protein aggregates and deuterosomes form near the PC, and procentrioles are nucleated from both PC and deuterosomes (stage I, ALI1-2); procentrioles continue to grow and elongate from PC and deuterosomes (stage II, ALI3-4); centrioles disengage from PC and deuterosomes, start to mature into basal bodies and migrate towards the apical membrane (stage III, ALI4-8); fully mature, apically docked basal bodies template ciliary assembly (stage IV, ALI8-12). By ALI12, most cells have completed differentiation into fully mature MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>It was recently proposed that deuterosomes are nucleated from the original PC, suggesting that the de novo centriole assembly pathway is dependent on PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>). To test this theory, we ablated PC in basal cells using Centrinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), a selective inhibitor of the kinase Plk4 known as the âmaster regulatorâ of centriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arquint and Nigg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pearson and Winey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sillibourne and Bornens, 2010</xref>). Centrinone blocks centriole duplication, resulting in cells that lack centrioles following a few rounds of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Basal cells were cultured with or without 1 ÂµM Centrinone, roughly 3â8 times higher concentrations than needed to suppress centriole formation in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), and the compound was maintained in the medium throughout differentiation (described in MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Samples were fixed at various stages of differentiation, immunostained for centrioles and analyzed using either confocal or superresolution structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM). Control cells at ALI0 predominantly contain the original two PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>). Upon exposure to ALI, cells proceeded through the various stages of centriole amplification, resulting in a population of cells comprised of roughly 60% MCC and 40% non-MCC as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Growth of basal cells in the presence of 1 ÂµM Centrinone resulted inÂ &gt;80% of cells lacking PC at ALI0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>). Remarkably, the formation of centriolar aggregates and subsequent centriole amplification proceeded normally in the absence of PC. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the timing of centriologenesis, or the fraction of MCC in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>). To ensure that Centrinone-treated cells were indeed lacking PC prior to differentiation, we analyzed cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cells at ALI0 were serially sectioned beginning at the apical surface and down to the basal membrane. Whereas PC were evident in control cells, there wasÂ &gt;80% decrease in cells containing PC upon Centrinone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>), consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis.</p><p>The abundance of Plk4 protein is regulated by autophosphorylation-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holland et al., 2010</xref>). Centrinone-mediated inhibition of Plk4 kinase activity blocks this degradation, resulting in elevated (yet inactive) Plk4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). In control cells, Plk4 expression increased during early stages of centriole amplification, peaking at ALI3 and subsequently decreasing upon centriole maturation at ALI8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>). Centrinone-treated cells showed accumulation of Plk4, which was already evident in a higher proportion of cells at ALI0-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Unlike control cells, the high Plk4-expressing fraction persisted at ALI8 and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>), indicating that Plk4 kinase activity was indeed blocked. Moreover, the non-multiciliated cells in the population did not reform/regain their PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), further indicative of Centrinoneâs inhibitory activity in our assay. Finally, we examined whether loss of PC attenuated the various stages of centriole assembly. Control and Centrinone-treated cells were immunostained for markers of procentriole initiation (STIL, Cep152, Sas6, Cep135 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dammermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tang et al., 2011</xref>]), centriole growth and elongation (Cep120, centrin, Î³-tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betleja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahjoub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stearns et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xie et al., 2007</xref>]), centriole maturation (Cep164 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graser et al., 2007</xref>]), and ciliogenesis (acetylated-tubulin).

Plk4 expression becomes elevated during centriole amplification in airway MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoh et al., 2012</xref>), where it localizes to both PC and deuterosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), thus it has been generally assumed to play an important role in centriole amplification. However, our Centrinone treatments suggest that although Plk4 kinase activity is necessary for centriole duplication during the proliferation phase of basal cells, it is not essential for post-mitotic centriole amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). One possibility is that Plk4 acts in a kinase-independent manner to control centriole amplification, for example as a scaffold to recruit other components of the centriole assembly pathway. To test this, we depleted the protein in basal cells using shRNA-expressing lentivirus. Depletion of Plk4 during the proliferation phase resulted in near complete loss of PC by ALI0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5aâb</xref>), similar to the Centrinone experiments. Examination of cells at ALI3 showed that cells lacking Plk4 still initiate centriologenesis similar to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c and d</xref>), and form more deuterosomes on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and e</xref>), consistent with the Centrinone-mediated experiments. Moreover, quantification of the fraction of MCC at ALI12 showed no overall difference between control and Plk4-depleted cells. However, the process of centriole amplification appeared delayed, as roughly 50% of Plk4-depleted cells at ALI12 were in Stages I-II or III-IV instead of being fully mature MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and f</xref>). We interpret these results to suggest that loss of Plk4 delays the process, but does not impact overall centriole assembly. Indeed, culturing these Plk4-depleted cells for an additional 9 days caused an increase in the fraction of mature MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and g</xref>). Importantly, once cells completed maturation we did not observe a significant decrease in centriole number per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Finally, we used a combination of shRNA-mediated depletion and Centrinone-based inhibition of Plk4 to ensure that any residual Plk4 activity/function was blocked.

Constitutive expression of mChPlk4 during the proliferation stage resulted in cells that contained more than the normal complement of two PC at ALI0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). However, mature MCC containing excess PC and Plk4 protein formed a similar number of centrioles when compared to control cells at ALI12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5iâj</xref>).

In MTEC cultures, cell size and surface area are established roughly 1â2 days before the ciliogenesis transcriptional program is initiated. This temporal separation provided us with a means to determine whether the centriole amplification machinery responds to the differences in cell size set at the end of the proliferation phase. To test this, we manipulated cell shape and size prior to inducing differentiation by growing basal cells on varying concentrations of extracellular collagen. Modulating extracellular matrix density is a commonly used approach to manipulate cell volume and/or surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Califano and Reinhart-King, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trappmann and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wells, 2008</xref>). Culture and differentiation of basal cells on increasing concentrations of extracellular collagen resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7aâb</xref>). Remarkably, centriole abundance also increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). To determine whether the increase in average centriole number per cell was a function of increased cell volume, we measured cell depth (apical-basal distance). Although the cells contained a larger surface area, they were shallower in depth, resulting in a similar overall cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and dâe</xref>). Thus, the size of surface area, but not overall cell volume, appears to dictate centriole abundance during amplification. Finally, we sought to determine whether the higher centriole number in cells with larger surface areas was regulated at the level of the deuterosome. Indeed, cells grown on higher concentrations of collagen formed a higher proportion of deuterosomes per cell on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7fâg</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that a cell-intrinsic surface area-dependent process establishes centriole abundance, potentially by modulating deuterosome number.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44039.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Enlargement of the surface area of progenitor cells results in increased centriole abundance.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example 3D-SIM images of MTEC grown on varying concentrations of extracellular collagen matrix.

We first tested the relative contributions of the PC and Plk4 to deuterosome formation, centriole amplification, and establishment of centriole number. Loss of PC had no impact on deuterosome formation and function indicating that, although deuterosomes can be nucleated from the original PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>), their presence is not essential for the de novo centriologenesis pathway. In contrast, the average number of procentriole-forming deuterosomes was slightly but significantly higher upon loss of the PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). One intriguing possibility for the increase may be that the deuterosome pathway compensates for the loss of PC-derived centrioles by increasing deuterosome-mediated centriole assembly. This is consistent with our observation that cells lacking the PC formed a slightly higher number of centrioles on average when fully mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of deuterosome formation was shown to result in increased procentriole nucleation by the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that these two centriole assembly pathways likely communicate to regulate centriole biogenesis. However, loss of the PC did impact the kinetics of deuterosome formation; they were evident in PC-less cells slightly earlier than control cells, and persisted at stages (e.g. ALI8) when they would normally have disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We interpret these data to suggest that, although the PC are not critical for deuterosome biogenesis, they may help to control the number of deuterosomes formed, as well as the timing of their assembly and disassembly. During the revision of the manuscript, two studies (one preprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mercey et al., 2018</xref>] and one published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>]) report similar parental centrioleâindependent deuterosome formation in Centrinoneâtreated ependymal multiciliated cells. Altogether, these data indicate that deuterosome formation and initiation of centriole amplification can proceed normally is the absence of PC.</p><p>Loss of parental centrioles (and thus, centrosomes) in dividing retinal pigment epithelial cells has been shown to trigger a p53-mediated stress response that inhibits their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, loss of the PC in airway basal cells did not block or slow their growth, suggesting that the downstream consequences may differ in various cells or tissues. Phenotypes of patients with mutations in centrosomal genes support this notion. For example, mutations in components of the centriole assembly pathway are a major cause of microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>). These mutations disrupt the proliferation and differentiation program of neuronal precursors, leading to p53-mediated loss of the progenitor pool, resulting in the small brain phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nano and Basto, 2017</xref>). In contrast, mutations in centrosome duplication factors can also cause cystic and fibrotic kidney diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srivastava et al., 2017</xref>), which are characterized in part by enhanced and sustained cell proliferation. Therefore, the response of cells to centrosome loss, and the p53-dependent mitotic surveillance mechanism that senses this defect, may be cell- and tissue specific.</p><p>Although Plk4 kinase function was needed for canonical centriole duplication in proliferating basal cells, it was dispensable for post-mitotic centriole amplification. This was somewhat surprising for two reasons: (a) expression levels of Plk4 increase significantly during centriole amplification in MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), suggestive of a role during those stages, and (b) the kinase is essential for initiating procentriole formation in the majority of mammalian cells examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sillibourne and Bornens, 2010</xref>). However, Plk4 is absent in a number of organisms that contain centrioles. For example, the unicellular ciliates <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are able to assembly and duplicate their centrioles (basal bodies) without Plk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutcher and O'Toole, 2016</xref>). Similarly, Plk4-interacting proteins such as STIL and Cep152 are missing in a number of organisms with centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>), highlighting the presence of other mechanisms that allow for control of centriole formation. Thus, even though components of the centriole assembly machinery are generally conserved throughout evolution, our results suggest that certain mammalian cell types may have adapted mechanisms to initiate centriologenesis independent of Plk4 kinase function.</p><p>Depletion of Plk4 in MTEC did cause a delay in centriologenesis, indicating that the protein itself might be needed for proper progression through the various stages of centriole assembly. This is reminiscent of what was recently described for other kinases involved in coordinating centriole assembly and cell cycle progression in MCC. For example, it was shown that differentiating, non-dividing MCC repurpose the mitotic regulatory circuitry involving CDK1/Plk1/APC-C to control the timely progression of centriole amplification, maturation, and motile ciliogenesis while avoiding reentry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>). Another study found that CDK2, the kinase responsible for G1-S phase transition, was also required in MCC to initiate the motile ciliogenesis program independent of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vladar et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, one possible reason for the elevated Plk4 protein is to coordinate the timing of centriole assembly and maturation in post-mitotic cells. Consistent with this theory, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified a role for Plk4 in regulating the rate and period of procentriole growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrating that Plk4 functions as a homeostatic clock to ensure centrioles grow to the correct size. Indeed, we found that MCC lacking Plk4 initiated centriole assembly to the same extent as control cells, were delayed in passage through the growth and maturation phases, but eventually âcaught upâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, multiciliated cells lacking Plk4 contained the same number of centrioles on average when fully mature at ALI21, further indicating that it is not critical for regulating number per se. Moreover, overexpression of Plk4 in MTEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or in <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klos Dehring et al., 2013</xref>) did not result in increased centriole number. Thus, Plk4 may play a similar role as CDK1/CDK2/Plk1/APC-C, by participating in a temporal regulatory mechanism that mediates passage through the various centriole assembly steps.</p><p>Centriole abundance in MCC scales with surface area, a phenomenon we observed in airway tissues in vivo and in MTEC cultures in vitro. However, it is unclear which of those properties influences the other: does having a larger surface area result in the formation of more centrioles, or does a cell that forms a larger number of centrioles expand its surface area to accommodate them? One advantage of using the MTEC culture system is that the ciliogenesis program initiates roughly 2 days after basal cells have already established their size and surface area at ALI0. Therefore, we could temporally separate these two events. By growing cells on increasing extracellular collagen matrix density during the proliferation phase, we caused the enlargement of cell surface area before the transcriptional ciliogenesis program initiated. We discovered that cells formed more centrioles once fully differentiated, suggesting that the centriole amplification machinery responds to the change in surface area. We attempted the reciprocal experiment, which was to induce the formation of excess centrioles and test whether the size of the surface area changed accordingly. Although constitutive overexpression of Plk4 did result in the formation of excess PC, it did not alter final centriole number or surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>How are the variations in cell surface area communicated to the centriole amplification pathway to establish centriole number? There are at least three possible ways we envision this could occur. First, larger cells might increase transcription of genes essential for centriole and cilia assembly. This would be analogous to the âlimiting componentâ model of organelle abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Marshall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goehring and Hyman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marshall, 2016</xref>), where a fixed quantity of a precursor protein(s) would be expressed then âused upâ as centriole assembly occurs. In this scenario, the number of centrioles assembled would stop once the limiting component is no longer available. We did note an increase in deuterosome number in cells with enlarged surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that transcriptional output of at least some precursors is likely elevated. However, it remains unclear whether there is a single limiting component, or if all centriolar proteins become expressed at higher levels in larger cells. Alternatively, cells with larger surface areas might spend a longer period of time in stages of centriole assembly compared to smaller cells. In this scenario, the rate of centriole assembly would be the same in cells of different size, but ones with larger surface areas would spend longer periods in stages I-III to generate more total centrioles. Since the amount of time spent in these assembly stages is coordinated by proteins such as CDK1/Plk1/CDK2/APC-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vladar et al., 2018</xref>), one possibility is that these pathways help relay information about cell surface area/size to the centriole assembly machinery, and fine-tune the length of time spent in assembly to achieve the desired final number.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that the apical cytoskeleton helps instruct the centriole amplification pathway to regulate centriole abundance per cell. It is well established that an apical actin network in MCC plays a critical role in modulating the surface area, regulating centriole migration and docking at the plasma membrane, ensuring the even distribution of centrioles across the cell surface, and orienting (planar polarization) of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herawati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulkarni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mahuzier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sedzinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sedzinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Werner et al., 2011</xref>). What remains unclear is whether this actin network communicates with the centriole amplification machinery to regulate centriole number. One possibility is that the variations in surface area may result in corresponding changes to the size of the apical actin lattice, which could then instruct the centriologenesis program to generate more centrioles. Our future studies will focus on defining the pathway(s) coordinating the relationship between cell surface area and centriole amplification. These will have important clinical implications for ciliopathies caused by reduced cilia abundance in MCC, such Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and hydrocephalus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All animal studies were performed following protocols that are compliant with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University and the National Institutes of Health.

To determine the extent of parental centriole loss, cells at ALI 0 were scored for centriole number (0, 1, 2, 3, four centrioles) per cell. To determine the fraction of cells in the population undergoing centriole amplification during differentiation, cells at ALI 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 were scored for the presence of centriolar aggregates (Agg.), which then become defined as multiciliated cells (MCC). This approach was applied to each centriolar marker, and the percentage of the population undergoing centriole amplification determined. The surface area was defined by staining cells with ZO-1 to mark the apical cell-cell junctions, and measured using the thresholding algorithm (Elements AR 4). Cells were binned into three categories that ranged from what we define as small (&lt;50 Âµm<sup>2</sup>), medium (50â100 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) and large (&gt;100 Âµm<sup>2</sup>). Cell volume was determined by measuring the apical-basal distance (depth), which was then multiplied by the surface area. To quantify deuterosome number, MCC at ALI 3â4 were stained for markers of the deuterosome and procentrioles. The number of procentriole-forming deuterosome rings/rosettes were scored and compared in cells of similar size. The number of procentrioles per deuterosome was calculated from 3D-SIM images.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Meng-Fu Bryan Tsou (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work investigates mechanisms controlling basal body abundance in multiciliated cells (MCCs). Previous work had indicated that the daughter centriole and deuterosomes participate in the generation of MCC basal bodies. PLK4, a previously identified master regulator of centriole assembly, was functionally assessed using centrinone, a pharmacological PLK4 inhibitor, or Plk4 knockdown. Notably, PLK4 inhibition did inhibit duplication of the parental centrioles, but did not affect total basal body number in MCCs, suggesting that centrioles are not required for deuterosome formation or basal body/centriole/centrosome generation in MCCs. In the search for regulators of centriole number, perhaps independent of PLK4, the authors identified that centriole number scales with the size of the apical domain of cells. Scaling was already evident at the stage of deuterosome assembly, as cells with a larger surface formed more deuterosomes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>More evidence to support the Plk4 loss of function data is required to strengthen the paper. In particular, showing that known Plk4 substrates are normally recruited at centrioles following inactivation of Plk4 in MCCs will help support the author's view that the delay in centriole assembly following shRNA inactivation is due to other Plk4 functions (i.e. coupling to the cell cycle machinery).</p><p>In particular, it will be important to use a combination of the centrinone (1ÂµM) and shRNA to fully inactivate PLK4. The authors have shown that shRNAi can reduce PLK4 to nearly a non-detectable level, so whatever the remaining level of PLK4 should be sufficiently inhibited by 1ÂµM of the drug. The centriole biogenesis dynamics under this condition should be monitored and compared to the single treatment. Higher concentration of centrinone can also be tried, but 10 ÂµM centrinone may potentially cause off target effects, leading to non-specific blocks of normal MCC development.</p><p>Also, loss of PLK4 should lead to loss of the key PLK4 substrate, STIL, at centrioles. The authors should check whether STIL is present in PLK4 loss of function centrioles. It will be striking to see STIL negative centrioles in MCCs, a strong support for the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Centrosome loss has been shown to induce p53-dependnet stress response in cycling cells, but it does not seem to occur in the MTEC system used here. If space is allowed, the author should perhaps discuss or highlight this interesting difference seen in basal cells of MCC.</p><p>2) The authors showed that centriole number is not affected in MCC lacking pre-existing centrioles. We wonder, in their EM studies, if the authors also check the structural integrity, or the shape, of these de-novo centrioles formed in the absence of parental centrioles and PLK4.</p><p>3) Plk4 over-expression in other cell types increases the number of procentriole assembly sites around parental centrioles, leading to the formation of &quot;rosettes&quot; (Habedanck et al., 2005). In MCCs, are rosettes already present, raising the possibility that all the possible assembly sites are already being used? Do the authors think that something similar could be happening for deuterosome-based centriole assembly (i.e. the formation of a given number of assembly sites independently of Plk4 and the use of all of them in normal conditions)? If so, Plk4 over-expression may not be sufficient to increase centriole number even if it does play a role in centriole assembly.</p><p>4) An interesting notion is that PLK4, STIL and the PLK4 scaffold CEP152/CEP192 are actually <italic>not</italic> conserved in all organisms that form centrioles. It would be interesting to have a paragraph discussing which organisms have centrosomes but not PLK4, STIL or CEP152/CEP192.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44039.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>More evidence to support the Plk4 loss of function data is required to strengthen the paper.

The dynamics of centriole biogenesis were examined as was described for the other experiments in the manuscript. Simultaneous depletion and Centrinone-mediated inhibition of Plk4 in basal cells caused loss of parental centrioles by ALI0, as expected. We found that the fraction of cells lacking Plk4 that initiated centriole assembly was unchanged, consistent with the centrinone and shRNA-mediated depletion experiments alone. Similar to the Plk4-depletion experiments, a significant fraction of the cells at ALI12 were immature, delayed in Stages I-II and III-IV of centriole amplification. Culturing the cells for an additional 9 days (ALI21) resulted in an increase in the percentage of mature cells, highlighting a delay in the steps of centriologenesis. Importantly, there was no additive effect: the addition of Centrinone to Plk4-shRNA infected cells did not block centriole amplification, but merely caused a delay in the process. This result is almost identical to the shRNA-based depletion results (Figure 5). Thus, we conclude that Plk4 is indeed dispensable for initiation of centriole amplification. These data are presented as new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, and added to the Results section (subsection âModulating Plk4 expression delays centriole assembly but does not affect numberâ, first paragraph). We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment, which further adds to the rigor of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, loss of PLK4 should lead to loss of the key PLK4 substrate, STIL, at centrioles. The authors should check whether STIL is present in PLK4 loss of function centrioles. It will be striking to see STIL negative centrioles in MCCs, a strong support for the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the dynamics of STIL expression and localization in MTEC upon Plk4 inhibition (Centrinone) or depletion (shRNA plus Centrinone). Intriguingly, we discovered that STIL is expressed and recruited in a timely manner to sites of procentriole assembly during centriole amplification in Centrinone-treated cells (new Figure 2C). This suggests that parental centrioles and Plk4 kinase activity are dispensable for STIL localization. This is consistent with our analysis of another Plk4 substrate, Cep152, which we also showed is recruited normally (Figure 2E and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). Moreover, STIL was localized at sites of procentriole assembly upon simultaneous depletion and inhibition of Plk4 (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G-H). Therefore, it appears that the enrichment of centriole assembly factors to sites of procentriole formation (deuterosomes) is Plk4-independent during the centriole amplification stage of multiciliated cells.</p><p>We note that multiple organisms that assemble centrioles lack Plk4, while others appear to be missing its interactors such as STIL and Cep152. Thus, there are mechanisms that allow for control of centriole formation independent of the Plk4-STIL-Cep152 axis. Our results indicate that specialized mammalian cell types may have adapted mechanisms to initiate centriologenesis independent of Plk4 kinase function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Centrosome loss has been shown to induce p53-dependnet stress response in cycling cells, but it does not seem to occur in the MTEC system used here. If space is allowed, the author should perhaps discuss or highlight this interesting difference seen in basal cells of MCC.</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted this difference in a new paragraph in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âLoss of parental centrioles (and thus, centrosomes) in dividing retinal pigment epithelial cells has been shown to trigger a p53-mediated stress response that inhibits their proliferation (Fong et al., 2016; Lambrus et al., 2016; Meitinger et al., 2016). [â¦] Therefore, the response of cells to centrosome loss, and the p53-dependent mitotic surveillance mechanism that senses this defect, may be cell- and tissue specific.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that centriole number is not affected in MCC lacking pre-existing centrioles. We wonder, in their EM studies, if the authors also check the structural integrity, or the shape, of these de-novo centrioles formed in the absence of parental centrioles and PLK4.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to address this question by examining the morphology and size (length, diameter etc) of procentrioles from our EM experiments. However, it is difficult to quantitatively compare centrioles between control and centrinone-treated samples by EM. This is due to the fact that the centrioles in each section are oriented differently, and we could not confidently select procentrioles that were in the exact same stage of growth, as well as orientation relative to the EM grid. Nonetheless, we note in the manuscript that the centrioles generated by centrinone-treated cells are functionally normal: cells form the correct number of centrioles (Figure 4), these centrioles mature into basal bodies (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A-B), dock at the plasma membrane and form cilia (Figure 3C-D), and these cilia beat normally (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that the integrity and functions of these de novo centrioles are unaffected by loss of parental centrioles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Plk4 over-expression in other cell types increases the number of procentriole assembly sites around parental centrioles, leading to the formation of &quot;rosettes&quot; (Habedanck et al., 2005). In MCCs, are rosettes already present, raising the possibility that all the possible assembly sites are already being used? Do the authors think that something similar could be happening for deuterosome-based centriole assembly (i.e. the formation of a given number of assembly sites independently of Plk4 and the use of all of them in normal conditions)? If so, Plk4 over-expression may not be sufficient to increase centriole number even if it does play a role in centriole assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>In an effort to determine the status of available assembly sites on deuterosomes, we quantified the number of procentrioles formed by deuterosomes in control and PC-less (centrinone-treated) cells. We found that deuterosome ârosettesâ in control cells formed an average of 5 procentrioles each at ALI3. The number of procentrioles per deuterosome ranged from 2-8 (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>Importantly, deuterosomes of centrinone-treated cells showed the exact same range, with an upper limit of 8 procentrioles per deuterosome. Thus, it is possible that a proportion of procentriole assembly sites are already being used, limiting the effects of Plk4 overexpression. However, most of the deuterosomes were forming less than the upper limit of 8 procentrioles (new Figure 4), and many deuterosomes in PC-less cells contained âopen sitesâ for assembly. These results indicate that free sites for centriole assembly are likely available in the deuterosome population. Since overexpression of Plk4 did not cause an increase in centriole number in our MTEC (Figure 5I-J), nor in <italic>Xenopus</italic> multiciliated cells (Klos Dehring et al., 2013), we conclude that Plk4 is not rate limiting for procentriole formation in multiciliated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An interesting notion is that PLK4, STIL and the PLK4 scaffold CEP152/CEP192 are actually not conserved in all organisms that form centrioles. It would be interesting to have a paragraph discussing which organisms have centrosomes but not PLK4, STIL or CEP152/CEP192.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this important idea. Indeed, several papers and reviews have examined the evolutionary relationships between centrosomes, centriole duplication and the Plk4-STILCep152/Cep192 modules across different organisms. We have expanded on this topic in the Discussion section and included citations to relevant reviews on this topic. Specifically, we point out that Plk4 is indeed missing in various organisms that form and duplicate centrioles, such as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. Similarly, there are organisms with centrioles that lack STIL or Cep152/Cep192. This suggests that other pathways and mechanisms exist that permit centriologenesis in a Plk4-independent manner, and that certain mammalian cell types may have adapted these mechanisms. We have included the following paragraph:</p><p>âAlthough Plk4 kinase function was needed for canonical centriole duplication in proliferating basal cells, it was dispensable for post-mitotic centriole amplification. [â¦] Thus, even though components of the centriole assembly machinery are generally conserved throughout evolution, our results suggest that certain mammalian cell types may have adapted mechanisms to initiate centriologenesis independent of Plk4 kinase function.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
