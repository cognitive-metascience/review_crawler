More recently, theta and gamma oscillations were also reported to exhibit phase-phase coupling, or n:m phase-locking, suggesting an important mechanism of neuronal coding that has long received theoretical support. However, by analyzing simulated and actual LFPs, here we question the existence of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rat hippocampus. We show that the quasi-linear phase shifts introduced by filtering lead to spurious coupling levels in both white noise and hippocampal LFPs, which highly depend on epoch length, and that significant coupling may be falsely detected when employing improper surrogate methods. We also show that waveform asymmetry and frequency harmonics may generate artifactual n:m phase-locking. Studies investigating phase-phase coupling should rely on appropriate statistical controls and be aware of confounding factors; otherwise, they could easily fall into analysis pitfalls.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20515.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20515.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neuroscientists have long sought to understand how the brain works by analyzing its electrical activity. Placing electrodes on the scalp or lowering them into the brain itself reveals rhythmic waves of activity known as oscillations. These arise when large numbers of neurons fire in synchrony. Recordings reveal that the frequency of these oscillations – the number of cycles of a wave per second, measured in Hertz – can vary between brain regions, and within a single region over time. Moreover, oscillations with different frequencies can co-exist and interact with one another.</p><p>Within the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory, two types of oscillations dominate: theta waves and gamma waves. Theta waves are relatively slow waves, with a frequency between 5 and 10 Hertz. Gamma waves are faster, with a frequency of up to 100 Hertz. Recent work has suggested that gamma waves and theta waves show a phenomenon called phase-phase coupling. Since gamma waves are faster than theta waves, multiple cycles of gamma can occur during a single cycle of theta. Phase-phase coupling is the idea that gamma and theta waves align themselves, such that gamma waves always begin at the same relative position within a theta wave. This was thought to help the hippocampus to encode memories.</p><p>Using computer simulations and recordings from the rat hippocampus, Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort have now reexamined the evidence for theta-gamma phase-phase coupling. The new results suggest that previous reports describing the phenomenon may have relied on inadequate statistical techniques. Using stringent control analyses, Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort find no evidence for prominent theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the hippocampus. Instead, the simulations suggest that what appeared to be statistically significant coupling may in reality be an artifact of the previous analysis.</p><p>Phase-phase coupling of theta and gamma waves has also been reported in the human hippocampus. The next step therefore is to apply these more robust analysis techniques to data from the human brain. While revisiting previously accepted findings may not always be popular, it will likely be essential if neuroscientists want to accurately understand how new memories are formed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20515.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20515.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>cross-frequency coupling</kwd><kwd>brain rhythms</kwd><kwd>neuronal oscillations</kwd><kwd>local field potential</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheffer-Teixeira</surname><given-names>Robson</given-names></name><name><surname>Tort</surname><given-names>Adriano BL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheffer-Teixeira</surname><given-names>Robson</given-names></name><name><surname>Tort</surname><given-names>Adriano BL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phase-locking of hippocampal theta and gamma waves has been proposed to support memory formation, but an analysis using robust statistical methods finds no convincing evidence for the phenomenon.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Local field potentials (LFPs) exhibit oscillations of different frequencies, which may co-occur and also interact with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>).

In fact, the phase shift between two consecutive data points follows a probability distribution highly concentrated around 2*π*f<sub>c</sub>*dt, where f<sub>c</sub> is the filter center frequency and dt the sampling period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For instance, for dt = 1 ms (1000 Hz sampling rate), consecutive samples of white noise filtered between 4 and 12 Hz are likely to exhibit phase difference of 0.05 rad (8 Hz center frequency); likewise, signals filtered between 30 and 50 Hz are likely to exhibit phase differences of 0.25 rad (40 Hz center frequency). In turn, the ‘sinusoidality’ imposed by filtering leads to non-zero R<sub>n:m</sub> values, which peak at the ratio of the center frequencies, akin to the fact that perfect 8 Hz and 40 Hz sine waves have R<sub>n:m</sub> = 1 at n:m = 1:5. In accordance to this explanation, no R<sub>n:m</sub> bump occurs when data points of the gamma phase time series are made independent by sub-sampling with a period longer than a gamma cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), or when extracting phase values from different trials (not shown). As expected, the effect of filtering-induced sinusoidality on R<sub>n:m</sub> values is stronger for narrower frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Qualitatively similar results were found for 1- and 10 s epochs; however, R<sub>n:m</sub> values were considerably lower for the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In fact, for any fixed n:m ratio and frequency pair, R<sub>n:m</sub> decreased as a function of epoch length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for θ−γ<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>1:5</sub>): the longer the white-noise epoch the more the phase difference distribution becomes uniform. In other words, as standard phase coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinck et al., 2010</xref>) and phase-amplitude coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tort et al., 2010</xref>), phase-phase coupling has positive bias for shorter epochs. As a corollary, notice that false-positive coupling may be detected if control (surrogate) epochs are longer than the original epoch.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical testing of n:m phase-locking</title><p>We next investigated the reliability of surrogate methods for detecting n:m phase-locking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The ‘<italic>Original</italic>’ R<sub>n:m</sub> value uses the same time window for extracting theta and gamma phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper panel). A ‘<italic>Time Shift</italic>’ procedure for creating surrogate epochs has been previously employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), in which the time window for gamma phase is randomly shifted between 1 to 200 ms from the time window for theta phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper middle panel). A variant of this procedure is the ‘<italic>Random Permutation</italic>’, in which the time window for gamma phase is randomly chosen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lower middle panel). Finally, in the ‘<italic>Phase Scramble</italic>’ procedure, the timestamps of the gamma phase time series are shuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lower panel); clearly, the latter is the least conservative. For each surrogate procedure, R<sub>n:m</sub> values were obtained by two approaches: ‘<italic>Single Run</italic>’ and ‘<italic>Pooled</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the first approach, each surrogate run (e.g., a time shift or a random selection of time windows) produces one R<sub>n:m</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, top panels). In the second, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from several surrogate runs are first pooled, then a single R<sub>n:m</sub> value is computed from the pooled distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, bottom panel). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, R<sub>n:m</sub> computed from a pool of surrogate runs is much smaller than when computed for each individual run. This is due to the dependence of R<sub>n:m</sub> on the epoch length: pooling instantaneous phase differences across 10 runs of 1 s surrogate epochs is equivalent to analyzing a single surrogate epoch of 10 s. And the longer the analyzed epoch, the more the noise is averaged out and the lower the R<sub>n:m</sub>. Therefore, pooled surrogate epochs summing up to 10 s of total data have lower R<sub>n:m</sub> than any individual 1 s surrogate epoch.</p><p>No phase-phase coupling should be detected in white noise, and therefore <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>n:m</sub> values should not differ from properly constructed surrogates. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> for θ−γ<sub>S</sub> as an illustrative case (similar results hold for any frequency pair), θ−γ<sub>S</sub> phase-phase coupling in white noise was statistically significantly larger than in phase-scrambled surrogates (for either <italic>Single Run</italic> or <italic>Pooled</italic> distributions). This was true for surrogate epochs of any length, although the longer the epoch, the lower the actual and the surrogate R<sub>n:m</sub> values, as expected (compare right and left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). <italic>Pooled</italic> R<sub>1:5</sub> distributions derived from either time-shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) or randomly permutated epochs (not shown) also led to the detection of false positive θ−γ<sub>S</sub> phase-phase coupling. On the other hand, <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>n:m</sub> values were not statistically different from chance distributions when these were constructed from <italic>Single Run</italic> R<sub>n:m</sub> values for either <italic>Time Shift</italic> and <italic>Random Permutation</italic> surrogate procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude that neither scrambling phases nor pooling individual surrogate epochs should be employed for statistically evaluating n:m phase-locking. Chance distributions should be derived from surrogate epochs of the same length as the original epoch and which preserve phase continuity.</p><p>To check if <italic>Single Run</italic> surrogate distributions are capable of statistically detecting true n:m phase-locking, we next simulated noisy Kuramoto oscillators as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but of mean natural frequencies set to 8 and 40 Hz. <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>1:5</sub> values were much greater than the surrogate distribution for coupled – but not uncoupled – oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result illustrates that variability in the instantaneous frequency leads to low n:m phase-locking levels for independent oscillators even when their mean frequencies are perfect integer multiples. On the other hand, coupled oscillators have high R<sub>n:m</sub> because variations of their instantaneous frequencies are mutually dependent. We then proceeded to analyze simulated LFPs from a previously published model network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kopell et al., 2010</xref>). The network has two inhibitory interneurons, called O and I cells, which spike at theta and gamma frequency, respectively (for a motivation of this model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tort et al., 2007</xref>). Compared to <italic>Single Run</italic> surrogate distributions, the model LFP exhibited significant n:m phase-locking only when the interneurons were coupled; R<sub>n:m</sub> levels did not differ from the surrogate distribution for the uncoupled network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). (Note that the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve also exhibited a peak for both the uncoupled network and <italic>Single Run</italic> surrogate data, which is due to the low variability in the instantaneous spike frequency of the model cells; without this variability, however, all networks would display perfect n:m phase-locking).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>True n:m phase-locking leads to significant R<sub>n:m</sub> values.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The left panels show mean R<sub>n:m</sub> curves and distributions of R<sub>1:5</sub> values for original and surrogate (<italic>Random Permutation/Single Run</italic>) data obtained from the simulation of two coupled Kuramoto oscillators (n = 300; epoch length = 30 s; *p&lt;0.001, t-test). The right panels show the same, but for uncoupled oscillators. In these simulations, each oscillator has instantaneous peak frequency determined by a Gaussian distribution; the mean natural frequencies of the theta and gamma oscillators were set to 8 Hz and 40 Hz, respectively (coupling does not alter the mean frequencies since they already exhibit a 1:5 ratio; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Top panels show results from a simulation of a model network composed of two mutually connected interneurons, O and I cells, which emit spikes at theta and gamma frequency, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kopell et al., 2010</xref>).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, a non-sinusoidal oscillation such as a theta sawtooth wave can be decomposed into a sum of sine waves at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies, which have decreasing amplitude (i.e., the higher the harmonic frequency, the lower the amplitude).

Due to the non-sinusoidal shape of theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheremet et al., 2016</xref>), the LFP also exhibited spectral peaks at harmonic frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We constructed phase–phase plots using LFP components narrowly filtered at theta and its harmonics: 14, 21, 28 and 35 Hz. Similarly to the sawtooth wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the phase-phase plots exhibited diagonal stripes whose number was determined by the harmonic order (i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> harmonic exhibited two stripes, the second harmonic three stripes, the third, four stripes and the fourth, five stripes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bi–iv</xref>). Interestingly, when the LFP was filtered at a broad gamma band (30–90 Hz), we observed five diagonal stripes, the same number as when narrowly filtering at 35 Hz; moreover, both gamma and 35 Hz filtered signals exhibited the exact same phase lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Biv–v</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots may be influenced by theta harmonics. Under this interpretation, signals filtered at the gamma band would be likely to exhibit as many stripes as expected for the first theta harmonic falling within the filtered band. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the peak frequency of theta relates to the number of stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Phase–phase coupling between theta and gamma oscillations may be confounded by theta harmonics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, representative LFP epoch exhibiting prominent theta activity (~7 Hz) during REM sleep.

Since white noise has no harmonics, these results show that the sinusoidality induced by the filter can by itself lead to diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots, in the same way that it leads to a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, as in actual LFPs, bin counts in phase-phase plots of white-noise signals were also deemed statistically significant when compared to the distribution of bin counts from time-shifted surrogates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Since by definition white noise has no n:m phase-locking, we concluded that the statistical analysis of phase-phase plots as originally introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al.

To test this possibility, we next revisited the significance of phase-phase plots of actual LFPs. For epochs of up to 100 s, we found similar results as in white noise, namely, bin counts were no longer statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Holm-Bonferroni method); this was true when using either the <italic>Time Shift</italic> or <italic>Random Permutation</italic> procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Surprisingly, however, when analyzing much longer time series (10 or 20 min of concatenated periods of REM sleep), several bin counts became statistically significant when compared to randomly permutated, but not time-shifted, surrogates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Moreover, this result reflected in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curves: the <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>n:m</sub> curve fell within the distribution of <italic>Time Shift/Single Run</italic> surrogate R<sub>n:m</sub> values for all analyzed lengths, but outside the distribution of <italic>Random Permutation/Single Run</italic> surrogates for the longer time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We believe such a finding relates to what we observed for synthetic sawtooth waves, in which <italic>Random Permutation</italic> was more sensitive than <italic>Time Shift</italic> to detect the significance of the artifactual coupling caused by waveform asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this sense, the n:m phase-locking between fundamental and harmonic frequencies would persist for small time shifts (±200 ms), albeit in different phase relations, while it would not resist the much larger time shifts obtained through random permutations. However, irrespective of this explanation, it should be noted that since the n:m phase-locking metrics cannot separate artifactual from true coupling, the possibility of the latter cannot be discarded. But if this is the case, we consider unlikely that the very low coupling level (~0.03) would have any physiological significance.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.028</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Weak but statistically significant n:m phase-locking can be detected when analyzing long LFP epochs (&gt;100 s).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Panels show the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> but for a representative hippocampal LFP.

Theta and gamma are well known to interact by means of phase-amplitude coupling, in which the instantaneous gamma amplitude waxes and wanes as a function of theta phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caixeta et al., 2013</xref>). This particular type of cross-frequency coupling has been receiving large attention and related to functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to phase-amplitude coupling, theta and gamma oscillations can potentially interact in many other ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the power of slow gamma oscillations may be inversely related to theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tort et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting amplitude-amplitude coupling. Recently, it has been reported that theta and gamma in hippocampal LFPs would also couple by means of n:m phase-locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Among other implications, this finding was taken as evidence for network models of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen and Lisman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lisman, 2005</xref>) and for a role of basket cells in generating cross-frequency coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). However, our results show a lack of convincing evidence for n:m phase-locking in the two hippocampal datasets analyzed here, and further suggest that previous work may have spuriously detected phase-phase coupling due to an improper use of surrogate methods, a concern also raised for phase-amplitude coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aru et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling</title><p>When searching for phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma, we noticed that our R<sub>n:m</sub> values differed from those reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). We suspected that this could be due to differences in the duration of the analyzed epochs. We then investigated the dependence of R<sub>n:m</sub> on epoch length, and found a strong positive bias for shorter epochs. In addition, R<sub>n:m</sub> values exhibit greater variability across samples as epoch length decreases for both white noise and actual data (e.g., compare in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> the data dispersion in <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>1:5</sub> or R<sub>1:8</sub> boxplots for different epoch lengths). Since theta and gamma peak frequencies are not constant in these signals, the longer the epoch, the more the theta and gamma peak frequencies are allowed to fluctuate and the more apparent the lack of coupling. On the other hand, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> distribution becomes less uniform for shorter epochs. The dependence of n:m phase-coupling metrics on epoch length has important implications in designing surrogate epochs for testing the statistical significance of actual R<sub>n:m</sub> values. Of note, methodological studies on 1:1 phase-synchrony have properly used single surrogate runs of the same length as the original signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Van Quyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurtado et al., 2004</xref>). As demonstrated here, spurious detection of phase-phase coupling may occur if surrogate epochs are longer than the original epoch. This is the case when one lumps together several surrogate epochs before computing R<sub>n:m</sub>. When employing proper controls, our results show that R<sub>n:m</sub> values of real data do not differ from surrogate values in theta epochs of up to 100 s. Moreover, the prominent bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve disappears when subsampling data at a lower frequency than gamma for both white noise and hippocampal LFPs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>), which suggests that it is due to the statistical dependence among contiguous data points introduced by the filter (which we referred to as ‘filtering-induced sinusoidality’).</p><p>Therefore, even though the n:m phase-locking metric R<sub>n:m</sub> is theoretically well-defined and varies between 0 and 1, an estimated R<sub>n:m</sub> value in isolation does not inform if two oscillations exhibit true phase-coupling or not. This can only be inferred after testing the statistical significance of the estimated R<sub>n:m</sub> value against a proper surrogate distribution (but notice that false-positive cases may occur due to waveform asymmetry; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While constructing surrogate data renders the metric computationally more expensive, such an issue is not specific for measuring n:m phase-locking but also happens for other metrics commonly used in the analysis of neurophysiological data, such as coherence, spike-field coupling, phase-amplitude coupling, mutual information and directionality measures, among many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Van Quyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurtado et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pereda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tort et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The recent studies assessing theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in hippocampal LFPs have not tested the significance of individual R<sub>n:m</sub> values against chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>) statistically inferred the existence of n:m phase-locking by comparing empirical phase-phase plots with those obtained from the average of 1000 time-shifted surrogate runs. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al. (2012)</xref> established a significance threshold for each phase-phase bin based on the mean and standard deviation of individual surrogate counts in that bin, and showed that the bin counts leading to diagonal stripes were statistically significant. Here we were able to replicate these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we note that a phase-phase bin count is not a metric of n:m phase-locking; it does not inform coupling strength and even coupled oscillators have bins with non-significant counts. A bin count would be analogous to a phase difference vector (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), which is also not a metric of n:m phase-locking per se, but used to compute one. That is, in the same way that the R<sub>n:m</sub> considers all phase difference vectors, n:m phase-locking can only be inferred when considering all bin counts in a phase-phase plot. In this sense, by analyzing the phase-phase plot as a whole, it was assumed that the appearance diagonal stripes was due to theta-gamma coupling; no such stripes were apparent in phase-phase plots constructed from the average over all surrogate runs (see Figure 6A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>). However, here we showed that single time-shifted surrogate runs do exhibit diagonal stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), that is, similar stripes exist at the level of a <italic>Single Run</italic> surrogate analysis, in the same way that <italic>Single Run</italic> surrogates also exhibit a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve. Averaging 1000 surrogate phase-phase plots destroys the diagonal stripes since different time shifts lead to different phase lags. Moreover, since the average is the sum divided by a scaling factor (the sample size), computing the average phase-phase plot is equivalent to computing a single phase-phase plot using the pool of all surrogate runs, which is akin to the issue of computing a single R<sub>n:m</sub> value from a pooled surrogate distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Note that even bin counts in phase-phase plots of white noise are considered significant under the statistical analysis introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al. (2012)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Nevertheless, this was no longer the case when adapting their original framework to include a Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>Here we showed that the presence of diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots is not sufficient to conclude the existence of phase-phase coupling. The diagonal stripes are simply a visual manifestation of a maintained phase relationship, and as such they essentially reflect what R<sub>n:m</sub> measures: that is, the ‘clearer’ the stripes, the higher the R<sub>n:m</sub>. Therefore, in addition to true coupling, the same confounding factors that influence R<sub>n:m</sub> also influence phase-phase plots, such as filtering-induced sinusoidality and frequency harmonics. Our results suggest that the former is a main factor, because white-noise signals have no harmonics but nevertheless display stripes in phase-phase plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In accordance, no stripes are observed in phase-phase plots of white noise when subsampling the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in actual LFPs filtering is not the only influence: (1) for the same filtered gamma band (30–50 Hz), the number of stripes relates to theta frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); (2) for very long time series (i.e., 10–20 min of concatenated data), the stripes in phase-phase plots of actual data – but not of white noise – persist after correcting for multiple comparisons when employing <italic>Random Permutation/Single Run</italic> surrogates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>); (3) a striped-like pattern remains in phase-phase plots of actual LFPs after subsampling the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistently, R<sub>n:m</sub> values of actual LFPs are greater than those of white noise in 1200 s epochs (~0.03 vs ~0.005, compare the bottom right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Original</italic> R<sub>n:m</sub> values of actual LFPs are not statistically different from the distribution of <italic>Time Shift/Single Run</italic> surrogates even for the very long epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), which suggests that <italic>Random Permutation</italic> is more powerful than <italic>Time Shift</italic> and should therefore be preferred. Though a very weak but true coupling effect cannot be discarded, based on our analysis of sawtooth waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we believe these results can be explained by theta harmonics, which would remain phase-locked to the fundamental frequency under small time shifts. Sharp signal deflections have been previously recognized to generate artifactual phase-amplitude coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kramer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tort et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aru et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lozano-Soldevilla et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyafil (2015)</xref> recently suggested that the non-sinusoidality of alpha waves could underlie the 1:2 phase-locking between alpha and beta observed in human EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikulin and Brismar, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palva et al., 2005</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no metric capable of automatically distinguishing true cross-frequency coupling from waveform-induced artifacts in collective signals such as LFP, EEG and MEG signals. Ideally, learning how the signal is generated from the activity of different neuronal populations would answer whether true cross-frequency coupling exists or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>), but unfortunately this is methodologically challenging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lack of evidence vs evidence of non-existence</title><p>One could argue that we did not analyze a proper dataset, or else that prominent phase-phase coupling would only occur during certain behavioral states not investigated here. We disagree with these arguments for the following reasons: (1) we could reproduce our results using a second dataset from an independent laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), and (2) we examined the same behavioral states in which n:m phase-locking was reported to occur (active waking and REM sleep). One could also argue that there exists multiple gammas, and that different gamma types are most prominent in different hippocampal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tort et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014</xref>); therefore, prominent theta-gamma phase-phase coupling could exist in other hippocampal layers not investigated here. We also disagree with this possibility because: (1) we examined the same hippocampal layer in which theta-gamma phase-phase coupling was reported to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>); moreover, (2) we found similar results in all hippocampal layers (we recorded LFPs using 16-channel silicon probes, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) and (3) in parietal and entorhinal cortex recordings (not shown). Furthermore, similar results hold when (4) filtering LFPs within any gamma sub-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> to 6), (5) analyzing CSD signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), or (6) analyzing independent components that maximize activity within particular gamma sub-bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, one could argue that gamma oscillations are not continuous but transient, and that assessing phase-phase coupling between theta and transient gamma bursts would require a different type of analysis than employed here. Regarding this argument, we once again stress that we used the exact same methodology as originally used to detect theta-gamma phase-phase coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, we also ran analysis only taking into account periods in which gamma amplitude was &gt;2 SD above the mean (‘gamma bursts’) and found no statistically significant phase-phase coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al. (2012)</xref>, other studies also reported theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rodent hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>) and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, human studies had previously reported theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in scalp EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sauseng et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holz et al., 2010</xref>). Most of these studies, however, have not tested the statistical significance of coupling levels against chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sauseng et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al. (2016)</xref> based their statistical inferences on the inspection of diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots as originally introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al. (2012)</xref>. We further note that epoch length was often not informed in the animal studies. Based on our results, we believe that differences in analyzed epoch length are likely to explain the high variability of R<sub>n:m</sub> values across different studies, from ~0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>) down to 0.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since it is philosophically impossible to prove the absence of an effect, the burden of proof should be placed on demonstrating that a true effect exists. In this sense, and to the best of our knowledge, none of previous research investigating theta-gamma phase-phase coupling has properly tested R<sub>n:m</sub> against chance. Many studies have focused on comparing changes in n:m phase-locking levels, but we believe these can be influenced by other variables such as changes in power, which affect the signal-to-noise ratio and consequently also the estimation of the phase time series. Interestingly, in their pioneer work, Tass and colleagues used filtered white noise to construct surrogate distributions and did not find significant n:m phase-locking among brain oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tass et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2003</xref>). On the other hand, it is theoretically possible that n:m phase-locking exists but can only be detected by other types of metrics yet to be devised. In any case, our work shows that there is currently no convincing evidence for genuine theta-gamma phase-phase coupling using the same phase-locking metric (R<sub>n:m</sub>) as employed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), at least when examining LFP epochs of up to 100 s of prominent theta activity. For longer epoch lengths, though, we did find that R<sub>n:m</sub> values of hippocampal LFPs may actually differ from those of randomly permuted, but not time-shifted, surrogates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). While we tend to ascribe such result to the effect of theta harmonics, we note that the possibility of true coupling cannot be discarded. But we are particularly skeptical that the very low levels of coupling strength observed in long LFP epochs would be physiologically meaningful.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for models of neural coding by theta-gamma coupling</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisman and Idiart (1995)</xref> proposed an influential model in which theta and gamma oscillations would interact to produce a neural code. The theta-gamma coding model has since been improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen and Lisman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lisman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman and Buzsáki, 2008</xref>), but its essence remains the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>): nested gamma cycles would constitute memory slots, which are parsed at each theta cycle. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisman and Idiart (1995)</xref> hypothesized that working memory capacity (7 ± 2) is determined by the number of gamma cycles per theta cycle.</p><p>Both phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma have been considered experimental evidence for such coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman and Buzsáki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sauseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hyafil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajji et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of phase-amplitude coupling, the modulation of gamma amplitude within theta cycles would instruct a reader network when the string of items represented in different gamma cycles starts and terminates. On the other hand, the precise ordering of gamma cycles within theta cycles that is consistent across theta cycles would imply phase-phase coupling; indeed, n:m phase-locking is a main feature of computational models of sequence coding by theta-gamma coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen and Lisman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast to these models, however, our results show that the theta phases in which gamma cycles begin/end are not fixed across theta cycles, which is to say that gamma cycles are not precisely timed but rather drift; in other words, gamma is not a clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>If theta-gamma neural coding exists, our results suggest that the precise location of gamma memory slots within a theta cycle is not required for such a code, and that the ordering of the represented items would be more important than the exact spike timing of the cell assemblies that represent the items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, while absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, our results challenge the hypothesis that theta-gamma phase-phase coupling exists in the hippocampus. At best, we only found significant R<sub>n:m</sub> values when examining long LFP epochs (&gt;100 s), but these had very low magnitude (and we particularly attribute their statistical significance to the effects of harmonics). We believe that the evidence in favor of n:m phase-locking in other brain regions and signals could potentially also be explained by simpler effects (e.g., filtering-induced sinusoidality, asymmetrical waveform, and improper statistical tests). While no current technique can differentiate spurious from true phase-phase coupling, previous findings should be revisited and, whenever suitable, checked against the confounding factors and the more conservative surrogate procedures outlined here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p>All procedures were approved by our local institutional ethics committee (Comissão de Ética no Uso de Animais - CEUA/UFRN, protocol number 060/2011) and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this resubmitted paper on phase-phase coupling, all of the reviewers thought that several concerns had been addressed and suggestions implemented (such as the title change). The reviewers agreed that this is an important article that highlights a methodological issue impacting our understanding of the brain's activity and function. The authors are commended for sharing their analysis methods (on GitHub) and data.</p><p>The authors address three points in their paper: a statistical issue (using appropriates surrogate to detect n:m coupling), a conceptual issue (whether n:m coupling can be dissociated from asymmetrical oscillations), and an experimental one (whether n:m coupling is present in hippocampus). The first and last points are well made. However, this is not the case for the second, and other aspects remain unclear as presented. The authors are encouraged to revise and edit their paper to clarify all of the following issues.</p><p>1) A clear distinction between true phase versus estimated phase needs to be made as it is confusing as presented. Specifically:</p><p>A) As the authors' state, the theoretical quantity of n:m phase locking is well-defined. However, the estimated quantity of n:m phase locking as deduced from noisy neural data is fraught with difficulty. The authors show here that simply applying the theoretical n:m phase locking equation to data produces estimates that – without appropriate statistical tests – lead to spurious results. This is an important conclusion. Future work might seek to improve or correct (somehow) the estimation of the theoretical quantity, or propose a new theoretical quantity that is more easily estimated.</p><p>B) The point in the Discussion (subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph) that true n:m coupling can be disentangled from asymmetrical oscillation by visual inspection of the LFP or EEG trace, precisely because they will look very much alike does not seem appropriate. This distinction may be hard to make at the macroscopic level (LFP/EEG) and could rather be searched for in how this signal is generated from the activity of distinct neural subpopulations. If the same gamma oscillations that are shown to phase-lock to theta oscillations can be dissociated neurally from theta oscillations (and indeed the authors did a tremendous job in previous publications at showing that hippocampal theta and gamma rely on distinct interconnected networks), then the evidence is rather of favor of genuine n:m locking. In the converse case, if no population selectively engaged in the faster oscillation can be identified, I would say that the asymmetrical oscillation is the most plausible explanation.</p><p>2) More detail of why the stripes in phase-phase plot can be produced by asymmetry of the theta waves needs to be provided.</p><p>It is not clear how the authors can conclude for the dataset at hand that stripes in phase-phase plot are due to the asymmetry of the theta waves and not to genuine gamma activity (Results, eighth paragraph). The authors seem to somehow tie this possible caveat to the stripes in phase-phase plots. However, stripes are just a visual inspection for maintained relationship between the two phases, just as (properly controlled) Rnm should measure.</p><p>3) The discussion about the caveat of asymmetrical oscillations is unsatisfying for the following reasons:</p><p>A) This point is made in the middle of the analysis of experimental data. Since this has nothing to do with the data at hand, in which no evidence for phase coupling was found, this obscures the message. A separate section should be devoted to the caveat of the asymmetrical oscillations, possibly before the analysis of experimental data.</p><p>B) The point should be clarified, by not only focussing on the presence of stripes for asymmetrical oscillations, but by explaining conceptually why this dissociation emerges. Possibly it could be illustrated by showing how an asymmetrical wave resembles the sum of multiples sinusoids at the fundamental and harmonics frequencies n:m locked to each other (and possibly with also some phase-amplitude coupling, see Kramer et al.).</p><p>4) Any differences between the measure of the authors and that of Belluscio's needs to be made clear. As specified by one of the reviewers:</p><p>It is not quite clear whether the methods used are exactly the same. In Belluscio et al., I think the counts were performed first for each surrogate (corresponding to a specific time-shift), and then the distribution of counts over the distinct time-shift was computed for each bin (i.e. Single Run analysis, which should be the correct method). By contrast, it seems that here – not quite clear in the text – surrogates for distinct time shifts were merged before counts were done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (i.e. Pooled analysis, which of course averages the count and creates many false positives). [Note that I use Single Run vs. Pooled terminology to refer to whether the metrics was computed for each surrogate independently (Single Run) or for merged data, the metrics applying yo either Rnm or counts.] I hope that I am being wrong here. Otherwise that would seriously limit the conclusions of the author about invalidating Belluscio's findings.</p><p>Note that there is still a statistical problem with the Single Run analysis of phase-phase counts, which relates to the absence of a correction for the number of tested bins (either for a given theta phase or across all theta phases). In any case, the p-value in Belluscio et al. reaches very low value (some p&lt;10^-10), which would probably resist proper corrections. If this is the case, that would provide statistically sound evidence for n:m coupling (asymmetrical theta being still a possible confound). Do the authors observe such low values in their own dataset? Could they remove statistical significance in the stripes in white noise using an appropriate correction? Or does this deceiving statistical significance come from yet another explanation?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;On cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are remaining issues that need to be addressed. All of the reviewers appreciated the authors' revisions and thought that this work could serve as a useful cautionary tale for neuroscientists as well as a useful starting point for continuing work. Even though it was felt that the results were not completely satisfying, it was also felt that it would be of great benefit in preventing researchers from wandering down the wrong analysis path. It was further noted that if this paper were presented as a statistics paper it could be improved more but then it would probably be less read and absorbed by the neuroscience community for some time.</p><p>An overall suggestion is that the authors should be more cautious in their interpretation and clearer about there being room for further progress in editing their manuscript.</p><p>Specific issues to address are:</p><p>1) The Abstract would benefit from significant revisions considering the various changes already done, and ones to be done. Sentences that should be targeted are: &quot;filtered white noise has similar n:m phase-locking levels as actual data&quot;, and &quot;the diagonal stripes in theta-gamma phase-phase histograms of actual data can be explained by theta harmonics&quot;.</p><p>2) Validity of Belluscio's analysis – overall conclusion:</p><p>A) In the rebuttal, the authors consider that the analysis by Belluscio is intrinsically flawed rather than being simply not well controlled statistically. I tend to defend the alternative option (clearly here I do not refer to the analysis of Mean Phase-Phase Plot, which the authors have convincingly showed that is flawed, but to the tests on phase counts; I also want to reassure the authors that I really do not have any personal motivation to go one way or the other). My intuition is that the presence of one single significant count in the phase-phase plot, if appropriately controlled for multiple comparisons, would provide a valid statistical measure. In essence it would not simply detect the presence of stripes (which surrogate run also feature) but measure whether their amplitude is larger than those of surrogates. This could be shown in a quite straightforward way by looking whether significant points in phase-phase plots obtained from white noise persist when a correction for multiple comparisons is applied. The authors seem to agree that they would not. (As for the type of correction, the Bonferroni method that the authors refer to looks too conservative as the bin counts clearly are non-independent; less stringent correction such as FDR or Holm-Bonferroni may be preferred). A count is not a metric for n:m coupling for sure, but it can inform of the particular concentration of the high frequency phase at one specific phase of the high frequency phase. More importantly, what matters here is not a metric of the coupling strength, but a reliable statistical test that selectively detects coupling, and my intuition is that counts in the phase-phase plot may provide one. If a simple correction can be applied to give a sound statistical test, this could allow Belluscio and colleagues to look back at their data and see whether the significant counts indeed resist correction for multiple comparisons.</p><p>B) About the very low p-values in Belluscio's data, the authors suggest that &quot;it is possible that, by analyzing a longer epoch length, the influence of theta harmonics becomes more apparent and would lead to lower p-values, while the effect of the filtering-induced sinusoidality is washed out for both actual and surrogate epochs (of the same length).&quot;</p><p>Well the manuscript previously demonstrates that n:m coupling measures as well as phase-phase plots cannot tear apart asymmetrical waves from true cross-frequency coupling. Thus, if indeed p-values remain lower than threshold when controlled appropriately, it could equally be due to asymmetrical theta or true theta-gamma phase coupling, but the latter could not be dismissed.</p><p>3) The reason for stripes in the phase-phase plot of hippocampal data:</p><p>A) In the manuscript authors state that &quot;the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots are due to theta harmonics and not to genuine gamma activity.&quot; If it were true harmonics, that would imply a consistent phase relationship between theta and gamma over sustained periods (not just over small periods as for white noise), i.e. would test positive for n:m coupling. So in my opinion here the effect is rather due to the temporary n:m alignment of phases, just as for white noise. In other words, stripes emerge also when analyzing white noise despite there being no harmonics in the signal.</p><p>B) In the rebuttal, the authors defend that &quot;Believing in two different and genuine gamma activities – one coupled at 5 cycles per theta, the other at 4 cycles per theta – would go against the parsimonious principle.&quot; (this is when theta frequency evolves). However, as established by theoretical studies of coupled oscillators, n:m coupling is not a fixed property of the network but emerges as a combination of oscillator intrinsic dynamics and the characteristics of the connectivity pattern. See for example Arnold tongue: if we assume there is just one fixed gamma, a fluctuating theta and fixed connectivity, it is perfectly normal that n:m coupling will shift from 1:5 to 1:4 if the lower oscillator accelerates and the ratio of frequency goes from around 5 to around 4.</p><p>4) Asymmetrical theta vs. phase-coupled theta-gamma in general</p><p>I am coming back to the authors' comment on this in the rebuttal, although this is no longer present in the manuscript. This is a comment for the authors benefit and speaks to the overall comment mentioned above. Sharp edges in LFP/EEG are not by itself an indication that we are measuring a single asymmetrical oscillation as the superposition of a slow and a fast n:m coupled oscillation can also give rise to sharp edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; note that this can even be obtained with just two oscillations). Thus, sharp edges is no more a selective feature of asymmetrical oscillations than n:m coherence is selective of phase-coupled oscillators. In other words, visual inspection cannot tell us more than statistics.</p><p>5) It looks like &quot;Random Perm&quot; is more powerful test than &quot;Time Shift&quot;, as mentioned in the first paragraph of the subsection “Lack of evidence for n:m phase-locking in actual LFPs”. If this is the case then it could be stated as a conclusion of the work that &quot;Random perm&quot; should be preferred over &quot;Time Shift&quot; (and of course of the &quot;Scrambling&quot; procedure), as it is less likely to miss existing effects (lower False Rejections rate).</p><p>6) Conclusion: the very new paper by Lozano-Soldevilla and colleagues (Frontiers Comp Neuro) provides another example of spurious cross-frequency coupling measures due to asymmetrical oscillations, could be worth referencing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>While all of the reviewers felt that this was an important and interesting paper, they also thought that it was presented in a confusing manner, was limited, and could lead to confusion rather than clarification for the field.

We believe both metrics are well defined. The current concept of n:m phase-locking reflected in the metric’s definition (i.e., the concentration of the phase difference distribution) is used not only by experimentalists but also by theoretical groups. Please note that we did not create the n:m phase-locking metric in this work but studied the exact same metric in current widespread use in the literature, which led influential conclusions about how the brain might work. In our paper, we identify the lack of proper control/surrogate analyses as the methodological issue driving incorrect conclusions, which should prompt other groups to revisittheir findings. We believe these results are of enough importance to many neuroscientists working with brain rhythms and their interactions (e.g., Schack et al., 2002; Schack et al., 2005; Schack and Weiss, 2005; Palva et al., 2005; Holz et al., 2010; Sauseng et al., 2008; Sauseng et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013; Stujenske et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Aru et al., 2015; Hyafill et al., 2015; Chaieb et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016, among many others).</p><p>The points above seem to implicitly assume that n:m phase-phase coupling would exist in the brain but the current metric is not able to detect it. While we have difficulties in imagining how this would exactly happen (since the metric and the definition of n:m phase coupling are intrinsically related), we do not disagree with such possibility and have edited our text to discuss it. In addition, we performed new simulations to show that cases of significant coupling may reflect not only true coupling but also artifactual coupling. We tried but were unable to devise a way to separate these cases; in the revised version, we have expanded our Results and Discussion sections to comment on these limitations.</p><p>But please note that our results point to lack of statistically significant coupling in actual LFPs upon proper surrogate procedures, and therefore such issues do not interfere with the main conclusion of our paper.</p><p><italic>2) Given that a clear measure of cross-frequency phase-coupling does not exist, a change of title should be considered.</italic> </p><p>We have changed our title to “On cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus”. But please note that above and in our answers below we defend that there exists a current, well-defined measure of n:m phase-locking, and that the lack of evidence for n:m phase-coupling reported in our work may not be due to a “fault” of this metric but simply to lack of existence of such effect.</p><p><italic>3) A repository (of data and algorithms) should complement the work, and would be beneficial for the community moving forth as analyses, clear understanding and interpretation of artificial and biological data would be available.</italic> </p><p>We have made our codes available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tortlab/phase_phase">https://github.com/tortlab/phase_phase</ext-link>.

But we note that this issue is not specific for n:m phase-locking estimates, as it also occurs for other metrics commonly used in Neuroscience. For instance, estimates of mutual information, coherence, spike-field coupling, phase-amplitude coupling, directionally measures – to mention a few – all suffer from short sample bias. In the re-revised manuscript, we now devote a paragraph to discuss such issue and highlight the difference between estimated and true phase-phase coupling (please see subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>B) The point in the Discussion (subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph) that true n:m coupling can be disentangled from asymmetrical oscillation by visual inspection of the LFP or EEG trace, precisely because they will look very much alike does not seem appropriate. This distinction may be hard to make at the macroscopic level (LFP/EEG) and could rather be searched for in how this signal is generated from the activity of distinct neural subpopulations. If the same gamma oscillations that are shown to phase-lock to theta oscillations can be dissociated neurally from theta oscillations (and indeed the authors did a tremendous job in previous publications at showing that hippocampal theta and gamma rely on distinct interconnected networks), then the evidence is rather of favor of genuine n:m locking. In the converse case, if no population selectively engaged in the faster oscillation can be identified, I would say that the asymmetrical oscillation is the most plausible explanation.</italic> </p><p>The passage of our Discussion mentioned by the reviewer reads, former version):</p><p>“To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no metric capable of automatically distinguishing true cross-frequency coupling from waveform-induced artifacts in collective signals such as LFP, EEG and MEG signals. Until one is developed, we believe the best practice is to judge statistically significant coupling levels on a case-by-case basis by visual inspection of raw signals.”</p><p>We meant that if theta and gamma oscillations genuinely n:m phase-couple, one should be able to observe this effect in the unfiltered LFP (i.e., one should see the actual gamma cycles coupled to theta upon visual inspection); on the other hand, if n:m coupling is spurious and due to an asymmetric theta wave, one would observe sharp deflections in the unfiltered LFP instead of genuine gamma cycles. We have previously discussed such “manual” solution in Kramer et al. (2008) for the cases of spurious phase-amplitude coupling. On page 356 of that paper, we wrote:</p><p>“To ameliorate the potential problem of spurious frequency comodulation, we recommend careful inspection of the unfiltered data to distinguish between sharp edges and true high frequency oscillations.” And later: “First, we recommend visual inspection of the unfiltered data at times corresponding to increases in the amplitude envelope of the high frequency activity. At these times, do the unfiltered data exhibit high frequency oscillations or sharp edges?”</p><p>But we acknowledge that a problem arises when the signal has both gamma oscillations and sharp deflections, in which case it is very difficult – if not impossible – to realize by visual inspection which effect is at play, and therefore we agree with the reviewer that the sentence may not be appropriate.</p><p>We further agree with the reviewer that understanding how the signal is generated by the activity of distinct neural subpopulations would be ideal to sort apart true from artifactual coupling. But this constitutes a huge problem in Neuroscience by itself: after all, what gives rise to LFP oscillations? After decades of research, we still debate about what generates theta and gamma at the circuitry and neuronal levels; we currently have models but not a complete understanding of oscillatory genesis; the available experimental data are not yet fully conclusive. Computer simulations – as the ones mentioned by the reviewer – are useful tools to generate insights into potential mechanisms, but they cannot be considered ultimate proofs. Thus, the gold standard solution referred to by the reviewer (of searching how the signal is generated by the activity of neural subpopulations) is unfortunately not a practical one but methodologically very challenging.</p><p>To address this issue, in the re-revised version we removed the sentence the reviewer did not find appropriate, and instead we now spell out the ideal suggestion put forward by the reviewer (subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) More detail of why the stripes in phase-phase plot can be produced by asymmetry of the theta waves needs to be provided.</italic> </p><p><italic>It is not clear how the authors can conclude for the dataset at hand that stripes in phase-phase plot are due to the asymmetry of the theta waves and not to genuine gamma activity (Results, eighth paragraph). The authors seem to somehow tie this possible caveat to the stripes in phase-phase plots. However, stripes are just a visual inspection for maintained relationship between the two phases, just as (properly controlled) Rnm should measure.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that stripes in phase-phase plots are only a visual manifestation of a maintained phase relationship, and in essence the stripes reflect what R<sub>n:m</sub> measures. The stripes may be due to (1) theta harmonics (i.e., theta asymmetry), due to (2) genuinely coupled gamma activity, or even due to (3) the sinusoidality imposed by the filter. Similarly, all these 3 effects can lead to a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for genuine coupling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for theta asymmetry, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for the filtering-imposed sinusoidality in white noise).</p><p>Therefore, the reviewer is right in that it is not possible to differentiate genuinely coupled gamma from theta harmonics (or filtering effects) solely based on visual inspection of phase-phase plots, and the same is also true for the visual inspection of a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve. But please note that we did not mean to imply that the presence of stripes per se was a proof of theta harmonics and absence of genuine coupling. Rather, our conclusion of absence of genuine coupling stemmed from a conjunction of observations, along with the Occam's principle of parsimony:</p><p>1) As correctly pointed out by the reviewer, the R<sub>n:m</sub> metric and the stripes are essentially related: the more prominent the stripes are in phase-phase plots, the higher the R<sub>n:m</sub>. Therefore, were the stripes due to genuinely coupled gamma activity, they should be associated with R<sub>n:m</sub> values different from chance, which was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its figure supplements).</p><p>2) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the number of stripes perfectly relates to the order of the first theta harmonics falling within the filtered bandwidth. That is, instead of assuming the existence of multiple types of gamma activities coupled to theta, we deemed more parsimonious to attribute the different number of stripes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to different orders of the theta harmonics.</p><p>3) Please notice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> that the filter bandwidth for gamma is the same (30-50 Hz). Yet, the phase-phase plot of the LFP in 8A has 5 stripes while the phase-phase plot of the LFP in 8B has 4 stripes. Instead of assuming that theta would couple to a genuine 1:5 gamma (i.e., 5 gamma cycles per theta cycle) and to a genuine 1:4 gamma (4 gamma cycles per theta cycle), we believe the stripes are straightforwardly explained by the fact that theta frequency in 8A example is 7.1 Hz while in 8B theta frequency is 8.4 Hz; therefore, it takes a factor of 5 and 4, respectively, to make these theta frequencies larger than the low cutoff frequency of the gamma filter (i.e., 7.1 Hz x 5 = 35.5 Hz &gt; 30 Hz and 8.4 x 4 = 33.6 Hz &gt; 30 Hz), which would explain why we see 5 and 4 stripes, respectively. Believing in two different and genuine gamma activities – one coupled at 5 cycles per theta, the other at 4 cycles per theta – would go against the parsimonious principle.</p><p>But while our observations argue against genuine gamma coupling, the distinction between the contribution of theta harmonics and of filtering-induced sinusoidality is trickier, and actually both effects may be at play. In brief, though, the effect of filtering-induced sinusoidality is short lived and would not account for the stripes seen in very long epochs such as the 20-min long signal analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>In the re-revised manuscript, we elaborated new text to clarify these points (subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The discussion about the caveat of asymmetrical oscillations is unsatisfying for the following reasons:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) This point is made in the middle of the analysis of experimental data. Since this has nothing to do with the data at hand, in which no evidence for phase coupling was found, this obscures the message. A separate section should be devoted to the caveat of the asymmetrical oscillations, possibly before the analysis of experimental data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the nice suggestion, which we have followed in the re-revised version. Namely, we now divide our Results section into subsections (in the former version we had a single text), and devote one subsection – before we present the experimental results – to show the caveat of asymmetrical/non-sinusoidal oscillations. This has led to major changes throughout the manuscript, such as the elaboration of a new figure and associated text (see below), and re-ordering of previous figures and text. For convenience, we submitted as “related manuscript file” a PDF version of our manuscript with all changes highlighted.</p><p><italic>B) The point should be clarified, by not only focussing on the presence of stripes for asymmetrical oscillations, but by explaining conceptually why this dissociation emerges. Possibly it could be illustrated by showing how an asymmetrical wave resembles the sum of multiples sinusoids at the fundamental and harmonics frequencies n:m locked to each other (and possibly with also some phase-amplitude coupling, see Kramer et al.).</italic> </p><p>To address this point, we have elaborated a new figure in which we illustrate that the Fourier decomposition of a non-sinusoidal wave is characterized by the sum of multiple sinusoids at harmonic frequencies that are n:m phase-locked to each other; please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and new subsection of the Results section (c.f. our answer above). We mention that an asymmetric wave shape may also lead to spurious phase-amplitude coupling in the first paragraph of the subsection “Spurious n:m phase-locking due to non-sinusoidal waveforms” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, and explicitly show this effect in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Any differences between the measure of the authors and that of Belluscio's needs to be made clear. As specified by one of the reviewers:</italic> </p><p><italic>It is not quite clear whether the methods used are exactly the same. In Belluscio et al., I think the counts were performed first for each surrogate (corresponding to a specific time-shift), and then the distribution of counts over the distinct time-shift was computed for each bin (i.e. Single Run analysis, which should be the correct method). By contrast, it seems that here – not quite clear in the text – surrogates for distinct time shifts were merged before counts were done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (i.e. Pooled analysis, which of course averages the count and creates many false positives). [Note that I use Single Run vs. Pooled terminology to refer to whether the metrics was computed for each surrogate independently (Single Run) or for merged data, the metrics applying yo either Rnm or counts.] I hope that I am being wrong here. Otherwise that would seriously limit the conclusions of the author about invalidating Belluscio's findings.</italic> </p><p>The statistical analysis of the phase-phase plots was done exactly as described in Belluscio et al. and correctly summarized by the reviewer. Namely, for each phase-phase bin, each single surrogate run contributed with one count (please note that we did not merge single surrogates before counting). Then, for each phase-phase bin we constructed a distribution of counts, and, based on the mean and standard deviation of this distribution, we inferred the statistical significance of the actual count for that bin in the phase-phase plot.</p><p>In the re-revised version, we have edited the legend and panel labels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> (current numeration) and subsection “Lack of evidence for n:m phase-locking in actual LFPs”, second paragraph and subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, third paragraph to let it clearer that the mean and SD are computed over individual bin counts, and not over pooled counts.</p><p>Importantly, please note that we do not consider the framework employed in Belluscio et al. as a Single Run analysis. We reserve the term “Single Run” to denote an analysis in which each single surrogate run generates a single measure of n:m phase-locking. In this sense, we don’t see a single histogram count as a metric of n:m phase-locking, in the same way that we don’t see a single vector of phase difference (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>�</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mtext>φ</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) as a metric of n:m phase-locking, simply because neither a single histogram count nor a single phase difference vector measures the level of n:m phase-locking between the time series. Rather, for each single surrogate run, a metric of n:m phase-locking is obtained by computing the length of the mean vector over all phase difference vectors (R<sub>n:m</sub>). Therefore, sticking to this analogy, the counts in phase-phase plots would correspond to the phase difference vectors used to compute the R<sub>n:m</sub>, but not to the R<sub>n:m</sub> metric itself. Again, a count is not an n:m phase-locking metric. In the case of the phase-phase plot, a Single Run surrogate would be an entire phase-phase plot constructed from a single surrogate (i.e., time-shifted) time series, because it is at this level that we infer the existence of n:m phase-locking – and not at the level of a single bin count. In other words, Belluscio et al. inferred the existence of n:m phase-locking by the visual inspection of stripes. And, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, phase-phase plots from single surrogate runs do exhibit stripes similar to the original phase-phase plot. This relates to the fact that single surrogate R<sub>n:m</sub> values are similar to original R<sub>n:m</sub> values, that is, there is no difference between actual and surrogate data at the level of an n:m phase-locking metric, which justifies our conclusions.</p><p>In the re-revised version, we substantially edited a previous Discussion paragraph to clarify these points (please see subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, third paragraph).</p><p>Supplementary remarks: In the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Belluscio et al. show the mean phase-phase plot over all surrogate runs. In our paper we note that plotting the mean number of counts across all surrogates is qualitatively identical to plotting the pool of counts over all surrogate runs, up to a scaling factor, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20515.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20515.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20515.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20515-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Clearly, the scaling factor is the number of surrogates (n=1000). The equivalence above motivated us to state that the procedure in Belluscio et al. is akin to what we call as a pooled surrogate analysis: there is no visual inspection of phase-phase plots for single surrogate runs but only the inspection of their average, which is equivalent to the visual inspection of their pool (of note, this improper visual analysis was also performed in Zheng et al. 2016). At any event, we stress that there is no proper Single Run surrogate analysis performed at the level of an n:m phase-locking metric such as the R<sub>n:m</sub> in Belluscio et al.</p><p><italic>Note that there is still a statistical problem with the Single Run analysis of phase-phase counts, which relates to the absence of a correction for the number of tested bins (either for a given theta phase or across all theta phases). In any case, the p-value in Belluscio et al. reaches very low value (some p&lt;10^-10), which would probably resist proper corrections. If this is the case, that would provide statistically sound evidence for n:m coupling (asymmetrical theta being still a possible confound). Do the authors observe such low values in their own dataset? Could they remove statistical significance in the stripes in white noise using an appropriate correction? Or does this deceiving statistical significance come from yet another explanation?</italic> </p><p>Indeed, in most phase-phase bins the counts would not survive a Bonferroni correction. (Since we used 120x120 phase-phase bins, a correction would bring the significance threshold down to 10<sup>-6</sup>; we don’t know how many phase-phase bins Belluscio et al. employed and whether their counts would survive a Bonferroni correction). But please notice that this is actually one more argument against the existence of phase-phase coupling. Forgetting for the moment the issues with this framework mentioned above, were the described effect robust, we should have been able to replicate it.</p><p>We suspect the p-values in Belluscio et al. are lower than ours due to differences in epoch length; they stated they analyzed 11 sessions in three rats, but the total analyzed length is not informed. Intuitively, we believe it is possible that, by analyzing a longer epoch length, the influence of theta harmonics becomes more apparent and would lead to lower p-values, while the effect of the filtering-induced sinusoidality is washed out for both actual and surrogate epochs (of the same length).</p><p>As for this statement: “If this is the case, that would provide statistically sound evidence for n:m coupling (asymmetrical theta being still a possible confound).”</p><p>As reviewers ourselves, we appreciate the voluntary and time-consuming work of the reviewer, and thank him/her for the relevant suggestions that helped us improving our paper. But while we respect the reviewer’s opinion, we feel compelled to disagree with this particular statement. Based on arguments provided above, we do not think that a proper statistical procedure was performed in Belluscio et al. After all, what is the n:m phase-locking metric being measured in Belluscio et al. framework? A single phase-phase bin count is not a metric, it does not inform how coupled the time series are, and even coupled oscillators have non-significant bin counts. Please note that Belluscio et al. state “The diagonal stripes in the phase–phase plots indicate a statistically reliable relationship between the respective phases of theta and gamma oscillations during both RUN and REM”.Thus, the “metric” in Belluscio et al. is in essence the visual inspection of stripes. But single run surrogates also exhibit stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), in the same way that single run surrogates also exhibit a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve. The stripes are trivially averaged out when one computes the mean over time-shifted phase-phase plots, which relates to a pooled analysis (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>); it is not too surprising that actual counts of some phase-phase bins are deemed statistically significant under this framework. Please note that a single surrogate phase-phase plot – which has stripes – would also be deemed statistically significant if one were to apply this very same framework. Therefore, we do not consider this framework a proper one. Instead, Belluscio et al. should have inferred the statistical significance of coupling at the R<sub>n:m</sub> level, which is an actual metric of n:m phase-locking.</p><p>In the re-revised version, we have substantially edited a previous Discussion paragraph to explain why an histogram count would not constitute an n:m phase-locking metric, and why we do not consider the analysis framework in Belluscio et al. a proper one. Please see subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, third paragraph.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] An overall suggestion is that the authors should be more cautious in their interpretation and clearer about there being room for further progress in editing their manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specific issues to address are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Abstract would benefit from significant revisions considering the various changes already done, and ones to be done. Sentences that should be targeted are: &quot;filtered white noise has similar n:m phase-locking levels as actual data&quot;, and &quot;the diagonal stripes in theta-gamma phase-phase histograms of actual datacan be explained by theta harmonics&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for calling attention to this issue. In the revised version we have edited the Abstract to reflect changes done in the previous and current version. The two mentioned sentences no longer appear in the revised version.</p><p><italic>2) Validity of Belluscio's analysis – overall conclusion:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) In the rebuttal, the authors consider that the analysis by Belluscio is intrinsically flawed rather than being simply not well controlled statistically. I tend to defend the alternative option (clearly here I do not refer to the analysis of Mean Phase-Phase Plot, which the authors have convincingly showed that is flawed, but to the tests on phase counts; I also want to reassure the authors that I really do not have any personal motivation to go one way or the other). My intuition is that the presence of one single significant count in the phase-phase plot, if appropriately controlled for multiple comparisons, would provide a valid statistical measure. In essence it would not simply detect the presence of stripes (which surrogate run also feature) but measure whether their amplitude is larger than those of surrogates. This could be shown in a quite straightforward way by looking whether significant points in phase-phase plots obtained from white noise persist when a correction for multiple comparisons is applied. The authors seem to agree that they would not. (As for the type of correction, the Bonferroni method that the authors refer to looks too conservative as the bin counts clearly are non-independent; less stringent correction such as FDR or Holm-Bonferroni may be preferred). A count is not a metric for n:m coupling for sure, but it can inform of the particular concentration of the high frequency phase at one specific phase of the high frequency phase. More importantly, what matters here is not a metric of the coupling strength, but a reliable statistical test that selectively detects coupling, and my intuition is that counts in the phase-phase plot may provide one. If a simple correction can be applied to give a sound statistical test, this could allow Belluscio and colleagues to look back at their data and see whether the significant counts indeed resist correction for multiple comparisons.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we tended not to consider Belluscio et al. analysis a proper one; despite a bin count not being a metric of n:m coupling strength (c.f. our previous answers and acknowledged by the reviewer), we predicted difficulties in interpreting significant bin counts. For instance, a phase-phase plot of 120 x 120 bins (i.e., 3<sup>o</sup> bins) has 14400 bin counts. If a single bin count out of these 14400 bins is deemed statistically significant (after an appropriate correction), should we consider the time series n:m phase-coupled? We particularly did not consider that having only one bin deemed statistically significant would suffice. But then, what would be the minimal number of significant bins for assuming n:m phase-coupling? And would the appearance of striped patterns be necessary? Or would a few significant bins scattered at random locations suffice? Again, especially considering that there is a well-defined metric of n:m phase-coupling (R<sub>n:m</sub>), we had particular difficulty in considering the bin count analysis a proper one. That said, though, we do respect the opposite opinion manifested by the reviewer, and have followed the suggestion of subjecting the p-values of phase-phase bin counts to a correction for multiple comparisons. These analyses show that the statistically significant bins in phase-phase plots of white noise under the original framework of Belluscio et al. do not persist after correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm-Bonferroni (we considered the FDR correction too liberal since it led to significant bins in white noise). The results were true when building surrogate distribution using both Time Shift and Random Permutation procedures. This is now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and stated/discussed in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots” and in the third paragraph of the subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”. Please note that we created a new Results subsection to discuss the origin of stripes in phase-phase plots (“On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots”), which led to editions and rearrangement of previous paragraphs and figures (in specific, former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> are now new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, respectively).</p><p>In actual LFP data, we also found no significant bins after correcting for multiple comparisons when employing the same ± 200 ms time-shift surrogate procedure as in Belluscio et al. Interestingly, however, for very long epochs (5-10 minutes of concatenated data) we did find significant bins even after Holm-Bonferroni correction when employing randomly permutated – but not time-shifted – surrogates. We believe this is because small time-shifts as performed in Belluscio et al. ( ± 200 ms) would preserve phase-locking between the fundamental and harmonic frequencies (albeit in different phase relations) while the larger time shifts obtained through random permutations would not. These results are now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> stated/discussed in the last two paragraphs of the subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”. Please note that in the revised manuscript we leave room for this result being due to a weak but true coupling effect (subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots”, fifth paragraph, subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph, and subsection “Lack of evidence vs evidence of non-existence”, last paragraph). Please see also our answers below.</p><p><italic>B) About the very low p-values in Belluscio's data, the authors suggest that &quot;it is possible that, by analyzing a longer epoch length, the influence of theta harmonics becomes more apparent and would lead to lower p-values, while the effect of the filtering-induced sinusoidality is washed out for both actual and surrogate epochs (of the same length).&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>Well the manuscript previously demonstrates that n:m coupling measures as well as phase-phase plots cannot tear apart asymmetrical waves from true cross-frequency coupling. Thus, if indeed p-values remain lower than threshold when controlled appropriately, it could equally be due to asymmetrical theta or true theta-gamma phase coupling, but the latter could not be dismissed.</italic> </p><p>As stated above and shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, p-values in phase-phase plots of actual data are no longer considered statistically significant after appropriate correction for multiple comparisons when employing the surrogate procedure introduced in Belluscio et al. ( ± 200 ms time shifts), which in principle would settle this issue. However, we note that bin counts are deemed statistically significant even after correction when employing randomly permutated surrogates, especially for very long epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). We agree with the reviewer that n:m coupling measures cannot separate true coupling from asymmetrical waves; while we indeed tend to ascribe these results to harmonic influences, in the revised manuscript we now state our interpretation more cautiously and leave open the possibility of true theta-gamma phase coupling (subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots”, fifth paragraph, and the Conclusion).</p><p><italic>3) The reason for stripes in the phase-phase plot of hippocampal data:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) In the manuscript authors state that &quot;the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots are due to theta harmonics and not to genuine gamma activity.&quot; If it were true harmonics, that would imply a consistent phase relationship between theta and gamma over sustained periods (not just over small periods as for white noise), i.e. would test positive for n:m coupling. So in my opinion here the effect is rather due to the temporary n:m alignment of phases, just as for white noise. In other words, stripes emerge also when analyzing white noise despite there being no harmonics in the signal.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. Indeed, after performing new analyses on white noise and actual LFPs (which led to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>), we came to agree with the reviewer that the temporary n:m phase alignment due to the sinusoidality induced by filtering is a main factor in determining the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots. These conclusions are backed by data shown in our new figures and explicitly stated in subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots”, last three paragraphs and subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph. However, our new analyses now reveal that in actual LFP signals there is a second influence, which is not accounted for solely by filtering. This effect is only statistically detected when analyzing very long epoch lengths (&gt;100 s) and when contrasting original results (either phase-phase plots or Rnm curves) against randomly permutated data (please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Based on our analysis of sawtooth wave (in which random permutation was more sensitive to detect coupling than time-shifted surrogates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and given that the effect of filtering-induced sinusoidality is controlled for in surrogate data, we particularly believe that the weak (Rnm=0.03) but significant coupling detected in very long time series is due to theta harmonics (discussed in subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph). But in the revised manuscript we leave open the possibility of this low level of coupling as denoting true coupling (subsection “On diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots”, fifth paragraph, subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”, last paragraph, subsection “Lack of evidence vs. evidence of non-existence”, last paragraph, and the Conclusion).</p><p><italic>B) In the rebuttal, the authors defend that &quot;Believing in two different and genuine gamma activities – one coupled at 5 cycles per theta, the other at 4 cycles per theta – would go against the parsimonious principle.&quot; (this is when theta frequency evolves). However, as established by theoretical studies of coupled oscillators, n:m coupling is not a fixed property of the network but emerges as a combination of oscillator intrinsic dynamics and the characteristics of the connectivity pattern. See for example Arnold tongue: if we assume there is just one fixed gamma, a fluctuating theta and fixed connectivity, it is perfectly normal that n:m coupling will shift from 1:5 to 1:4 if the lower oscillator accelerates and the ratio of frequency goes from around 5 to around 4.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for calling our attention to these facts, point taken. We just note that the “parsimony argument” properly criticized by the reviewer was not present in the manuscript text but only stated in the rebuttal letter.</p><p><italic>4) Asymmetrical theta vs. phase-coupled theta-gamma in general</italic> </p><p><italic>I am coming back to the authors' comment on this in the rebuttal, although this is no longer present in the manuscript. This is a comment for the authors benefit and speaks to the overall comment mentioned above. Sharp edges in LFP/EEG are not by itself an indication that we are measuring a single asymmetrical oscillation as the superposition of a slow and a fast n:m coupled oscillation can also give rise to sharp edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; note that this can even be obtained with just two oscillations). Thus, sharp edges is no more a selective feature of asymmetrical oscillations than n:m coherence is selective of phase-coupled oscillators. In other words, visual inspection cannot tell us more than statistics.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the thoughtful comments by the reviewer. (As stated by the reviewer, this issue is no longer present in our manuscript.)</p><p><italic>5) It looks like &quot;Random Perm&quot; is more powerful test than &quot;Time Shift&quot;, as mentioned in the first paragraph of the subsection “Lack of evidence for n:m phase-locking in actual LFPs”. If this is the case then it could be stated as a conclusion of the work that &quot;Random perm&quot; should be preferred over &quot;Time Shift&quot; (and of course of the &quot;Scrambling&quot; procedure), as it is less likely to miss existing effects (lower False Rejections rate).</italic> </p><p>We agree (and actually our new analyses of very long LFP epochs support such conclusion). This conclusion is now explicitly stated in the last paragraph of the subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”.</p><p><italic>6) Conclusion: the very new paper by Lozano-Soldevilla and colleagues (Frontiers Comp Neuro) provides another example of spurious cross-frequency coupling measures due to asymmetrical oscillations, could be worth referencing.</italic> </p><p>We now cite Lozano-Soldevilla et al. et al. at the passage mentioned by the reviewer (currently in the last paragraph of the subsection “Statistical inference of phase-phase coupling”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
