This study sought to identify actionable gene targets by selective targeting of the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation. Silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an amidotransferase that converts aspartate into asparagine, produced the strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma growth in a functional genomic screen of mouse sarcomas generated by oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> and disruption of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>. ASNS silencing in mouse and human sarcoma cell lines reduced the percentage of S phase cells and impeded new polypeptide synthesis. These effects of ASNS silencing were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine. Also, asparagine depletion via the ASNS inhibitor amino sulfoximine 5 (AS5) or asparaginase inhibited mouse and human sarcoma growth in vitro, and genetic silencing of ASNS in mouse sarcoma cells combined with depletion of plasma asparagine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells may represent a metabolic vulnerability with potential anti-sarcoma therapeutic value.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09436.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09436.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09436.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the connective tissues of the body, such as bone, cartilage, muscle and fat. Usually, treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor and/or radiation to kill the tumor cells. However, if sarcomas spread to other parts of the body, the treatment options are limited.</p> <p>Genetic studies have revealed several genetic changes that contribute to the formation of sarcomas. Many sarcomas have a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called Ras. In 2011, researchers found that injecting Ras mutant muscle cells into the muscles of mice could lead to the formation of sarcomas. Next, the researchers compared gene expression in the mouse sarcoma cells with gene expression in normal mouse muscle cells and found that certain genes appeared to be more highly expressed in the sarcoma cells. These genes were also hyperactive in human sarcoma cells and may promote the growth of sarcomas carrying mutant forms of Ras.</p> <p>Now, Hettmer et al. – including some of the same researchers involved in the earlier work – show that targeting one of these hyperactive genes can slow sarcoma growth. The experiments made use of a technique called ribonucleic acid interference (or RNAi for short) to specifically switch off the expression of the hyperactive genes and then observed how this affected sarcoma growth. Hettmer et al. found that blocking the expression of one particular gene, which encodes an enzyme called asparagine synthetase, slowed down the growth of the sarcoma the most.</p> <p>Asparagine synthetase makes the amino acid asparagine, which is needed to make proteins in cells. Further experiments showed that reducing the amount of asparagine in human and mouse sarcoma cells slowed down the growth of these cells. A drug that lowers the amount of asparagine in cells is already used to treat some blood cancers. Hettmer et al.’s findings suggest that drugs that alter the availability of asparagine in the body might also be useful to treat sarcomas with mutant forms of Ras.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09436.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09436.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sarcoma</kwd><kwd>rhabdomyosarcoma</kwd><kwd>functional genomics</kwd><kwd>asparagine synthetase</kwd><kwd>asparaginase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000043</institution-id><institution>American Association for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SU2C-AACR-IRG1111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagers</surname><given-names>Amy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003341</institution-id><institution>Sarcoma Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SARC-SPORE grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hettmer</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006058</institution-id><institution>St. Baldrick's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pediatric Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hettmer</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA050661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA142536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA176058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The availability of asparagine is important for cell growth and nascent peptide synthesis in certain sarcoma cells, and could be targeted therapeutically to inhibit tumor growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of non-hematopoietic, mesodermal cancers. Certain STS types present with tissue-specific features, such as skeletal muscle differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Parham and Barr, 2013</xref>). For most STS tumors, cure depends on radical resection and/or radiation of the tumor, and therapeutic options for tumors that have spread regionally and/or systemically are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Linch et al., 2014</xref>). The genetic spectrum of STS is heterogeneous. Many tumors carry complex karyotypes with variable genetic changes; others express specific oncogenic mutations or exclusive chromosomal translocations within a relatively simple karyotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bovee and Hogendoorn, 2010</xref>). For RMS, two main genotypes have been described: those characterized by expression of the fusion oncogenes <italic>PAX3:FOXO1</italic> or <italic>PAX7:FOXO1</italic> and those that lack these fusions. The most common oncogenic mutations in the latter group of fusion-negative RMS tumors are in the Ras pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shern et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported rapid sarcoma induction by intramuscular implantation of <italic>Kras (G12V)</italic>-expressing, <italic>Cdkn2a (p16p19)</italic> deficient mouse myofiber-associated (MFA) cells into the extremity muscles of NOD. SCID mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>). Transcriptional profiling of <italic>Kras; p16p19<sup>null</sup> </italic>sarcomas identified a cluster of sarcoma-relevant candidate genes. These genes are enriched in mouse sarcomas and in human RMS as compared to normal mouse or human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>), and may include transcripts of fundamental importance for sarcoma growth. To examine the contributions of each of these candidate genes to sarcoma growth, we performed a customized shRNA-based proliferation screen. The strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma cell proliferation was observed after silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the enzyme that catalyzes cellular synthesis of the non-essential amino acid asparagine. We found that adequate availability of asparagine is required in rapidly proliferating sarcomas cells, likely to support nascent polypeptide synthesis, and that asparagine starvation impedes sarcoma growth. Thus, small molecules targeting asparagine availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>) could be useful as anti-sarcoma therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null </sup></italic>mouse sarcomas identify a cluster of sarcoma-relevant genes</title> <p>In prior work, we showed that ex-vivo lentiviral transduction with oncogenic <italic>Kras (G12v)</italic> of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> (p16p19)-deficient myofiber-associated (MFA) cells, isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from muscle tissue of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice, drives rapid sarcoma formation upon transplantation of these cells into the muscle of immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The myogenic differentiation status of the <italic>Ras</italic>-driven sarcomas generated in this system depends largely on the cell type transduced, also known as the “cell-of-origin”: <italic>Kras; p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> satellite cells typically gave rise to RMS, whereas the identical oncogenetic lesions introduced into fibroadipogenic precursors within the MFA cell pool almost always produced sarcomas lacking myogenic differentiation features (non-myogenic sarcomas, NMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We previously showed that <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </italic>mouse sarcomas from each of these cellular origins recapitulate transcriptional profiles across the entire spectrum of human RMS and used this information to identify 141 genes of potential significance for sarcoma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>). To evaluate the functional contributions of each of the previously identified sarcoma-relevant genes, we designed a customized shRNA proliferation screen, using 5 distinct shRNAs per candidate gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data SD3-data SD4-data">Supplementary files 1–4</xref>). The screen was carried out in one <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </italic>RMS and one <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </italic>NMS cell line, and shRNAs were delivered in puromycin-selectable pLKO lentiviral vectors. Correlation coefficients of 0.8348 and 0.9501 between puromycin-treated and untreated cells confirmed adequate transduction efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,F</xref>). As shRNA mediated silencing of Kras (G12v)-IRES-GFP, the driver oncogene used to initiate the mouse sarcomas, markedly inhibits the growth of <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup> </italic>sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), shRNAs directed against either GFP or KRAS served as positive controls in this screen and showed clear growth-inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D, 1H-I</xref>). Control shRNAs (cntrl-shRNA) directed against LACZ, red fluorescent protein (RFP) and luciferase (LUC) served as negative controls, and showed no growth-inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D, 1H-I</xref>). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, using an external control set of shGFP-infected and cntrl-shRNA-infected RMS and NMS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data SD4-data">Supplementary files 3–4</xref>), validated the ability of this system to distinguish between shRNAs with and without growth-inhibitory effects on sarcoma cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,G</xref>). ROC analysis also determined a false discovery rate of &lt;30% for shRNAs associated with a reduction in proliferation to &lt;52% of the average of cntrl-shRNA-infected RMS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) and &lt;40% of cntrl-shRNA-infected NMS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). In both RMS and NMS cells, silencing of ASNS (Asparagine Synthetase) produced by far the strongest anti-proliferative effect (p&lt;0.0001, q&lt;0.01, 4–5 of 5 shRNAs with FDR&lt;30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data SD6-data">Supplementary files 5–6</xref>).

Functional genomic screening of genetically engineered mouse sarcomas revealed that asparagine synthetase (ASNS) exerted the strongest observed effect on sarcoma cell proliferation within a small group of genes upregulated in both mouse and human sarcomas. ASNS is the amidotransferase that converts L-aspartic acid into L-asparagine in an energy-consuming enzymatic reaction requiring ATP and a nitrogen source that is L-glutamine in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>).

Similarly, ASNS silencing in melanoma cells was recently reported to result in cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2015</xref>). The effects of ASNS reduction in sarcoma cells were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine, supporting the notion that rapidly growing sarcoma cells depend on adequate availability of intrinsic or extrinsic asparagine to support tumor growth. Moreover, ASNS inhibition significantly slowed mouse sarcoma growth in vivo only when combined with depletion of plasma asparagine, likely reflecting the ability of systemic asparagine in the tumor environment to replenish intracellular asparagine availability after ASNS inhibition. We speculate that asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells represents a metabolic vulnerability that could be exploited therapeutically to inhibit rapid tumor growth.</p><p>Previously published metabolic profiling studies have identified a number of metabolites that are heavily consumed by cancer cell lines, including glycine and asparagine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). Glycine starvation prolonged the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced proliferation, in part because sufficient amounts of this amino acid are required to support de novo purine biosynthesis in rapidly dividing cells. Unlike purine synthesis, protein synthesis in glycine-starved cells remained relatively intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we found that asparagine starvation of mouse and human sarcoma cells impedes synthesis of nascent polypeptide chains thereby slowing cell proliferation. These results are consistent with observations in soybean, barley and maize where free asparagine levels in developing seeds correlate positively with higher protein levels at maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pandurangan et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, limiting the extracellular supply or blocking the synthesis of single amino acids is known to suppress global translation initiation via activation of GCN2 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor EIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sood et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, asparagine in the tumor cell environment may have important functions in controlling the synthesis and turnover of protein in sarcoma cells.</p><p>Impaired peptide biosynthesis may not be the only mechanism contributing to the asparagine dependence of sarcoma cells described in this study. For instance, our data do not exclude the possibility that glutamate deprivation and/or aspartate excess resulting from changes in asparagine biosynthesis negatively impact cell survival and proliferation. However, aspartate carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Son et al., 2013</xref>), and increased aspartate levels after ASNS knockdown might be predicted to benefit the redox state of sarcoma cells. In addition, it has been suggested that increased glutaminase expression in cancer cells can counterbalance decreased glutamate levels, especially in a glutamine-rich environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we found that glutaminase expression was increased by 7- to 11-fold in mouse sarcoma cells compared to normal mouse muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism may be used by sarcoma cells to counteract glutamate reductions that may result from ASNS silencing.</p><p>Finally, a recent report demonstrated, unexpectedly, that asparagine supplementation can suppress cell death in glutamine-deprived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), implicating asparagine in promoting cellular adaptation to metabolic stresses such as glutamine depletion. This study also noted that asparagine is the last amino acid synthesized in the TCA cycle and that its amination depends exclusively on glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Amino acid availability is known to stimulate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, which integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that asparagine may serve a central role as a cellular sensor of TCA cycle intermediate/ reduced nitrogen availability and, ultimately, as a metabolic regulator of cell behavior.</p><p>While our studies demonstrate a clear dependence of sarcoma cell growth and survival on cellular asparagine levels, they certainly do not exclude the possibility that adequate availability of amino acids other than asparagine may also be important. The shRNA proliferation screen we performed was designed to evaluate the functional contributions of a particular group of sarcoma signature genes identified by their high level expression in both <italic>Ras</italic>-driven mouse sarcomas and human sarcomas, and thus did not comprehensively evaluate all amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Indeed, within the cluster of sarcoma genes evaluated, the top-scoring cellular functions were cell cycle control and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>). However, we note that in addition to ASNS, our list of candidate targets included genes encoding 3 other enzymes relevant for amino acid biosynthesis: branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Both PHGDH and PSAT1 contribute to serine/ glycine biosynthesis, which plays an important role in supporting nucleotide synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Labuschagne et al., 2014</xref>), and recent publications indicate that high expression of PHGDH in tumor tissue is required for cell growth in epithelial malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Locasale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Possemato et al., 2011</xref>). However, in our screen, silencing of PSAT1, PHGDH or BCAT1 did not inhibit sarcoma cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data SD6-data">Supplementary files 5–6</xref>), suggesting that these biosynthetic pathways may be of lesser importance for the sarcomatous malignancies studied here.</p><p>ASNS expression among tissues in adult animals varies considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2013</xref>). ASNS in tumor tissue has been linked to the transactivating effects of oncogenic effectors such as <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scian et al., 2004</xref>) and metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui et al., 2007</xref>). For example, in pancreatic cancer, glucose deprivation upregulated ASNS expression, which, in turn, protected tumor cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, upregulation of ASNS in response to amino acid restriction, such as plasma asparagine depletion by treatment with asparaginase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui et al., 2007</xref>), is part of a normal physiological adaptation response to counteract nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2013</xref>). As sarcomas outgrow the existing vasculature, tumor cells are continuously exposed to a microenvironment in which the supply of nutrients is limited. Increased <italic>Asns</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null </sup></italic>mouse sarcomas as compared to normal muscle could occur in response to amino acid and glucose deprivation in rapidly growing sarcomas.</p><p>Cellular asparagine reliance has been exploited successfully in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with bacterially derived asparaginase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Haskell et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jaffe et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>). Lymphoblasts are thought to be exquisitely sensitive to asparaginase treatment due to their low ASNS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>). Growth inhibitory effects of asparaginase on sarcoma cells in vitro were previously reported by Tardito et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tardito et al., 2006</xref>). However, the response of sarcoma cells to asparaginase alone is moderate to poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tardito et al., 2006</xref>)) when compared to the published spectrum of asparaginase sensitivity of primary lymphoblasts (EC50 concentrations between &lt;0.002 and &gt;10 IU/ml; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fine et al., 2005</xref>)). One published report on the efficacy of asparaginase as a single agent documented remissions in 7 of 32 children with ALL, but there was no objective response in a single patient with RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jaffe et al., 1971</xref>). Yet, asparaginase is a well-characterized drug with a relatively favorable toxicity profile that does not overlap with the toxicities of conventional cytostatics used in RMS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Haskell et al., 1969</xref>), and the further development of specific, cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of ASNS may open additional therapeutic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>), especially when combined with systemic asparagine depletion.</p><p>Understanding the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation may enable the development of therapies based on selective targeting of proliferation-relevant cellular pathways. This study identified asparagine starvation as a candidate intervention that impedes sarcoma growth. Yet, it is highly unlikely that any interventions will have noticeable anti-sarcoma effects in vivo when used alone. For future studies and clinical development, it will be important to rationally select combinations of interventions that target multiple proliferation-relevant cellular processes including Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> mouse sarcomas</title><p>Primary <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> mouse sarcomas were induced by ex-vivo transduction of freshly sorted Cdkn2a<sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>p16p19<sup>null</sup>)</italic> mouse skeletal muscle precursor cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>TER119<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>-</sup>CXCR4<sup>+</sup> β1integrin<sup>+</sup>) or Sca1+ fibroadipogenic precursor cells CD45<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>TER119<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>) with pGIPZ-Kras (G12V)-IRES-GFP lentivirus followed by intramuscular transplantation of <italic>Kras</italic>-expressing, <italic>p16p19<sup>null </sup></italic>cells into the cardiotoxin-preinjured gastrocnemius muscles of 1- to 3-months old NOD/SCID mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hettmer et al., 2011</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p> <p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hideyuki Okano (Reviewing Editor) and Yoji Minamishima (peer reviewer).</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>The manuscript by Hettmer and colleagues presents the results of an shRNA-based proliferation screen in a <italic>p1619<sup>null</sup></italic> KRAS (<italic>G12v</italic>) model of RMS and identifies asparagine synthethase (ASNS) as a main contributor to proliferation in the screened cells. It further shows a decrease in cell proliferation, increase in cell death and decrease of polypeptide synthesis after ASNS silencing in the model cells and human RMS cell line, effects that can be reversed by addition of exogenous asparagine.</p> <p>All the experiments seemed to be well designed. All the data seems to be firm, have adequate controls and looks reliable. Although Asn requirement was already known in other malignant tumors such as ALL, it would be still valuable knowledge that Asn could be therapeutic target in sarcomas, which have fewer therapeutic options.</p> <p>The authors need to address the following issues before the manuscript is acceptable for publication:</p> <p>1) The authors clearly showed that Asn depletion suppressed nascent polypeptide synthesis, which might suppress tumor growth. If it is the cause of the tumor growth suppression, depletion of other amino acids would do the same.

Furthermore, are the rescuing effects of Asn dose-dependent?</italic> </p> <p>We agree with the reviewers that it is very well possible that sarcoma growth and survival require adequate availability of amino acids other than asparagine. Unfortunately, the design of the shRNA proliferation screen described in this study did not allow for comprehensive functional testing of genes encoding for enzymes relevant in amino acid biosynthesis. Instead, the screen was designed to evaluate the functional contributions of a particular group of sarcoma signature genes that were expressed at higher levels in both <italic>Ras</italic>-driven mouse sarcomas and human sarcomas. Within this cluster of sarcoma genes, top-scoring cellular functions were cell cycle control and cell division (Hettmer et al., 2011).</p> <p>Nonetheless, in addition to ASNS, the candidate group of sarcoma genes we evaluated in this study did include 3 other transcripts encoding for enzymes relevant in amino acid biosynthesis. These enzymes were phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1). Recently published findings indicate that high expression of PHGDH in tumor tissue is a requirement for cell growth in epithelial malignancies (Locasale et al., 2011; Possemato et al., 2011), and both PHGDH and PSAT1 contribute to serine/glycine biosynthesis which plays an important role in supporting nucleotide synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells (Labuschagne et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2012). Branched chain amino acids provide anaplerotic substrates for the TCA cycle (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015). However, in our screen, silencing of PSAT1, PHGDH or BCAT1 did not result in growth inhibition, suggesting that sarcoma cells show lesser dependence on these pathways.</p> <p>To provide a more comprehensive discussion of amino acid metabolism pathways in tumor cell growth, we have revised manuscript to include the above considerations (Discussion, fourth and fifth paragraphs). We also included a new series of experiments documenting the effects of increasing concentrations of asparagine on the growth of shASNS and sh-LUC-transduced mouse <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> RMS and NMS cells. These experiments revealed that ≥ 10mg/L asparagine was needed to rescue the growth-inhibitory effects of ASNS silencing, whereas 0.01 – 1mg/L asparagine were insufficient. Interestingly, normal asparagine concentrations in mouse and human plasma are 3.8mg/L and 7.3mg/L, respectively (Cooney et al., 1970). Thus, even slight reductions in physiologic asparagine levels make sarcoma cells vulnerable to ASNS silencing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and subsections “ASNS silencing inhibits growth of mouse <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> sarcoma cells by asparagine starvation” and”Asparagine depletion impedes mouse sarcoma growth in vivo”).</p> <p><italic>2) Similarly, ASNS reaction is coupled with Gln-Glu conversion. Asparaginase treatment or ASNS-knockdown might reduce Glu abundance. On the other hand, supplementation of Asn will interfere with ASNS enzyme activity, which might suppress Glu production. The authors should briefly comment on why Gln or Glu is not involved in this context. For example, Gln/Glu could be generated by other metabolic pathways, or something like that. Thus, evaluation of asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, glutamate levels before and after the treatment would be required.</italic> </p> <p>Asparagine synthetase catalyzes the biosynthesis of asparagine from aspartate through an ATP-dependent transamination reaction. In this reaction, glutamine (Gln) acts as amino group donor and is converted into glutamate (Glu). As noted by the reviewers, ASNS inhibition or exogenous Asparaginase treatment should result in increased aspartate and glutamine, as well as decreased glutamate levels. As suggested, we confirmed this by measuring amino acid levels before and after treatment in Asparaginase treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p> <p>As the reviewer correctly points out, we cannot exclude that glutamate deprivation and/or aspartate excess negatively impact sarcoma cell survival/proliferation in addition to the growth inhibitory effects of asparagine withdrawal. However, increased glutaminase expression in cancer cells (Huang et al., 2014) could counterbalance glutamate reduction, especially in a glutamine-rich environment. Aspartate, on the other hand, carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle (Chen et al., 2013), and increased aspartate levels after ASNS knockdown conceivably would benefit the redox state of sarcoma cells. Nonetheless, we recognize that disruption of Gln/Glu metabolism may represent an additional mechanism by which modulation of asparagine availability disrupts sarcoma cell growth.</p> <p>We have addressed all of these important points in the revised manuscript, including an explicit discussion of the potential effects of altered glutamate/aspartate availability after Asparagine depletion (Discussion, third paragraph). We also demonstrated increased expression of Glutaminase transcripts in <italic>Kras;p16p19<sup>null</sup></italic> sarcoma cells compared to normal mouse skeletal muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> and the aforementioned paragraph), which, as noted above, may counterbalance glutamate reduction due to ASNS inhibition.</p> <p><italic>3) Based on these data, the authors need to provide some mechanistic insight revealing why the combination of asparagine depletion and ASNS inhibition is required for inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Is the inhibitory effect on polypeptide chain synthesis the only underlying mechanism for the observed metabolic vulnerability in sarcoma (i.e. tumor growth suppression)?</italic> </p> <p>In our experiments, ASNS silencing in sarcoma cells did not impede sarcoma growth in vivo unless systemic asparagine was depleted by treatment with asparaginase. One could argue that limited nutrient availability within a rapidly enlarging solid tumor and slow asparagine uptake speak against repletion of tumor cell asparagine content from systemic sources. Nevertheless, our data support the notion that exogenous asparagine in the cell environment restores intracellular asparagine availability after ASNS silencing. This is discussed more extensively in the revised manuscript (Discussion, first paragraph).</p> <p>Up until recently, the only known use of asparagine in mammalian cells was in protein synthesis, Asparagine does not contain the reducing equivalents of certain other amino acids, and Aspartate consumption due to Asparagine biosynthesis may diminish the reducing power of the malate-aspartate shuttle (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015. Metabolic pathways promoting cancer cell survival and growth. Nat Cell Biol, 17, 351-9.; Chen et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014). However, we agree with the reviewers that impaired peptide biosynthesis may not be the only mechanism responsible for the asparagine dependence of sarcoma cells observed in this study. Recently published data revealed that, surprisingly, asparagine supplementation suppressed cell death in glutamine-deprived cells (although it did not restore TCA anaplerosis and proliferation) (Huang et al., 2014). Thus, Asparagine appears to promote cellular adaptation to metabolic stress such as glutamine depletion. Zhang et al. also noted that asparagine is the last amino acid synthesized in the TCA cycle and that its amination exclusively depends on glutamine (Huang et al., 2014). Amino acid availability is known to stimulate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, which integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth (Jewell et al., 2015). Taken together, these observations by ourselves and others suggest that Asparagine may serve a central role as a cellular sensor of TCA cycle intermediate/reduced nitrogen availability and, ultimately, as a metabolic regulator of cell behavior.</p> <p>An in-depth discussion of potential other mechanisms responsible for sarcoma cell asparagine dependence was added to the revised manuscript (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p></body> </sub-article></article>
