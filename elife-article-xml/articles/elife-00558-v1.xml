In the presence of the disaggregating drug these proteins transit the secretory pathway. When the drug is removed these proteins form electron-dense plaques which we term staples. Unexpectedly, when initially positioned within the cis-Golgi, staples remained at the cis face of the Golgi even after many hours. By contrast, soluble FM-aggregates transited the Golgi. Staples and soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae therefore have different fates. Whereas the membrane staples are located in the flattened, stacked central regions of the cisternae, the soluble aggregates are in the dilated rims. This suggests that while the cisternae are static on the time scale of protein traffic, the dilated rims are mobile and progress in the cis → trans direction via a mechanism that we term ‘Rim Progression’.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00558.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00558.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00558.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plant and animal cells contain an organelle known as the Golgi apparatus, which consists of a series of four to six stacked cisternae. Almost all the proteins that are secreted from the cell, or targeted to its plasma membrane, transit through the Golgi. This process takes roughly 5–20 min.</p><p>Although transport of proteins through the Golgi was first observed more than 50 years ago, it is still unclear exactly how this process occurs. One possibility is that proteins to be packaged move through the cisternae enclosed in vesicles, as if on a conveyor belt. Alternatively, the proteins themselves may remain stationary while the Golgi cisternae move over them.</p><p>Now, Lavieu et al. provide evidence that the Golgi shows both mobile and static behaviour depending on the type and size of the cargo being processed. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, they created a new type of protein cargo—which they called a ‘staple’—that became fixed to the walls on each side of the cisternae and could not, therefore, move freely through the Golgi. They compared the processing of this protein to that of a more typical soluble protein cargo, which could move freely through the Golgi stack.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Golgi processed these two types of cargo in very different ways. The staples remained embedded in the walls in the center of the cisternae, whereas the conventional soluble cargo was transported past the staples and collected at the edges of the cisternae, which are known as rims. These are wider than the center of the cisternae, and the staples are too narrow to span them. Lavieu et al. suggest that the Golgi cisternae can be divided into two functionally distinct domains: the centers of cisternae, which remain stationary, and the edges or rims, which can move.</p><p>In addition to increasing our understanding of how proteins are prepared for transport inside cells, this new mechanism reconciles seemingly conflicting data by revealing that the Golgi can be both mobile and static.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00558.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00558.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>Traffic</kwd><kwd>Membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cisternae of the Golgi contain two functionally distinct domains: the central areas, which remain stationary, and the edges or rims, which are mobile.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anterograde transport (cis → trans) through the Golgi stack is a prerequisite for virtually all proteins that are ultimately secreted from the cell, targeted to the cell surface membrane, or localized in a plethora of internal membrane-bound compartments in plants and animals. Despite the fact that this fundamental process was first recognized over 50 years ago, there is still today no general agreement on how it works. The greatest distinction among the competing models for anterograde transport (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rothman, 2010</xref>) is whether the 4–6 cisternae typically comprising the Golgi stack are proposed to be static or mobile over the time scale of protein flow across the Golgi (typically 5–20 min).</p><p>In ‘static’ models, a transport process such as budding/fusing COPI transport vesicles or possibly tubules is required to create anterograde flow of cargo.</p><p>In contrast, in ‘mobile’ models, the cisternae themselves continuously move as intact units in the cis → trans direction (termed ‘cisternal progression’), forming at the cis face and being consumed at the trans face, so that no inter-cisternal transport process is required in the anterograde direction. In order to allow the Golgi stack to retain its resident proteins (such as glycosyltransferases) in the face of continuous cisternal turnover, mobile/cisternal progression models also require concomitant retrograde transport (trans → cis or Golgi → ER, or both) of steady-state Golgi resident enzymes, termed ‘cisternal maturation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The strongest evidence for cisternal progression in Golgi stacks is that intrinsically large soluble cargoes such as immature collagen aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>)—which are far too large to be accommodated by COPI transport vesicles—can nonetheless be rapidly transported across the stack. On this basis it has been widely accepted by deductive reasoning, as distinct from direct visualization, that whole cisternae must indeed progress across the stack. This of course does not rule out that parallel processes of COPI vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</xref>) and/or tubule-based transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>) could also occur.</p><p>We sought to further test the cisternal progression paradigm by extending the deductive approach from soluble aggregates to aggregates fixed in the membrane, which should behave identically to soluble aggregates according to cisternal progression models. For this purpose, we designed reversible membrane ‘staples’ loosely modeled on the adhesion protein cadherin, which can adhere cells homo-typically. Cadherins consist of tandem repeats of an adhesive unit that binds itself preferentially in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pokutta and Weis, 2007</xref>). A similar unit, which additionally is controllable with soluble ligands that can enter cells, is the FKBP mutant termed FM, which according to its crystal packing also interacts in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rollins et al., 2000</xref>), with the additional feature that this interaction is disrupted by ligands such as AP21998 even in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests that tandem membrane-anchored repeats of FM domains should mimic cadherin in producing a defined structure (staple) that will reversibly adhere intracellular membranes when it faces the cytoplasm, or in the present application produce intra-lumenal adhesions within Golgi cisternae when the FM repeats are lumenally-oriented. To our surprise, we found that luminal staples and compositionally analogous soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae had entirely different fates. Whereas the soluble aggregates were rapidly transported, the membrane staples remained in place.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and properties of lumenal membrane staples in the ER</title><p>As the basic unit of a lumenal membrane staple we designed a chimeric protein, termed CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, that contained a signal sequence, for its proper insertion and translocation across the ER membrane, fused to 1) a fluorescent protein (GFP or DsRed) to track the protein within the cells by confocal microscopy, 2) four repeats of a domain (FM4) designed to self-aggregate in trans in the absence of the disaggregating drug (AP21998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rollins et al., 2000</xref>), and 3) the CD8 protein, known to be a trans-membrane protein ultimately targeted to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hennecke and Cosson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lavieu et al., 2010</xref>). This CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> protein should initially reside in the ER oriented with its FM4-containing aggregation domain facing the lumen, and so long as it remains non-aggregated (in the presence of AP21998) should be effectively transported to the cell surface. On the other hand, if AP21998 is removed while in the ER—or at any later stage of transport through the Golgi—then intra-lumenal adhesions are expected to form as CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> aggregates homo-typically in trans, like a cadherin. These staples are expected to remain in the ER if they are planar and too large to be packaged into a small COPII vesicle. Various structural models suggest a planar adhesion plaque will form that closely links two sides of ER lamellae or tubules, with an intra-lumenal separation between the stapled membranes that from first principles could vary from 10 to 23 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), depending on the preferred arrangement of trans-aggregating FM4 domains. In particular, however, if repeat FM domains interact like cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Miyaguchi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pokutta and Weis, 2007</xref>) primarily via their most-membrane distant module (i.e., at their tips), then we would expect a membrane separation in the stapled state close to 25 nm (model 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00558.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aggregated-CD8<sub>Lumenal</sub> as an ER staple.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains harbored by CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>.

When tested by SDS-PAGE, the disaggregating drug increased Triton-X100 solubility (without sonication procedure) of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> in cell extracts by a factor 3.9 ± 0.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note that this relatively modest response of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> to the disaggregating-drug (44% Triton X100-solubility after 4 hr treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) can be attributed to the transient transfection procedure. A large portion of the transfected cells showed a very high level of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> over-expression, and did not respond well to the disaggregating drug. As a consequence CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, remained aggregated in the ER even during drug treatment. This also explains the apparent moderate efficiency of transport of disaggregated-CD8 when measured by bulk assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Disaggregated CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, expected to be O-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nilsson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lavieu et al., 2010</xref>), appeared as an isoform with reduced SDS-PAGE motility (* <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, Jacalin, a lectin that binds D-Galactose residues, exclusively precipitates this isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, metabolic radiolabeling experiments showed that staples (∼5.5 hr half-life) were slightly more stable that disaggregated CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (∼2.5 hr half-life) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such stability is enough to guarantee the presence of the staples during numerous complete rounds of anterograde transport either from ER to Golgi or across the entire Golgi (around 20 rounds if we assume that one round of transport takes 15 min). Note that staples persist in the ER and in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) for the same time period (5–6 hr) before degradation by a cellular machinery that is not yet known.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00558.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Re-aggregated CD8<sub>lumenial</sub> as a Golgi staple, and its retention within the Golgi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General procedure: 16°C temperature block and disaggregation/re-aggregation cycles are combined to form the staples in the cis-Golgi and assess the cisternal progression model.

In contrast, the lectin Jacalin, which requires trans-Golgi localized modifications for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Spicer and Schulte, 1992</xref>), did not precipitate CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> at 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), although it did at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To explore the fate of the staples when transport is permitted, we first used a surface biotinylation method and immunofluorescence in intact cells to assess the surface exposure of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> after release of the temperature block to allow anterograde transport to resume. Surprisingly, the CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> re-aggregated in the Golgi at 16°C did not reach the surface and was retained in the Golgi as judged by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, lane 2). Golgi retention of the staples is due to controlled aggregation, because this block to transport was removed when the drug was added back, and CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (disaggregated) now moves from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, lane 3). Note that except when mentioned otherwise, we used as a loading control 10% of the pellet fraction (insoluble fraction after sonication), which is almost free of soluble disaggregated-CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (including the glycosylated-form). Again we attributed the apparent low efficiency of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> transport to transient transfection. Cells that respond to the drug show &gt;50% transport efficiency to the PM after 2 hr chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lane 3), consistently with the efficiency of transport of regular CD8-GFP (FM4-free) reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lavieu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used confocal microscopy to further independently delineate where the staples accumulated within the Golgi at 16°C and their fate during a chase at 20°C which allows anterograde transport to proceed to the trans-Golgi but not beyond. We confirmed that co-expressed cis- and trans-Golgi fluorescent markers (Grasp65 and Golgin97, respectively) could be well discriminated by confocal microscopy and the degree of separation quantified with Pearson’s coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and graph). As a negative control we showed that ER-staples did not co-localize with either the cis- or trans-Golgi markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, 4 and graph). Using the same method we demonstrated that the initial localization of membrane staples Golgi staples formed at 16°C overlaps with the cis- but not the trans-Golgi marker. This co-localization with the cis- but not the trans-Golgi marker persists following warm-up to 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, 2, 3 and graph), implying that the staples do not migrate in the cis → trans direction within the stack, even under conditions where this transport process is expected to resume. Again, the block to transport of the staples is entirely due to aggregation, because adding the drug to disaggregate the staples now allows transport and increased co-localization with the trans-Golgi marker following the warm-up to 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, 2 and graph).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00558.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>cis-Golgi retention of Golgi staples at the light microscopy level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrograph showing HeLa cells co-expressing DsRed-Golgin97, a trans-Golgi marker, with GFP-Golgin97 (upper panel) or Grasp65-GFP, a cis-Golgi marker (lower panel).

So, the staples would be expected to preferentially form in the flattened central regions of a cisterna.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Membrane staples are static at every level of the Golgi stack</title><p>Because large soluble aggregates such as collagens can move forward rapidly across the stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>) it was unexpected to observe that membrane staples remain fixed in cis-most cisternae. We therefore wanted to see if staples deposited in later Golgi cisternae might also be static. To deposit staples throughout the Golgi stack we allowed CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> to enter the Golgi at 20°C in the presence of drug to maintain it in the disaggregated state. Then, the drug was removed at 20°C. Surface biotinylation established that staples formed at 20°C remained at the Golgi even after the cells were warmed up to 37°C for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), similar to the cis-Golgi staples. Electron microscopy revealed that the staples formed at 20°C were present and retained throughout the entire Golgi stack, including the trans-most Golgi cisterna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

To test this, we introduced a well-studied anterograde cargo into cells harboring staples, the VSV-encoded G protein. Specifically, we used a GFP-tagged version of a temperature-sensitive mutant G protein that is retained in the ER at 39°C, but which can exit the ER and be transported to the cell surface via the Golgi when the temperature is subsequently lowered to 32°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Presley et al., 1997</xref>). In these experiments, the staples were labeled with DsRed (DsRed-CD8<sub>luminal</sub>) and co-expressed with GFP-tagged VSV-G. We estimated by confocal microscopy that &gt;95% of the cells were co-transfected. We used the 39°C temperature block to retain VSV-G-GFP in the ER, then a fraction of both VSV-G-GFP and disaggregated DsRed-CD8<sub>luminal</sub> (+drug) were partially released into the Golgi at 16°C, prior to re-aggregating CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> (−drug) at 16°C into cis-Golgi staples. Only then was the temperature raised to 32°C for 2 hr to test the transport of VSV-G-GFP (the fraction localized into the stapled cis-Golgi and the fraction that was still into the ER). Surface biotinylation showed that the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells that harbored staples in their Golgi was 91 ± 12% of the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells harboring a normal Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We used photo-activatable GFP-tagged VSV-G (PAGFP-VSV-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002</xref>]) to activate a cohort of protein within a Golgi area to enable us to measure the release of VSV-G from that same Golgi complex. The rate of the release (half-time ∼ 5 min) of PA-GFP-VSV-G from even long-term (4 hr) stapled Golgi was indistinguishable from that measured from a non-stapled Golgi identified with a red-tagged Golgi marker (ST-RFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This observation and the fact that stapled-Golgi remain properly stacked established that stapled-Golgi is fully functional for transport.</p><p>Then we asked if Golgi-staples could interfere with the transport of endogenous large cargo. We used Saos-2 cells, which secrete endogenously produced collagen-I. After transfection with GFP-CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>, Saos-2 cells were incubated at 20°C in the presence of the disaggregating drug, followed by drug removal to allow the positioning of the staples within the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> upper panel, lane 1,2 show the glycosylated form of CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>). 2 hr after stapling the Golgi membranes, the culture media was removed and cells were incubated at 37°C in the presence of fresh media containing ascorbate to release collagen-I from the ER. After a 2 hr chase the amount of newly secreted collagen-I was determined by TCA precipitation/immunobloting procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Cells harboring stapled-Golgi for 2 hr showed 92.5 ± 13% of freshly secreted collagen-I when compared to cells harboring normal Golgi (set to 100%). This suggests that, as reported above with for VSV-G, anterograde transport of Collagen-I is not altered when staples are positioned within the Golgi. To rigorously assess if Golgi staples had only minor effect on secretion, we further tested the rate of transport of collagen-I and MMP2, two proteins secreted by Saos-2 cells. The kinetics of secretion for both proteins did not show any robust differences whether the Golgi apparatus was stapled or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, this suggests that the amount of staples that is loaded in the Golgi membranes during the re-aggregation procedure does not poison the anterograde transport function of the Golgi.</p><p>To further test if Golgi staples interfere with the behavior of Golgi membranes, we assessed the redistribution of Golgi resident enzymes into the ER under BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>). Redistribution of Golgi enzymes into the ER was observed whether Golgi staples were present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that consistently with the moderate disaggregation reported above (44% solubilization in Triton X100), some aggregates remained in the ER (arrows <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These ER-remaining aggregates did not perturb the behavior of the Golgi resident enzymes (Golgi targeting and BFA-redistribution).</p><p>Importantly, FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) showed that staples (localized either within the Golgi or within the ER) readily diffuse within the cisternal membranes and do not perturb the diffusion of Golgi resident enzymes; in fact, Golgi-staples diffused only slightly more slowly than disaggregated CD8<sub>lumenal</sub> at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This would explain in a satisfying manner why the essential functions of the Golgi (and ER) such as transport and glycosylation are not perturbed by the presence of the staples, since these behave like any cargo or resident protein within the membrane, as further evidenced by the re-distribution of staples (like any other Golgi cargo or resident enzyme) to the ER as a result of BFA treatment.</p><p>Retrograde transport is also a major aspect of Golgi function, and it would potentially be of interest to investigate if staples interfere with such function. While we cannot presently rule out this caveat, even if retrograde transport were blocked it would not diminish our conclusion that anterograde transport of both small and large cargo (next section) can occur at normal speeds without movement of cisternae in the stack.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Soluble aggregates are transported through stacks in which staples remain</title><p>Previously, we found that soluble aggregates that are compositionally similar to the staples (the main difference being that they were not membrane-anchored) rapidly move forward through the Golgi, analogous to collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Volchuk et al., 2000</xref>). We noted that these soluble aggregates were concentrated at the rims of the Golgi cisternae, analogous to collagens. Given the prima facia contradiction between our current observation of immobile staples and our prior observation of mobile soluble aggregates composed of virtually the same protein, we repeated the earlier studies and compared the fates of soluble aggregates and staples in the same cells.</p><p>We first asked whether lumenally-expressed soluble FM4 (FM4-hGH) and membrane-bound FM4 proteins (CD8<sub>lumenal</sub>) co-aggregate in the cell. This would be expected because they share the same homotypic adhesion FM modules. As expected, when the two FM-containing proteins were present in the ER they were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, when these same proteins were disaggregated and allowed to leave the ER and then re-aggregated for 1 hr in the cis-Golgi at 16°C, or even further in the Golgi stack at 20°C, the Golgi-modified forms of these same proteins were no longer co-immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary homo-aggregates constituted of soluble cargo (hGH) were efficiently formed even after re-aggregation at 16°C or 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Whereas the Golgi retained the staple protein it released the soluble aggregates to the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This biochemical result confirms yet again that hetero-aggregates (composed of staples and soluble FM proteins) were not formed efficiently within the Golgi, confirming by yet another approach that the two FM proteins aggregate separately within the Golgi cisternae (even when using a 2:1 membrane:soluble protein ratio).</p><p>Electron microscopy was also used to follow the fate of the two types of aggregates. When aggregates accumulated in the cis-Golgi are allowed to move anterograde through but not exit the Golgi following warm-up to 20°C, ≈75% of the staples, as expected, remain at the cis-face of the Golgi, whereas ≈75% of the soluble aggregates are transported to the opposite, trans-face of the same Golgi stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and graph).</p><p>We conclude that the anterograde transport process permits large soluble aggregates to be carried forward between cisternae that are immobile.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Does the presence of staples perturb anterograde transport? On the one hand, because staples freely diffuse like any other membrane constituent it is hard to imagine how a moderate amount of staples would broadly perturb Golgi transport or function such as glycosylation, and there is no positive evidence from our studies that they do so. On the other hand, because they span and link between two sides of the cisterna, it is easy to see why staples should remain in the thin centers of the cisternae, far from the dilated rims (whose width is too great to accommodate the staples) where transport vesicles bud, and also why staples would be sterically excluded from budding COPI or other vesicles if they did occasionally reach a rim, and thus would remain within the cisterna.</p><p>With this in mind, our findings can be simply summarized as follows: 1) membrane staples localize to the central regions of Golgi cisternae where they segregate from large soluble aggregates which mainly concentrate at the dilated rims; and 2) membrane staples remain in place as anterograde transport occurs, whereas large soluble aggregates and small cargo are transported at normal rates.</p><p>The obvious explanation of the above is that while the cisternae in the stack (containing staples mainly in their central regions) are static, the rims of cisternae—mainly containing the soluble aggregates—are mobile (at least on the average) in the anterograde direction, a process we term ‘rim progression’.</p><p>However, the unique nature of the artificial staples prevents us from definitively concluding that ‘pure maturation’ does not occur in region of the Golgi stacks that are depleted of staples. Although we established by using broad sets of assays that anterograde transport through stapled Golgi is not altered, we cannot rule out that staples introduced, non-obvious, minor side effects on Golgi.</p><p>It would be very easy to mis-interpret rim progression as cisternal progression if the only marker being studied is in the rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>). In retrospect, the principal evidence for cisternal progression in Golgi stacks was the mobility of large aggregates like collagens that are located to the rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>). But in retrospect a stricter interpretation of that data would have been to conclude that the ‘at least some portions’ of the cisterna containing the collagen aggregates (i.e., the rims) are mobile, without reaching any conclusion with respect to the rest of the cisterna. A striking feature of the collagen data is that while the majority of the aggregates are indeed rapidly transported, a sizable minority (∼20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>]) remains in the Golgi cisternae, mainly in the centers of the cisternae, consistent with our results and interpretation.</p><p>We do not know how the rims of otherwise stable stacks progress, but the most likely possibility would be cycles of fission and fusion that are known to take place in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pfeffer, 2010</xref>). Pfeffer has considered how this could be organized in the cis → trans direction by known Rab cascades in the Cisternal Progenitor model, which could well be the basis for the transport of rims dilated with aggregates. We would imagine that after fission a transiently separated rim would nonetheless remain in register in the stack because its membrane would still be engaged in stacking/tethering interactions. Pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Volchuk et al., 2000</xref>) showed the appearance of detached rims closely-associated with the edges of the stack that transiently appeared during the transport of soluble aggregates (which we termed mega-vesicles at the time). Retention of rims in transit would facilitate orderly rim progression.</p><p>To the extent that the bulk of a Golgi stack is static on the time scale of anterograde transport, this reduces the quantitative demand on retrograde transport of Golgi resident proteins and the need for cisternal maturation. In budding yeast, where cisternae generally do not stack, the process of cisternal maturation is well documented, though formal proof that anterograde cargo is present in maturing cisternae is still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>). We do not wish to conclude that cisternal maturation does not occur in the stacked Golgi of complex plants and animals, or that it may not be important in re-assembly of the Golgi after cell division, only that it does not appear to be required on the time scale of biosynthetic protein transport in interphase in stacked Golgi.</p><p>How are smaller cargoes that do not create dilated rims transported across the Golgi if the cisternae are static? We propose that rim progression is dedicated to large soluble aggregates that due to physical constraints are forced into the rims away from adhesive centers of cisternae, and differs mechanistically from vesicle budding. COPI vesicles are known to bud extensively from the rims of Golgi cisternae at every level and contain–in addition to retrograde-directed cargo–anterograde-directed cargo such as insulin, albumin, and VSV-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rothman, 2010</xref>); so this biochemically well-understood pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Popoff et al., 2011</xref>) would seem to be the principal contender. There may well be other, parallel pathways depending on physiological state, specifically budding/fusing tubules, which have been observed especially under conditions of protein over-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ladinsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our findings, along with other evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>), point to a broad division of the Golgi cisternae into two functionally distinct domains: the centers and the rims. The rims specialize in exit and entry into the stack and are dynamic, while the centers are static and adherent to form the stack and specialize in biosynthesis and processing. Much remains to be learned about how these domains segregate and organize the multitude of tasks associated with Golgi function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, United States) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco).

We now clarify the minor concerns that were raised during peer review.</p><p><italic>1) There is no known cargo of this type and that has to be clearly stated.

Please state the half life of the collagen compared with the staples in stapled cells to try to address this point</italic>.</p><p>We have shown that the rate of secretion of collagen-I and MMP2 are unchanged whether or not staples are pre-positioned in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Since there is no retention of collagen-I, there is no reason to expect any change in the lifetime of this protein. On a more technical point of view, how can one measure the intracellular lifetime of a protein, which is efficiently secreted?</p><p>We now state in the revised manuscript that the unique nature of the artificial staples prevents us from definitively concluding that “pure maturation” does not occur in regions of the Golgi stacks that are depleted of staples. Although we established by using broad sets of assays that anterograde transport through stapled Golgi is not altered, we cannot rule out that staples introduced other, non-obvious, minor side effects on Golgi membranes.</p><p><italic>2) Some staples may be in cis and others trans. This should be mentioned in the text</italic>.</p><p>Do you mean cis-Golgi vs Trans-Golgi localization or cis-interaction vs trans-interaction?</p><p>Concerning the localization within the Golgi we combined biochemistry (lectin precipitation), confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and immuno-electron microcopy to establish that staples formed in the cis-Golgi remain in the cis Golgi.</p><p>Concerning the mode of interaction, although we visualized only staples resulting from trans-interaction, as proved by the artificial stacking of ER membranes harboring cytosolic staples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>), we cannot rule out that staples may form in cis (on the same membrane bilayer) when physical constraints are favorable. This is now mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, it was not clear that the collagen secretion was due to new collagen versus previously secreted collagen.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, staples were formed for two hours and then secretion of collagen-I was tested. At the beginning of the chase (t=0), old media was removed and replaced with fresh media. After two hours the media was collected and submitted to TCA precipitation. This is now clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> showed the rate of release of collagen-I (and MMP2), and clearly showed the absence of collagen-I in the media at t=0.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and related text: the experiments assume the cells are co-transfected.

The amount of plasmid used for the soluble protein was constant, whereas the amount of plasmid for the membrane protein was increased by a factor 3. Intensity of membrane protein expressed alone was set to 1. Using this method we showed that using a 1:1 TMD:Sol plasmid ratio increases the signal by a factor 1.9 (in theory a 2 fold increase is expected). When the TMD:Sol plasmid ratio is 3:1, the signal increased by a factor 2.8, suggesting a 1.8:1 TMD:Sol protein ratio. This ≅2 protein ratio is now reported in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
