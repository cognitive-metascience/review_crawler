Here, we test the hypothesis that inter-individual microbiota variation can arise solely from differences in the order and timing by which the gut is colonized early in life. Experiments in which mice were inoculated in sequence either with two complex seed communities or a cocktail of four bacterial strains and a seed community revealed that colonization order influenced both the outcome of community assembly and the ecological success of individual colonizers. Historical contingency and priority effects also occurred in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is not a major contributor to these processes. In conclusion, this study established a measurable effect of colonization history on gut microbiota assembly in a model in which host and environmental factors were strictly controlled, illuminating a potential cause for the high levels of unexplained individuality in host-associated microbial communities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36521.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The microbial community living in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, also known as the gut microbiome, is essential for health. Disturbances of this community can lead to chronic diseases. Each person has a unique and stable community of gut microbes that is as personal as a ‘fingerprint’. Studies have shown that an individual’s genetics, diet, environment, lifestyle, and physiological state all make small contributions to the variation of the gut microbiome among individuals. However, less than 30% of this variation can be explained, and even identical twins, who share the same genetics and often diets and lifestyle, have distinct gut microbiomes. This suggests that other unknown factors likely shape these microbial communities too.</p><p>The microbial communities and the gut make up an ecosystem that is likely subject to many of the same ecological rules that govern ecosystems like rainforests or coral reefs. Yet many studies have overlooked the role of ecology in shaping the gut microbiota. For example, it is well known that the order in which organisms arrive in a community may influence how they interact and assemble into communities. It is possible that the order bacteria are introduced into the gastrointestinal tract of babies early in life may also change the make up of their gut microbiome, and thus introduce the variation that is currently unaccounted for.</p><p>Now, Martínez et al. show that the first types of bacteria to colonize the gut of mice have a lasting impact on their microbiome. In the experiments, genetically identical mice were housed under exactly the same conditions in airtight plastic bubbles. This allowed the scientists to control when the young mice first encountered specific microbes and microbe communities. Distinct microbial communities collected from different adult mice were introduced into the gastrointestinal tract of the young mice in sequence. Martínez et al. found that the microbes they introduced into the young mice first had the strongest influence on their gut microbiome at the end of the experiments.</p><p>When the experiments were repeated with a cocktail of four different bacteria the results were similar – the earlier arrivals showed enhanced colonization and had the biggest influence on the microbe community. This suggests that the timing of bacterial arrival in the gut is very important to shape the gut microbiome. Since it is highly random and unpredictable in real-life, and likely to differ even among twins, it could explain why the gut microbiome can be so unique. More studies are needed to understand how antibiotics, formula feeding, or cesarean sections affect gut microbiota early in life, and consequently health. This may help scientists develop better ways to influence the microbiota to improve health, for example, by introducing beneficial microbes early in life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>community ecology</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>colonisation history</kwd><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus</italic></kwd><kwd>priority effect</kwd><kwd>historical contingency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM099525-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benson</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Danial</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P20GM104320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benson</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramer-Tait</surname><given-names>Amanda E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments in ex-germ-free mice establish a measurable effect of colonization history on gut microbiota assembly, illuminating a potential cause for the high levels of unexplained individuality in host-associated microbial communities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human gastrointestinal microbiota makes essential contributions to host metabolic, physiological, and immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujimura et al., 2010</xref>), and aberrations in its structure contribute to pathologies and chronic disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houghteling and Walker, 2015</xref>). Microbiome assembly begins at birth and undergoes dynamic processes influenced by factors such as birth method, feeding method, and antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich et al., 2016</xref>). Once established, the community is dominated by a core set of species characteristic to the host species and is resilient to perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martínez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schloissnig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 2014a</xref>). Despite the profound importance of the host-microbiome symbiosis for human health, the gut microbiota is characterized by a high degree of variation in composition and relative abundance of community members, which is referred to as ß-diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huttenhower, 2012</xref>). This individuality can relate to functions important for health (e.g. the bio-conversion and activation of dietary compounds and drugs), and it is likely that misconfigurations play a role in disease predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Vatanen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kostic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016</xref>). Given these associations, a critical need exists to define the fundamental ecological principles that govern and regulate gut microbiome structure and the mechanisms that drive microbiome variation across hosts.</p><p>To date, research aimed at identifying the factors that cause microbiome variation has focused largely on host genetics and diet. Host genetic variation has an established role in driving β-diversity in both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson et al., 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Turpin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and a subset of fecal bacterial taxa has been shown to be partly heritable and/or associated with host single-nucleotide polymorphisms or quantitative trait loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Turpin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson, 2016</xref>). However, most taxa do not show any significant heritability, and for those that do, heritability estimates are generally low compared to other heritable traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodrich et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, genetic studies in humans show a low degree of repeatability, with only a small number of microbiome genome-wide associations being reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Turpin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodrich et al., 2017</xref>). Even the combined effects of host genotype and dietary variables often do not account for the overall variation in a given taxonomic ‘trait' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leamy et al., 2014</xref>). The rather low contribution of host genetics to microbiome variation and the lack of heritability across many taxa is reflected in studies on monozygotic twins, which although slightly more similar than dizygotic twins, exhibit a substantial degree of individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodrich et al., 2014</xref>). In mice, the effect of diet on microbiome structure has been shown to exceed the contribution of host genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmody et al., 2015</xref>). However, the contribution of diet to human microbiome variation was estimated to account for only around 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and standardizing the diet did not reduce β-diversity across study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2014b</xref>). Although additional factors such as lifestyle (e.g. smoking), host physiology (e.g. age), and medication contribute to microbiome variation, non-genetic and genetic factors each account for approximately 10% of the variation in gut microbiota and thus fail to explain the majority of the inter-individual diversity that is observed in human cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Falony et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rothschild et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>When attempting to understand compositional features of the gut microbiota, one must consider that the studies performed to date have not accounted for the full range of ecological processes predicted to shape community diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter, 2015</xref>). Factors such as genotype, diet, smoking, medication, and host physiology all contribute to a deterministic process (or ‘selection’) that impacts diversity through niche-based mechanisms, thus selecting for specific taxa based on fitness differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vellend, 2010</xref>). However, according to ecological theory, variation among local communities is not only shaped by selection but also by historical and neutral processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavender-Bares et al., 2009</xref>), which can only be described in probabilistic terms and include stochastic events such as ecological drift that occur randomly with respect to species fitness differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubbell, 2001</xref>). With respect to historical processes, ecological theory holds that the timing and order of species immigration during community assembly can cause variation in the structure and function of communities, or historical contingency, through priority effects and monopolization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Meester et al., 2016</xref>). These effects could be paramount in shaping microbiomes as community assembly is initiated for each newborn since mammals are born germ-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perez-Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>). After birth, the offspring gradually acquires a microbial population, and community assembly occurs in parallel to host immunological, physiological, and metabolic maturation, with reciprocal interactions between microbes and host postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrieta et al., 2014</xref>). It is increasingly recognized that an early-life ‘window of opportunity' is a critical period for both microbiome assembly and microbiome-driven host development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lafores-Lapointe and Arrieta, 2017</xref>). Priority effects have been suggested to influence gut microbiota assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>), and circumstantial evidence as well as the characteristics of the adult gut microbiota (stability and resilience despite pronounced inter-individual variation) are consistent with a combined effect of niche-related (deterministic) and early-life historical processes on community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walter and Ley, 2011</xref>). However, experimental evidence for the importance of colonization history in the gut microbiota assembly is lacking.</p><p>In this study, we employed a carefully controlled experimental model that allowed us to elucidate the importance of colonization history in early-life gut microbiota assembly by varying arrival order and timing of complex seed microbial communities in previously germ-free mice. The effect of arrival timing on the colonization success of specific gut bacteria and its impact on assembly trajectory of the resident community was also assessed. In both approaches, the influence of the host’s adaptive immune system in causing priority effects and historical contingency was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history</title><p>To determine whether colonization history affects early-life gut microbiota assembly, experiments were first conducted to test the importance of arrival order when colonizing germ-free C57BL/6 mice with two compositionally distinct complex cecal microbial communities obtained from adult mice (<italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>). Experiments consisted of three different treatment groups. In two of the treatments, donor communities were sequentially inoculated in alternating order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with one treatment group being inoculated first with community A and second with B (group A/B) and the second treatment group being first inoculated with community B followed by community A (group B/A). In a third treatment group, both donor communities were inoculated at each time point (group AB/AB). The age of 10 days was chosen for the first inoculation as it was the earliest age at which pups could be gavaged without jeopardizing their health or parental care. At weaning (21 days), parent mice were sacrificed and their ceca collected (samples Parents A, Parents B, and Parents AB), while offspring mice were separated by sex.

The second donor was a wild mouse caught in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weldon et al., 2015</xref>) (Donor B; referred to as ‘wild-caught’). These allopatric mouse populations differed markedly in gut microbiota composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lagkouvardos et al., 2016</xref>). Prior to the actual experiments, the microbial communities from donors A and B were established in germ-free C57BL/6 mice in our facility to standardize the inocula. Cecal bacterial diversity became only marginally reduced in recipient mice 4 weeks after colonization during the standardization when compared to the wild donors, and the majority (85% for donor A and 82% of donor B) of the bacterial types could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, an analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities revealed that recipient microbiota clustered tightly with that of the donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, these analyses showed that a large proportion of the microbiota from wild mice can be established in germ-free mice under laboratory conditions with similar taxonomic distributions and proportions.</p><p>The experimental model has several unique advantages in that it recapitulates ‘real life’ conditions during early-life microbiota assembly while keeping ecological variables strictly controlled. The first colonization was done in 10-day-old germ-free mice, which resemble newborn mice as they are devoid of microbes and not yet fully developed, allowing the study of gut microbiota assembly during a time window critical for both microbiota assembly and host postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoop et al., 2017</xref>). The parent mice become hereby fully colonized, which allows vertical and horizontal transmission of bacteria (i.e. through coprophagia) to the offspring mice up until weaning when they become fully mature. From an ecological perspective, the model is uniquely suitable to disentangle the relative importance of historical processes in community assembly. First, community assembly at local scales (mice) occurs under standardized conditions that included the use of inbred mice under the same husbandry regimen, thereby avoiding variation in deterministic (niche-related) ecological factors. Second, although complex undefined microbiomes were used, the regional species pool, which can profoundly influence the ecological processes that determine community structure at local scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chase and Myers, 2011</xref>), including priority effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>), is standardized (and to a large degree defined through sequencing). This was achieved by the administration of aliquots of the same inoculum to mice via gavage (a highly efficient method of transmission) and the maintenance of mice in isolators that prevented acquisition of additional members. Consequently, colonization order is the only experimental variable in the model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gut microbiota of recipient mice shows higher diversity when compared to donors</title><p>Analysis of donor and recipient microbiota showed that 99.5% of the bacterial types found in the donor microbiomes were also found in the recipient mice, while 93.4% of the types (adding up to 99.3% of the total sequences) in the recipient mice were also detected in the donors. These findings indicate an almost complete transfer of the communities from donors to recipients without an expansion of minority members of the donor communities in the recipient mice.

The taxonomic distribution of these bacterial types mirrored the overall community profile, showing that no particular phylum was specifically more affected by colonization history. The fact that colonization order impacts bacterial types but not higher taxonomic levels points to the importance of competitive interactions as a major mechanism driving the observations.</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms by which priority effects emerge, it was assessed whether bacterial types affected by colonization order were overrepresented when inoculated first or overrepresented when introduced second. If a bacterial type is overrepresented when inoculated first, it would occur either through niche-preemption, monopolization (the evolutionary process by which early arrivals to a new patch adapt to the local conditions, gaining an advantage over later colonists) or niche-modification that provides an advantage to the earlier colonizer, all of which are inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>).

In the other two cases (Type_4996 vs. Type_4997, and Type_4297 vs. Type_4299), one type excludes the other type when introduced together, but earlier colonization can overcome this fitness difference and give an advantage to the type that displays a lower degree of fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Previous work aiming to elucidate the factors that drive diversity patterns focused mostly on deterministic processes while neglecting stochastic ecological elements, that according to theory, are implicated in shaping community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vellend, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavender-Bares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>). By establishing that historical processes can drive β-diversity of the gut microbiota in a setting where host genetics, diet, and the regional species pool are standardized, this study demonstrated that individuality in gut microbiota composition can arise solely from a variation of the timing by which microbes are acquired. Although the relative importance of assembly history appears small in our experiments (and less than that of dispersal limitation), effects of species arrival history in real life are predicted to be amplified over time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>). Our finding that differences in arrival timing by only four members by a few days can produce a measurable alteration in the long-term trajectory in the development of the community is therefore especially relevant. Given that there are hundreds if not thousands of species that assemble into gut microbiomes, most of whose acquisition is likely to some degree stochastic, historical events have the potential to add up to contribute substantially to individuality of gut microbiomes. Our findings therefore have important implications on our understanding of how microbiotas assemble. They further illuminate the need to develop statistical models and algorithmic approaches that could be incorporated into existing algorithms for population-driven analyses (e.g. GWAS and MWAS) to accurately measure the relative contributions of ecological factors, host genetic variation, and other deterministic factors in large-scale population-based studies.</p><p>Although our findings clearly establish the importance of colonization history in gut microbiota assembly and suggest an importance of inhibitory priority effects, they provided limited insight into the exact mechanisms that cause historical contingency. Priority effects can arise through niche preemption or modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>), or through in situ evolution by which earlier colonizers adapt to gain an advantage over later colonizers through monopolization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Meester et al., 2016</xref>). These processes might also be impacted by interactions across domains of life (bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea) and even bacteriophages. Future studies should therefore employ metagenomic sequencing and ‘trait-based’ approaches with careful consideration of the interactions between the functional, taxonomic, and genetic features of both the colonists and the assembled microbiomes in an attempt to determine the relative importance of niche-preemption, niche-modification (including inter-domain interactions), and monopolization in historical contingency. In addition, arrival timing of microbes might also change the trajectory of gut microbiota assembly by inducing developmental, physiological, and immunological changes in the host that then in themselves shape the microbiota. In other words, the timing of species immigration might not only impact microbe-microbe interactions that would qualify as classical priority effects, but also reciprocal interactions of microbes and the host. Future studies should attempt to determine to what degree the latter contributes to historical contingency in gut microbiota assembly. If relevant, host factors and host-microbe interactions would have to be incorporated into ecological theory in order for its application to be useful for our understanding of host-associated microbial communities.</p><p>In this study, the role of a key inducible host factor in historical contingency, the adaptive immune system, was systematically analyzed. We hypothesized, like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koskella et al., 2017</xref>), that ecological consequences similar to those of priority effects would arise through early colonizers gaining an advantage through the induction of tolerance by adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoop et al., 2017</xref>). However, our comparisons of WT and <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice indicated that the importance of historical processes was, with few exceptions, not reduced in the absence of adaptive immunity, and nearly all the taxa affected by colonization order in WT mice were also among those affected in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Moreover, the overall effect of colonization history was actually amplified in most measurements in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. A potential explanation for this finding is a higher relative contribution of selection (deterministic processes) in <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to their WT counterparts. Ex-germ-free <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice develop inflammation in the intestinal epithelial lining in response to bacterial colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>), and this inflammatory milieu could exert a higher selective pressure on the bacterial community. Stronger selection is predicted to increase competition, which in itself increases the importance of priority effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>), providing an explanation for the impact of sequence of arrival on the population of <italic>L. johnsonii</italic> and <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> but not WT mice. In summary, it appears that for some specific species, the adaptive immune system might alter niches, allowing, for example, donor-B-specific lineages to persist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), a finding only obtained with WT but not <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, most of our observations do not support the hypothesis that interactions between microbes and the adaptive immune system are a major contributor to historical contingency. Instead, our analysis on microbe-microbe associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggests ecological interactions such as inhibitory priority effects and potentially niche-preemption as the dominant processes. Future studies are necessary to determine if additional inducible host factors (innate immune functions, defensins, mucus, etc.) constitute a mechanism by which arrival timing of microbes causes historical contingency in gut microbiota assembly.</p><p>Although our understanding on how ecological theory can be applied to the gut microbiome is still vastly incomplete, our findings contribute to an emerging historical perspective that could explain the spatial and temporal patterns of diversity described for the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walter and Ley, 2011</xref>). The seemingly paradoxical characteristics of the gut microbiota, namely resilience and high intra-individual stability despite large inter-individual variability, are consistent with a view in which stochastic historical events such as chance colonization, random extinction, ecological drift, and monopolization, in combination with niche pre-emption and modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>), drive inter-individual variability. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in which colonizers continue to adapt to the niche opportunities that arise during the dynamic assembly process ensure that communities end up to be, despite their unpredictable configurations, composed of highly adapted members that stably occupy niches and display resilience and colonization resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter, 2015</xref>). Since some level of stochasticity during microbiota assembly would be expected to occur even among monozygotic twins, this framework provides an explanation for their surprisingly high inter-individual microbiota variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodrich et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, low dispersal decreases rates of immigration, which is predicted to enhance priority effects as average time spans between early and later colonizers are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukami, 2015</xref>), consequently increasing β-diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubbell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chase and Myers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosindell et al., 2012</xref>). These concepts may provide one explanation for the higher microbiota individuality in people living in industrialized societies (which likely have lower levels of dispersal due to sanitation) when compared to non-industrialized populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martínez et al., 2015</xref>). However, although these concepts are in agreement with much of the observational data on microbiomes, the findings in our study derive from experiments testing only two communities and four specific members, and it will require additional mechanistic, observational, and theoretical studies in a variety of contexts to validate the importance of historical perspective of gut microbiota assembly. Specifically, future research should be targeted at determining to what extent general concepts of ecological theory can be applied to host-associated microbial communities.</p><p>Apart from contributing to our basic understanding of gut microbial ecology, this study provides a critical foundation for future experiments that test the impact of colonization order in disease predisposition and whether assembly history can be systematically influenced. Given the importance of historical contingency for gut microbiota assembly, clinical and medical interventions early in life (e.g. antibiotics, C-sections, formula feeding) are likely to have longer lasting consequences, driving not only inter-individual differences but potentially also aberrant patterns of colonization that could potentially be prevented by an adjustment of clinical practices to avoid priority effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dominguez-Bello et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings are also relevant for the development of strategies to modulate microbiomes. As the understanding of the health-promoting attributes of gut bacteria continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olle, 2013</xref>), it will be important to evaluate how they can be established more permanently. Once assembled, the gut microbiota is extremely resilient to therapeutic modulations, dietary changes and moderate doses of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martínez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), and colonization resistance constitutes a major barrier to introducing beneficial microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walter et al., 2018</xref>). Our results confirmed recent findings in humans that bacterial strains can be stably established in a climax community if closely related species are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maldonado-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>). However, if competitors are present, stable persistence cannot be achieved. More permanent persistence can be achieved if microbes are introduced early in life. In addition, the findings demonstrated that early introduction of just a few species can divert the entire trajectory of the microbiota. If such shifts can be introduced reproducibly, then early colonizers could be selected to deliberately control microbiome assembly to obtain predictable outcomes. Although there will likely always be strong stochastic elements in microbiome acquisition, priority effects will favor bacteria that are introduced first, thereby providing an opportunity to potentially prevent aberrant microbiomes, and by doing so, dysbiosis-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse husbandry</title><p>Germ-free C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (which lack mature B and T lymphocytes) mice were born and reared in flexible film isolators and maintained under gnotobiotic conditions at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

The ceca selected corresponded to i) a mouse originating from a population of mice derived from a wild mouse population sampled in the Massif Central region of France in 2009 and was subsequently housed at the breeding facility of the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Biology for three generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), referred to in the present manuscript as donor community A, and ii) from a wild mouse caught in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weldon et al., 2015</xref>), which is referred to as donor community B.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation and standardization of donor inocula</title><p>To prepare inocula, frozen ceca were introduced into an anaerobic chamber (Bactron600 Shel Lab, Sheldon Manufacturing INC., Cornelius, OR) to avoid oxygen exposure, and slurries were made by suspending cecal contents in pre-reduced, sterile PBS with 10% glycerol (pH 7) at a dilution of 1:10 and stored at −80°C in aliquots of 500 μl to avoid freeze-thawing. To generate standardized donor cecal inocula, the cecal communities of the wild mice was transferred into germ-free C57BL/6J mice reared at the UNL’s Animal Research Facility. This standardization was performed to i) obtain larger volumes of inocula needed for the experiments, ii) determine whether a wild mouse microbiota could be successfully established in C57BL/6J mice under laboratory conditions, and iii) standardize the inocula to the same environmental conditions (food, oxygen exposure at gavage, environmental changes due to laboratory conditions, etc.). To establish microbiomes in mice, 100 μl of either donor A or B were orally gavaged into 8 week old C57BL/6J mice (N = 8 for donor A, and N = 5 for donor B) housed in separate flexible plastic isolators. Four weeks after gavage, mice were euthanized and their ceca harvested. Ceca were excised inside a laminar flow hood with aseptic techniques, and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cecal slurries of the two donor microbiomes were obtained after pooling ceca from recipient mice under anaerobic conditions and homogenizing contents with sterile, pre-reduced PBS with 10% glycerol (1:10 ratio) as described above. Donor microbiomes were stored in 500 μl aliquots and kept frozen at −80°C until further use. DNA extraction was done according to Martínez and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al., 2010</xref>), and sequencing of the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krumbeck, 2015</xref>) was done at the University of Minnesota Sequencing Center. Analysis of the 16S rRNA data was done as explained below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sequential inoculation of two complex cecal communities into germ-free mice</title><p>The first set of experiments was designed to systematically modify colonization order of two donor cecal microbiomes (A and B; see supplementary file for additional information on how donor inocula were selected and prepared), through three experimental treatment groups. In two of the treatments, donor communities were sequentially inoculated in alternating order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where community A was inoculated first and B second (group A/B) and where community B was inoculated first and A second (group B/A). In a third treatment, both donor communities were inoculated at each time point (AB/AB). Either germ-free C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were inoculated at 10 ± 2 days after birth by oral gavage (first inoculation), and at 36 ± 2 days after birth (second inoculation). Inoculation by oral gavage consisted of introducing 50 μl of cecal contents into the mouth of each pup using a small-sized syringe. The leftover inoculum was deposited on the parents’ fur (for 10-day-old mice), on the mouse’s fur (for 36-day-old mice), and on the cage bedding. For the AB/AB group, separate vials containing donor A and B aliquots were introduced into the isolators and mixed right before administering to the mice. Pups were weaned at 21 ± 1 days after birth, and the parents were euthanized to collect their ceca for microbiome analysis; pups were placed into separate cages according to sex. On day 78 after birth (±1 day), mice were euthanized and their ceca harvested and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction. Mice were maintained in isolators for the entire duration of the experiment, with separate isolators for different treatments and genetic backgrounds (WT or <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>). Each experiment was done in duplicate (N ≥ 5 per replicate with mice from one or two litters).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Modification of colonization order of specific bacterial colonizers in ex-germ-free mice</title><p>A second set of experiments was performed to specifically modify colonization timing of a cocktail of four bacterial strains during gut microbiota assembly relative to that of a complex microbiota. Four strains autochthonous to the mouse gut microbiota were selected: <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> Lpuph1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oh et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Lactobacillus johnsonii</italic> DPPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> RJ2H1 (a strain isolated from laboratory mice at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; NCBI accession number PRJNA78795), and <italic>Clostridium cocleatum</italic> ATCC 29902<sup>T </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaneuchi et al., 1979</xref>). Growth conditions of the individual strains in the cocktail mix is detailed in the section below. The donor cecal inocula used in these experiments were prepared from ceca harvested from 8-week-old conventionally raised C3H/HeN mice (5 mice of the same litter) housed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, as described above. Germ-free C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were maintained inside independent, flexible-film isolators until inoculation with C3H/HeN ceca donor microbiota at 10 ± 1 days after birth. At that time, litters of pups and their parents were transferred to individually ventilated cages (IVC) mounted on racks with positive airflow until the end of the experiments. Inoculation of all mice with specific colonizer strains or cecal inocula was done by orally gavaging the pups 50 μl of cell suspension (see previous section), except for 5-day-old mice for which a drop of the inoculum was gently placed on pups’ snouts which they leaked, thus avoiding over-handling of the pups and potentially hurting them. This technique proved successful for inoculation of the four specific strains in the mix, as seen in the consistent detection of all four strains in fecal samples. Group I received the mix of specific colonizers at day 5 (while in the isolator and before being moved to the IVC rack and receiving the donor microbiota); Group II at day 15 (5 days after receiving the donor microbiota); and Group III at day 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Approximately 10<sup>8</sup> cells per mouse were administrated for each strain, with the exception of <italic>C. cocleatum</italic> (around 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mouse). Fecal samples were collected from each mouse right before the first inoculation (same day), and weekly throughout a 5-week period post-inoculation. For Group I experiments, the first fecal sample was collected from the parents instead of the pups due to their young age (5 days); the remaining five fecal collections were obtained from each pup. For Groups II and III, all fecal pellets were collected directly from the pups/adult animals. Mice were weaned at day 21, at which time parents were removed from the cage, euthanized, and their ceca harvested as previously described. Mice were euthanized at day 78 (±1 day), and their ceca collected for DNA extraction, quantification of the specific strains, and microbiota analysis. Each experiment was done in duplicate (N &gt; 5 in each replicate, from one or two litters).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Growth conditions of strains used as specific colonizers in cocktail</title><p>All bacterial strains were grown under anaerobic conditions at 37°C. <italic>L. reuteri</italic> and <italic>L. johnsoniii</italic> were propagated in MRS media (BD Difco Microbiology, Houston, TX) supplemented with 10 g/L of maltose and 5 g/L of fructose (mMRS), while <italic>C. cocleatum</italic> ATCC 29902 was grown in Reinforced Clostridium media (Oxoid Limited), and <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> on was grown in Tryptone Yeast Glucose broth (TYG) for liquid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>) and on Brain Heart Infusion Agar with 10% Sheep Blood for plating.

Primer sequences and PCR fragment lengths are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. Primers’ strain specificity was tested in silico by conducting a BLAST search against the NCBI database. Primers were also tested experimentally against DNA isolated from the C3H/HeN donor microbiota by qPCR, and confirmed to produce no background amplification with the donor community. Cell numbers of strains were quantified by absolute quantification using a standard curve prepared with DNA isolated from cultures for which cell numbers were determined by quantitative culture. Standard curves were prepared by using pure cultures of each microorganism harvested at late exponential phase, determined by growth curves generated for each strain under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maldonado-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krumbeck, 2015</xref>). qPCR was performed using a Bio-Rad C1000 Thermal Cycler instrument (Bio-Rad laboratories, CA), with PCR reaction volumes of 25 μl using Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Agilent Technologies, Cedar Creek, TX), 0.8 μM primer concentrations, and 1 μl DNA template.

In both cases, pair-end sequencing was done in the MiSeq Illumina platform (2 × 300; MiSeq Reagent Kit v3). Each dataset was processed independently but following the same protocol. In brief, pair-end reads (2 × 300; MiSeq Reagent Kit v3) were merged and quality controlled with the merge-pairs application of the illumina-utils toolset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eren et al., 2013</xref>) with quality check (Q30), removal of primers, removal of sequences with at least one mismatch to the primer sequence, and P parameter = 0.03 (for all other parameters default settings were used). Quality-controlled sequences were subjected to Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eren et al., 2015</xref>), which allows the differentiation of single-nucleotide differences, therefore allowing the highest level of resolution when differentiating members of the two donor communities. Because MED is a non-cluster based algorithm, the term ‘bacterial types’ is used in the manuscript to refer to the phylogenetic bins assigned by MED, instead of operational taxonomic units that are inherently based on a clustering step. Independent MED analyses were done for the two experimental datasets (given that the ceca microbiota used were different). Taxonomic assignment of the representative sequences of each bacterial type was performed using the RDP Classifier and Seqmatch tools, and verified with BLASTn by the NCBI. Quality-controlled sequences were also binned in a reference-based manner using the RDP MultiClassifier tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) as an independent method of sequence classification.</p><p>α and β-diversity distances were calculated after rarefying the number of sequences (20,000 sequences/sample for the experiments introducing the whole ceca experiments in different sequential order, and 12,500 sequences/sample for the experiments testing the importance of time of arrival of specific colonizers). α and β-diversity distances were calculated after rarefying the number of sequences using the QIIME pipeline (version 1.9.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caporaso et al., 2010</xref>).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Experimental evaluation of the importance of colonization history in early-life gut microbiota assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper by Martinez et al. aims to study an important and fundamental question of community establishment, and specifically, how order of exposure/colonization effects the final composition of communities. It is tested here in the gut of mice, WT or <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, to start and understand the adaptive immune system's role in community establishment. Together, these studies suggest that the timing of colonization can play a significant role in determining emergent community composition. The reviewers agree that this work is of great interest to the larger microbiome community, with strong implications on the establishment of the human microbial communities as well. The data are extremely interesting, but some additional analyses can lift the manuscript even higher.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The sample collection is not 100% clear. Multiple figures refer to &quot;Parents A&quot; and &quot;Parents B&quot;, and it's unclear where these samples came from. If it is indeed from the fur of the parents, then we should have had &quot;Parents AB&quot; as well, so it's unclear.</p><p>Subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”: The authors state a desire &quot;to avoid microbiomes from animal care facilities&quot;, but then select an individual (donor A) from a colony maintained for three generations in such a facility (and, presumably, indoors, consuming standardized chow, etc). Why? Also, in subsection “Donor mice”, it sounds like one mouse gave rise to three generations. Perhaps edit (unless this was a cloning lab). The donor A mouse is described as &quot;wild&quot; but was born and lived in a lab.</p><p>The experiment design looks good, but there are key analyses that I would expect to see in the paper. Some appear later but should be presented much earlier. Please include a better analysis of bacterial species found in donor vs. recipients. Analysis of the transmitted bacterial species, not in terms of overall statistics (like Shannon diversity), or PCoA plots, but big heat map(s) that show(s) which strains were transferred and which were not. And/or rank abundance curves with relevant taxa highlighted. The PCoA plots often show different axes (not always named axis 1 and 2), and it feels like there are more interesting results in the full data.</p><p>Figure 1B: It seems like data from Parents A/B are missing from both WT and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> experiments. I wonder if these parents had higher alpha-diversity, too (like the pups), because they were exposed to a mixture. Please add if available. (To be clear, I mean the parents of the AB/AB treatment mice, given that the parents of the A/B and B/A treatment mice are shown.)</p><p>Figure 1C: How come there is variation in samples A,B in panel C but not in B? How many samples are in each group?</p><p>Figure 2 needs a lot of polishing. Axes are not consistent, sizes are not consistent. Clearly, it is not ready for publishing. PCoA axis should have% variance explained added to them.</p><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure” and Figure 2A: It appears that all of the recipient animals cluster closer to donor A than they do to donor B. Is this consistent with the statement that &quot;B/A mice clustered closer to Donor B&quot;? Is there a significant difference in the clustering of A/B vs. B/A mice with Donor A vs. Donor B? In Figure 2A, parent colors are not distinguishable from A/B, B/A; the x-axis label is missing; Parents A/B are missing.</p><p>Figure 2C: I am puzzled by the differences across the various colonization orders. It seems that for A/B and B/A within cage and across cages are not that different, whereas for AB/AB there is a strong difference there. How can this be explained? I am also surprised that there is a significant difference in AB/AB comparing across cages to across isolators (*** P &lt; 0.001). The figure doesn't seem to show that strong difference.</p><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”: The Adonis analysis and the distances shown in Figure 2C do not seem to agree. From Figure 2C, it appears the isolator would have the strongest effect, and not the cage. Can you provide more details on your Adonis analysis?</p><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”: Nice result. To support that local extinction (within isolators) was by drift and not by selection, could you examine the relative abundance of those types (that disappeared) in the donor communities (i.e., the metacommunity)? Assuming low abundance types are more likely to drift to local extinction.</p><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: Before digging deeper into the order, there are clear species that are absent in one donor, and present in the recipients, and it would be very interesting to understand what these are.</p><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: In the linear mixed model analysis, were cage/isolators variable taken into account? The authors made it clear in the previous section that these are relevant variables, yet they are not mentioned here more.</p><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: I would name these (inhibitory/facilitative effects) the opposite. If a strain is overrepresented when inoculated first, that would not be inhibitory. I find these confusing, maybe you should consider explaining it in more detail?</p><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: Please indicate the total number of cases; the three cherry picked examples all have quite low abundances – less than 1%, less than 0.1% –which raises a concern about detection limits and whether these are just sampling depth effects. Were any highly abundant types affected?</p><p>The figures are not sharp enough. Some figures do not convey the message clearly and concisely (like the experimental design figures). E.g. Figure 3A – what are the values shown – abundance or log values? A label is missing. The entire figure needs much polishing as well. All the sizes are different, and it is not well positioned of all panels. PCoA plots should not show clustering of samples (for example, with a circle surrounding each group of samples), as this visualization is misleading to show more separation than what the data support. Overall, figures are missing legend headers, axis names, units explanation, etc.</p><p>Subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history” and in particular &quot;[…] colonization order is the only experimental variable in the model.&quot;: Is host age (and associated factors like weaning status and parental proximity) not also a variable? There is no control in which day 10 A or B is followed by day 36 sham; or day 10 sham is followed by day 36 A or B. Isn't it possible that A and B differ in the degree to which their species can persist at a particular developmental age without the competing community? (Overall, pieces of this paragraph might fit better in the Introduction or Discussion section, rather than Results section.) Likewise, in subsection “Timing of arrival impacts persistence of individual colonizers” (second paragraph), by &quot;timing&quot;, do the authors mean host age, or relative to the timing of C3H introduction, or both? Again, controls in which nothing was introduced on day 10 might shed light on this.</p><p>Subsection “The adaptive immune system does not contribute to historical contingency in gut microbiota assembly”: Nice result.

It is tested here in the gut of mice, WT or Rag1<sup>-/-</sup>, to start and understand the adaptive immune system's role in community establishment. Together, these studies suggest that the timing of colonization can play a significant role in determining emergent community composition. The reviewers agree that this work is of great interest to the larger microbiome community, with strong implications on the establishment of the human microbial communities as well. The data are extremely interesting, but some additional analyses can lift the manuscript even higher.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this overall positive and encouraging assessment, and we thank the reviewers for extremely constructive reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The sample collection is not 100% clear. Multiple figures refer to &quot;Parents A&quot; and &quot;Parents B&quot;, and it's unclear where these samples came from. If it is indeed from the fur of the parents, then we should have had &quot;Parents AB&quot; as well, so it's unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this was confusing and thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We have now modified Figure 1A (experimental design), which is now a separate figure (Figure 1), to clarify how and when samples were collected and how samples are called, including the samples from the parents. In addition, the text in the manuscript was modified to specify when the parent samples were collected (subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”: The authors state a desire &quot;to avoid microbiomes from animal care facilities&quot;, but then select an individual (donor A) from a colony maintained for three generations in such a facility (and, presumably, indoors, consuming standardized chow, etc). Why? Also, in subsection “Donor mice”, it sounds like one mouse gave rise to three generations. Perhaps edit (unless this was a cloning lab). The donor A mouse is described as &quot;wild&quot; but was born and lived in a lab.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now clarified that what we wanted was to avoid mice from commercial facilities that are often aberrant (subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”). In addition, we now strictly refer to the mice that were caught in the wild and then housed in a facility as “wild-derived” (subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”), and we have clarified how these mice were derived (subsection “Preparation and standardization of donor inocula”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiment design looks good, but there are key analyses that I would expect to see in the paper. Some appear later but should be presented much earlier. Please include a better analysis of bacterial species found in donor vs. recipients. Analysis of the transmitted bacterial species, not in terms of overall statistics (like Shannon diversity), or PCoA plots, but big heat map(s) that show(s) which strains were transferred and which were not. And/or rank abundance curves with relevant taxa highlighted. The PCoA plots often show different axes (not always named axis 1 and 2), and it feels like there are more interesting results in the full data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In fact, a heat map was provided (previously Figure 3A) that does in fact show the abundances of all bacterial types in both donor and recipients, but a clear legend was missing, and we apologize for that. This has now been corrected. The heat map provides clear information on the bacterial types found in donor vs. Recipient. We agree with the reviewer that the heat map should be presented earlier, and we now show the heat map in Figure 2A and have provided text earlier on (subsection “Gut microbiota of recipient mice shows higher diversity when compared to donors”) to present to what degree types were transferred. We further discuss how the relative abundances shown in the heatmap is similar in donor and recipient mice for most types, demonstrating that the abundance distribution of bacterial types in the recipient mice reflected to a large degree those of the donors, showing that transfer of the microbiota did not result in major rearrangements in community structure.</p><p>We prefer not to focus on the exact taxonomic assignments of relevant taxa as such assignments are difficult to make for these largely uncharacterized wild-derived microbiomes. Please be aware that we do make such assignments for the taxa that are impacted by colonization order (Supplementary file 1), which is the focus of this study. Clearly, both rank abundance curves and larger tables could be provided if requested, but we do question that value of adding this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B: It seems like data from Parents A/B are missing from both WT and Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> experiments. I wonder if these parents had higher alpha-diversity, too (like the pups), because they were exposed to a mixture. Please add if available. (To be clear, I mean the parents of the AB/AB treatment mice, given that the parents of the A/B and B/A treatment mice are shown.)</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the Parents A/B also have higher alpha-diversity consistent with the findings in all recipient mice, and we have added them into the revised Figures 2B-E. Please be aware that parents were not included in the statistical analysis as they only served as a reference and the objective of the statistical test was to determine if recipient mice at 78 days were more diverse than donor mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C: How come there is variation in samples A,B in panel C but not in B? How many samples are in each group?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for this is that to determine A and B specific types, data from donor and parent mice were combined to avoid sample size bias that results from having only one sample profiled for each of the donor communities. Amount of samples are now added to the figure legend (now Figure 2), and the figure legend has been modified to clarify these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 needs a lot of polishing. Axes are not consistent, sizes are not consistent. Clearly, it is not ready for publishing. PCoA axis should have% variance explained added to them.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2, which is now Figure 3 in the revised version, has been polished to make axes and sizes consistent. Please be aware that these are not PCoA plots, but NMDS plots (non-metric multidimensional scaling, within the vegan package in R), which have many advantages of PCoA, such as making assumption about data distribution, and is a very popular method in ecology. There is no meaningful way to express axis variation in NMDS. Instead, a low stress value is preferred (as a guide &lt;0.05 stress value is considered excellent, and &lt;0.1 good). Stress values have been added to the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure” and Figure 2A: It appears that all of the recipient animals cluster closer to donor A than they do to donor B. Is this consistent with the statement that &quot;B/A mice clustered closer to Donor B&quot;? Is there a significant difference in the clustering of A/B vs. B/A mice with Donor A vs. Donor B? In Figure 2A, parent colors are not distinguishable from A/B, B/A; the x-axis label is missing; Parents A/B are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and agree it was not clear. We have now clarified that we mean distances between the A/B and the B/A group in comparison with the other groups, and not absolute distances (subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”). Since this is only an overview graph that also contains donor and parent mice, statistics were not done here. However, they are done in the analysis shown in Figure 3C without the parents, and we have now compared average distances of the groups to the donors A and B, and they indeed are significantly different (Figure 3B). Colors have changed to make them distinguishable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: I am puzzled by the differences across the various colonization orders. It seems that for A/B and B/A within cage and across cages are not that different, whereas for AB/AB there is a strong difference there. How can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation, but our experiment does not allow conclusions on why that is. The important massage is that, although all of these mice received the same communities, they clearly cluster according to barriers of dispersal, which is discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also surprised that there is a significant difference in AB/AB comparing across cages to across isolators (*** P &lt; 0.001). The figure doesn't seem to show that strong difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The difference is significant, but indeed, the p value was only 0.006, which makes it ** P &lt; 0.01. This mistake has been corrected in what is now Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”: The Adonis analysis and the distances shown in Figure 2C do not seem to agree. From Figure 2C, it appears the isolator would have the strongest effect, and not the cage. Can you provide more details on your Adonis analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The Adonis test is evaluating what is the variable that drives similarities across the samples, and the better explanatory variable is the factor ‘cage’, as the microbiomes within cages are more similar to each other than across isolators (which is consistent with what Figure 3D is showing). The text was changed from “explaining most of the variation” to “variables revealed that the data was better explained by the factor cage (P &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66), followed by isolator (P &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46) and colonization order (P &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21).” (subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Assessing the importance of colonization history and dispersal limitation towards shaping gut microbiota structure”: Nice result. To support that local extinction (within isolators) was by drift and not by selection, could you examine the relative abundance of those types (that disappeared) in the donor communities (i.e., the metacommunity)? Assuming low abundance types are more likely to drift to local extinction.</p></disp-quote><p>Clearly, such an analysis could be done. However, given that dispersal limitation is the only factor that contributes to the clustering, we are pretty confident that we are in fact dealing with drift here. Second, the focus of our work is to identify the importance of historical processes, and we therefore think that such an analysis would be out of scope and confuse more than help. Clearly, if requested, it could be added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: Before digging deeper into the order, there are clear species that are absent in one donor, and present in the recipients, and it would be very interesting to understand what these are.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary file 1 does show all 20 types affected by colonization order, many of which cannot be classified to species level. Also, as described above, only 7% of the types detected in the recipient mice are not detectable in the donors, and they only make up 0.7% of the total sequences. This shows that only a very small proportion of the recipient microbiome cannot be traced back to donors, and as described above, this is now included in the manuscript (subsection “Gut microbiota of recipient mice shows higher diversity when compared to donors”). We do therefore not think it would be helpful to focus space here on the discussion of the types that are absent in the donor and present in the recipients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: In the linear mixed model analysis, were cage/isolators variable taken into account? The authors made it clear in the previous section that these are relevant variables, yet they are not mentioned here more.</p></disp-quote><p>It is mentioned now in the text that 'isolator' was indeed used as a random variable in the model. We think that it is not appropriate to use both ‘isolators’ and ‘cages’ as the two variables are dependent. However, we have also done the analysis using 'cages' as the random variable, and out of the 20 bacterial types detected with 'isolators' as the random variable, 18 were also detected with 'cages' as the random variable. 'Cages' as the random variable led to a higher number of significant bacterial types to be detected as different across groups, but visual inspection of the distributions indicated that the findings are less robust for the extra types detected. As a conservative approach, we decided to present results using 'isolators' as the random variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: I would name these (inhibitory/facilitative effects) the opposite. If a strain is overrepresented when inoculated first, that would not be inhibitory. I find these confusing, maybe you should consider explaining it in more detail?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a more detailed explanation in the revised manuscript to argue that overrepresentation when inoculated first does indeed point to inhibition in the subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Bacterial types affected by colonization order and mechanisms of priority effects”: Please indicate the total number of cases; the three cherry picked examples all have quite low abundances – less than 1%, less than 0.1% – which raises a concern about detection limits and whether these are just sampling depth effects. Were any highly abundant types affected?</p></disp-quote><p>Two of the examples that we present have percentages of around 1%. Given that there are around three hundred bacterial types in these communities, we do not consider a 1% relative abundance ‘low abundance’. In addition, we sequenced to a depth of 20,000 sequences per sample. We therefore think it is unlikely that our observations are purely through sampling. Lastly, we show averages obtained in at least 12 mice per group and two independent experiments. We therefore argue that random effects through sampling depth would not have been that consistent and would not have resulted in statistically significant findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures are not sharp enough. Some figures do not convey the message clearly and concisely (like the experimental design figures). E.g. Figure 3A – what are the values shown – abundance or log values? A label is missing. The entire figure needs much polishing as well. All the sizes are different, and it is not well positioned of all panels. PCoA plots should not show clustering of samples (for example, with a circle surrounding each group of samples), as this visualization is misleading to show more separation than what the data support. Overall, figures are missing legend headers, axis names, units explanation, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The figures were actually quite sharp, so we think this was a problem of the Pdf that was generated for the review purpose. Figure 3A, which is now Figure 2A, has been changed, and legend has been added. Figures were extensively polished. As we write above, these are NMDS plots, and circles are quite standard here, and we have added information to the Material and Methods on how these circles were generated (subsection “Statistical analysis”). Axis names and explanations have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history” and in particular &quot;[…] colonization order is the only experimental variable in the model&quot;: Is host age (and associated factors like weaning status and parental proximity) not also a variable?</p></disp-quote><p>Host age and weaning status were strictly standardized and not different between treatment groups. We acknowledge that there will be developmental changes in the offspring mice both in this paragraph and in the discussion. These are factors that could account for some of our findings, and this is discussed (see Discussion section), but we argue that these are not variables among groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no control in which day 10 A or B is followed by day 36 sham; or day 10 sham is followed by day 36 A or B. Isn't it possible that A and B differ in the degree to which their species can persist at a particular developmental age without the competing community? (Overall, pieces of this paragraph might fit better in the Introduction or Discussion section, rather than Results section.) Likewise, in subsection “Timing of arrival impacts persistence of individual colonizers” (second paragraph), by &quot;timing&quot;, do the authors mean host age, or relative to the timing of C3H introduction, or both? Again, controls in which nothing was introduced on day 10 might shed light on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that developmental differences at day 10 might contribute to historical contingency, and this is discussed. However, we find it unlikely that this is due to differences in persistence at early age. Please be aware that in our experiments, the parent mice also get colonized (and this was confirmed by sequencing), which allows vertical and horizontal transmission (e.g. through coprohagy) to the offspring up until weaning and thus maturity, which makes it unlikely that effects are only because species can persist when colonizing early. We have added additional information to the manuscript (subsection “Establishing a mouse model using distinct, complex microbial communities to study the importance of colonization history”) to emphasize this feature of our model. We would further like to add that even if developmental differences contribute to historical contingency, colonization order would still be important microbiome assembly. This is also discussed in the manuscript (Discussion section). What is meant by ‘arrival timing’ (it is relative to competitors arrival) has been clarified (subsection “Timing of arrival impacts persistence of individual colonizers”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The adaptive immune system does not contribute to historical contingency in gut microbiota assembly”: Nice result.

We would therefore prefer not to perform such a genomic analysis as we think this would be highly confounded (a member not benefiting from priority effects might well do so in a different context). In addition, many aspects of priority effects are based on selection and competition but, in ecology, the process is still not considered completely deterministic as the order of arrival does influence the interactions between the members, and this order is, and many of the mechanisms (e.g. monopolization, which is based on mutations), in most cases, stochastic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the discussion is already quite long, perhaps some sections could be condensed in order to clarify the limitations of the sample sizes used (2 communities, 4 species) in deriving general principles.
