the conserved HORMA domain family. Here we present the structure of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> TRIP13 ortholog PCH-2, revealing a new family of AAA+ ATPase protein remodelers. PCH-2 possesses a substrate-recognition domain related to those of the protein remodelers NSF and p97, while its overall hexameric architecture and likely structural mechanism bear close similarities to the bacterial protein unfoldase ClpX. We find that TRIP13, aided by the adapter protein p31(comet), converts the HORMA-family spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 from a signaling-active ‘closed’ conformer to an inactive ‘open’ conformer. We propose that TRIP13 and p31(comet) collaborate to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint through MAD2 conformational conversion and disassembly of mitotic checkpoint complexes. A parallel HORMA protein disassembly activity likely underlies TRIP13's critical regulatory functions in meiotic chromosome structure and recombination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07367.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07367.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07367.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material inside human and other animal cells is made of DNA and is packaged in structures called chromosomes. Before a cell divides, the entire set of chromosomes is copied so that each chromosome is now made of two identical sister ‘chromatids’.</p><p>Next, the chromosomes line up on a structure called the spindle, which is made of filaments called microtubules. Cells have a surveillance system known as the spindle assembly checkpoint that halts cell division until every chromosome is correctly aligned on the spindle. Once the chromosomes are in place, the checkpoint is turned off and the spindle pulls the chromatids apart so that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes.</p><p>A protein called MAD2 plays an important role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. It can adopt two distinct shapes: in the ‘closed’ shape it is active and halts cell division, but in the ‘open’ shape it is inactive and allows cell division to proceed. Another protein called TRIP13 can help turn off the checkpoint, but it is not clear how this works or whether TRIP13 acts on MAD2 directly.</p><p>Here, Ye et al. studied these proteins using a technique called X-ray crystallography and several biochemical techniques. The experiments show that TRIP13 belongs to a family of proteins known as ‘AAA-ATPases’, which can unfold proteins to alter their activity. Ye et al. found that TRIP13 binds to an adaptor protein that allows it to bind to the closed form of MAD2. TRIP13 then unfolds a part of the MAD2 protein, converting MAD2 into the open shape.</p><p>Ye et al. propose that, once all chromosomes are lined up on the spindle, TRIP13 turns off the spindle assembly checkpoint by converting closed MAD2 to open MAD2. Also, when cells are not undergoing cell division, TRIP13 may maintain MAD2 in the open shape to prevent cells from turning on the spindle assembly checkpoint at the wrong time. Further work will be needed to show how TRIP13 recognizes the closed form of MAD2, and whether it can act in a similar way on other proteins in the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07367.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07367.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd><kwd>HORMA domain protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM104141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Qiaozhen</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Tiffany Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation (March of Dimes Births Defect Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FY14-251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Qiaozhen</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006156</institution-id><institution>Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeller</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name><name><surname>Speir</surname><given-names>Jeffrey A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy (Department of Energy)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbett</surname><given-names>Kevin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRIP13 inactivates the spindle assembly checkpoint by converting MAD2 from its active ‘closed’ state to its inactive ‘open’ state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The assembly and disassembly of specific protein complexes underlies many important signaling pathways in the cell. The HORMA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind and Koonin, 1998</xref>) is a conserved, structurally unique signaling module that forms complexes through a characteristic ‘safety-belt’ interaction in which the C-terminus of the domain wraps entirely around a short region of a binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sironi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). HORMA domain protein complexes participate in multiple cellular signaling pathways, including meiotic recombination control, DNA repair, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). While the regulated assembly of HORMA domain protein complexes has been extensively characterized, the mechanisms underlying their disassembly, which requires significant conformational changes to disrupt the extremely stable safety-belt interaction, are largely unknown.</p><p>In meiosis, homologous chromosomes must recognize one another and recombine, forming physical links called crossovers (COs) that enable their bi-orientation and segregation in meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). CO formation is promoted and regulated by a conserved family of HORMA domain proteins termed HORMADs. Early in meiotic prophase, HORMADs localize to chromosomes along their entire lengths, where they promote the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks and bias the repair of those breaks toward the homologous chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Subramanian and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>). In both yeast and mammals, excess recombination is limited by a feedback mechanism that removes or redistributes HORMADs along the chromosome after sufficient COs have formed. The removal of HORMADs depends on a conserved AAA+ family ATPase, Pch2/TRIP13, without which the frequency and spatial distribution of COs is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Börner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). We have previously shown that the HORMADs assemble into higher-order oligomers through head-to-tail safety-belt interactions, and that these interactions are critical for their meiotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). As a predominant family of AAA+ ATPases function to disaggregate or disassemble protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauer and Baker, 2011</xref>), it has been proposed that Pch2/TRIP13 mediates HORMAD removal from chromosomes through specific recognition and disassembly of chromosome-associated HORMAD complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, mammalian TRIP13 has been shown to regulate the SAC, which monitors kinetochore-microtubule attachment in both mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). In this pathway, unattached kinetochores generate an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which is composed of the MAD2, CDC20, BUBR1, and BUB3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardwick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraschini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>). MAD2 is a relative of the meiotic HORMADs, and exists in one of two conformers: an inactive ‘open’ state (O-MAD2), and an active ‘closed’ state (C-MAD2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that binds CDC20 through a safety-belt interaction to form the core of the MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sironi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2012</xref>). After all kinetochores become properly attached to microtubules, new MCC assembly is halted and the SAC is inactivated. Timely SAC inactivation requires two factors, TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and the HORMA domain protein p31(comet) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Varetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Westhorpe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>), which recent evidence suggests may act together to directly disassemble the MCC. p31(comet) specifically recognizes and binds C-MAD2, and the p31(comet)-MAD2 interface overlaps MAD2's interface with BUBR1 in the intact MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tipton et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that p31(comet) may compete with BUBR1 for MAD2 binding. Further, the combined activities of p31(comet) and TRIP13 can cause the dissociation of MAD2 from immunoprecipitated CDC20 or BUBR1 complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teichner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eytan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, human <italic>TRIP13</italic> has also been identified as an oncogene: <italic>TRIP13</italic> is overexpressed in a number of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Kester et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and can promote proliferation and invasion when overexpressed in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>). The source of <italic>TRIP13</italic>'s oncogenic activity is unknown, but may stem from effects on chromosome structure and DNA repair pathways (as its meiotic functions would suggest), or may instead arise from aberrant regulation of the SAC.</p><p>Pch2/TRIP13 is thus directly implicated in the regulation of HORMA domain-mediated signaling in two separate pathways, meiotic recombination and the SAC. The mechanistic basis for this regulation, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that Pch2/TRIP13 comprises a new family of AAA+ ATPase protein remodelers, with a substrate-recognition domain similar to the NSF/p97/PEX1 remodeler family and a physical mechanism closely related to the bacterial ClpX unfoldase. We show that TRIP13 converts closed, active MAD2 to its inactive open conformer, and that p31(comet) functions as an adapter to recognize closed MAD2 and deliver it to TRIP13. Thus, TRIP13 regulates the SAC through MAD2 conformational conversion and safety belt disengagement, and a similar mechanism for HORMAD complex disassembly likely underlies the enzyme's regulatory functions in meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> PCH-2</title><p>Pch2/TRIP13 proteins are members of the functionally diverse AAA+ ATPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>). These proteins share a common architecture, with a family-specific N-terminal domain (NTD) responsible for localization or substrate recognition, and one or two AAA+ ATPase modules that typically assemble into a hexameric ring. AAA+ ATPases are extremely diverse and include DNA and RNA helicases, DNA replication initiators, and a large family termed the ‘classic remodelers,’ which disaggregate or unfold proteins; these include the SNARE complex disassembly factor NSF, the ubiquitin-directed disaggregase p97/Cdc48, and the ATPase component of the eukaryotic proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Sequence comparisons of the Pch2/TRIP13 AAA+ ATPase module fail to clearly classify it within any well-characterized AAA+ family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, sequence comparisons of the Pch2/TRIP13 NTD fail to identify homology to any known proteins. Therefore, we took a structural approach to determine the relationship of Pch2/TRIP13 to other AAA+ ATPases. We overexpressed and purified <italic>Mus musculus</italic> TRIP13 and its <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog PCH-2, and found that while TRIP13 adopts a range of oligomeric states from monomer to hexamer, PCH-2 forms a stable hexamer both with and without added nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We next performed negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) on PCH-2; low-resolution class averages reveal a distinctly asymmetric hexamer in the absence of nucleotides, which becomes more symmetric and compact when ATP is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We attempted crystallization both in the presence and absence of nucleotides, and successfully determined the crystal structure of PCH-2 without added nucleotide to a resolution of 2.3 Å. The structure reveals an elongated hexamer with an approximate ‘dimer of trimers’ symmetry and an overall shape similar to our EM class averages of this state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07367.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PCH-2/TRIP13 is a distinct class of hexmeric AAA+ ATPase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of selected AAA+ ATPases, colored by clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>).

These proteins possess two-part NTDs with tightly associated N-N and N-C subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">May et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 1999</xref>). A hydrophobic cleft between the two subdomains binds either directly to substrates, or alternatively to ‘adapter’ proteins that aid localization and specific substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kloppsteck et al., 2012</xref>). In PCH-2, the NTD contains a single folded domain similar to the NSF/p97/PEX1 N-C subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and as such does not share these proteins' substrate-binding hydrophobic cleft. Nonetheless, the similarity in NTD structure indicates a hitherto unappreciated evolutionary link between Pch2/TRIP13 and the NSF/p97/PEX1 remodeler family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and strongly suggests that the PCH-2 NTD is involved in substrate recognition, either directly or indirectly through one or more adapter proteins.</p><p>PCH-2's single AAA+ ATPase module is composed of two domains, termed the large and small AAA domains. Structural comparisons using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>) indicate that the ATP-binding large AAA domain of PCH-2 (residues 100–323) is most structurally similar to the ‘classic remodelers,’ including NSF/p97/PEX1, Vps4, Katanin p60, and the proteasome ATPase subunits (2.7–3.4 Å r.m.s.d. comparing 150–170 Cα atoms). The domain also shows strong similarity to other AAA+ ATPase families including the ‘HCLR’ clade that includes ClpX, the unfoldase component of the bacterial ClpXP protease (3.2–3.3 Å r.m.s.d. comparing ∼150 Cα atoms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauer and Baker, 2011</xref>). The small AAA domain (residues 324–424) is most similar to ‘classic remodeler’ family members (1.5–2.0 Å r.m.s.d. comparing 60–70 Cα atoms).</p><p>As in other AAA+ ATPases, the PCH-2 hexamer assembles through interactions between each subunit's large AAA domain and the small AAA domain of a neighboring subunit, with the ATP-binding sites situated near the subunit interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). Although no nucleotides were added during purification or crystallization of PCH-2, we observed that two subunits in the hexamer (chains B and E) are bound to ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), enabling a close analysis of PCH-2 active site structure. PCH-2 possesses the characteristic Walker A, Walker B, Sensor-1, and ‘arginine finger’ motifs in the large AAA domain that cooperate to bind nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B, 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>). In many AAA+ ATPases, nucleotide binding is sensed by an additional ‘Sensor-2’ motif, typically an arginine residue, reaching from the small AAA domain into the active site. This motif is involved in nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and nucleotide-dependent inter-domain conformational changes in various AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ogura et al., 2004</xref>). Curiously, the ‘classic remodelers’ family, including NSF/p97/PEX1, uniformly lacks the Sensor-2 motif and also possesses a second arginine adjacent to the arginine finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These differences indicate that this family's mechanism for ATP-driven conformational changes may have diverged somewhat from other AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ogura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>). Pch2/TRIP13 proteins, in contrast, possesses only a single arginine finger (R312 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> PCH-2), and our PCH-2 structure shows that a conserved arginine (R385) is properly positioned to act as a Sensor-2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B, 2E</xref>). This finding suggests that despite sharing a common NTD with a family of ‘classic remodelers’, the detailed mechanism for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in Pch2/TRIP13 may more closely resemble other AAA+ families.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nucleotide-driven conformational changes in the PCH-2 hexamer</title><p>The distinctly asymmetric hexamer architecture of PCH-2 provides clues to conformational changes that likely occur during ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release. Within the hexamer, four PCH-2 subunits adopt a ‘closed’ conformation equivalent to that observed in most AAA+ ‘classic remodeler’ structures, with the large and small AAA domains tightly associated around the ATP-binding site. Two of these subunits (chains B and E) are bound to ADP in our structure, while the other two (chains A and D) contain a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> ion from the crystallization buffer. Asymmetry in the PCH-2 hexamer arises from large conformational differences in the remaining two subunits (chains C and F, also bound to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>), situated on opposite ends of the extended hexamer. Compared to the four closed subunits, these chains adopt an ‘open’ conformation, in which the small AAA domain is rotated ∼70° away from the large AAA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07367.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes within the PCH-2 hexamer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural basis for nucleotide binding-dependent conformational changes.

Instead, the PCH-2 structure closely resembles several prior structures of the ClpX unfoldase, which contain four ‘closed’ and two ‘open’ subunits arranged in the same pattern as in PCH-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>). This conformation was observed both in the absence of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>) and in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (ATP-γ-S), which was found to bind the four ‘closed’ subunits but not the two ‘open’ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>). Detailed biochemical analysis of the ClpX mechanism has demonstrated that sequential ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release drive cyclical open → closed → open conformational changes within each subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stinson et al., 2013</xref>). These motions in turn drive axial movement of loops lining the hexamer pore (pore loops), which contain aromatic residues that directly engage substrate proteins during unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siddiqui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iosefson et al., 2015</xref>).

This number is similar to several prior measurements of NSF-mediated SNARE complex disassembly (6–50 ATP per event, depending on experimental conditions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cipriano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 2015</xref>) or ClpX-mediated unfolding of a small model substrate (∼150 ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2001</xref>), likely reflecting that MAD2 conformational conversion may require only a local perturbation of the safety-belt motif, rather than complete unfolding (see ‘Discussion’). This idea would fit with recent work indicating that NSF unfolds its substrates in a single step, using the energy from multiple ATP hydrolysis events to build up tension within the hexamer, then promoting a critical conformational change that results in SNARE complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>). A similar ‘spring-loaded’ mechanism in TRIP13 could enable the enzyme to catalyze conversion/disassembly of unliganded C-MAD2 or its complexes with partner proteins such as CDC20 with similar efficiency; alternatively, if MAD2 conformational conversion requires several rounds of ATP hydrolysis, the energy requirements for disassembly of ligand-stabilized MAD2 may be significantly higher than the 8–10 ATP we measured for C-MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> conformational conversion.</p><p>Finally, we tested the ability of p31(comet) mutants that disrupt binding to either MAD2 or TRIP13 to support MAD2 conformational conversion. The MAD2-binding mutant (Q86A/F193A) and two TRIP13-binding mutants (Δ159–164 or P230A/K231A) each modestly reduced MAD2 conversion compared to wild-type p31(comet) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Combinations of these mutants, however, almost completely eliminated MAD2 conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), illustrating that the adapter function of p31(comet) is critical for TRIP13 to recognize and convert C-MAD2 to O-MAD2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that Pch2/TRIP13 is a AAA+ ATPase with structural and mechanistic properties similar to both the ‘classic remodelers’ and the bacterial protein unfoldase ClpX. First, the PCH-2 hexamer architecture shows close mechanistic parallels with ClpX, suggesting a shared mechanism for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes driving pore loop motions and substrate remodeling. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that Pch2/TRIP13 engages its substrates within the hexamer pore, and undergoes coordinated ATP hydrolysis-coupled conformational changes to mediate substrate unfolding. In contrast to ClpX, however, Pch2/TRIP13 does not completely unfold its HORMA domain protein substrates. Rather, we have shown that TRIP13 catalyzes a much more subtle structural change, converting closed MAD2 to its open state. We propose that TRIP13 specifically unfolds the C-terminal safety belt region of MAD2, then allows it to refold into the open state. Given the mechanistic similarities between Pch2/TRIP13 and the processive unfoldase ClpX, however, an obvious question is how unfolding by Pch2/TRIP13 is controlled to achieve HORMA domain conformational conversion instead of complete unfolding.</p><p>The answer to this question may lie in the second aspect of Pch2/TRIP13's hybrid nature: its mode of substrate recognition, which is mediated by an NTD related to a family of ‘classic remodelers’ including NSF, p97, and PEX1. Importantly, as in NSF and p97, substrate recognition by Pch2/TRIP13 is indirect with p31(comet) acting as an adapter to deliver MAD2 to TRIP13. p31(comet) binds specifically to C-MAD2, meaning that once TRIP13 engages and unfolds the MAD2 safety belt, p31(comet) would cease to bind MAD2. This could destabilize the ternary complex, releasing partially-unfolded MAD2 and allowing its re-folding into the open conformation. As mentioned above, MAD2 safety belt unfolding could occur in a processive manner accompanied by multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis by TRIP13, or could occur similarly to NSF, where recent work has indicated a single-step ‘spring-loaded’ mechanism for SNARE complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>). In the SAC, we propose that p31(comet) and TRIP13 catalyze a two-step MCC disassembly mechanism to inactivate the SAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). First, p31(comet) displaces BUBR1 from MAD2, potentially causing its dissociation from MAD2:CDC20. The resulting p31(comet):MAD2:CDC20 complex is then recognized by TRIP13, which converts C-MAD2 to O-MAD2, thus disrupting binding to both p31(comet) and CDC20, and also preventing MCC re-assembly.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07367.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for SAC inactivation by p31(comet) and TRIP13.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unattached kinetochores catalyze the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) through the conversion of O-MAD2 to C-MAD2 and assembly with CDC20 (blue), BUBR1 (pink), and BUB3 (not shown).

These data strongly suggest that cellular factors actively maintain MAD2 in the open state. We propose that a major role for TRIP13 and p31(comet) may be to counteract spontaneous O-MAD2 to C-MAD2 conversion, thus guarding against improperly-timed MCC assembly (which can occur outside mitosis given a supply of soluble C-MAD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tipton et al., 2011a</xref>]) and also ensuring a sufficient supply of O-MAD2 for SAC activation in prometaphase. An important remaining question is how the competing pathways for MCC assembly and disassembly are balanced and regulated throughout the cell cycle: do p31(comet) and TRIP13 constantly disassemble MCC at a low level during prometaphase and metaphase, with this activity becoming dominant only after new MCC assembly is ceased, or is the activity of p31(comet) and TRIP13 suppressed during metaphase by additional mechanisms? Recently it was shown that human p31(comet) is phosphorylated specifically in mitosis, and that phosphorylation lowers the affinity of p31(comet) for MAD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Date et al., 2014</xref>). While the phosphorylated residue (Ser102) is not universally conserved in p31(comet) orthologs, this result nonetheless represents one potential mechanism for suppressing TRIP13-mediated MCC disassembly specifically during mitosis.</p><p>The ability of TRIP13 to disengage the safety-belt motif of MAD2 strongly suggests a parallel mechanism for its remodeling/removal of HORMAD proteins along chromosomes in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

We have been unable, however, to detect direct interactions between PCH-2/TRIP13 and their putative HORMAD substrates, nor do these proteins stimulate PCH-2/TRIP13 ATPase activity (not shown).

For calculation of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>, sampled were performed in triplicate with ATP concentration varying from 20 μM (lower bound for measuring decline in NADH absorbance) to 1 mM, and data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Y = (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> × X)/(<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> + X)) using PRISM v. 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA).</p><p>For samples measuring TRIP13 ATPase activity after pre-incubation, proteins (4 μM concentration for all proteins) were pre-incubated for 2 hr at 20°C in assay buffer with or without ATP as above. Samples were then passed through a desalting spin column (Zeba-Spin, Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA) to remove remaining ATP and hydrolyzed ADP. Fresh ATP and coupled-assay master mix were then added and ATP hydrolysis measured as above.</p><p>To examine MAD2 conformational conversion by TRIP13, separately purified C-MAD2 monomer (R133A mutant), p31(comet), and TRIP13 were incubated at 20°C for 2 hr at 30 μM concentration (sixfold molar excess of p31(comet) and MAD2 to TRIP13 hexamers), in ATPase assay buffer (pH 7.5) with or without 2 mM ATP (166 μl reaction volume). Samples were diluted to 50 mM NaCl by the addition of buffer without NaCl, then loaded onto a 1 ml HiTrap Q HP column (GE Life Sciences) and eluted with a gradient to 400 mM NaCl. Fractions were collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining.</p><p>For measurement of MAD2 conversion rate by TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), pre-incubations were performed for 30 min at 37°C with 30 μM p31(comet), 30 μM MAD2 enriched for C-MAD2 (approximately 10 μM O-MAD2 and 20 μM C-MAD2), and the indicated amounts of TRIP13. Samples were separated by ion-exchange chromatography, and quantitation of Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE bands was performed. Background-subtracted relative intensities of O-MAD2 vs C-MAD2 (lanes 6–7) was performed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), and ratios were converted to quantities based on the total (MAD2) of 30 μM. (O-MAD2) was plotted vs (TRIP13 hexamer) in the range of (TRIP13) where the reaction was not saturated (up to 0.2 μM TRIP13 hexamer). Linear regression fitting was performed with PRISM v. 6 (GraphPad Software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Cleveland, A Desai, J Han, A Shiau, J Berger, and members of the Corbett lab for helpful discussions.

There are two interesting new findings: a pronounced type of asymmetry in the PCH-2 (TRIP13 homolog) AAA+ ATPase – two of the subunits in the hexametric arrangement are bound to sulfate, two are apparently apo, and two are bound to ADP, resulting in large conformational differences between the “small” subdomain of the AAA+ module.</p><p>A second important result is the finding that TRIP13 can induce a conformational change in its substrate MAD-2 (“closed” to “open”), via the adapter protein p31. This function of TRIP13 may play a role during mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation. In summary, this work provides new insights into the structure and function of TRIP13/PCH-2. However, there were some concerns about the interpretation and generality of the asymmetry observed in the crystal structure, and about the ATP hydrolysis experiments, as well as numerous suggestions on discussion of results from other groups on other systems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> implies that AAA domains A and D are in the apo state. Is this correct? Are there conformational differences between apo and ADP bound states?</p><p>2) Is it certain that A and D are apo? Please provide simulated annealing omit maps of the nucleotide binding regions of each of the six subunits.</p><p>3) Figure 2–figure supplement 2: The comparison to ClpX is problematic since in that structure all subunits were in the apo state.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: does p31 interact with TRIP13 alone? In the case of NSF/aSNAP/SNARE, the adapter aSNAP does not interact with NSF alone.</p><p>5) The negative-stain EM studies are rather low resolution, and no 3D reconstruction was attempted. It should be made clear in the text that these results are rather tentative considering the lack of a 3D reconstruction and the lack of a resolution estimate.</p><p>6) There are too many supplementary figures, making it hard to read this paper. <italic>eLife</italic> discourages use of supplementary figures unless they represent raw data or repeat data.

Mol. Cell 2002 and Sironi et al. EMBO J. 2002 (not to be confused with Sironi et al. EMBO J 2001, see below).</p><p>2) Tipton et al. (2013; JBC 286) were the first authors to demonstrate the interaction of BubR1 with C-MAD2 that p31comet interferes with. The authors may elect to cite this paper alongside <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al. 2012</xref>. The other two cited papers, albeit excellent, do not demonstrate the point the authors are discussing, i.e. the separation of C- MAD2 from BubR1. The reason to make this point is that the authors cite literature demonstrating a role of p31comet in MCC disassembly in a somewhat arbitrary and selective manner: there are quite a few additional papers making the point in addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Westhorpe et al. 2011</xref> and it is immediately clear why the authors pick one but not the others.</p><p>3) Discussion, first paragraph: The authors adopt an interpretation of the relative stability of O-MAD2 and C-MAD2 that is based on the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al. 2004</xref>. There is a second interpretation, discussed by Mapelli et al. COSB 2007, in which O-MAD2 is seen as being more stable than empty (without a ligand) C-MAD2, but much less stable than ligand-bound C-MAD2. In this view, O-MAD2 is not a metastable state, but rather the stable state of MAD2 in the absence of a binding partner. The authors should consider that both the dimerization of MAD2 (even residual dimerization as in the R133A mutant) and the binding of C-MAD2 to p31comet (which they use in their assay) influence very dramatically the O-MAD2:C-MAD2 equilibrium, and that measuring the relative energy of these two states is therefore very complex. These considerations should probably reverberate also on the authors' discussion on the amount of ATP used for the conversion reaction. If a ligand (e.g. Cdc20) were bound to C-MAD2, the stability of C-MAD2 would be much higher and probably the amount of ATP required for the conversion would be correspondingly higher. My feeling is that the low ATP requirements reported by the authors are essentially due to the fact that the empty C-MAD2 substrate they use is much less stable than a C-MAD2 bound to a substrate, and that all the energy essentially goes in disrupting the considerable stabilization to the C-MAD2 conformation provided by p31comet.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>1) TRIP13/PCH-2 is presented as a new AAA+ family, based on the observation that its N-terminal domain resembles those of classic remodelers, whereas its AAA+ domain shows stronger similarities to the HCLR clade of enzymes. The authors repeatedly emphasize that classic remodelers have a diverged mechanism for ATP-driven conformational changes, primarily due to the lack of a sensor-II Arg. However, to my knowledge there is no existing literature or strong data yet indicating a fundamental difference in mechanisms. Even the exact role of the sensor-II Arg is still unclear. Studies on Hsp104 suggested that the sensor-II Arg in NBD2 provides some extra nucleotide-binding energy but does not act to sense differences between nucleotides (Hattendorf and Lindquist, PNAS 99, 2002). In contrast, a sensor-II Arg mutation in ClpX allows normal ATP- or ADP binding but apparently prevents sensing of the nucleotide state (Joshi et al., NSMB 11, 2004).</p><p>The authors also discuss the distinctly asymmetric hexamer architecture of PCH-2 as an indication for a structural mechanism that is distinct from “classic remodelers”. However, FtsH, a member of the classic clade of AAA+ enzymes, also crystallized as an asymmetric hexamer that resembled a dimer of trimers (Bieniossek et al., PNAS 103, 2006). There may be several different reasons why some AAA+ enzymes crystallize in 2-fold symmetric hexamers, like TRIP13/PCH-2 or ClpX, whereas others are more symmetric or have a continuous spiral staircase arrangement of subunits. As shown by EM studies in this manuscript, ATP binding can already significantly influence ring symmetry, and substrate binding in the central pore may induce additional changes in subunit arrangement or vertical registers. Even for ClpX, for which there are numerous structures and functional data both in bulk and at the single-molecule level, it remains unclear whether during substrate processing the hexamer maintains a 2-fold symmetry or adopts a conformation that contains a continuum of nucleotide states and a corresponding spiral staircase arrangement of pore-loops around the ring.</p><p>I therefore suggest that the authors focus on the obvious differences and similarities in structure and sequence between TRIP13/PCH-2 and the HCLR or classic clades (including the sensor-II motif and Arg finger), without speculating and claiming too much about potential differences in the mechanisms of ATP-hydrolysis coupled conformational changes.</p><p>Related to this, the authors state: “Mutation of the putative Sensor-2 residue R385 in PCH-2 also results in the loss of nucleotide binding, illustrating the importance of this residue and further supporting a ClpX-like mechanism…”.</p><p>As mentioned above, ClpX with a mutation of the sensor-II Arg still has near wild-type affinity for ATP and ADP, and the authors should correct or clarify their statement to prevent confusion.</p><p>2) Even though it is tempting and reasonable to interpret the PCH-2 crystal structure with respect to potential structural intermediates adopted by individual subunits during the ATPase cycle, the authors should more strongly consider and discuss that this is still “only” an empty/ADP-bound structure. As indicated by the presented negative-stain EM as well as several previous studies on related AAA+ enzymes, ATP binding to the hexamer may significantly affect subunit conformations and ring topology. I assume the authors unsuccessfully tried to solve a PCH-2 crystal structure in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or for the Walker-B mutant in the presence of ATP, and therefore turned to negative stain EM. It would be worth mentioning that the crystallization of the ATP-bound state was unsuccessful.</p><p>3) In their discussion of potential nucleotide-driven conformational changes of PCH-2, pore-loop movements, and the strong similarities to the ClpX motor (in the subsection headed “Nucleotide-driven conformational changes in the PCH-2 hexamer” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>) the authors may include a recent paper by the Sauer group, indicating highly coordinated gripping and conformational changes of subunits in the ClpX hexamer (Iosefson et al., Nat Chem Bio 11, 2015). This is particularly relevant for the model of axial pore loop movements presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>.</p><p>4) The authors performed Michaelis-Menten analyses and calculated <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> for ATP hydrolysis by PCH-2 and TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the legend for Figure 1–figure supplement 2 it is mentioned that TRIP13 adopts a mixture of oligomeric states that shifts to higher molecular weight oligomers upon addition of ATP. For an accurate calculation of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> the question remains: how much TRIP13 was present in hexameric versus other states? It may be useful to measure the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on TRIP13 concentration to get an idea about the Kd for hexamerization and thereby increase confidence in the calculated <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> value.</p><p>For the measurement of C-MAD2 substrate turnover the authors varied the TRIP13 concentration and observed a linear dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), which suggests that the oligomeric state of TRIP13 did not change between 50 and 200 nM. However, it is possible that binding of p31/C-MAD2 to TRIP13 stabilizes the hexamer, especially because the single bound substrate-adaptor complex may bridge several TRIP13 subunits. It would therefore still be reasonable to assess the TRIP13-concentration dependence of ATP hydrolysis and get an idea about the extent of hexamers present under the experimental conditions used in the ATPase assay.</p><p>5) In the legend to Figure 1–figure supplement 2 the authors mention that the E253Q mutant of TRIP13 is predominantly hexameric both in the presence and the absence of ATP, suggesting that the mutation itself stabilizes the hexameric state. How did the authors determine that this mutant is indeed nucleotide-free when purified? Like other AAA+ enzymes TRIP13 may hold on to nucleotide during purification, even more so when it is hydrolysis-dead due to the Walker-B mutation.</p><p>6) It is a bit of a concern that the ATP-hydrolysis activity of PCH-2/TRIP13 is 90% inhibited at pH 7.5 compared to pH 8.5, and that the ATPase stimulation by p31/C-MAD2 can only be observed under these conditions. The authors should try to explain this behavior, as one would expect that the motor respond with a similar relative stimulation to the presence substrate in the central pore, independent of the pH and the corresponding basal ATPase rate. Does p31/C-MAD2 bind to TRIP13 with similar affinities at both pH 7.5 and 8.5? Currently there is no information in the figure legends or Materials and methods about the detailed buffer conditions used for SEC analyses of TRIP13/p31/MAD2 complex formation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and Figure 4–figure supplement 3 and 4.</p><p>The authors should for instance rule out that the observed ATPase stimulation by p31/C-MAD2 at pH 7.5 is simply due to a stabilization of the hexamer.</p><p>7) The authors show that only one p31/MAD2 complex binds to the TRIP13 hexamer, despite the presence of 6 N-terminal domains. A substrate delivery model is suggested in which p31 transiently interacts with the TRIP13 N-terminal domain before MAD2 directly binds in the central pore. However, currently this is largely speculation, and the authors should test this model by assessing the complex formation for the W221A pore loop mutant of TRIP13.</p><p>8) It is described in Materials and methods that “…optimal basal ATPase rates were obtained from protein treated during the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity purification step with 0.8 M urea, which removes the two ADP molecules bound to each hexamer…”.</p><p>It is unclear to me why the co-purified ADP needed to be removed prior to ATPase measurements, during which ADP is constantly generated and quickly turned into ATP by the regeneration system. Is this stripping step necessary to more accurately measure the PCH-2 concentration by UV absorbance? Or does PCH-2 with 2 bound ADP represent a trapped, inactive form of the hexamer, which may also be prevented by purifying PCH-2 in the presence of ATP?</p><p>9) The ATPase measurements for the W221A mutant of TRIP13 showed absolutely no response to the presence of p31 and MAD2 at 27°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but at 37°C there is a more than 30% increase in hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1C</xref>). The authors should try to explain those temperature-dependent differences in behavior.</p><p>10) In the Discussion section the authors discuss TRIP13's mode of substrate recognition, which seems to include an initial interaction of the p31 adaptor with the TRIP13 N-terminal domain, before the MAD2 substrate binds in the central pore. The authors state: “its mode of substrate recognition, which parallels not ClpX but a family of ‘classic remodelers’ including NSF, p97, and Pex1.” I am sure the Corbett group is aware that many ClpX substrates with N-terminal degradation signals initially interact with the ClpX N-terminal domain before they are transferred to the central pore, and ClpX adaptors also bind to the N-terminal domain for substrate delivery to the central pore. The overall process of substrate delivery to TRIP13 thus appears to strongly parallel the mechanisms of ClpX, even though there are differences in the architecture of the N-terminal domains.

The authors adopt an interpretation of the relative stability of O-MAD2 and C-MAD2 that is based on the studies of</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Luo et al. 2004</italic></xref><italic>. There is a second interpretation, discussed by Mapelli et al. COSB 2007, in which O-MAD2 is seen as being more stable than empty (without a ligand) C-MAD2, but much less stable than ligand-bound C-MAD2. In this view, O-MAD2 is not a metastable state, but rather the stable state of MAD2 in the absence of a binding partner. The authors should consider that both the dimerization of MAD2 (even residual dimerization as in the R133A mutant) and the binding of C-MAD2 to p31comet (which they use in their assay) influence very dramatically the O-MAD2:C-MAD2 equilibrium, and that measuring the relative energy of these two states is therefore very complex. These considerations should probably reverberate also on the authors' discussion on the amount of ATP used for the conversion reaction. If a ligand (e.g. Cdc20) were bound to C-MAD2, the stability of C-MAD2 would be much higher and probably the amount of ATP required for the conversion would be correspondingly higher. My feeling is that the low ATP requirements reported by the authors are essentially due to the fact that the empty C-MAD2 substrate they use is much less stable than a C-MAD2 bound to a substrate, and that all the energy essentially goes in disrupting the considerable stabilization to the C-MAD2 conformation provided by p31comet</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point, and we had not fully considered the complexity of the MAD2 energy landscape. To clarify the picture somewhat, we sought to determine the equilibrium levels of open and closed MAD2<sup>R133A</sup> in vitro, using our ion-exchange chromatography assay. We performed these tests in the absence of any binding partners (which we agree do significantly stabilize the C-MAD2 conformation). We incubated purified O-MAD2 or C-MAD2 24 hours at 37°C, then separated them by ion-exchange and quantified their relative levels. We find that both samples converge to ∼15% O-MAD2 and ∼85% C-MAD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that whatever the reason (dimerization, even residual dimerization as in MAD2<sup>R133A</sup>, could certainly promote conversion or at least stabilize the closed state), C-MAD2 is the preferred state in solution even in the absence of binding partners. Because of the complexity of this issue and our still-limited data, however, we have refrained from stating outright that C-MAD2 is more thermodynamically stable than O-MAD2.</p><p>Based on the above data and prior findings that O-MAD2 spontaneously converts to C-MAD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al. 2004</xref> and other references), we feel that our proposal that TRIP13 and p31(comet) may serve to maintain cellular MAD2 in the open state is still valid. Indeed, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al. (2004)</xref> and now explicitly noted in our discussion, essentially all free MAD2 in a HeLa cell extract is in the open state. Unless MAD2’s inherent conformational equilibrium is fundamentally different inside the cell versus outside, there will be a continuous (albeit slow) conversion of O-MAD2 to C-MAD2, which must be counteracted to avoid aberrant SAC activation, etc.</p><p>Apart from the above discussion, we agree with the reviewer that unliganded C-MAD2 is likely much less stable than liganded (or otherwise bound, e.g. to p31(comet) C-MAD2. We have added a sentence to the Results section (in the subsection headed “TRIP13 catalyzes the conversion of closed MAD2 to the open conformer”) pointing this out, and noting that conformational conversion of liganded C-MAD2 may take significantly more energy than what we measured.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) TRIP13/PCH-2 is presented as a new AAA+ family, based on the observation that its N-terminal domain resembles those of classic remodelers, whereas its AAA+ domain shows stronger similarities to the HCLR clade of enzymes. The authors repeatedly emphasize that classic remodelers have a diverged mechanism for ATP-driven conformational changes, primarily due to the lack of a sensor-II Arg. However, to my knowledge there is no existing literature or strong data yet indicating a fundamental difference in mechanisms. Even the exact role of the sensor-II Arg is still unclear. Studies on Hsp104 suggested that the sensor-II Arg in NBD2 provides some extra nucleotide-binding energy but does not act to sense differences between nucleotides (Hattendorf and Lindquist, PNAS 99, 2002). In contrast, a sensor-II Arg mutation in ClpX allows normal ATP- or ADP binding but apparently prevents sensing of the nucleotide state (Joshi et al., NSMB 11, 2004)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the evidence for diverged mechanisms between the “classic remodelers” and other AAA+ proteins is not clear, so have re-worded the discussion of these points throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors also discuss the distinctly asymmetric hexamer architecture of PCH-2 as an indication for a structural mechanism that is distinct from</italic> “<italic>classic remodelers</italic>”<italic>. However, FtsH, a member of the classic clade of AAA+ enzymes, also crystallized as an asymmetric hexamer that resembled a dimer of trimers (Bieniossek et al., PNAS 103, 2006). There may be several different reasons why some AAA+ enzymes crystallize in 2-fold symmetric hexamers, like TRIP13/PCH-2 or ClpX, whereas others are more symmetric or have a continuous spiral staircase arrangement of subunits. As shown by EM studies in this manuscript, ATP binding can already significantly influence ring symmetry, and substrate binding in the central pore may induce additional changes in subunit arrangement or vertical registers. Even for ClpX, for which there are numerous structures and functional data both in bulk and at the single-molecule level, it remains unclear whether during substrate processing the hexamer maintains a 2-fold symmetry or adopts a conformation that contains a continuum of nucleotide states and a corresponding spiral staircase arrangement of pore-loops around the ring</italic>.</p><p><italic>I therefore suggest that the authors focus on the obvious differences and similarities in structure and sequence between TRIP13/PCH-2 and the HCLR or classic clades (including the sensor-II motif and Arg finger), without speculating and claiming too much about potential differences in the mechanisms of ATP-hydrolysis coupled conformational changes</italic>.</p><p>We have restructured both the Results and Discussion sections on these points, with a clarified discussion of our findings and less speculation about the mechanistic uniqueness of Pch2/TRIP13.</p><p><italic>Related to this, the authors state:</italic> “<italic>Mutation of the putative Sensor-2 residue R385 in PCH-2 also results in the loss of nucleotide binding, illustrating the importance of this residue and further supporting a ClpX-like mechanism…</italic>”.</p><p><italic>As mentioned above, ClpX with a mutation of the sensor-II Arg still has near wild-type affinity for ATP and ADP, and the authors should correct or clarify their statement to prevent confusion</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the reference to ClpX in this sentence, and instead simply point out that the loss of nucleotide binding affinity in the R385 mutant strongly supports its identification as a Sensor-2 motif.</p><p><italic>2) Even though it is tempting and reasonable to interpret the PCH-2 crystal structure with respect to potential structural intermediates adopted by individual subunits during the ATPase cycle, the authors should more strongly consider and discuss that this is still</italic> “<italic>only</italic>” <italic>an empty/ADP-bound structure. As indicated by the presented negative-stain EM as well as several previous studies on related AAA+ enzymes, ATP binding to the hexamer may significantly affect subunit conformations and ring topology. I assume the authors unsuccessfully tried to solve a PCH-2 crystal structure in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or for the Walker-B mutant in the presence of ATP, and therefore turned to negative stain EM. It would be worth mentioning that the crystallization of the ATP-bound state was unsuccessful</italic>.</p><p>While our EM analysis was conducted alongside crystallization trials, the reviewer is correct that we tried extensively to determine the structure of nucleotide-bound PCH-2, so far without success. Generally, we found that regardless of the added nucleotide, the resulting crystals adopted the same form as that determined here. After determining the Apo/ADP structure and then developing a method to strip out the bound nucleotide (see response to question 8 below), we were likely more successful in exchanging the nucleotide, but thus far we have not obtained crystals of protein treated in this manner. We now note our unsuccessful attempts to determine the PCH-2 structure in the presence of nucleotides in the subsection headed “Nucleotide-driven conformational changes in the PCH-2 hexamer” of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) In their discussion of potential nucleotide-driven conformational changes of PCH-2, pore-loop movements, and the strong similarities to the ClpX motor (in the subsection headed “Nucleotide-driven conformational changes in the PCH-2 hexamer” and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F, G</italic></xref><italic>) the authors may include a recent paper by the Sauer group, indicating highly coordinated gripping and conformational changes of subunits in the ClpX hexamer (Iosefson et al., Nat Chem Bio 11, 2015).

In the legend for Figure 1–figure supplement 2 it is mentioned that TRIP13 adopts a mixture of oligomeric states that shifts to higher molecular weight oligomers upon addition of ATP. For an accurate calculation of</italic> k<sub>cat</sub> <italic>the question remains: how much TRIP13 was present in hexameric versus other states?

However, it is possible that binding of p31/C-MAD2 to TRIP13 stabilizes the hexamer, especially because the single bound substrate-adaptor complex may bridge several TRIP13 subunits. It would therefore still be reasonable to assess the TRIP13-concentration dependence of ATP hydrolysis and get an idea about the extent of hexamers present under the experimental conditions used in the ATPase assay</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we measured the concentration dependence of TRIP13’s basal ATPase activity at both pH 7.5 and 8.5. The results, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> (from triplicate measurements), indicate that within the TRIP13 concentration range we can reasonably test at each pH, the ATPase rate varies linearly with TRIP13 concentration (R<sup>2</sup> values for both linear regression fits were 0.998). The slopes of these lines, which correspond to ATP’s hydrolyzed per minute per TRIP13 hexamer, are 3.36 at pH 7.5 and 8.64 at pH 8.5, close to the values reported in the manuscript. These data support the idea that wild-type TRIP13 is mostly hexameric in the ATPase assay conditions. We have noted this point in the Methods section (in the subsection headed “ATPase and MAD2 conversion assays”) as unpublished data.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07367.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07367.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07367.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07367-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) In the legend to Figure 1–figure supplement 2 the authors mention that the E253Q mutant of TRIP13 is predominantly hexameric both in the presence and the absence of ATP, suggesting that the mutation itself stabilizes the hexameric state. How did the authors determine that this mutant is indeed nucleotide-free when purified? Like other AAA+ enzymes TRIP13 may hold on to nucleotide during purification, even more so when it is hydrolysis-dead due to the Walker-B mutation</italic>.</p><p>We were also concerned about this point, so have done some analysis to convince ourselves that TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> is indeed “Apo” when purified. When we purify TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> from <italic>E. coli</italic> (without adding nucleotides), the final size-exclusion step shows a major hexamer peak, and a minor monomer peak. During concentration and 4°C storage of the hexamer peak, extensive precipitation occurs, which can be eliminated by the addition of a nucleotide of our choice. This implies that the protein is not already bound to nucleotide when purified (or at least is not fully occupied), but is then stabilized upon the addition of nucleotides. Further, we have measured the UV absorbance spectrum for purified TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> prior to nucleotide addition, and we obtain an A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio of 0.651. From a theoretical calculation of TRIP13’s UV absorbance from the spectra of Trp, Tyr, and Phe, we obtain a theoretical A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio of 0.682 for Apo protein, 0.786 for a TRIP13 hexamer bound to two nucleotides (as in PCH-2), and 0.977 for a hexamer bound to six nucleotides. Therefore, we are confident that TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> is in the Apo state when purified.</p><p>A useful comparison can be made to the case of PCH-2, which does stably bind two ADP molecules per hexamer through the purification, except if treated with small amounts of denaturant during the initial Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity step (see response to point 8 below). We can clearly observe the two bound ADP’s, and their removal by denaturant treatment, by UV/Vis spectroscopy in that case.</p><p><italic>6) It is a bit of a concern that the ATP-hydrolysis activity of PCH-2/TRIP13 is 90% inhibited at pH 7.5 compared to pH 8.5, and that the ATPase stimulation by p31/C-MAD2 can only be observed under these conditions. The authors should try to explain this behavior, as one would expect that the motor respond with a similar relative stimulation to the presence substrate in the central pore, independent of the pH and the corresponding basal ATPase rate. Does p31/C-MAD2 bind to TRIP13 with similar affinities at both pH 7.5 and 8.5? Currently there is no information in the figure legends or Materials and methods about the detailed buffer conditions used for SEC analyses of TRIP13/p31/MAD2 complex formation presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref> <italic>and Figure 4–figure supplement 3 and 4</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors should for instance rule out that the observed ATPase stimulation by p31/C-MAD2 at pH 7.5 is simply due to a stabilization of the hexamer</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the pH dependence of PCH-2/TRIP13 activity and stimulation by p31(comet):MAD2 is initially somewhat confusing. Is not the case, however, that there is no observed stimulation of PCH-2/TRIP13 by p31(comet):MAD2 at pH 8.5; only that the stimulation factor is not as high. For example, a TRIP13 hexamer hydrolyzes ∼2.5 ATP/min in the basal state versus ∼11 when stimulated at pH 7.5 (4X stimulation), versus a basal rate of 9 ATP/min and stimulated rate of ∼19 ATP/min at pH 8.5 (2X stimulation; not shown in manuscript). The stimulated rates at each pH also agree well with the basal rate of TRIP13 W221A (11 ATP/min at pH 7.5, 19 ATP/min at pH 8.5). We interpret these results as indicating that at pH 8.5, even without p31(comet):MAD2, PCH-2/TRIP13 is working closer to its maximum capacity than at pH 7.5, so the observed stimulation is lower as a result. We feel that the basal and stimulated ATPase rates measured at pH 7.5 are more relevant to the cellular context; however when initially characterizing these enzymes’ ATPase rates and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> values, we sought to maximize the enzyme’s basal hydrolysis rate for easier characterization.</p><p>As noted above, we have added a new section to the Methods describing the conditions for our size exclusion analyses. This analysis was indeed done at pH 7.5, close to the conditions used for ATPase stimulation of PCH-2/TRIP13.</p><p>To address the point about hexamer stabilization and its effects on ATPase stimulation, we note two points: 1) While the TRIP13 hexamer is unstable, PCH-2 is a stable hexamer in all conditions, and we see the same general trend in pH-dependent changes in stimulation for PCH-2 as TRIP13 (for PCH-2, 1.7-fold stimulation at pH 7.5 versus 1.2-fold stimulation at pH 8.5; not shown in manuscript). 2) As mentioned above, we tested the concentration dependence of ATP hydrolysis by TRIP13 at both pH 7.5 and 8.5, and the results indicate that in our ATPase assay conditions, TRIP13 is likely to be fully hexameric even in the absence of p31(comet):MAD2.</p><p><italic>7) The authors show that only one p31/MAD2 complex binds to the TRIP13 hexamer, despite the presence of 6 N-terminal domains. A substrate delivery model is suggested in which p31 transiently interacts with the TRIP13 N-terminal domain before MAD2 directly binds in the central pore. However, currently this is largely speculation, and the authors should test this model by assessing the complex formation for the W221A pore loop mutant of TRIP13</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and was indeed an experiment that we initially attempted. For these experiments, we have used the TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> mutant, which forms a stable hexamer by size exclusion. We generated the TRIP13<sup>E253Q/W221A</sup> double mutant in order to test the role of the pore loop in p31(comet):MAD2 binding but found that, unexpectedly, this mutant does not form a stable hexamer like the TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> mutant (as judged by elution on a size exclusion column in the presence of nucleotide). Instead, its behavior appears more similar to both wild-type TRIP13 and TRIP13<sup>W221A</sup>, which both adopt a mixture of oligomeric states whose migration on a size-exclusion column is not clearly distinct from that of p31(comet):MAD2. Thus, we were unable to accurately judge complex formation in the TRIP13<sup>E253Q/W221A</sup> double mutant using elution-volume shifts on a size exclusion column. We have now noted this result in the text at the end of the subsection entitled “p31(comet) functions as an adapter between MAD2 and TRIP13”.</p><p>The behavior of the TRIP13<sup>E253Q/W221A</sup> mutant is somewhat mysterious, and a full explanation will likely require a more comprehensive analysis of the <italic>M. musculus</italic> TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup> hexamer’s conformation. We note that the TRIP13<sup>W221A</sup> single mutant has comparable activity to fully-stimulated TRIP13, strongly supporting the notion that it can form active hexamers. Also, <italic>C. elegans</italic> PCH-2<sup>W221A</sup> forms stable hexamers as in wild-type PCH-2, indicating that this mutant does not significantly disrupt PCH-2 structure. We are currently pursuing several avenues for structural analysis of TRIP13, which may explain how the W221A mutation can disrupt the stable hexamer state adopted by TRIP13<sup>E253Q</sup>.</p><p><italic>8) It is described in Materials and methods that</italic> “<italic>…optimal basal ATPase rates were obtained from protein treated during the Ni</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>-affinity purification step with 0.8 M urea, which removes the two ADP molecules bound to each hexamer…</italic>”.</p><p><italic>It is unclear to me why the co-purified ADP needed to be removed prior to ATPase measurements, during which ADP is constantly generated and quickly turned into ATP by the regeneration system. Is this stripping step necessary to more accurately measure the PCH-2 concentration by UV absorbance? Or does PCH-2 with 2 bound ADP represent a trapped, inactive form of the hexamer, which may also be prevented by purifying PCH-2 in the presence of ATP</italic>?</p><p>Based on our experience with PCH-2, we believe that the reviewer is most likely correct in labeling the ADP/Apo state we crystallized as a “trapped, inactive form of the hexamer.” This has stymied crystallization of PCH-2 with other nucleotides (as noted above), as well as initial ATPase activity assays. We found that the urea treatment gave maximally active PCH-2, likely because the ADP/Apo state is remarkably stable; the two ADP molecules imaged in our crystal structure remained bound to PCH-2 during a two-day protein purification (including four chromatography steps and multiple buffer exchanges) and several days in the crystallization conditions. It is likely that incubation in an ATP-regenerating system would eventually give maximally active protein, but the amount of time required for this activation would be prohibitive.</p><p>As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>, the A<sub>280</sub> of purified PCH-2 changes very little after stripping out the bound nucleotides; however, it is clear from changes in A<sub>260/280</sub> ratio that the treatment does indeed have the desired effect.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref> describes the stripping of nucleotide from PCH-2<sup>E253Q</sup>, intended for crystallization trials.

The A<sub>260/280</sub> ratios of the urea-treated sample agreed with the theoretical value calculated for PCH-2 protein based on amino acid content (0.689 measured versus 0.701 theoretical), and the ratio for untreated PCH-2 matched the theoretical value calculated for a PCH-2 hexamer bound to two ADP molecules (0.825 measured versus 0.818 theoretical), as observed in our crystal structure of untreated wild-type protein.

The authors should try to explain those temperature-dependent differences in behavior</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting point, and one that we cannot readily explain. It is possible that the W221A mutant is not entirely defective in substrate recognition and engagement, and that the mutation’s effect varies somewhat at different temperatures. Even at 37°C, the mutant has much higher basal ATPase activity than wild-type TRIP13. Also, in our MAD2 conversion assays—performed at 37°C—showed no activity for TRIP13<sup>W221A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom panel), indicating that even if this mutant is somewhat stimulated by p31(comet):MAD2 at 37°C, it is still unable to mediate C-MAD2 to O-MAD2 conversion.</p><p><italic>10) In the Discussion section the authors discuss TRIP13's mode of substrate recognition, which seems to include an initial interaction of the p31 adaptor with the TRIP13 N-terminal domain, before the MAD2 substrate binds in the central pore.

The overall process of substrate delivery to TRIP13 thus appears to strongly parallel the mechanisms of ClpX, even though there are differences in the architecture of the N-terminal domains. The authors should clarify or correct their statement to prevent confusion</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and have altered the sentence in question to read: “…its mode of substrate recognition, which is mediated by an N-terminal domain related to a family of ‘classic remodelers’ including NSF, p97, and PEX1.”</p><p><italic>11) There is a mistake in a figure reference in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “p31(comet) functions as an adapter between MAD2 and TRIP13</italic>”<italic>.
