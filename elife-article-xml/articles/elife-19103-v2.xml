diverse functions. Although the striatum is thought to consist of sensorimotor, associative and limbic domains, their precise demarcations and whether additional functional subdivisions exist remain unclear. How striatal inputs are differentially segregated into each domain is also poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive map of the excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum. The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas. Optogenetic experiments show the subregion-specific heterogeneity in the synaptic properties of striatal inputs from both the cortex and the thalamus. This projectome will guide functional studies investigating diverse striatal functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19103.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19103.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19103.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To fully understand how the brain works, we need to understand how different brain structures are organized and how information flows between these structures. For example, the cortex and thalamus communicate with another structure known as the basal ganglia, which is essential for controlling voluntary movement, emotions and reward behaviour in humans and other mammals. Information from the cortex and the thalamus enters the basal ganglia at an area called the striatum. This area is further divided into smaller functional regions known as domains that sort sensorimotor, emotion and executive information into the basal ganglia to control different types of behaviour. Three such domains have been identified in the striatum of mice. However, the boundaries between these domains are vague and it is not clear whether any other domains exist or if the domains can actually be divided into even smaller areas with more precise roles.</p><p>Information entering the striatum from other parts of the brain can either stimulate activity in the striatum (known as an “excitatory input”) or alter existing excitatory inputs. Now, Hunnicutt et al. present the first comprehensive map of excitatory inputs into the striatum of mice. The experiments show that while many of the excitatory inputs flowing into the striatum from the cortex and thalamus are sorted into the three known domains, a unique combination of the excitatory inputs are sorted into a new domain instead. One of the original three domains of the striatum is known to relay information related to associative learning, for example, linking an emotion to a person or place. Hunnicutt et al. show that this domain has a more complex architecture than the other domains, being made up of many distinct areas. This complexity may help it to process the various types of information required to make such associations.</p><p>The findings of Hunnicutt et al. provide a framework for understanding how the striatum works in healthy and diseased brains. Since faulty information processing in the striatum is a direct cause of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and other neurological disorders in humans, this framework may aid the development of new treatments for these disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19103.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19103.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>striatal circuitry</kwd><kwd>thalamostriatal projections</kwd><kwd>mesoscopic connectome</kwd><kwd>corticostriatal projections</kwd><kwd>striatal subdivisions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunnicutt</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2OD008425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS094247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Tianyi</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS081071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Tianyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first comprehensive map of all excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum is presented and used to define and demarcate striatal subdivisions, including a previous unappreciated novel subdivision in the posterior striatum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basal ganglia play an essential role in movement control and action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graybiel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Packard and Knowlton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>). Their primary input station — the striatum — sorts contextual, motor, and reward information from its two major excitatory input sources, the cortex and the thalamus, into specific downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berendse and Groenewegen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerfen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerfen and Wilson, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerfen and Bolam, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). The thalamus, which extensively interconnects with the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sherman and Guillery, 2009</xref>), is also a primary output target of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haber and Calzavara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>). Knowledge of the precise circuits and organizational principles between the cortex, thalamus, and striatum is essential for the mechanistic dissection of how these structures orchestrate function.</p><p>Neuronal circuits within large brain structures, such as the cortex and the thalamus, are organized around functional subregions. For example, the cortex contains many distinct functional areas, including the sensory subregions, which are defined by specific sensory inputs, and the motor subregions, which are defined by intracortical microstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Waters, 1991</xref>). The thalamic subregions have traditionally been defined by cytoarchitectural boundaries to delineate ~40 nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones, 2007</xref>). In contrast, the spatial organization of the striatum is poorly defined, particularly in mice. The striatum is thought to contain three functional domains: the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic domains, which approximately correspond to the dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventral striatum, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruber and McDonald, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al., 2005</xref>). However, the precise demarcations between these striatal domains remain unclear, and it is not known whether each striatal domain contains finer levels of organization. Notably, although the striatum extends a significant length along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis (~4 mm in mice), the existence of domain heterogeneity along this axis remains elusive.</p><p>Although the striatum lacks accepted domain demarcations, it is known to have stereotypic excitatory input patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Averbeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berendse et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kincaid and Wilson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985</xref>). For example, in primates, the motor cortex has been shown to project to the rostral putamen, which corresponds to the rostral dorsolateral striatum, whereas the premotor cortex projects to the rostral caudate, which corresponds to the rostral dorsomedial striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Künzle, 1975</xref>). Investigation of the topographic arrangement of corticostriatal inputs from selected cortical subregions, or to isolated parts of the striatum have also been initiated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). However, the precise projection patterns from most cortical subregions to the entire striatum remain to be systematically characterized. Furthermore, the organization of thalamostriatal inputs, which provide ~1/3 of all glutamatergic synapses in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2014</xref>), has been less studied. In primates, the centromedian/parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex of the thalamus has been the main focus in studies of thalamostriatal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">François et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), yet less is known about the thalamostriatal projections from other thalamic subregions.</p><p>The lack of systematic anatomical maps of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal inputs has stymied efforts to dissect the cortico-thalamo-striatal triangular circuits. For example, recent functional studies suggest that corticostriatal and thalamostriatal axons differ in their release probability and plasticity properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smeal et al., 2007</xref>), but the precise differences have been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smeal et al., 2007</xref>). This controversy raises the possibility of heterogeneity within axons originating from different cortical or thalamic subregions in their synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). A comprehensive excitatory input wiring diagram will provide a road map to enable systematic examination of the differential function of individual inputs. In addition, since the excitatory input patterns are thought to be stereotypic in the striatum, we reasoned that the striatal subregions and their boundaries may be revealed by systematic analysis of these input patterns from individual cortical and thalamic subregions.</p><p>Here, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive description of cortical and thalamic inputs to the mouse striatum. This is achieved by integrating an in-house comprehensive thalamic anterograde projection dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>) and a selected cortical projection dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences (AIBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). Analyses of this striatal excitatory input wiring diagram revealed clear boundaries separating the three traditional striatal domains and uncovered a fourth subdivision in the posterior striatum. The dorsomedial striatum exhibited the highest degree of cortical input heterogeneity, suggesting that this subdivision serves as an information hub. In addition, thalamic subregions receiving basal ganglia outputs are preferentially interconnected with motor-related cortical subregions. With all the pathways tested, the anatomically described corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections were confirmed to be functional using optogenetic approaches. Importantly, striatal inputs originating from different cortical or thalamic subregions form synapses in the striatum with distinct plasticity properties. Our findings lay the foundation for understanding the function of the striatum and its interactions with the cortex and the thalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Integration of cortical and thalamic injection datasets</title><p>In order to obtain a comprehensive excitatory map of the striatum, two viral-based anterograde fluorescent-tracing datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) were analyzed and combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

typical size of a viral injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>) and many of them have complex boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones, 2007</xref>). To overcome this problem, we used a whole brain image dataset produced from 218 highly overlapping viral injections that covered &gt;93% of the thalamic volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>). The overlapping injections allow for the determination of the thalamic origins of projections in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–g</xref>) with finer resolution than the viral injection volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>). Strong fluorescent signal derived from fasciculated axons that originate from the thalamus and travel through the striatum to reach their cortical targets was presented in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These axons do not form synaptic connections in the striatum, as confirmed by channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-mediated photostimulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>), and therefore, their fluorescent signal needed to be removed. The fasciculated axons have distinct morphological features compared to the defasciculated axons which do form synaptic connections with medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). We applied a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify these morphological features and remove the fluorescent signal from fasciculated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The resulting striatal input maps were aligned to the AIBS averaged template brain (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and thalamostriatal projections were localized using a semi-automated image segmentation method and custom-developed algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The resulting dataset describes the axonal projection patterns in the striatum that originate from individual thalamic injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Corticostriatal input distribution patterns</title><p>Corticostriatal projections are known to have two functionally distinct types of innervation patterns: a core projection field of densely packed terminals and a larger diffuse (i.e. sparse) projection field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>). To examine these different patterns, cortical projections within each downsampled striatal voxel were classified as one of three graded densities: dense, moderate, and diffuse projections, which were defined as over 20%, 5%, and 0.5%, respectively, of original imaging voxels containing fluorescent axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref> and Materials and methods).</p><p>For each cortical subregion, a maximum projection density map throughout the striatum was determined by combining projection distributions from all injections within a given cortical subregion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each projection distribution was quantified in the dorsal-ventral (D-V), anterior-posterior (A-P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and medial-lateral (M-L) (data not shown) axes. Each cortical subregion gave rise to a distinct projection pattern in the striatum, forming either one or two contiguous volumes. While no two projection maps were identical, some were similar. For example, the somatosensory and motor subregions, including FrA, M1/2, and S1/2, exhibit similar projection patterns, producing dense, highly overlapping projection fields in a large volume of the central portion of the striatum in the A-P axis. These projections were biased toward the lateral striatum, likely including the traditionally-termed dorsolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). In contrast, frontal subregions, including LO/VO, IL, and MO/PrL, have smaller, largely non-overlapping dense projections in the anterior, medial striatum and diffuse projections that span a larger striatal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). When injections were further grouped according to their locations in either the A-P or M-L axis, we observed a moderate trend for topographic organization in the A-P and M-L axes for the dense projections, but this was not seen for diffuse projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, even the dense projections from such grouping often resulted in several discrete, non-contiguous projection fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and e</xref>), which are not as well defined as the cortical subregion-specific projection fields, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19103.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive mapping of cortical inputs to the striatum.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coronal section outlines for one hemisphere of the striatum (starting 1.8 mm anterior to bregma and continuing posterior in 300 µm steps, AIBS atlas).

For example, Ptl, Rsp, IL, and Sub have very little projection overlap with the motor areas M1/2 or FrA. In contrast, several cortical subregions, such as the motor (FrA and M1/2) and select sensory (S1/2 and AI/GI/DI) subregions, have a high level of convergence for both diffuse and dense projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Thalamostriatal inputs and their convergence with corticostriatal inputs</title><p>To localize the projection distribution for each thalamic injection, we developed a semi-automated image segmentation method to identify axonal projections in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and Materials and methods).

Each thalamic confidence map describes the likelihood that a given thalamic volume projects to a given striatal volume with a resolution finer than the size of individual injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This process was repeated for all cortical subregions, producing a complete map of striatal convergence for corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19103.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of the origins of thalamostriatal projections that converge with a corticostriatal projection in the striatum.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic sagittal view of the mouse brain, adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watson et al., 2012</xref>), indicating the location of M1/2.

The results indicate that distinct striatal subdivisions receive different numbers of converging cortical inputs and that there are distinct differences between dense and diffuse projection convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Nearly all striatal voxels receive diffuse projection from at least five cortical subregions, with an average of 8.3 cortical inputs converging per voxel. When the striatal voxels were subdivided based on the average convergence level, two distinct subdivisions formed. A large, contiguous subdivision, constituting ~63% of the ipsilateral, is innervated by diffuse projections from a high number of cortical subregions (10.7 ± 1.1 inputs per voxel, mean ± s.d.), and a second subdivision receiving diffuse projections from a low number of cortical subregions (6.6 ± 0.84 inputs per voxel, mean ± s.d.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Interestingly, when we constructed thalamic confidence maps to localize the thalamic subregions innervating the ipsilateral striatum receiving either a high (&gt;8.3 inputs) or a low (≤8.3 inputs) level of cortical convergence, the striatal subdivision with high cortical input convergence was found to receive inputs from every thalamic nucleus shown to project to the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, the striatal subdivision with low input convergence does not receive any input from the anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). For dense corticostriatal projections, a lower level of convergence was observed (2.7 ± 0.4 inputs per voxel, mean ± s.d.), as expected since dense projections cover a smaller volume. However, their convergence exhibits a different distribution pattern from that of the diffuse projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For example, a higher level of convergence of the diffuse projections is observed in the dorsal striatum, whereas dense projection convergence is biased toward the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the striatal subdivisions with either high or low cortical input convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>) could be attributed to evolutionary differences in the cortical inputs, we mapped the projection distributions for the evolutionarily distinct classes of the cortical plate: neocortex, mesocortex, and allocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), which carry predominantly sensory/motor, associative, and limbic information, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>). We found that, instead of a single class, the striatal subdivision with high cortical convergence always received input from multiple cortical classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Additionally, the thalamostriatal inputs that converge with each cortical class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b–c</xref>) did not mimic the thalamostriatal inputs that converge with striatal subdivisions based on high/low input convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>).

Since the above analyses indicate heterogeneity in excitatory input integration across the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and cortical input patterns are thought to be stereotypic across animals, we sought to subdivide the striatum using an objective and functionally relevant approach based on corticostriatal projection patterns. The striatum was downsampled to a voxel size of 150 µm x 150 µm x 150 µm, and the projection density within each voxel was calculated for all cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

Cortical subregions were analogously clustered based on their projections to individual striatal voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

A slightly lower threshold produced three clusters that are highly reminiscent of the three traditional striatal domains: a dorsomedial subdivision with highly convergent inputs, a lateral subdivision receiving dense sensorimotor innervation, and a ventral subdivision receiving several limbic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>). Notably, the ventral subdivision contains two non-contiguous segments: a ventral segment in the anterior striatum and the most posterior segment of the striatum, suggesting that they may represent two different domains. Indeed, when the threshold was lowered to create a fourth cluster, the posterior segment became a distinct cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Although this posterior subdivision shares similarities with the limbic domain, it also receives strong auditory and visual innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This posterior cluster may constitute a previously unappreciated functional subdivision of the striatum in mice. Further lowering the threshold to produce 13 clusters divided the dorsomedial subdivision, as well as a small portion of the lateral subdivision immediately adjacent to the dorsomedial subdivision, into many smaller clusters without dividing the remaining three subdivisions (see the small clusters at the dorsomedial striatum in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), indicating a high degree of input heterogeneity in this region. When the threshold was lowered to produce 15 clusters, the posterior and ventral subdivisions are each separated into two clusters, where one cluster receives motor and somatosensory information and the other cluster does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>). Importantly, even with the low threshold generating 15 clusters, the majority of the lateral subdivision, likely corresponding to the traditional sensorimotor domain, remained as a single large cluster, suggesting a highly homogeneous functional role for this region.</p><p>We also determined the origins of thalamic inputs to each cluster-defined striatal subdivision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The thalamic inputs largely project to striatal clusters in accordance with the known thalamic nuclear groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b–c</xref>). For example, when the striatum is divided into four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>), the dorsomedial subdivision receives input primarily from the anterior nuclear group, the ventral subdivision receives most of its inputs from the midline and medial nuclear groups, the lateral subdivision receives inputs from the ventral, intralaminar, posterior, and medial nuclear groups, while the posterior subdivision receives only weak thalamic input from the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b–c</xref>). To verify that the convergent inputs to each subdivision were accurately localized, retrograde bead injections were performed in portions of the dorsomedial and posterior subdivisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>). All cortical and thalamic subregions labeled by the retrograde injections were predicted by our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4c–h</xref>). The unique cortical and thalamic input patterns to different striatal clusters suggest that each cluster may serve distinct functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Circuit properties of the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop</title><p>In addition to being a major input source to the striatum, the thalamus is also one of the primary output targets of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haber and Calzavara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, the thalamus extensively interconnects with the cortex, thereby creating a cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To obtain a complete picture of the organization of this circuit, we overlaid the thalamic confidence map for thalamocortical projections to a given cortical subregion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>) with the thalamic confidence map for thalamostriatal projections that target the striatal field innervated by the same cortical subregion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> shows a representative example of this overlay process corresponding to the somatosensory cortices (S1/2) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for all cortical subregions).

To include corticothalamic connections, preprocessed data describing the density of projections in the thalamus for each cortical injection examined herein were downloaded from the AIBS application programming interface (API) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/</ext-link>, see Materials and methods). These corticothalamic data were integrated into our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>, green), providing a crucial feedback pathway necessary to fully understand excitatory connectivity within the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit.</p><p>Corticocortical connections provide another possible path for information integration within this circuit. It has been proposed that cortical subregions whose projections converge in the striatum are more strongly interconnected than subregions that do not converge and non-converging cortical subregions are less interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeterian and Van Hoesen, 1978</xref>), which may maintain information segregation. To test the hypothesis that cortical subregions that converge in the striatum are more strongly cortically connected, the same preprocessed AIBS API datasets that were used to map the corticothalamic projections were also used to determine the density of projections between each cortical subregion. Cortical subregions whose projections converge &gt;20% within the striatal projection fields of each other are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b–p</xref>. The primary convergent subregions are indicated with a darker color, and projections are shown as ribbons between subregions, where dark ribbons indicate connections between two primary convergent subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b–p</xref>). As shown, primary convergent inputs with most cortical subregions form distributed cortical networks, for example frontal subregions IL and d/vACC are more interconnected with cortical subregions that they do not converge with in the striatum. However, some areas, such as FrA, M1/2, S1/2, and AI form highly recurrent networks with convergent subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b–p</xref>). These varied connectivity patterns suggest that different pathways through the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit may have different levels of information integration, supporting the existence of both open- and closed-loop circuits.</p><p>To complete the investigation of the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit, the thalamocortical, thalamostriatal, corticothalamic, and corticocortical data were compared for MD, ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL), ventromedial nucleus (VM), and Pf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), which are the main thalamic targets of the basal ganglia output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deniau and Chevalier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McFarland and Haber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). A full circuit map shows the relative levels of input convergence between cortical and thalamic subregions, as well as with the basal ganglia output targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>), and by focusing on connectivity related to specific subregions, information flow can be traced through the circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). For example, these comparisons reveal that the motor cortex (M1/2) directly innervates, receives projections from, and converges in the striatum with all of thalamic nuclei that receive basal ganglia output. This extensive interconnectivity of the thalamic nuclei innervated by the basal ganglia with motor-related cortical and striatal subregions, particularly M1/2 and FrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggests the importance of cortical motor information for basal ganglia function. In contrast, the orbital cortices (LO/VO) are highly interconnected with MD, VM, and, to a lesser extent, with VAL, but there are no direct corticothalamic or thalamocortical interactions between LO/VO and Pf. Thus, although LO/VO plays an important role in this circuit, it does not display the ubiquitous connectivity pattern seen with M1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, whereas S1/2 is interconnected with VM, Pf, and VAL, it does not send or receive MD projections directly, even though both S1/2 and MD send converging axons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The thalamic origins of projections to each striatal subdivision and the thalamocortical projections to the cortical subregions associated with the same striatal subdivision largely overlap. Thus, nearly all thalamic nuclei that target a given striatal subdivision also send projections to at least one of the cortical subregions that forms a primary input to that striatal subdivision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–f</xref>, white). This suggests a strong relationship between the thalamus and the cortex for subdivision-specific input integration in the striatum. In contrast, the projection field of corticothalamic feedback within each network at the thalamus only partially overlaps with the thalamocortical or thalamostriatal projecting nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>, cf. green and white/cyan). These data provide further evidence that the striatal clusters identified in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) represent functionally relevant striatal subdivisions, and give evidence for robust integration of cortical and thalamic information within each subdivision-associated cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Anatomical inputs to the striatum are functional</title><p>The striatal subdivisions described here were defined by their excitatory input patterns, leading us to investigate the functional differences between individual cortical and thalamic inputs to the striatum.

However, the precise synaptic properties of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal inputs differed qualitatively across studies. To determine if these discrepancies were due to a lack of subregion specificity when stimulating cortical or thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>), we examined the synaptic properties of Thal1, Thal2, d/vACC, and Vis inputs to MSNs in the DM striatal subdivision.</p><p>By using a paired-pulse ratio (PPR) experiment to examine the presynaptic release probability, we found that paired-pulse photostimulation of Thal1 axons resulted in facilitation of synaptic transmission onto MSNs, whereas Thal2 axons showed synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d–e</xref>). Consistently, repetitive photostimulation (10 stimuli, 20 Hz) of the two thalamic inputs resulted in sustained Thal1 EPSCs with larger relative magnitude than those evoked by Thal2 axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1f–g</xref>). Moreover, a sustained slow current, which is evident even in singly evoked EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c</xref>) in Thal1 inputs, but not in Thal2 inputs, contributed to an overall increased charge transfer during the consecutive photostimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Similarly, different cortical projections to the DM striatal subdivision also exhibited heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b–h</xref>). The PPR of Vis inputs exhibited strong synaptic depression, which was not observed in d/vACC inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c and e</xref>). Repetitive photostimulation of Vis or d/vACC inputs resulted in similar levels of synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1f</xref>). However, repetitive stimulation d/vACC, but not Vis inputs, resulted in a prominent slow sustained current that led to increased charge transfer at d/vACC–DM synapses relative to Vis–DM synapses over consecutive photostimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Thus, the discrepancies observed across previous studies may be due to electrical stimulation of cortical or thalamic inputs to the striatum lacking sufficient subregion specificity. These data provide, to our knowledge, the first examples of intra-thalamic and intra-cortical heterogeneity among striatal excitatory inputs, suggesting subregion-dependent integration in the striatum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, the present study provides the first comprehensive excitatory input map of the mouse striatum. Given the broad roles of the striatum in action selection, motor execution, and reward, understanding how individual inputs precisely project to the striatum and how such inputs may interact with one another is a step forward in dissecting the circuit mechanisms underlying striatal function.</p><p>An unbiased cluster analysis of the corticostriatal input patterns reveals that the striatum can be divided into four large subdivisions with clear boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Three of these subdivisions most likely correspond to the traditional dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventral domains thought to play critical roles in goal-directed behaviors, habitual behaviors, and affective control of behaviors, respectively. The fourth subdivision at the posterior end of the striatum may represent a previously unappreciated functional domain, and illustrates the existence of heterogeneity along the A-P axis. Recent evidence has suggested that the posterior part of the striatum receives inputs from anatomically distinct populations of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>), bears a unique MSN subpopulation composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gangarossa et al., 2013</xref>), and has been shown in primates to mediate specific behavioral functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Our data identify and describe the distinct connectivity of the posterior striatum in mice, showing that this posterior subdivision receives strong inputs from the auditory, visual, and rhinal cortices, as well as from the amygdala, suggesting that this area may process multi-modality sensory inputs in the context of emotional information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We also found that the associative striatum, consistent with its proposed function, receives extremely heterogeneous inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The comprehensive input map presented here may also guide future experiments aimed at understanding the function of individual cortical, thalamic, or striatal subdivisions by allowing for a systematic evaluation of all locations to perform imaging and recording experiments.</p><p>An orthogonal approach to spatially subdividing the striatum involves the separation of the patch and the matrix compartments via neurochemical markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerfen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graybiel and Ragsdale, 1978</xref>). These subdivisions have been shown, mainly in primates, to receive distinct patterns of cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerfen, 1992</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to examine how the patch/matrix subdivisions interact with the subdivisions described herein to orchestrate striatal function. Besides geometric subdivisions, brain circuitry is also organized based on different neuronal cell types. Future studies combining cell-type-specific and subregion-specific circuit analyses to examine how subregion-specific inputs differentially innervate different cell types, for example, the D1 and D2 MSNs, in striatal subdivisions will provide additional insights into the striatal circuitry in normal and diseased brains.</p><p>The work presented here was achieved by integrating two large-scale viral-tracing datasets and vigorous data analyses. Recent technical advances have made it possible to systematically generate whole brain projection data at mesoscopic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pinskiy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains challenging to integrate such large datasets (typically &gt;50 terabytes) obtained from different research teams under different conditions, and with various forms of metadata. To our knowledge, our study represents the first example of combining two different large mesoscopic imaging datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our efforts were fruitful for several reasons. First, similar viral infection reagents were used, which standardized many properties of the imaging data, including comparable injection sites and high-imaging sensitivity. Second, our analyses utilize the different advantages of each dataset. For the thalamic dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>), because the thalamic nuclei can be smaller than the size of an individual injection, high-density, overlapping injections are necessary to achieve adequate mapping resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the injections in the AIBS Mouse Connectivity Atlas dataset are sparse and mostly non-overlapping, but they are spread across many brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2014</xref>), making them suited for mapping projections from cortical areas, which are larger, more widely spread, and better demarcated than the mouse thalamic nuclei.</p><p>Although most current efforts at mesoscopic circuit mapping focus on illustrating the connections between two macroscopic brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra, 2014</xref>), information processing in the brain often involves several brain regions. We were able to expand our systematic circuit analyses to include three main brain regions that form a complete loop. Specifically, we examined how subregion-specific projections from the thalamus and the cortex converge in the striatum, and how the thalamus is interconnected with the cortex and basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). To do this, we carried out several analyses. First, we mapped the thalamic origins of thalamostriatal projections and identified the converging subregion-specific corticostriatal inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we illustrated the relationships between the thalamic subregions that directly project to a cortical subregion and the thalamic subregions that converge with the same cortical subregion in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is worth noting that the current thalamic dataset does not include the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (MGN and LGN, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>), although reports in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeDoux et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veening et al., 1980</xref>), as well as our visual inspection of AIBS thalamic injections (data not shown), suggest that the MGN, but not the LGN, projects to the posterior striatum. Third, since the thalamus is the major target of basal ganglia output, and only specific thalamic subregions receive basal ganglia innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deniau and Chevalier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerfen and Bolam, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McFarland and Haber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), we examined how these basal ganglia-innervated thalamic subregions differ in connectivity patterns as compared to other thalamic subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We found that these thalamic subregions have strong ties with motor cortical subregions, and converge in the same striatal subdivisions with corticostriatal projections from those motor cortical subregions, consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia play a critical role in movement controls and are in close coordination with the cortical motor processing.</p><p>Regarding the corticostriatal inputs, the results of the present study are largely consistent with related literature in rat and primate, although several sources could potentially contribute to any discrepancy in isolated cases. First, the relative small size of mouse brain allows the systematic tracing coverage of all cortical subregions and &gt;93% volume of the thalamus with individual injections of small (500–600 µm) sizes, and the imaging of the entire projections of every injection. The level of completeness has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. The comprehensiveness of the datasets allows us to perform quantitative analyses that are difficult with a few example images. On the other hand, because of the relative small size of mouse brain, and the lack of anatomical landmarks for demarcating certain subregions, accurately assigning cortical subregions can be challenging (e.g., for M1 and M2, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2011</xref>]). For cortical injections, we applied stringent criteria (see Materials and methods) in the selection process and, as a result, only &lt;10% of AIBS injections was included. Even with great care, the lack of clear landmarks for certain mouse cortical subregion definition may still be a source of variability. Second, it is important to note that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, 15 clusters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Draganski et al., 2008</xref>), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruber and McDonald, 2012</xref>), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahan and Ressler, 2012</xref>). Finally, there might be circuit differences at mesoscopic resolution across species due to parallel evolution and it will be interesting to systematically compare them in the future when similar type of data become available in other mammalian species.</p><p>Recent work from Hintiryan and colleagues uses an anterograde tracing dataset from cortical injections to illustrate the corticostriatal circuits and demonstrate the usefulness of large scale mesoscopic projection mapping to study ‘circuitry-specific connectopathies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>). Although Hintiryan et al. and our studies both use comprehensive mesoscopic cortical projections in the striatum to understand striatal circuit logic, these two studies are also complementary. In addition to cortico-dorsal striatal projections, our study also includes cortico-ventral striatal projections, thalamostriatal projections, as well as corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity. Our thalamostriatal dataset is of particular interest because thalamostriatal data for mouse is scarce in the literature and the circuits are much less understood compared to the corticostriatal pathways. The completeness of our dataset allows us to illustrate the features of the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The anatomical axonal projection map suggests, but does not guarantee, synaptic connections (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dantzker and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>]), especially in the striatum where many fasciculated axons pass through without forming synapses. Therefore, we examined the existence of synaptic connections using optogenetic stimulation and physiological recording for the anatomically described corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results indicate that, for the projections identified after computer-assisted exclusion of passing fasciculated axons, the mapped axonal projections do form functional synapses in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, taking advantage of our comprehensive anatomical input map, we examined functional heterogeneity of synaptic connections in the striatum. A series of recent studies have shown that cortical and thalamic inputs form functionally unique synapses in the striatum, although their synaptic properties remain controversial. In addition, little was known about whether different subregions within the cortex or the thalamus form functionally unique synapses in the striatum. We found that distinct cortical and thalamic subregions each give rise to synapses in the striatum with unique synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), providing a potential explanation for the discrepancies reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smeal et al., 2007</xref>) when the thalamic or cortical inputs were stimulated in a non-subregion-specific manner. Taken together, these results presented here demonstrate the value of creating comprehensive input maps, and their utility in guiding the effective design of functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol number: IS00003542).

Two weeks post-injection, each brain was fixed, cryostat-sectioned at 50 µm, and imaged using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer imaging system (Japan), resulting in 0.5 µm/pixel lateral resolution for the full-brain fluorescence images of all injections and their cortical and striatal projections.

Injection site images were matched to their corresponding full brain Nanozoomer images through rigid translation and rotation using manually selected anatomical landmarks visible in both images.

Mesocortex, also called the paralimbic cortex, is generally three-layered and is made up of associative subregions in frontal cortex as well as subregions at the interface between allocortex and neocortex, such as insular and perirhinal cortices. Allocortex is the evolutionarily oldest part of cortex, and comprised of piriform cortex, hippocampus and the subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>). Although the amygdaloid complex has both telencephalic (pallial) and subpallial origins, it is situated within allocortex, between piriform cortex and the subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pabba, 2013</xref>). Being functionally related to both the hippocampus through the limbic system and the piriform cortex with olfactory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Novejarque et al., 2011</xref>), it was grouped here as part of the allocortex. Since that olfactory information does not project directly to the dorsal striatum and only very weakly to the ventral striatum and with olfactory tubercle not considered, olfactory areas and the piriform cortex were not included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>), leaving 957 injections. This was also checked through a search for olfactory to striatal projections in the AIBS Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (data not shown). These 957 injections include both wildtype and cell-type specific cre lines, 177 of these injections are in wildtype C57BL/6J animals. However, many of the wildtype injections spanned multiple cortical subregions and had insufficient subregion specificity to map projections. Therefore, three primary sets of cre lines were also included in the search: A930038C07Rik-Tg1-Cre, Rbp4-Cre_KL100, and Cux2-IRES-Cre. The cre lines were chosen to span cortical layers 2/3 (L2/3) and 5 (L5), so as not to bias the dataset towards intratelencephalic (IT) or pyramidal-tract (PT)-type corticostriatal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kress et al., 2013</xref>), and contain injections in all of the cortical subregions analyzed. This added another 177 injections to the 177 wildtype injections, totaling 354 to choose from. No cortical layer 4 (L4) or layer 6 (L6) lines were chosen because they do not project to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs, 2010</xref>). One injection each from Etv1-CreERT2, Gpr26-Cre_KO250, and Grp-Cre_KH288 mouse lines in auditory and insular cortices were used to supplement the lack of specific L5 or L2/3 injections in the AIBS connectivity atlas for the three primary cre lines described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The amygdala and hippocampus were primarily targeted by wildtype injections, but also required a different set of injections from cre lines since they have different gene expression patterns from neocortex and mesocortex. The metadata for each injection identifies the primary and secondary brain areas infected, which was used as a first screening process for subregion specificity before each brain was manually evaluated for injection targeting accuracy and specificity. Some small subregions were grouped with functionally similar areas if few or no specific injections could be identified. This includes the following grouping: LO/VO, dACC/vACC, Rhi/Tem, and AI/GI/DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Injections specific to multiple areas within a single large subregion, such as visual and somatosensory cortices were selected to insure full coverage of the entire volume, and were analyzed as a single group (e.g., injections in VISp, VISal, VISl, and VISam for visual cortex). In the end 127 injections were found to specifically target 15 subregions that spanned all striatal projecting subregions originating from the cortical plate. All areas contain at least one wildtype, one L2/3, and one L5 injection and contain eight injections on average, with considerable variability depending on the size of the subregion, with the fewest being infralimbic (IL) with three injections and most being somatosensory cortex (S1/2) with 21 injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>For hippocampal areas, while some injections included in this dataset had CA1 or CA3 as a primary target, only injections that at least partially covered the subiculum sent projections to the striatum (data not shown). For amygdalar areas, the primary volumes of the amygdala injections in this dataset are in the basolateral amygdalar nucleus (BLA), and basomedial amygdalar nucleus (BMA), but they also cover parts of the central nucleus of amygdala (CEA), posterior amygdalar nucleus (PA), medial amygdalar nucleus (MEA), and piriform-amygdalar area (PAA), areas which span both pallial and subpallial parts of the amygdaloid complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The raw data processing methods used to generate the voxelized corticostriatal projection data and AIBS averaged template brain were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Photostimulation of defasciculated and fasciculated axons in the striatum to examine functional connectivity</title><p>Mice were injected at P14–16 with 10–20 nl of an AAV2/1 virus encoding ChR2-H134R-TdTomato (Addgene: 28017).

The excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub>) were recorded in voltage clamp (holding potentials were –70 mV or –75 mV) while blue light was stimulated the thalamic axons transfected with ChR2. Each map was repeated two to four times. The maps were averaged and a cell was counted as a positive responder if there was any excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude &gt;6x the standard deviation of the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image integration and image analysis</title><p>The outline of the striatum was manually traced in each image set to generate a striatum mask. The front of the striatum was defined as the first slice containing the nucleus accumbens (NAc), where the anterior commissure (ac) separates from the rostral migratory stream. The border of the dorsal striatum was determined by the lateral ventricle (VL) and corpus callosum (cc). The ac was included in the striatum mask until it became medial of the VL. Posterior to the commissural part of ac, the ac formed the ventral border of the striatum. In posterior sections containing the globus pallidus extrenal segment (GPe) and the internal capsule, they were considered the medial border of the striatum.</p><p>To facilitate comparison across experiments and datasets, each experimental striatum mask was aligned to the striatum of the AIBS average template brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>). First, each section image was rotated about the anterior posterior (A-P) axis so that it was oriented vertically (i.e., roll rotation) based on manually selected midpoints and down-sampled to 25 µm per pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Rotation of the images caused by an aberrant sectioning angle about the left-right (L-R) axis (i.e. a pitch rotation) was estimated using manually selected landmarks, and the rotation due to an aberrant sectioning angle about the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis (i.e. a yaw rotation) was estimated using the center of mass of each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The average template brain was rotated using these estimated angles to mimic the aberrant sectioning angle of the experimental brain. A center of mass curve was then generated from the striatum mask of this rotated average template brain, and the experimental brain sections were aligned to the rotated average template brain in the M-L and D-V axes. In the M-L axis, only the top half of the striatum was used to calculate the center of mass due to the variability in the ventral striatum masks. Additionally, the first several sections of the striatum (a variable number depending on D-V rotation angle) were aligned using the center of mass of the anterior commissure because the range of D-V sectioning angles made the shape of these sections too variable to implement a striatum center of mass alignment. In a case where a section displayed significant tissue damage, the section was skipped, and the sections before and after the damaged section were averaged to replace the damaged section for both the striatum mask, as well as the projection masks.</p><p>The full experimental striatum was scaled in the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis to fit the rotated average template brain based on the first and last section containing the corpus callosum crossing the midline. A linear scaling in the D-V axis was applied based on the average distance from the top of the striatum to the center of mass of the anterior commissure in the front several sections, and this scaling for sections posterior to the anterior commissure crossing the midline was based on the average distance from the top to the bottom of the striatum. Scaling in the M-L axis was determined by an average width of the dorsal striatum above the center of mass. The section images are then iteratively aligned to the rotated average template brain in the D-V axis using the anterior commissure for the first several sections, and the dorsal border of the striatum for posterior sections, and realigned in the M-L axis based on the center of mass of the top half of the striatum.</p><p>After these alignments, the experimental brains were rotated in all axes to align with the original coordinates of the average template brain, and then subjected to one more round of iterative alignment in each axis as described above. Finally, after visual inspection, if manual adjustments to the alignment were necessary, they were fed back to a point just before the average template brain is rotated to mimic the aberrant sectioning angle of the experimental brain, and the process is repeated. The corresponding thalamic projection masks were aligned concurrently with the striatum masks. The final result is the alignment of each experimental brain to the average template brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b–c</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b–c</xref> show all of the aligned striatum masks overlaid at several coronal sections in the A-P axis for all experimental striatum masks.</p><p>Corticostriatal projections were identified in the AIBS images based on an AIBS custom image segmentation algorithm that identifies all fluorescent pixels and produced a full-resolution (0.35 µm/pixels) binary mask of positive pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The images were then binned into 100 µm x100 µm x100 µm voxels, where the value of each voxel represents the fraction that contained positive fluorescence within that voxel. This data was used for the analysis of corticostriatal projections in the present study. Guided by the original images, we applied thresholds of 0.2, 0.05, and 0.005 to the voxelized data to localize the dense, moderate, and diffuse projections, respectively. Corticostriatal projection data were manually corrected to remove fluorescence resulting from fasciculated traveling axons that do not make synapses in the striatum, since the AIBS analysis did not vigorously distinguish traveling axons from axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The contaminating traveling axons were removed manually based on their stereotypic bundled and fasciculated morphology (similar to fasciculated thalamostriatal axons that are functionally evaluated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) using custom MATLAB software.</p><p>For all injections in AIBS Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, the voxelized data was obtained from the AIBS and the preprocessed projection density data was obtained from the AIBS API (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org/api/index.html">http://www.brain-map.org/api/index.html</ext-link>) (Research Recourse Identifier (RRID): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005984">SCR_005984</ext-link>) which contained the volume and density of projections to all brain regions defined in the AMBA ontology. This data was utilized in the present study to identify the density of corticothalamic projection in specific thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, green) and corticocortical projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data describe the density of projections in each cortical subregion and each thalamic nucleus. Since these cortical and thalamic subregions are well demarcated and do not contain bundled axons requiring manual removal, as in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–k</xref>), this data accurately represents the corticothalamic and corticocortical connectivity of each injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Machine learning and human supervised process for excluding fasciculated traveling axons</title><p>To localize thalamostriatal projections and distinguish them from traveling thalamocortical axons, a machine-learning plugin for ImageJ, Trainable WEKA Segmentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation">http://fiji.sc/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation</ext-link>) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To prepare the image sets for training, each image section containing striatum was background subtracted, a 12-pixel Gaussian filter was applied, and the striatum mask was used to limit the region of interest to only the striatal volume. The images were then split into single channels (red or green) and converted to an 8-bit grayscale format. The WEKA Segmentation program was manually trained to distinguish between three categories: (1) defasciculated axons that make synapses in the striatum, (2) fasciculated, or bundled axons that travel through the striatum to reach their final targets in the cortex, or (3) residual background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>). Visually, fasciculated traveling axons could be identified as being highly directionally oriented and generally brighter than the defasciculated thalamostriatal projections, which have a diffuse, spidery appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Since these morphological distinctions varied slightly for projections from different thalamic nuclei, separate training was required for each brain. For each channel, 3–6 sections (an average of 4) were used for training. The Trainable Weka Segmentation parameters were as follows; six image filters were selected, Entropy, Membrane Projections, Neighbors, Structure, and Variance. Classes were homogenized, and the other settings were left on their default values (membrane thickness: 1, membrane patch size: 19, minimum sigma: 1.0, maximum sigma: 16.0, classifier: fast random forest of 200 trees with two features per tree). Once the training was complete, the classifier was applied to the remaining ~80 sections of the brain containing the striatum, generating a probability map for each of the three features listed above, which conveys the certainty that a given pixel belonged to each of the three features. Only the defasciculated projection probability map was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f</xref>).</p><p>A threshold was selected for the defasciculated projection probability map and applied to the full probability map stack.

Individual images were manually inspected for accuracies in projection identification during the Trainable Weka Segmentation process, and any inaccuracy was manually corrected in MATLAB using custom programs. The final output was a binary projection mask encompassing the full thalamostriatal projection for each injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confidence map generation</title><p>Confidence maps, which define the thalamic origin of projections, were created to determine the likelihood that regions of the thalamus sent projections to: (1) striatal volumes that contained corticostriatal projections originating from cortical subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), (2) striatal volumes that contained high- or low-diffuse corticostriatal input convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>), and (3) striatal subdivisions generated by clustering voxels with common cortical input patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). To control for alignment variability (~100 µm) across thalamus masks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>), an injection ‘core’ was produced by eroding the ‘full’ injection for each three-dimensional injection mask by 100 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each injection, a positive injection core adds one to the confidence level and a positive full injection adds one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–c,e</xref>). Similarly, negative injection cores subtract one from the confidence level, and a negative full injection subtracts one. Exception: full injections were only subtracted for the two easiest to meet criteria in each grouping method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>, arrows, and 1d), and subsequent criteria only subtract negative injection cores as one. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a simplified schematic of this process for case (1) listed above. A six level confidence map was generated by determining the inclusion of each injection in the following three groups; 10% of the diffuse target volume covered by the projection, 5% of the dense target volume covered by the projection, and 50% of the dense target volume covered by the projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Thalamic volumes occupied by the cores of injections that did not meet any of these criteria were set to zero. For cases (2) and (3), there was not projection density data, but instead binary volumes targeted by the thalamic projections, so the injection grouping was adjusted accordingly. For these groups, eight level confidence maps were created by determining the inclusion of each injection in the following four groups; 10% of the target volume covered by the projection, 10% of the projection volume within the target, 25% of the target volume covered by the projection, and 25% of the projection volume within the target. Thalamic volumes occupied by the cores of injections that did not meet any of these criteria were set to zero, and values of the final confidence maps below zero are also set to zero. The overall method was similar to that for case (1), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, except each injection is categorized based on the inclusion in each of the four groups listed above instead of the three groups shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Voxel cluster analysis for striatal segmentation</title><p>Each voxel was assigned a point in a 15-dimensional space corresponding to the density of projections from each cortical subregion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This distance metric and an average linkage were used to perform cluster analysis on the striatal voxels. The maximum number of voxel clusters was determined by applying a threshold to the resulting dendrogram.

Since corticocortical connections may be either reciprocal or unilateral, ribbons joining them may have widths on one or both ends. Corticocortical connections are shown only for connections to or from a cortical subregion included in the indicated network, i.e. a primary convergent input to either the corticostriatal projection field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) or the striatal subregion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For the corticostriatal projection fields, the convergence of one cortical subregion with one other cortical subregion was averaged across projection densities, i.e. the fraction of dense projections in the dense projection field, moderate projections in the moderate projection field, and diffuse projections in the diffuse projection for one cortical subregion with the corticostriatal projection field of each other cortical subregion. Corticocortical connections are indicated for projections with a density &gt;15% in the target area, and primary convergent subregions are those where their projection fields converge with &gt;50% the target projection field. Since the Amyg has broad projections throughout the striatum, it constituted a primary convergent input to all corticostriatal projection fields.

The summary network diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref> is a manually modified version of a Gephi network diagram. The order of cortical nodes in each network diagram was based on the cortical subregion clustering shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, the order of the striatal nodes was the same as for the cortical nodes, and the order of the thalamic nodes were based on their projection similarity, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>. Edges are shown for connections that are above a cutoff for each projection type: corticostriatal: projection density &gt;15% in the target area; corticostriatal: projection fields converge with &gt;50% the target projection field (as described for the chord diagrams above); thalamostriatal: thalamic nucleus with &gt;20% of its volume contributing to the convergent projections; thalamocortical: thalamic nucleus with &gt;20% of its volume contributing to projections to the indicated cortical subregion; corticothalamic: projections where &gt;20% of the thalamic nucleus received projections from the corresponding cortical subregion.</p><p>For the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit, it is also worth noting that since the cortical subregions used to localize the thalamocortical projections may send corticostriatal projections to more than just the associated striatal subdivision, the thalamocortical data may over-represent the association with the striatal subdivision. However, this does not diminish the relationship seen between the thalamus and cortex for subdivision-specific networks in the circuit, since the thalamocortical inputs are going to a primary input to the striatal subdivision, but it may account for the excess of thalamocortical projections not associated with corresponding thalamostriatal projections in these networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–f</xref>). Furthermore, the thalamostriatal confidence maps for each striatal subdivision are unrelated to the thalamostriatal confidence maps for cortical subregions since the striatal subdivisions may be either larger or smaller than the full projection fields of their corresponding primary cortical inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiological recording and photostimulation</title><p>Brain slices were obtained from mice that were stereotaxically injected using methods similar to those used for the anatomical injections at postnatal day 16 with 10–20 nl of AAV serotype two expressing synapsin-CsChR-GFP, purchased from the University of North Carolina viral core (titer 4*10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>).

Putative MSN with evoked EPSC of ≤−100 pA were included.</p><p>Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Multiclamp 700B (BCJ) with an online 2 kHz low-pass filter (Molecular Devices) and <italic>Ephus</italic> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ephus.org">www.ephus.org</ext-link>) or using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and AxoGraph X software sampled at 20 kHz and filtered online with a 5 kHz low-pass filter (WTB). Data analysis was performed in Matlab, R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</ext-link>), Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), Excel (Microsoft), Axograph X, Origin7 (OriginLab) and Prizm 6 (GraphPad). Rise- and decay time were calculated based on 10% to 90% of EPSC peak value. For decay time calculation, the presence of a slow current was taken into account. Slow currents of single evoked EPSCs were calculated as the change in mean current (10 ms episode) at 40 ms post-stimulus relative to 10 ms pre-stimulus or, in the case of repetitive stimulation, 10 ms prior to the tenth stimulus over 10 ms before the first stimulus, and normalized to EPSC peak value. Charge transfer was calculated per stimulus over a 50 ms episode starting from the stimulus onset and normalized to the charge transfer evoked by the first stimulus. For data analysis, numbers of observations represent recorded cells from (# cells / # mice): d/vACC, 34/6; V1, 26/4; Thal1, 25/5; Thal2, 32/5.</p><p>Due to the injection site-specific innervation patterns to the striatum, injection sites were first inspected by the experimenters. Injected animals were excluded from analysis, when thal1 or thal2 injection produced tail-contamination in the d/vACC. Statistical comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by <italic>post-hoc</italic> Dunn’s test with Bonferonni correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e,g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b–e</xref>) and two-way repeated measures ANOVA with <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1f–g</xref>). The results presented here do not show correlations with the light power used for photostimulation (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Retrobeads injections</title><p>Mice (P21) were injected with LumaFluor red or green beads (1:1 diluted in sterile PBS) in the dorsomedial (DMS) and posterior striatum (PS). Each animal received one injection in the DMS and two in the PS. Bead color – injection region combination was assigned randomly per animal. Injection coordinates were based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, 15 nl bead volume per position was deposited at (relative to bregma; along the anterior – posterior axis, with positive values anterior to bregma, along the medial – lateral axis relative to the midline, and along the dorsal – ventral axis relative to bregma in µm): DMS, 1000, 1000, 3100; PS, −1600, 3250, 3700 and 3400. Mice were perfused with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS 3 days post-injection. Brains were resected, post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS overnight and subsequently stored in PBS at 4°. Coronal brain sections of 50 µm were produced on a vibratome and stained with 1:5000 Hoechst. Epifluorescent tiled images were made on an AxioImager N2 (Zeiss).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. John T.

This was accomplished using a combination of existing databases and new experiments. The authors combined this anatomical connectivity work with detailed computer based analyses of injection volumes, averaging of striatal volumes, and effective subtraction of fasciculated fibers of passage. These approaches were supplemented with high quality optogenetic/electrophysiogical experiments showing the location and properties of intriguing selected cortical and thalamic inputs. Overall this work represents a tour-de-force of structural and functional connectivity analysis that will be valuable to everyone studying the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits and their functions. The mapping of overlapping cortical and thalamic inputs to striatum is especially valuable. There are a few areas where data presentation might be improved, and I strongly urge the authors to think about ways that input pathways and especially convergent pathways could be represented in schematic or 3d formats that would be easier for readers to understand. There are also a few questions about some aspects of the data and some small corrections that are needed.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to have at least one figure or panel that included schematic drawings of a section of cortex, a section of striatum and a section of thalamus that would illustrate the convergence of inputs to the striatum, for at least one good example case. Ultimately, it would be great to have several such schematics, maybe posted online. A 3-dimensional plot of some sort would be even more useful, but admittedly difficult to put into the manuscript itself. All the necessary information is certainly present in the figures, it is just very hard to appreciate the overlap without some sort of direct visual representation.</p><p>2) There did not seem to be any data on entorhinal projections to striatum. This is a highly interesting cortical area for a number of reasons, so it is not clear why it was not included.</p><p>3) Why were the injections, tracing and recordings performed using such young animals? Is there reason to believe that no anatomical or physiological differences would be observed in adult brain?</p><p>4) Regarding the oEPSCs, did the paired-pulse and frequency responses and the sustained current vary with light stimulus intensity, duration or the amplitude of the initial oEPSC? The data certainly suggest differences in synaptic properties, but care should be taken to be sure that these differences are not due to differences in the level of channel rhodopsin expression or activation in different projections (also, are the scale bar values in panel C the same as in panel D?).</p><p>5) The authors need to cite and discuss the recent paper by Hintiryan et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2016). Many of the corticostriatal projection subdomains identified by these investigators show good overlap with the data in this manuscript, but there may be some areas of disagreement (e.g. the ectorhinal projections into dorsal striatum seem to differ a bit), and if so these should be discussed.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Corticostriatal projectome data overview”, the authors note that the striatum does not receive olfactory information, and cite a previous publication and the AIBS site. However, it is not clear if they include the olfactory tubercle in their definition of the striatum. It might be worth revising this statement to indicate that olfactory information does not go to dorsal striatum and only weakly to ventral striatum/accumbens, but that the olfactory tubercle that has many striatal-like properties does receive this input, but will not be the subject of this study. On a related subject, Hintiryan et al. report that piriform cortex projects to ventral/ventromedial striatum, and the Allen Brain connectivity site shows a weak projection to parts of the nucleus accumbens, so perhaps statements regarding this cortical subregion should be revised.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper by Mao et al. examines how cortical and thalamic inputs innervate and define functional regions in the striatum. The authors combine a meta-analysis of a cortex data set from the Allen Institute (Oh et al. 2014) with further analysis of a thalamus data set from their own lab (Hunnicutt et al. 2014). They first establish that different parts of cortex and thalamus make unique projections into the striatum. They then show how the thalamic nuclei associated with thalamostriatal projections relate to the corticostriatal projections. Similarly, they establish how these thalamic nuclei relate to striatal subdivisions defined by corticostriatal inputs. They then show how these thalamostriatal maps relate to their published thalamocortical maps, in an attempt to begin to establish the presence and extent of cortico-thalamo-striatal loops. Finally, they also perform some slice physiology experiments to confirm cortico- and thalamo-striatal connections.</p><p>While I think there is a lot of interesting information in the paper, the presentation was often confusing, and more example data, analysis, and explanation are needed. It should be noted that a recent study also studied the cortico-striatal projectome in great detail (Hintiryan et al., 2016). In my view, the current paper is complementary, as it focuses on thalamostriatal projections and larger circuits. I think it has the potential to be a valuable resource, but several major points first need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors jump from mapping corticostriatal inputs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to a complex analysis of thalamic nuclei in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Before making that jump, I would like to see more examples of the thalamostriatal projections and how they were analyzed.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows how corticostriatal inputs define sub-regions of striatum, and how different thalamic nuclei project onto these different sub-regions. I think it would be valuable to experimentally validate this result by performing retrograde injections into striatum and showing which cortical and thalamic areas are labeled. For example, retrograde injections into the 4 clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> should presumably label the same areas of cortex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B/C</xref> and thalamus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E/F</xref>.</p><p>3) The first part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is potentially interesting, but currently underdeveloped. I would like to see more examples from the different clusters that receive cortical and thalamic input shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. For example, it would be interesting to see examples for dorsomedial, dorsolateral, ventromedial and very caudal striatum.</p><p>4) The last part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, examining corticothalamic feedback connections, is very underdeveloped. It is important to show much more data on the corticothalamic projection, how it was processed, and how it fits into the paper. As it currently stands, I cannot agree that &quot;these data provide a comprehensive picture of cortical and thalamic input integration in the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit&quot;.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it seems like it would be much more interesting to validate some of the previously unexplored areas of the striatum that were identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, and see examples for dorsomedial, dorsolateral, ventromedial and caudal striatum. Although it is not a big part of the paper, the authors should also provide some explanation for the slow EPSC, which could be an artifact due to excessive input. Ideally, they should show that this data is relatively invariant with light intensity.</p><p>6) The authors should discuss in detail how their work relates to Hintiryan et al., 2016.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper shows how far we have come technically. The future of connectivity studies looks a lot like this paper. It is exciting to see a comprehensive approach to a large and diverse projection like the corticostriatal pathway.</p><p>However, the results make a stark contrast with the results from traditional methods of mapping the corticostriatal projection, and I have more confidence in the previous results. The results here indicate much less structure in the corticostriatal projection than expected, and it may be the projection is less structured in mice than in larger animals. Both the old and new methods (and primates and mice) have their strong and weak points. It is great to cover the entire cortex. In the previous generation of this kind of work it was never possible to do more than a fragment of the cortex in any one study. The positive side of the old primate work is that cortical regions were much better defined, and the projections were seen at higher resolution. Not only are functional regions larger in primates, but it was often possible to define regions functionally, rather than only by position on the cortex. This allowed injections to be placed far from functional boundaries, and even in functional subregions (e.g. hand area of somatosensory cortex). A lesson of those old papers was that cortical regions that are close to each other might be functionally disparate and have disparate projections in the striatum. That is, although they projected to the same general area of the striatum (e.g. the somatosensory cortex recipient region), injections in the hand and foot somatosensory cortex did not have convergent projections at the microscopic level, and so did not converge on single striatal neurons. My first concern about this study is that all of those principles learned from the primate work have been jettisoned, and a strictly spatial scheme is used. Because functional areas of the cortex in the mouse are so small, it is likely that most of these injections involve very different functional cortical regions with different projections in the striatum, and are being superimposed to make the projection look less specific than it is. The same could be said about the thalamic projections. Stated differently, if the cortex or thalamus contained an affine map of function, the lost resolution in the injections could be recovered by comparing nearby injections. If it is not, then this will not work. I think the previous work suggests that it is not.</p><p>One method that has served well in the past when functional mapping was unavailable was to look at the projections in the thalamus. Often, the precise set of cortical areas involved in a tracer injection can be inferred from its thalamic projections, as these have such sharp boundaries and corticothalamic relations are so well known.</p><p>One test of whether the results are showing us something really new or are just a blurred version of what we already know would be to find some new principle emerge, or to test an old one. I do not see any clear statement of a new principle. I think in this the authors may have missed an opportunity. One principle proposed by previous authors was that cortical areas that are strongly connected with each other converge in the striatum (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, Brain Res, 139:43-63, 1978). It seems to me that the information required to test this idea may be already available in the authors' data set, just by including corticocortical projections.</p><p>Declaring there to be a sensorimotor domain in the striatum is misleading. The somatosensory and motor systems are very closely connected and in the past many studies have shown that somatosensory and motor function may even overlap spatially in the cortex (of rodents). However, this does not extend to other sensory modalities. For example, visual cortex or its projections to the striatum do not go to the region called sensory by the authors. Throughout the paper, the word sensory seems specifically associated with the somatosensory cortex. I think the authors should replace the word 'sensory' in all cases in which it appears with 'somatosensory'. One thing we have learned from previous studies is that there is very little overlap between visual and somatosensory cortical projections to the striatum, and very little between visual and primary motor cortex. This is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but still, there is no recognition that Aud and Vis are sensory cortices. Their projections do not overlap much with motor cortex at all. What does this mean about the idea that all sensory input is 'sensorimotor'?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19103.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Insert a new figure to show the thalamostriatal projection in more detail.

Briefly, the cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A_C</xref>) were first used to define a striatal subdivision of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Then we localized the thalamic origins that project to this part of the striatum in the following steps. The thalamostriatal projection in individual sections were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) by using the method described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Thalamostriatal projections in the striatum were aligned across experimental mice as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and their axonal innervation within the striatal subdivision, as defined by the cortical inputs, were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>). The aligned thalamic projections in the striatum from individual injections were then categorized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All injection-projection information for a given striatal subdivision was combined to derive a “thalamic confidence map”, which describes the thalamic subregions that innervate this striatal subdivision (example results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-K</xref>, and methods detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The confidence map for each striatal subdivision is analogous to a comprehensive retrograde tracing analysis from the striatal subdivision. Our method has the advantage that it is efficient (only computational efforts are involved after producing the original thalamic projection dataset), and allows the user to dynamically change the striatal subdivision of interests (e.g., the striatal subdivision receiving M1/2 inputs versus the subdivision receiving d/vACC inputs).</p><p>Along the same spirit of illustrating the key steps in our analyses using example images, we have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for how the corticostriatal projection maps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were derived.</p><p>Overall, we hope these illustrations will help general readers to better understand our analyses.</p><p><italic>2) Expand the first part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to show the relationship of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical maps in much more detail. Ideally, this would include examples from the 4 main sub-regions of striatum identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>Due to the intertwining nature of individual injections/projections within the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loops, we find it difficult to completely separate the discussion and presentation of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical projections in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with other projections in the loop without sacrificing clarity and accuracy. We have therefore taken the spirit of points 2 and 3 as a whole and added a new main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and two supplement figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> to show the network properties and the information flow in the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop in the subregion-specific manner, with the highlight of thalamic nuclei innervated by GPi/SNr as the basal ganglia projection targets.</p><p><italic>As discussed above, we did not split the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Overall, we use S1/2 subregion as an example to explain the concept of the triangular loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>) and use the 4 thalamic subregions innervated by GPi/SNr as the way to tie the entire loop. The newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is a natural extension of integrating now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, as suggested by reviewer 2 in point 2.

A detailed description of these features is also now included in the main text (Results subsection “The cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop organization for clustered striatal subdivisions”; Methods subsection “Network diagrams of circuit convergence and connectivity”).</italic></p><p><italic>4) Address the substantial differences between the present results and those of older corticostriatal studies (including those in rat as well as primate).</italic></p><p>We have now devoted major text contents to discuss our finding in relationship to the available literature in rat and primate. As reviewer 3 accurately stated, the advantages of our study are two folds. First, because mouse brains are small, we were able to cover all cortical subregions and &gt; 93% volume of the thalamus with individual injections of small (500-600 µm) sizes, and image the entire projections of every injection. The level of comprehensiveness in documenting thalamic projections has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. Second, the comprehensiveness of the dataset allow us to perform quantitative analyses that are only possible with full dataset, but not with example images. For example, conventional descriptions of thalamic projections are mostly based on thalamic nucleus demarcations which, when compared to cats or primates, are less distinct and sometimes ambiguous in mice (Jones 2007, pg 52). As better stated in the textbook by Sherman and Guillery (2006), ‘The concept of the thalamic nucleus as a single structural, functional, and connectional entity has barely survived advancing techniques and new information. We stay with the thalamic nuclei as one of our prime analytical tools because, as yet, we have little to use in its place’. In our studies, we take the unique opportunity to establish nucleus-independent thalamic projection maps by using model thalamus based on averaging 70-100 mouse brains (Hunnicutt et al., 2014).</p><p>The caveats of our data and analyses were also pinpointed by reviewer 3: because the mouse brain is small, the definition of the subregion that gives the projections might be vague and ambiguous. That could be the source of the variation. This is true both for defining cortical injections and thalamic injections. For thalamic injections, as stated above, we took full advantage of the high <italic>n</italic> numbers we could get and used overlapping injections to increase the resolution beyond individual injection volumes (Hunnicutt et al., 2014). This algorithm is the operational expression of what reviewer 3 mentioned as ‘the lost resolution……recovered by comparing nearby injections’. Furthermore, our confidence maps are statistical by nature and therefore, are difficult to be compared to the traditional anatomical tracing just by numbers. For cortical injections, we integrated Allen Institute data but with strict criteria for selecting the injections within a given subregion (Methods). However, unlike in the primate literature, the definition of certain cortical subregions themselves can be controversial in mice (e.g., for M1 and M2, see Mao et al., 2011) and even with the ones that have clear functional definitions, the physical landmarks are often lacking to clearly demarcate them. We did the best practice possible by sticking to the existing mouse atlas using visible landmarks and by being consistent in injection selection process. Even with great care, the lack of sufficient demarcating landmarks may contribute to variability. We are also limited to what is available in AIBS database for cortical injections which is already the best effort available with current technology using over 1600 brains for establishing the model brain to assign the subregions. Because these cortical injections are mostly not-overlapping, we could not employ similar resolution improving algorithms as we did with thalamic injections (i.e., comparing to the neighbors). Despite these caveats, given that the mouse is an important model system for studying brain circuitry, our effort will provide a framework to examine the subregion-specific circuits in the mouse striatum.</p><p>Two technical notes are also important regarding why our datasets are different from certain traditional data. First, the high resolution imaging is crucial in our analyses because it allowed us to specify the portions of the striatum where there are a lack of projections, and we took consideration of the negative data (lack of projections) when localizing projection origins in the thalamus (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, most of traditional studies do not discuss any lack of projections due to lack of full brain images, and very few studies make full projections available. The way we categorized and quantified cortical projections requires comprehensive datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). With such a comprehensive map, any specific element of the circuits will need to be tested functionally in the future to have a thorough comparison across species. Second, that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (Mailly et al., 2013). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 15 clusters) (Draganski et al., 2008), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (Gruber and McDonald 2012), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (Mailly et al., 2013; Haber et al., 2006).</p><p>Finally, we also cannot rule out occasional circuit differences at mesoscopic resolution across species due to parallel evolution, as has been found from time to time even between rat and mice (e.g., Schwarz et al., 2015).</p><p>We have added the above points in our Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) Examine the existing dataset to see if it supports or denies the Yeterian and Van Hoesen, (Brain Res, 139:43-63, 1978) hypothesis that cortical areas strongly connected with each other converge in the striatum.</italic></p><p>We have now added analyses to address the hypothesis proposed by Yeterian and Van Hoesen. We first downloaded corticocortical projection data from Allen Institute of Brain Science mouse atlas API and then analyzed projection density between cortical subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found evidence of both types of connection patterns, i) for some cortical subregions, they interconnect with subregions that do not converge in the striatum with, ii) some are highly connected if they converge in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-H</xref>). The first type seems more prevailing. Interestingly, the highly interconnected ones are FrA, M1/2, S1/2, and AI forming highly recurrent networks with convergent subregions, which may be related to highly coordinated functions of somatosensori-motor integration.</p><p><italic>Along this line, we also further integrated cortiocortical connectivity data into our cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic></p><p><italic>6) Cite and discuss the recent paper by Hintiryan et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2016). Many of the corticostriatal projection subdomains identified by these investigators show good overlap with the data in this manuscript, but there may be some areas of disagreement (e.g. the ectorhinal projections into dorsal striatum seem to differ a bit), and if so these should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We have now added the citation of Hintiryan et al. and discussed the related contents. Hintiryan et al. uses an anterograde tracing dataset from cortical injections to illustrate the corticostriatal circuits and demonstrated the usefulness of large scale mesoscopic projection mapping to study ‘circuitry-specific connectopathies’. This study and ours share the same spirit in terms of using comprehensive mesoscopic cortical projections in the striatum to understand the logic of the striatum circuit. At the same time, our study also differs from Hintiryan et al. as we include the thalamostriatal pathway and eventually integrate information regarding cortico-cortical, corticothalamic and thalamocortical circuits. These two studies also emphasize the complementary aspects of the striatal circuits, as detailed below.</p><p>First, Hintiryan et al. paper focused on cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum. In addition to cortico-dorsal striatum data, our study also includes cortico-ventral striatum projections and the projections from the thalamus to the entire striatum. Our thalamostriatal dataset is of particular interest because thalamostriatal data for mouse is scarce in the literature and the circuits are much less understood compared to the corticostriatal pathways. As an example of conclusions unique to our study, the thalamic origins of the projections to the dorsal and ventral striatum, respectively, show a large degree of complementary patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conceptually, we also only use corticostriatal data as the first step, as shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to illustrate the convergence of the corticostriatal and the thalamostriatal pathways. The completeness of our dataset allows us to illustrate the complete cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop by further incorporating corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity, which is not possible with a corticostriatal only dataset.</p><p>Second, Hintiryan et al. identified 29 distinct striatal domains, which are useful for understanding the sub-organizations of the striatum and studying their functions. However, whether there are hierarchical organizations between these domains is less clear. In our analysis, we described a fourth primary subdivision within the posterior striatum, which is in parallel to the conventional dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventral striatal subdivision. By lowering the clustered dendrogram thresholds, increasing numbers (we present up to 15, but the number can be more with even lower thresholds) of subdivisions can be identified and described, but most of these smaller subdivisions are associated with one primary striatal subdivision, the dorsomedial subdivision, and this is consistent with the associative function of this subdivision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Third, while Hintiryan et al. examined two mouse lines and demonstrated the subregion-specific changes in pathological conditions, we provide physiology/optogenetics mediated functional confirmation of the anatomically defined pathways. Importantly, we showed that the subregion-specific input pathways have distinct plasticity properties and this finding could reconcile the apparent discrepancy in the field (Discussion).</p><p>Regarding the corticostriatal projections, our data is overall consistent with Hintiryan et al. As we discuss both above (Essential revisions #4) and below (Encouraged but not required #3), the caveats associated with mouse cortical injection is the difficulty in assigning precisely the subregions being injected. This in turn can make it difficult in cases to evaluate whether individual injections are in and only within a claimed cortical subregion. This applied to both work. For this reason, we were very conservative in including any injections. For example, we included &lt;10% of all published AIBS cortical injections, and we did not take entorhinal as an individual group because almost all AIBS injections in this area also covered either entorhinal, perirhinal, or some of temporal cortex. We instead included entorhinal in Rhi/Tem group (subsection “Corticostriatal projectome data overview”, second paragraph). The small differences between the two studies in corticostriatal inputs might potentially be from jitters in assigning or grouping the cortical subregions.</p><p>These above points are now included in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Encouraged but not required:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A small number of retrograde injections labeling select sub-regions of striatum in order to validate key claims about convergence of cortical and thalamic inputs.</italic></p><p>We have now performed retrograde injection experiments by using retrobeads to target 2 striatal subdivisions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the most dorsomedial subdivision of the striatum and the posterior striatum, as suggested by reviewer 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). All retrogradely labeled neurons are found within the boundaries of the cortical and thalamic subregions illustrated in the manuscript for projecting to the corresponding striatal subdivision. Please note that the beads do not label the whole striatal subdivision, and therefore does not retrograde label all cortical and thalamic input regions. This is expected since we intentionally used very small injections so that there would be no contaminating tails (we excluded animals that we could detect obvious injections tails).</p><p><italic>2) As suggested by Reviewer #1, show that the oEPSC results are robust.</italic></p><p>We have now added analysis to show that oEPSC results are robust.

We were fully aware of the ‘effective’ expression variations across animals. For this reason, our viral titers, infection time etc. parameters were the same for all four groups (we kept them even from the same batch of virus). Even with the best experimental effort, there could be intrinsic factors that give rise to different ‘effective’ expression levels for certain groups. Therefore, we plotted light power used for all four groups (Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC) and there is no overall difference in light power used among the four groups (panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, light power used for Thal1 = 1.157 ± 0.141 mw; Thal2 = 1.475 ± 0.136 mw; Vis = 1.589 ± 0.122 mw; d/vACC = 1.275 ± 0.075 mw, mean ± SEM, Kruskall-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn’s test, <italic>P<sub>(overall)</sub></italic>= 0.09, <italic>Χ2</italic> = 6.54); we also plotted PPR over the light power and there is no correlation between the PPR and the light power (R<sup>2</sup> for Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC were all &lt; 0.045, panel C). Similarly, we also plotted EPSC over light power for single light stimulation and repetitive light stimulation (panel B and D). Our findings regarding the functional heterogeneity of striatal inputs are relative measures obtained within each recording, namely paired-pulse ratio and relative standing current to EPSC amplitude size. Since there is no correlation between PPR or relative standing current with light power, the observed heterogeneity is a feature of the biological system.</p><p><italic>We want to emphasize that this set of experiments were carried out in two different setups and performed by two independent experimenters (pink and blue dots in the attached plot represent two independent experimenters) to minimize this types of bias in channelrhodopsin experiments, the results obtained from the two setups gave the same conclusion (the data in the manuscript was pooled data).</italic></p><p><italic>3) Consider including data on entorhinal projections to striatum. This is a highly interesting cortical area for a number of reasons, so it is not clear why it was not included.</italic></p><p>Our data do include entorhinal (ENT) inputs (e.g. injection number 142656218 and 182794184 listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, they were grouped as part of the Rhi/Tem group (previously named Ect/Tem group). Two AIBS injections (#113226232 and #263974698) that are claimed to be solely ENT, also hit perirhinal cortex when we examined the original data. From our inspection, injection #126116848 is the only one that is specific within ENT. Therefore, rhinal cortical subregions were grouped together. To avoid confusion, we renamed this group Rhi/Tem which includes all rhinal and temporal cortical subregions.

This was accomplished using a combination of existing databases and new experiments. The authors combined this anatomical connectivity work with detailed computer based analyses of injection volumes, averaging of striatal volumes, and effective subtraction of fasciculated fibers of passage. These approaches were supplemented with high quality optogenetic/electrophysiogical experiments showing the location and properties of intriguing selected cortical and thalamic inputs. Overall this work represents a tour-de-force of structural and functional connectivity analysis that will be valuable to everyone studying the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits and their functions. The mapping of overlapping cortical and thalamic inputs to striatum is especially valuable. There are a few areas where data presentation might be improved, and I strongly urge the authors to think about ways that input pathways and especially convergent pathways could be represented in schematic or 3d formats that would be easier for readers to understand. There are also a few questions about some aspects of the data and some small corrections that are needed.</italic></p><p><italic>1) It would be helpful to have at least one figure or panel that included schematic drawings of a section of cortex, a section of striatum and a section of thalamus that would illustrate the convergence of inputs to the striatum, for at least one good example case. Ultimately, it would be great to have several such schematics, maybe posted online. A 3-dimensional plot of some sort would be even more useful, but admittedly difficult to put into the manuscript itself. All the necessary information is certainly present in the figures, it is just very hard to appreciate the overlap without some sort of direct visual representation.</italic></p><p>We have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that walks readers step-by-step through the method by which the convergence data are derived. Both schematic and example images of injections/projections are quantified. Briefly, the cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>) were first used to define a striatal subdivision of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Then we localized the thalamic origins that project to this part of the striatum in the following steps. The thalamostriatal projection in individual sections were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) by using the method described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Thalamostriatal projections in the striatum were aligned across experimental mice as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and their axonal innervation within the striatal subdivision, as defined by the cortical inputs, were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>). The aligned thalamic projections in the striatum from individual injections were then categorized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All injection-projection information for a given striatal subdivision was combined to derive a “thalamic confidence map”, which describes the thalamic subregions that innervate this striatal subdivision (example results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-K</xref>, and methods detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The confidence map for each striatal subdivision is analogous to a comprehensive retrograde tracing analysis from the striatal subdivision. Our method has the advantage that it is efficient (only computational efforts are involved after producing the original thalamic projection dataset), and allows the user to dynamically change the striatal subdivision of interests (e.g., the striatal subdivision receiving M1/2 inputs versus the subdivision receiving d/vACC inputs).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that 3-D plots would be helpful. Data visualization at this scale is challenging and by itself is a rapidly developing field actively pursued by computer scientists and bioinformatists besides biologists. With the current resource we have, presenting the data in 3-D will be beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, along the spirit of the suggestion, we have made efforts in better presenting the data in reduced dimensionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and have added more example images to help illustrating our analysis algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Many users of our data are used to 2D presentation and we hope these 2D plots might help them navigate specific circuits of interest.</p><p><italic>2) There did not seem to be any data on entorhinal projections to striatum. This is a highly interesting cortical area for a number of reasons, so it is not clear why it was not included.</italic></p><p><italic>As discussed earlier, our data do include entorhinal (ENT) inputs (e.g. injection number 142656218 and 182794184 listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, they were grouped as part of the Rhi/Tem group (previously named Ect/Tem group). Two AIBS injections (#113226232 and #263974698) that are claimed to be solely ENT, also hit perirhinal cortex when we examined the original data. From our inspection, injection #126116848 is the only one that is specific within ENT. Therefore, rhinal cortical subregions were grouped together. To avoid confusion, we renamed this group Rhi/Tem which includes all rhinal and temporal cortical subregions. This is now clarified in Methods (subsection “Corticostriatal projectome data overview”, second paragraph), <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Table 2.</italic></p><p><italic>3) Why were the injections, tracing and recordings performed using such young animals? Is there reason to believe that no anatomical or physiological differences would be observed in adult brain?</italic></p><p>The thalamic injected mice were sacrificed ~1 month age. This age was chosen mainly based on our experience with physiological characterizations of the thalamocortical projections with the consideration of two aspects: the technical consideration and the biological consideration. On the technical part, the cortical slices are more robust, and pyramidal neurons, especially layer 5 pyramidal neurons, are much more healthy in young adult mice compared to older mice. So, to provide cortical recordings to validate the thalamocortical projections, as we have done in Hunnicutt et al. 2014 paper, we chose the age (P14-18) that we could do consistent stereotaxic injections and after two weeks of viral infection, we could still have high success rate of cortical neuron recordings. Although the slice health is less of an issue for the striatum, we aimed the injections to accommodate both thalamocortical and thalamostriatal pathways for physiology. On the biological part, the motor and sensory areas are considered functionally and structurally matured by our time-point (P30) and this time point is widely used to investigate sensorimotor integration (e.g., Van Eden &amp; Uylings, 1985 and Weiler et al., 2008), although the frontal area is still dynamic around this time. In our previous work (Hunnicutt et al., 2014), we tested whether there may be large rearrangements in thalamocortical projection distributions, especially the thalamo-frontal projections in young adult mice. We found that thalamocortical projections from at least 24 nuclei have reached the frontal area and form functional synapses by P30, with all frontal subregions being contacted by at least 5 thalamic nuclei. Since the frontal subregions innervated by each nucleus are comparable to those seen in the adult rat, our data suggest that the majority of thalamocortical projections to the frontal area have reached their final targets by P30 in mouse. Therefore, the behavioral changes during young adult rodents are more likely due to local refinements and synaptic pruning, rather than larger rearrangements in thalamocortical projection distributions to frontal subregions.</p><p>The reviewer’s comment also brought up a really interesting question: would anatomical and/or physiological connectivity be different in older mouse brains at the mesoscopic resolution. This question is definitely worth testing but is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the oEPSCs, did the paired-pulse and frequency responses and the sustained current vary with light stimulus intensity, duration or the amplitude of the initial oEPSC? The data certainly suggest differences in synaptic properties, but care should be taken to be sure that these differences are not due to differences in the level of channel rhodopsin expression or activation in different projections (also, are the scale bar values in panel C the same as in panel D?).</italic></p><p>The reviewerbrought up one of the most important parameters in any channelrhodopsin-related quantitative comparison. We were fully aware of the ‘effective’ expression variations across animals. For this reason, our viral titers, infection time etc. parameters were the same for all four groups. Even with the best effort, there could be intrinsic factors that give rise to different ‘effective’ expression levels for certain groups. Therefore, we plotted light power used for all four groups (Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC) and there is no overall difference in light power used among the four groups (panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, light power used for Thal1 = 1.157 ± 0.141 mw; Thal2 = 1.475 ± 0.136 mw; Vis = 1.589 ± 0.122 mw; d/vACC = 1.275 ± 0.075 mw, mean ± SEM, Kruskall-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn’s test, <italic>P<sub>(overall)</sub></italic>= 0.09, <italic>Χ2</italic> = 6.54); we also plotted PPR over the light power and there is no correlation between the PPR and the light power (R<sup>2</sup> for Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC were all &lt; 0.045, panel C). Similarly, we also plotted EPSC over light power for single light stimulation and repetitive light stimulation (panel B and D). Our findings regarding the functional heterogeneity of striatal inputs are relative measures obtained within each recording, namely paired-pulse ratio and relative standing current to EPSC amplitude size. Since there is no correlation between PPR or relative standing current with light power, the observed heterogeneity is a feature of the biological system.</p><p>We want to emphasize that this set of experiments were carried out in two different setups and performed by two independent experimenters (pink and blue dots in the attached plot represent two independent experimenters) to minimize this types of bias in channelrhodopsin experiments, the results obtained from the two setups gave the same conclusion (the data in the manuscript was pooled data).</p><p>We decided not to put these plots as a figure in the manuscript. This is because although it is an important point, channelrhodopsin is more of a standard reagent now. We do state this point in the manuscript. We wrote: ‘The results presented here do not show correlations with the light power used for photostimulation (data not shown).’</p><p>We now change the label for scales for both panels C and D and as the reviewer indicated, they are the same labels.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to cite and discuss the recent paper by Hintiryan et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2016). Many of the corticostriatal projection subdomains identified by these investigators show good overlap with the data in this manuscript, but there may be some areas of disagreement (e.g. the ectorhinal projections into dorsal striatum seem to differ a bit), and if so these should be discussed.</italic></p><p>See our response to Essential revision #6.</p><p><italic>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Corticostriatal projectome data overview”, the authors note that the striatum does not receive olfactory information, and cite a previous publication and the AIBS site. However, it is not clear if they include the olfactory tubercle in their definition of the striatum. It might be worth revising this statement to indicate that olfactory information does not go to dorsal striatum and only weakly to ventral striatum/accumbens, but that the olfactory tubercle that has many striatal-like properties does receive this input, but will not be the subject of this study. On a related subject, Hintiryan et al. report that piriform cortex projects to ventral/ventromedial striatum, and the Allen Brain connectivity site shows a weak projection to parts of the nucleus accumbens, so perhaps statements regarding this cortical subregion should be revised.</italic></p><p>Our original statement did not mean to include olfactory tubercles. We now revised the statement in Methods regarding the olfactory processing to make this clearer.</p><p>We wrote: ‘Since that olfactory information does not project directly to the dorsal striatum and only very weakly to the ventral striatum and with olfactory tubercle not considered, olfactory areas and the piriform cortex were not included (McGeorge and Faull, 1989), leaving 957 injections’.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>While I think there is a lot of interesting information in the paper, the presentation was often confusing, and more example data, analysis, and explanation are needed. It should be noted that a recent study also studied the cortico-striatal projectome in great detail (Hintiryan et al., 2016). In my view, the current paper is complementary, as it focuses on thalamostriatal projections and larger circuits. I think it has the potential to be a valuable resource, but several major points first need to be addressed.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors jump from mapping corticostriatal inputs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to a complex analysis of thalamic nuclei in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Before making that jump, I would like to see more examples of the thalamostriatal projections and how they were analyzed.</italic></p><p>To add more example data and to improve the presentation and logic flow, we have now added the following full figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for example images; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1— figure supplement 2</xref> for explaining the logic of how an analysis is performed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6— figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6— figure supplement 3</xref> to better illustrate circuit properties. We agreed with the reviewer that the original manuscript had a gap in how we went from corticostriatal pathways to the thalamostriatal convergence. We have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that walks readers step-by-step through the method by which the convergence data are derived. Briefly, the cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>) were first used to define a striatal subdivision of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Then we localized the thalamic origins that project to this part of the striatum in the following steps. The thalamostriatal projection in individual sections were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) by using the method described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Thalamostriatal projections in the striatum were aligned across experimental mice as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and their axonal innervation within the striatal subdivision, as defined by the cortical inputs, were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>). The aligned thalamic projections in the striatum from individual injections were then categorized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All injection-projection information for a given striatal subdivision was combined to derive a “thalamic confidence map”, which describes the thalamic subregions that innervate this striatal subdivision (example results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-K</xref>, and methods detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The confidence map for each striatal subdivision is analogous to a comprehensive retrograde tracing analysis from the striatal subdivision. Our method has the advantage that it is efficient (only computational efforts are involved after producing the original thalamic projection dataset), and allows the user to dynamically change the striatal subdivision of interests (e.g., the striatal subdivision receiving M1/2 inputs versus the subdivision receiving d/vACC inputs). We hope this closed the missing logic gap that the reviewer was concerned about.</p><p>Along the same spirit of illustrating the key steps in our analyses using example images, we have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for how the corticostriatal projection maps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were derived.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows how corticostriatal inputs define sub-regions of striatum, and how different thalamic nuclei project onto these different sub-regions. I think it would be valuable to experimentally validate this result by performing retrograde injections into striatum and showing which cortical and thalamic areas are labeled. For example, retrograde injections into the 4 clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> should presumably label the same areas of cortex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B/C</xref> and thalamus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E/F</xref>.</italic></p><p>See our response to Encouraged but not required #1.</p><p><italic>3) The first part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is potentially interesting, but currently underdeveloped. I would like to see more examples from the different clusters that receive cortical and thalamic input shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. For example, it would be interesting to see examples for dorsomedial, dorsolateral, ventromedial and very caudal striatum.</italic></p><p>We have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to expand the concept of the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop using our current thalamostriatal dataset, previously published thalamocortical and corticothalamic datasets, and newly added corticocortical connectivity analysis based on data downloaded from the Allen Institute mouse connectivity atlas during the revision. Greater details of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical projections related to the 4 primary striatal subdivisions identified in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>. These new results are also described in detail in the main text (Results subsection “The cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop organization for clustered striatal subdivisions”; Methods subsection “Network diagrams of circuit convergence and connectivity”). Overall, we use S1/2 subregion as an example to explain the concept of the triangular loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>) and use the 4 thalamic subregions innervated by GPi/SNr as the way to tie the entire loop. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is a natural extension of integrating now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The full loop maps in similar format to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-C</xref> are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. A detailed description of these features is also now included in the main text.</p><p><italic>4) The last part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, examining corticothalamic feedback connections, is very underdeveloped. It is important to show much more data on the corticothalamic projection, how it was processed, and how it fits into the paper. As it currently stands, I cannot agree that &quot;these data provide a comprehensive picture of cortical and thalamic input integration in the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia circuit&quot;.</italic></p><p>We have now included datasets for thalamocortical, thalamostriatal, corticothalamic and corticocortical pathways. As discussed above, we have added a new main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and two supplement figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) show the network properties and the information flow in the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop in the subregion-specific manner, with the highlight of thalamic nuclei innervated by GPi/SNr as the basal ganglia projection targets.</p><p>Overall, we kept S1/2 subregion as an example to explain the concept of the triangular loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>) and use the 4 thalamic subregions innervated by GPi/SNr as the way to tie the entire loop. In these figures, corticothalamic projections are grouped across the cortical subregions that form the primary inputs of each of the 4 striatal subdivisions, as determined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We hope that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, together with the full loop maps presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> will provide readers a more detailed comprehension of the cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop circuit features. A detailed description of these features is also now included in the main text.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it seems like it would be much more interesting to validate some of the previously unexplored areas of the striatum that were identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, and see examples for dorsomedial, dorsolateral, ventromedial and caudal striatum. Although it is not a big part of the paper, the authors should also provide some explanation for the slow EPSC, which could be an artifact due to excessive input. Ideally, they should show that this data is relatively invariant with light intensity.</italic></p><p>Please see panel D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> with reviewer 1’s comments for slow EPSC over the light power for all four group (Thal1, Thal2, V1 and vACC). We found no significant correlations between the light power used and the amplitude of the current (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.01, 0.61, -0.01, and 0.07 respectively for Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC). Although R<sup>2</sup> for Thal2 is 0.61, the intercept and the slope for the fitting are very small (-0.009 and 0.02 respectively), consistent with the idea that there is no slow current for Thal2 compared toThal1 and d/vACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we also find no overall difference in light power used among the four groups and no correlation between the PPR and the light power. Please see the response to review 1 #3 for details.</p><p>In the current manuscript, we focus on using optogenetic/physiology experiments to demonstrate circuit convergence from 4 subregions of the thalamus and the cortex: Thal1, Thal2, Vis and d/vACC. We feel that these functional confirmations are necessary to complete the story by establishing the functional relevance of the anatomical maps we present. Examining previously under-explored striatal subregions, while extremely interesting and important, would require systematic efforts to target small thalamic sub-regions. Although we can achieve higher-than-injection-volume resolution by utilizing overlapping thalamic injections, it remains challenging to target small thalamic subregions we described with any single injection. Therefore, we feel that it is beyond the scope of current work.</p><p><italic>In light of this discussion, we have now re-worded our summary to clearly state that only example pathways were tested for optogenetic experiments. We wrote: ‘With all the pathways tested, the anatomically described corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections were confirmed to be functional using optogenetic approaches.’</italic></p><p><italic>6) The authors should discuss in detail how their work relates to Hintiryan et al., 2016.</italic></p><p>See our response to Essential revision #6.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper shows how far we have come technically. The future of connectivity studies looks a lot like this paper. It is exciting to see a comprehensive approach to a large and diverse projection like the corticostriatal pathway.</italic></p><p><italic>However, the results make a stark contrast with the results from traditional methods of mapping the corticostriatal projection, and I have more confidence in the previous results. The results here indicate much less structure in the corticostriatal projection than expected, and it may be the projection is less structured in mice than in larger animals. Both the old and new methods (and primates and mice) have their strong and weak points. It is great to cover the entire cortex. In the previous generation of this kind of work it was never possible to do more than a fragment of the cortex in any one study. The positive side of the old primate work is that cortical regions were much better defined, and the projections were seen at higher resolution. Not only are functional regions larger in primates, but it was often possible to define regions functionally, rather than only by position on the cortex. This allowed injections to be placed far from functional boundaries, and even in functional subregions (e.g. hand area of somatosensory cortex). A lesson of those old papers was that cortical regions that are close to each other might be functionally disparate and have disparate projections in the striatum. That is, although they projected to the same general area of the striatum (e.g. the somatosensory cortex recipient region), injections in the hand and foot somatosensory cortex did not have convergent projections at the microscopic level, and so did not converge on single striatal neurons. My first concern about this study is that all of those principles learned from the primate work have been jettisoned, and a strictly spatial scheme is used. Because functional areas of the cortex in the mouse are so small, it is likely that most of these injections involve very different functional cortical regions with different projections in the striatum, and are being superimposed to make the projection look less specific than it is. The same could be said about the thalamic projections. Stated differently, if the cortex or thalamus contained an affine map of function, the lost resolution in the injections could be recovered by comparing nearby injections. If it is not, then this will not work. I think the previous work suggests that it is not.</italic></p><p><italic>One method that has served well in the past when functional mapping was unavailable was to look at the projections in the thalamus. Often, the precise set of cortical areas involved in a tracer injection can be inferred from its thalamic projections, as these have such sharp boundaries and corticothalamic relations are so well known.</italic></p><p>The reviewer has pointed out the exact advantages and the disadvantages of the mice mesoscopic mapping. The advantages of our study in mice are two folds. First, because mouse brains are small, we were able to cover all cortical subregions and &gt; 93% volume of the thalamus with individual injections of small (500-600 µm) sizes, and image the entire projections of every injection. The level of comprehensiveness in documenting thalamic projections has not been previously achieved in any mammalian species. Second, the comprehensiveness of the dataset allow us to perform quantitative analyses that are only possible with full dataset, but not with example images. For example, conventional descriptions of thalamic projections are mostly based on thalamic nucleus demarcations which, when compared to cats or primates, are less distinct and sometimes ambiguous in mice (Jones 2007, pg 52). As better stated in the textbook by Sherman and Guillery (2006), ‘The concept of the thalamic nucleus as a single structural, functional, and connectional entity has barely survived advancing techniques and new information. We stay with the thalamic nuclei as one of our prime analytical tools because, as yet, we have little to use in its place’. In our studies, we take the unique opportunity to establish nucleus-independent thalamic projection maps by using model thalamus based on averaging 70-100 mouse brains (Hunnicutt et al., 2014). We also devoted significant effort to connect with the existing literature: for all the confidence maps presented, we overlay the confidence maps with the nucleus demarcations of both Paxinos atlas and Allen Brain atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D-E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).But because everything is smaller, and often time, lack of anatomical landmarks, accurately assigning the cortical subregions can be might be vague and ambiguous, and not trivial. For example, unlike in primate literature, the definition of some cortical subregions themselves can be controversial in mice (e.g., for M1 and M2, see Mao et al., 2011) and even with the ones that have clear functional definitions, their physical landmarks are lacking. Unfortunately, the boundaries of the thalamic nucleus are also much less distinct compared to the ones in the primate as mentioned above. This is indeed a common challenge in the field for mesoscopic mapping in mice at large scale. For thalamic injections, we took full advantage of the high <italic>n</italic> numbers we could get and used overlapping injections to dramatically increase the resolution (Hunnicutt et al., 2014). This algorithm is the operational expressing of what this reviewer mentioned as ‘the lost resolution…recovered by comparing nearby injections’. For cortical injections, we did the best practice possible by sticking to the existing mouse atlas and by being consistent in selection process (that is why &lt; 10% of AIBS injections was selected into the dataset). Even with great care, the lack of clear landmarks in mouse cortical subregion definition may still be a source of variability. We are also limited to what is available in AIBS database for cortical injections which is already the best effort available with current technology with using over 1600 brains for establishing the model brain to assign the subregions. These cortical injections are mostly not overlapping with one another, so we could not employ similar resolution-improving algorithms we did with thalamic injections.</p><p>We do not want to claim that we have solved the issue of dealing with less accurate brain region assignment (compared to primate work). Instead, we feel that our work illustrates the exact issues (e.g., injections not confined within a given thalamic nucleus, and ‘involving potentially different functional areas of the cortex’, as the reviewer pointed out). Many of our analyses were, in fact, inspired by the primate work (e.g., work cited Graybiel and colleagues for cortical inputs and Smith and colleagues for thalamic inputs) because we had to think how to take advantage of our data and combat the disadvantages. In the meantime, mouse has become an essential model in understanding the brain circuits. We reason that providing such anatomical maps, despite possible drawbacks, is important.</p><p>Two technical notes are also important regarding why our datasets are different from certain traditional data. First, the high resolution imaging is crucial in our analyses because it allowed us to specify the portions of the striatum where there are a lack of projections, and we took consideration of the negative data (lack of projections) when localizing projection origins in the thalamus (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, most of traditional studies do not discuss any lack of projections due to lack of full brain images, and very few studies make full projections available. The way we categorized and quantified cortical projections requires comprehensive datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). With such a comprehensive map, any specific element of the circuits will need to be tested functionally in the future to have a thorough comparison across species. Second, that there are two distinct projection patterns of corticostriatal axons, a localized dense core projection and a diffuse projection that generally spans a wider area than the dense projections (Mailly et al., 2013). Many previous mapping studies preferentially focused on the dense projections, particularly when reporting a summary result of several tracing experiments. In our data, we mapped both the dense and diffuse projections, and this revealed some previously underappreciated convergence patterns, such as the diffuse somatosensory-motor inputs to a portion of the limbic striatum (mid-dark blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 15 clusters) (Draganski et al., 2008), and the widespread diffuse projections of LO/VO to nearly the entire striatal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our dense projection results are highly consistent with the corticostriatal projection distributions reported in the literature (Gruber and McDonald 2012), and studies that separate the dense and diffuse projections describe similarly widespread diffuse projections (Mailly et al., 2013; Haber et al., 2006).</p><p>Finally, we also cannot rule out occasional circuit differences at mesoscopic resolution across species due to parallel evolution, as has been found from time to time even between rat and mice (e.g., Schwarz et al., 2015).</p><p>We have added the discussion for above points (Discussion).</p><p><italic>One test of whether the results are showing us something really new or are just a blurred version of what we already know would be to find some new principle emerge, or to test an old one. I do not see any clear statement of a new principle. I think in this the authors may have missed an opportunity. One principle proposed by previous authors was that cortical areas that are strongly connected with each other converge in the striatum (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, Brain Res, 139:43-63, 1978). It seems to me that the information required to test this idea may be already available in the authors' data set, just by including corticocortical projections.</italic></p><p>We have now added analyses to address the hypothesis proposed by Yeterian and Van Hoesen. We first downloaded corticocortical projection data from Allen Institute of Brain Science mouse atlas website and then analyzed projection density between cortical subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found evidence of both types of connection patterns, i) for some cortical subregions, they interconnect with subregions that do not converge in the striatum with, ii) some are highly connected if they converge in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-H</xref>). The first type seems more prevailing. Interestingly, the highly interconnected ones are FrA, M1/2, S1/2, and AI forming highly recurrent networks with convergent subregions, which may be related to highly coordinated functions of sensori-motor integration.</p><p><italic>Along this line, we also further integrated cortiocortical connectivity data into our cortico-thalamo-basal ganglia loop analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic></p><p><italic>Declaring there to be a sensorimotor domain in the striatum is misleading. The somatosensory and motor systems are very closely connected and in the past many studies have shown that somatosensory and motor function may even overlap spatially in the cortex (of rodents). However, this does not extend to other sensory modalities. For example, visual cortex or its projections to the striatum do not go to the region called sensory by the authors. Throughout the paper, the word sensory seems specifically associated with the somatosensory cortex. I think the authors should replace the word 'sensory' in all cases in which it appears with 'somatosensory'. One thing we have learned from previous studies is that there is very little overlap between visual and somatosensory cortical projections to the striatum, and very little between visual and primary motor cortex. This is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but still, there is no recognition that Aud and Vis are sensory cortices. Their projections do not overlap much with motor cortex at all. What does this mean about the idea that all sensory input is 'sensorimotor'?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer. The term meant to be used for somatosensory cortical area and it was misleading. We change ‘sensory’ to ‘somatosensory’ throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
