Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-psychotropic therapeutically active ingredient of <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>, is an activator of TRPV2 and also modulates other transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Here, we determined structures of the full-length rat TRPV2 channel in apo and CBD-bound states in nanodiscs by cryo-electron microscopy. We show that CBD interacts with TRPV2 through a hydrophobic pocket located between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits, which differs from known ligand and lipid binding sites in other TRP channels. CBD-bound TRPV2 structures revealed that the S4-S5 linker plays a critical role in channel gating upon CBD binding. Additionally, nanodiscs permitted us to visualize two distinct TRPV2 apo states in a lipid environment. Together these results provide a foundation to further understand TRPV channel gating, their divergent physiological functions, and to accelerate structure-based drug design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRP channels</kwd><kwd>cannabidiol</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moiseenkova-Bell</surname><given-names>Vera Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM103899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moiseenkova-Bell</surname><given-names>Vera Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS055159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM093290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohacs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabidiol binds to TRPV2 via a previously unidentified, but highly conserved, pocket.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play significant roles in human physiology and facilitate permeation of essential ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) through the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Venkatachalam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>). Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) belongs to the thermoTRPV subfamily of TRP channels (TRPV1-TRPV4), yet TRPV2 does not contribute to thermal nociception in vivo and is insensitive to vanilloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perálvarez-Marín et al., 2013</xref>). It has been the least studied among TRPV channels due to the lack of specific pharmacological agonists or antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perálvarez-Marín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>). Cannabidiol (CBD), a natural product of the <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> plant, is a TRPV2 agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>) which has been recently used to demonstrate the important role of TRPV2 in the inhibition of glioblastoma multiforme cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perálvarez-Marín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liberati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nabissi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nabissi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nabissi et al., 2013</xref>). These findings place TRPV2 on the list of important anti-tumor drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perálvarez-Marín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liberati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nabissi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nabissi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nabissi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cannabinoids and cannabinoid analogs have been reported to activate a variety of TRP channels, including TRPV1-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Petrocellis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smart et al., 2000</xref>) and TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Petrocellis et al., 2008</xref>). CBD activates TRPV2 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 3.7 µM for rat TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>), making it a good candidate for the investigation of TRP channel modulation by CBD using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Additionally, the activation of other TRP channels by CBD suggests that a cannabinoid binding site could be conserved within this family of channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Petrocellis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Petrocellis et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding the molecular mechanism of CBD modulation of functionally diverse TRP channels could allow us to gain insight into the gating mechanisms of these channels and develop novel therapeutics.</p><p>Recently, the TRPV2 channel has been the subject of several cryo-EM studies that offered thought-provoking insights on TRPV2 channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>). Constructs used in these studies varied from the pore turret deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>) to the full-length engineered resiniferatoxin (RTx)-sensitive channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>) and full-length wild-type channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>). These studies have been performed in detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>), amphipol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>), and nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>) and used TRPV2 from different channel orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>). Studies using the rabbit TRPV2 pore turret deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>) and full-length engineered resiniferatoxin (RTx)-sensitive channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>) concluded that the pore turret region in rabbit TRPV2 is not essential for channel function and that although mostly unresolved, it adopts a conformation perpendicular to the lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>). These studies also suggested that engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel undergoes symmetry transitions when activated by RTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, structures using the rat TRPV2 pore turret deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>) and full-length channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>) showed that the pore turret region plays a vital role in rat TRPV2 gating, whether in the presence or in the absences of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>). The previous full-length rat TRPV2 structure from our group was determined at ∼5 Å resolution in detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>), but at this resolution we could not build side chains, accurately assign the functional state of the channel or resolve pore turrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the pore turret structure in the full-length rat TRPV2 channel in detergent has been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>) and shown to adopt a conformation parallel to the lipid membrane. Moreover, this full-length rat TRPV2 structure in detergent has been assigned to the open state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>), however the provided cryo-EM data were not of sufficient quality to independently confirm this proposed channel conformation or the pore turret structure of the channel.</p><p>Here, we reconstituted the full-length rat TRPV2 channel in nanodiscs and determined the effect that a lipid environment and 30 μM CBD have on the channel structure. We now report two TRPV2 structures determined in an apo state resolved to 3.7 Å (TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>) and 4.0 Å (TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>) and two TRPV2 structures determined in the presence of 30 μM CBD resolved to 3.4 Å (TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>) and 3.2 Å (TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In both TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> and TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub>, CBD density occupies the newly proposed CBD-binding site between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits, but both channels adopt non-conducting conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> is very similar to TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> diverges from the non-conducting TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> state in nanodiscs, suggesting that we have resolved the channel in CBD-bound pre-open states or desensitized states. Moreover, nanodiscs allow us to observe TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub> state in a partially open conformation, suggesting that lipids play an important role in channel transitions between closed and open states. Comparison between the newly determined TRPV2 structures also revealed that the S4-S5 linker plays a critical role in channel gating. Together these results provide new structural information on the TRPV2 channel which could be used for the design of novel TRP channel therapeutics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48792.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the full-length rat TRPV2 channel structures in nanodiscs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional cryo-EM reconstructions for TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> at 3.7 Å (salmon), TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub> at 4.0 Å (purple), TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> at 3.4 Å (green), TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> at 3.2 Å (blue); (<bold>B</bold>) CBD binding pocket in the TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> structure.

The CBD-bound TRPV2 data also yielded two structures: TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> at 3.4 Å and TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> at 3.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The good quality of these cryo-EM maps allowed us to build atomic models for the TRPV2 channel in four different states, placing sidechains throughout the models. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As in previous cryo-EM structures of TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>), all four newly resolved full-length rat TRPV2 channels form homo-tetramers featuring six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) spanning the transmembrane domain (TMD) with six ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs) splayed out like a pinwheel on the cytoplasmic face of the protein, with the ARDs of adjacent monomers connected through a β-sheet region composed of the N-linker between the ARDs and the TMD and a portion of the C-terminus. S1-S4 form a bundle, while S5, S6 and the pore helix (PH) extend away from S1-S4 to domain swap with adjacent monomers and form the pore. Despite working with the full-length rat TRPV2 protein, all four maps obtained in this study lack fully resolved density for the pore turret between the top of S5 and the pore helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). Nevertheless, partial density for this region of the channel indicates that the pore turret forms a flexible loop perpendicular to the lipid membrane, which agrees with observations in the full-length engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>). Thus, our data do not agree with the observation that the charged and polar flexible pore turret loop is arranged parallel to the plasma membrane as it has been reported for the full-length rat TRPV2 structure in detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p><p>Comparison between full-length rat TRPV2 in the apo (TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>) and the CBD-bound (TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub>) states in nanodiscs allowed us to identify the CBD-binding pocket, which is located between the S5 and S6 helices of adjacent TRPV2 monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The non-protein density assigned to the CBD ligand is not present in the final or half maps of either apo TRPV2 structure and is present in all half maps of the CBD-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>). Since this density is unique to the dataset with added CBD and is similar in size and shape to CBD, we have assigned it to CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>All full-length rat TRPV2 maps presented in this manuscript also have extra non-protein density that could be attributed to lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Several cryo-EM studies on TRPV channels also observed very similar lipid densities in different TMD hydrophobic pockets and proposed that some of these lipids are important for channel function and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zubcevic et al., 2018a</xref>). It is interesting to note that ligand binding sites in several other TRPV channel cryo-EM structures determined so far have been also occupied by lipids in their apo structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hughes et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zubcevic et al., 2018a</xref>), which is not the case for the CBD binding pocket determined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The pore analysis of these four structures showed that they adopt distinct non-conducting conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> pore is occluded at the selectivity filter (Gly606 and Met607) and the lower gate of the channel (Met645 and His651), representing a closed TRPV2 state in nanodiscs. On the other hand, the TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub> pore selectivity filter is wide open, suggesting that this structure is in a partially open state. The TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> and TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> pores are in two different non-conducting states, suggesting that we may have resolved CBD-bound pre-open or desensitized states of the channel.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CBD binding site</title><p>A comparison of the models built into the TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>, and TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> cryo-EM maps revealed that the CBD binding site is lined with mostly hydrophobic and aromatic residues. These include Leu631, Tyr634, Val635 and Leu638 on the S6 helix of one monomer and Leu537, Phe540, Leu541 on the S5 helix and Met640 on the S6 helix of an adjacent monomer, while the pore helix of the adjacent monomer caps the pocket with residues Phe601 and Thr604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). CBD is composed of a cyclohexene headgroup with small hydrophobic substitutions, a middle aromatic ring with two free phenolic hydroxyl groups, and a 5-carbon acyl tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The hydrophobic head group enters furthest into the CBD-binding pocket, where it is surrounded by aromatic and hydrophobic residues. Notably, although most of the residues in this pocket are in similar positions in all three structures, Tyr634 rotates between TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> and the CBD-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to sit next to CBD, which may be due to the hydrophobic effect shielding CBD from ions in the pore. The two free phenolic hydroxyl groups of the middle region of CBD fit between turns of the α-helices on either side, potentially coordinating via bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of Leu631 and amide of Tyr634 on S6 of one monomer and the carbonyl of Leu537 and the amide of Leu541 on S5 of the adjacent monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, the Leu537 sidechain has rotated in the CBD-bound structures to accommodate the aromatic ring of CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Density for the CBD acyl tail trails off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating flexibility where the acyl tail meets lipids in the lipid bilayer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48792.014</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The CBD binding site.</title><p>Model representations of the CBD binding pockets in the (<bold>A</bold>) TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> (salmon), (<bold>B</bold>) TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> (green) and (<bold>C</bold>) TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> (blue) structures.

An alternate pose of the ligand was also tested, with CBD rotated 180° around its longest axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), turning the headgroup over in the interior of the pocket. While this pose was stable in the ligand density during refinement, it clashed with the Leu537 sidechain in the TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> structure, indicating the original pose as the optimal fit for this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Based on the CBD binding site identified in out cryo-EM maps, we predicted that mutating some of the smaller hydrophobic residues in this pocket to a bulky aromatic residue like phenylalanine could alter CBD access to the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Many of the residues on the interior of the binding pocket, which make contacts with the hydrophobic head group are already bulky aromatic groups and are additionally highly conserved across thermoTRPV channels, possibly indicating a crucial role at the tetramerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), so we focused on mutating Leu541, Leu631, and Val635 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Neither 20 μM CBD nor 100 μM 2-APB induced any current in non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with the Val635Phe mutant, indicating that the latter mutant was non-functional (data not shown).

The quality of density in this region is not sufficient to determine whether this caused the formation of the S4-S5 π helix hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has been observed in the S4-S5 linker in the full-length engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>). The conformational change in the S4-S5 linker of TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> is coupled to an 8° rotation of the TRP helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This rotation of the TRP helix in TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> also shifted it closer to the bottom of S6, potentially allowing for the rotation of His651 away from the pore of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The rotation of the TRP helix in TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> is also paired with a pivot outward by 1.5° and downward by 3.5° of each individual ARD, resulting in a downward swing of 4.5 Å at ankyrin repeat (AR) 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, the distal C-terminus in TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> transitioned from a helix to a coil, extending to residue Pro729 that wrapped around the β-sheet region and made contacts with AR 2–3 of the adjacent subunit of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Despite the rotation of the S5-PH-S6 region, the His651 residues at the bottom of the pore keep the helices together and the interplay between the rotation and the anchoring at His651 causes the base of the S6 helix to curve slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Nanodisc technology allowed us to resolve four different full-length rat TRPV2 structures in lipid membranes and observe membrane lipids that associated with the channel. We were able to identify the novel CBD binding site in the TRPV2 channel, which does not correspond to any lipid binding sites in TRPV channels, and determine conformational changes in TRPV2 upon CBD binding. TRPV channels share ~40% sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madej and Ziegler, 2018</xref>) and thermoTRPV channels (TRPV1-TRPV4) have all been shown to have varying levels of modulation by CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Petrocellis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smart et al., 2000</xref>). TRPV2 interacts with CBD through a hydrophobic pocket located between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits, which is highly conserved among TRPV channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This binding site coincides with the location of the π-helix on S6 in all truncated rat TRPV1 structures in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), while all the TRPV2 structures reported here had standard α-helixes in this portion of S6. Previous structures of rabbit TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>) and frog TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2018</xref>) also had standard α-helical S6 helices. In contrast, TRPV3 studies proposed that a transition between an α-helix and a π-helix on S6 is critical for channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zubcevic et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zubcevic et al., 2019b</xref>). Based on our current results, it is unclear whether the presence of the π-helix in TRPV1 and TRPV3 channels would hinder or aid CBD binding to the channel. Further systematic structural analysis of the full-length TRPV1-TRPV4 channels in the presence of CBD would be able to clarify this observation.</p><p>Studies on the truncated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zubcevic et al., 2018b</xref>) and full-length engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>) suggested that upon RTx binding TRPV2 undergoes a transition between two-fold and four-fold symmetry and that this transition is seen for structures in both amphipols and nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>). However, we did not see any evidence of two-fold symmetry transition in either of our full-length rat TRPV2 in nanodiscs data sets at any stage of data processing. Additionally, we did not see any indication in our structures that the pore turrets are arranging parallel to the membrane and interact with the lipids in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosey et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, in all of our structures we saw partial density for the pore turrets extending perpendicularly away from the membrane, confirming similar observations in the full-length engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>As all of these full-length rat TRPV2 structures are in static states, the forces and timing of the structural changes we observed are unclear. However, it seems logical to suggest that these changes would originate at the S4-S5 linker, which is the closest divergent region to the site of CBD binding. This region has previously been suggested to function as the gearbox in TRP channels generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hofmann et al., 2017</xref>), mediating the transmission of forces between the pore and the rest of the channel, which is consistent with our observations. This is also consistent with the recent work on the engineered RTx-sensitive rabbit TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>), which showed similar transitions in the S4-S5 linker upon RTx binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Previous work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Penna et al., 2006</xref>) has suggested that TRPV2 has some level of constitutive activity. This is supported by the second structure obtained from the apo TRPV2 dataset, TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>. Although this structure features an open selectivity filter, the TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub> pore is still occluded by His651 residues at the bottom of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). This state may be a snapshot of a semi-open state of the full-length rat TRPV2 channel. Despite the prominent role His651 seems to be playing in rat TRPV2 structures, it should be noted that His651 is not conserved, and in fact the human TRPV2 channel has a serine rather than a histidine in this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar selectivity filter conformation has been observed in the truncated rat TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>) channel upon RTx and double-knot toxin (DkTx) application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and it has been proposed that the selectivity filter plays a critical role in TRPV1 channel gating. All recent TRPV2 cryo-EM studies have made very similar conclusions, suggesting that TRPV1 and TRPV2 share similar gating mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zubcevic et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>). The data presented here support this idea and we conclude that the selectivity filter in TRPV2 is important for channel gating.</p><p>Recently, it has also been observed that the distal C-terminus in TRPV1-TRPV3 cryo-EM structures can adopt helical or coil conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zubcevic et al., 2019b</xref>), which may be associated with TRPV channel gating. The distal C-terminus in the truncated apo rat TRPV1 structure and mutant human TRPV3 structures are suggested to be helical, while in multiple wild-type apo TRPV3 structures and in the truncated rabbit TRPV2 channel X-ray structure in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> it is in the coil conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zubcevic et al., 2019b</xref>). Three of our structures (TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>, and TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>) have a helical distal C-terminus, but in TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub> the distal C-terminus adopts a coil conformation. Additionally, in three of our structures (TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>, TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>, and TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>) we observe a density that we assigned to the distal N-terminus, that is similar to the mutant human TRPV3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zubcevic et al., 2019b</xref>). Nevertheless, in another TRPV3 structure this region was assigned to be an extension of the distal C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). Based on all these recent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zubcevic et al., 2019b</xref>), it is evident that the distal N- and C termini undergo conformation changes in TRPV1-TRPV3 channels, nevertheless further structural analysis of these channels would need to be performed to clarify the role of distal intracellular domains in channels gating.</p><p>Overall, our structural studies provided new molecular insights into TRPV2 channel gating and revealed a novel drug binding site in TRPV channels.

Defocus values of the images range from −0.8 to −3.0 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image processing</title><p>For both datasets, all data processing was conducted in RELION 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheres, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). The movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), with the apo dataset being binned by two to a pixel size of 1.06 Å/pix, to compensate for beam-induced motion. Defocus values of the motion corrected micrographs were estimated using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang, 2016</xref>). At this point, suboptimal micrographs were removed from each dataset based on manual inspection and statistics generated by Gctf. Initially, a subset of 100 micrographs were picked from each with Laplacian-of-Gain auto-picking, which yielded on the order of 10 s of thousands of particles for each dataset. Each set of particles were subsequently sorted into 2D classes to generate templates for standard auto-picking for each dataset. For the apo dataset, auto-picking of 10,548 micrographs resulted in ~1.2 million auto-picked particles, for the CBD-bound dataset, auto-picking of 5024 micrographs resulted in ~2.3 million auto-picked particles. These were then subjected to 2D classification to remove suboptimal particles and false positive hits. The best 596,859 particles from the apo and 710,728 from the CBD-bound dataset were refined without applied symmetry. The initial model for these refinements was created from the density map of the previously published full length TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>) (EMB-6580) filtered to 60 Å. These initially refined particles were then subjected to 3D classification into eight classes without angular sampling and no applied symmetry, using a soft mask made from the initial 3D refinement. For both datasets, this classification yielded a single, clear best class with good TRP channel features. The best classes from the apo dataset had 117, 582 particles and from the CBD-bound dataset had 153,464 particles. Each set of particles were refined with no applied symmetry and tested for symmetry using the Map Symmetry tool in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>), which assigned C4 symmetry to both maps. These particles were then refined again with C4 symmetry before being subjected to CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and an additional round of 2D classification to further remove noise. After this treatment, the apo dataset had 96,161 polished particles and the CBD-bound dataset had 125,038 polished particles. Each set of particles was then refined with C4 symmetry followed by 3D classification without angular sampling into five classes for the apo dataset and six classes for the CBD-bound dataset, using a mask of the full TRP channel but excluding density for the nanodisc. Sorting for both datasets yielded three best classes, and in both datasets two of those classes were sufficiently similar to combine. This resulted in two final sets of particles for each dataset, 42,407 (TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub>) and 14,332 (TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>) for the apo dataset and 23,944 (TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>) and 36,153 (TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub>) for the CBD-bound dataset. Each of these sets of particles was again subjected to CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing before a final refinement with C4 symmetry, followed by post-processing using a mask of the channel that excluded the nanodisc cloud yielding maps at 3.7 Å (TRPV2<sub>APO_1)</sub>, 4.0 Å (TRPV2<sub>APO_2</sub>), 3.4 Å (TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub>) and 3.2 Å (TRPV2<sub>CBD_2</sub>). Local resolution maps were generated using the RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheres, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012</xref>) implementation of local resolution estimation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model building</title><p>The previously determined full-length rat TRPV2 structure (PDB: 5HI9) was employed as the initial starting model and docked into the TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> map. This model was then manually adjusted in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refined using phenix.real_space_refine from the PHENIX software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>) with four-fold NCS constraints. The model was subjected to iterative rounds of manual model fitting followed by real-space refinement and sidechains with insufficient density were removed. The disconnected 16 residue loop attributed to Gln30-Asn45 between the ARDs and the β-sheet region in the TRPV2<sub>APO_1</sub> model was initially built as alanines, with residue identities determined based on distinctive density for Met35 and Phe39 along with kinking of the backbone that could be traced to a distinctive pattern of three proline residues at the N-terminus of the protein. Models fit into the other three maps started from the final <sub>APO_1</sub> model, followed by the same process of manual adjustment and refinement.

In all experiments after formation of gigaohm-resistance seals, the whole-cell configuration was established and currents were recorded using a ramp protocol from −100 mV to +100 mV over 500 ms preceded by a −100 mV step for 200 ms; the holding potential was −60 mV, and this protocol was applied once every 2 s. The currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 5 kHz, and digitized through the Digidata 1440A interface. In all experiments, cells that had a passive leak current more than 100 pA were discarded.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular mechanism of TRPV2 channel modulation by cannabidiol&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Pumroy et al., describes two new structures of the TRPV2 ion channel, both in detergent and in nanodiscs. It also provides evidence of a new binding site for canabidiol (CBD), a pharmacological activator of this channel. This is an important finding, since it can provide a foundation to understand the actions of CBD on TRPV2 and other TRPV channels and the potential therapeutic actions of this drug, as well as the molecular mechanisms of activation of TRPV2.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers agree that the findings presented in your manuscript are of potential relevance to the field, there are a number of problems that need to be addressed for the manuscript to be acceptable in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The three reviewers agree that the conclusions are not strongly supported by the data. The resolution of the refines structures is poor and thus, additional experimental information is needed to support the claims of a new binding site for CBD. Phrases like &quot;The CBD-bound TRPV2 structure in nanodiscs clearly revealed that CBD interacts…&quot; (Introduction) must be avoided through the manuscript.</p><p>2) Most of the conformational changes observed between the structures are small, and in fact smaller than the resolution of the structures. In order to provide a strong support for these proposed structural changes, the authors should include the density maps in their structural comparisons. These include the changes in the S1-S4 domains in Figure 1D; the changes in S4-S5 linker and TRP helix in Figure 2B and C; the reorientation of Y525 in Figure 2D,E; the presence of a π-helix in the S4-S5 linker shown in Figure 4, etc. I would not think that the presence of a π-helix can be formally argued at a resolution close to 4 Å. Again the authors should extensively curb their language when describing the small changes that are observed, unless they are unambiguously supported by the data and the experimental densities, and avoid phrases like &quot;CBD induced dramatic conformational changes to S1-S4, the TRP helix, and ARDs…&quot; (subsection “Detergent-solubilized TRPV2 in CBD-bound state”).</p><p>3) The static cryo-EM maps do not provide any information about the causality or timing of events, or whether some regions exert force to push or pull on other regions of the protein. These are all entirely hypothetical interpretations, and should be described as such, ideally together with additional experimental data in support of the proposed mechanism. The authors should extensively edit the text to reflect this.</p><p>4) The experimental evidence presented to argue that specific residues at the &quot;entrance of the binding site&quot; have been located is at best marginal. The residues probed are far removed from the proposed binding site and thus the results do not demonstrate that the binding site is located where the authors suggest. Finally, only using calcium imaging is a very poor experimental choice. The authors have identified a large number of residues proposed to interact with CBD at its binding site. Given that this is the central finding of the manuscript, as most conformational changes in the protein observed in the structures are very small, it is essential that the authors provide additional mutagenesis results to support it. This would ideally involve high-quality electrophysiological experiments for a systematic evaluation of the effects of various residue substitutions within the pocket, showing that the effect of CBD can be selectively affected relative to 2-APB, and that the effects of the mutations are as predicted from the properties of the binding site.</p><p>5) For the apo TRPV2 structure, the authors state &quot;Postprocessing yielded a 4.3Å resolution map as estimated by Rmeasure.&quot; This method of estimating resolution has not been recommended since 2012 and has been superseded by the &quot;gold-standard&quot; FSC 0.143 protocol as detailed by Henderson (2012) and Scheres (2012). Although it is not explicitly stated for the other structures, it is assumed this method for estimating resolution was also used. The authors should report the resolution of their structures using gold-standard FSC criterion, as recommended by the EM Validation Task Force.</p><p>6) In accordance with recommended guidelines for publishing EM structures as outlined by the EM Validation Task Force, the authors are encouraged to deposit their unfiltered half maps, unsharpened final map, and mask(s) used for refinement/resolution estimation to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB).</p><p>7) Each of the three maps discussed in this manuscript arise from different magnifications. Small errors in the pixel size calibrations for each of these magnifications can lead to an apparent &quot;change in magnification&quot; of the final 3D volume which can introduce small, consistent errors that can make comparisons across magnifications tenuous, especially when the extent of conformational changes, like those discussed in this manuscript, are small (i.e., &lt;2 Å). Additionally, errors in pixel size can also lead to elevated MolProbity clashscores, like those observed for the apo TRPV2 structure, or require non-optimal refinement weights leading to unusually low (or high) bond length RMSDs. The authors are encouraged to verify the pixel size for each magnification, as implemented in Rosetta or other programs.</p><p>8) None of the figures in this manuscript detail interactions with the hydroxyl groups of CBD but rather focus solely on the hydrophobic interactions that could stabilize the proposed binding pose of CBD. Importantly, in the CBD-nanodisc structure, the proposed CBD binding pose places the hydroxyl groups directed at the backbone atoms of Leu631 or the phenyl ring of Phe540, neither of which form favorable hydrogen bonding interactions. This raises the question of how stable was the binding pose during refinement? What are the observed clashes/non-favorable interactions within 5 Å of the modeled CBD? Additionally, it appears CBD binds in a mixed pose with different occupancies. How does CBD refine when flipped 180° about the benzyl ring plane?</p><p>9) In accordance with recommended guidelines for publishing EM structures as outlined by the EM Validation Task Force, a detailed processing workflow for each structure should be provided in the supplemental figures.</p><p>10) Recent publications detailing the activation mechanisms of TRPV family members have observed deviations from the canonical C4 symmetric state of TRPV family members to C2 symmetric states upon agonist binding or desensitization (Zubcevic et al., 2018 and 2019). Importantly, this was also observed for TRPV2 (Zubcevic et al., 2019) from a different organism (rabbit). The authors are encouraged to provide a detailed analysis of the symmetry observed in their structures to ensure the TRPV2 molecules in their data are, in fact, C4-symmetric. This is especially important given how few particles are maintained in the final reconstructions after 2D classification.</p><p>11) The authors describe the CBD-nanodisc structure as a potential intermediate, yet, this is the only CBD-bound structure where the ligand can be &quot;fully&quot; observed. This is particularly confusing given the amount of excess CBD added during complex preparation exceeded the concentration of CBD added to the CBD-detergent sample. Therefore, one would expect the CBD-detergent structure to represent a potential intermediate with low CBD occupancy. Please clarify.</p><p>12) The authors claim that their CBD-bound TRPV2 structure (in detergent) adopts a &quot;partially open&quot; conformation, yet, M645 and V649 lie along the pore in positions that render the lower gate impermeable, even to fully dehydrated cations. If anything, addition of CBD results in a rearrangement of V649, placing it closer to the central pore axis and further blocking ion permeation. Despite these observations, it is unclear why the authors speculate that this structure was in the &quot;partially open&quot; conformation.</p><p>13) The authors state that CBD-binding leads to opening of the selectivity filter, yet, the largest diameter of the filter is only ~2 Å in diameter, which is insufficient to even allow passage of dehydrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (diameter = 2.28 Å). Furthermore, it has been speculated for other TRPV family members that ions pass through the selectivity filter in a partially dehydrated form, which would require a pore radius of 1.5-3.5 Å.</p><p>14) The authors make a comparison between the Y575-M672 stabilizing interactions in their CBD-nanodisc structure to the recently-published TRPV3 structures. As the observation of the π-helix in S4-S5 is different between the two structures, i.e., present in the apo TRPV3 structure but missing in the apo TRPV2 structure, this &quot;stabilizing&quot; interaction is not 100% conserved. I encourage the authors to further develop this section of the manuscript to better clarify their message.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;Molecular mechanism of TRPV2 channel modulation by cannabidiol&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favourably valuated by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by the group of Moiseenkova-Bell presents the identification of a CBD binding site in TRPV2 channels. The location of this site is novel, as it is located between the S5 and S6 of different subunits. CBD is an important compound of high clinical interest and this manuscript makes an important contribution to our understanding of the modulation of TRPV channels by compounds of cannabinoid origin, in particular CBD. The new data is of high quality and the identification of CBD bound to TRPV2 is solidly presented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers feel that the current version of the manuscript is much improved and the authors have made a good effort to address the concerns expressed in the previous revision. However, the reviewers also think that the electrophysiological data is still lacking and does not strongly support the identification of the binding site. In particular, having a similar current magnitude in response to 2-APB between WT and mutant does not constitute evidence that the mutations do not affect sensitivity to 2-APB, because the current magnitude does not distinguish between changes in open probability or level of channel expression. This experiment should therefore be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>The effect of the double mutation on the CBD to 2-APB current ratio is negligible, despite it being statistically significant. This data can be included in the manuscript, but the conclusion that this mutation identifies the binding site for CBD should be toned down.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48792.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers agree that the findings presented in your manuscript are of potential relevance to the field, there are a number of problems that need to be addressed for the manuscript to be acceptable in eLife.</p><p>1) The three reviewers agree that the conclusions are not strongly supported by the data.

All cryo-EM data were collected using the same Krios microscope. Based on the analysis of the half maps for apo and 30μM CBD-bound structures in nanodiscs, we assigned CBD to the density that is positioned between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits. This density is absent in rat full-length TRPV2 apo structures in nanodiscs.</p><p>We originally hypothesized that mutating Leu541, Leu631 and Val635, the residues that are part of the proposed CBD binding pocket (see Figure 3), to bulky hydrophobic residues like phenylalanine might alter the entrance of CBD into the pocket. We now performed whole cell patch clamp recordings on wild type and mutant TRPV2 channels. We now show that the ratio of currents induced by 20 μM CBD and 100 μM 2-APB was significantly higher in cells transfected with the Leu541Phe-Leu631Phe mutant compared to wild type TRPV2, but the 100 μM 2-APB induced currents were of similar amplitude in both channels (see Figure 2—figure supplement 4). This data and our new cryo-EM results suggest that we assigned CBD density appropriately and it interacts with TRPV2 through the pocket located between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits.</p><p>Neither 20 μM CBD not 100 μM 2-APB induced any current in non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with the Val635Phe mutant, indicating that the latter mutant was non-functional (data not shown). The CBD binding site is located between S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits in TRPV2. Val635 located on the interface of these subunits and based on these results, we decided not to mutate more residues that are located on the interface of S5 and S6 helices of adjacent subunits in TRPV2, as we thought these mutants will likely affect tetramer formation and produce non-functional channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the apo TRPV2 structure, the authors state &quot;Postprocessing yielded a 4.3Å resolution map as estimated by Rmeasure.&quot; This method of estimating resolution has not been recommended since 2012 and has been superseded by the &quot;gold-standard&quot; FSC 0.143 protocol as detailed by Henderson (2012) and Scheres (2012).

Importantly, in the CBD-nanodisc structure, the proposed CBD binding pose places the hydroxyl groups directed at the backbone atoms of Leu631 or the phenyl ring of Phe540, neither of which form favorable hydrogen bonding interactions. This raises the question of how stable was the binding pose during refinement? What are the observed clashes/non-favorable interactions within 5 Å of the modeled CBD? Additionally, it appears CBD binds in a mixed pose with different occupancies. How does CBD refine when flipped 180° about the benzyl ring plane?</p></disp-quote><p>CBD was very stable in this position during PHENIX refinement. Examination of the hydroxyl groups using MolProbity and Coot did not show clashes between the CBD hydroxyl groups and TRPV2, and instead suggested hydrogen bonds could be made with the backbone of both S5 and S6, potentially by forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the helical backbone. Bifurcation of the hydrogen bonds of an α-helix backbone by interaction with thiol or hydroxyl groups of sidechains like cysteine or serine, particularly in the context of helices in hydrophobic environments, has been established for many years (Gray and Matthews, 1984; Feldblum and Arkin, 2014). It seems feasible that the hydroxyl groups of CBD could be interacting with the backbones of S5 (between the carbonyl of Leu537 and the amide of Leu541) and S6 (between the carbonyl of Leu631 and amide of Val635) in the same way, particularly given that the rest of the pocket is very hydrophobic. We included this explanation in the text.</p><p>As far as the orientation of the ligand, the density on the interior of the pocket is quite strong and has two lobes, which makes us think CBD could not be flipped end to end with the acyl tail in the density inside of the pocket. The larger hydrophobic ring end of the molecule could potentially be rotated in the pocket 180° degrees, but it clashed with the Leu537 sidechain in the TRPV2<sub>CBD_1</sub> structure, indicating the original pose as the optimal fit for this data (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In accordance with recommended guidelines for publishing EM structures as outlined by the EM Validation Task Force, a detailed processing workflow for each structure should be provided in the supplemental figures.</p></disp-quote><p>All cryo-EM data is now presented in accordance with recommendations from cryo-EM Validation Task Force.

Importantly, this was also observed for TRPV2 (Zubcevic et al., 2019) from a different organism (rabbit). The authors are encouraged to provide a detailed analysis of the symmetry observed in their structures to ensure the TRPV2 molecules in their data are, in fact, C4-symmetric. This is especially important given how few particles are maintained in the final reconstructions after 2D classification.</p></disp-quote><p>All four non-symmetrized C1 rat full-length TRPV2 maps in nanodiscs presented in this revised manuscript were evaluated by the Map Symmetry function in Phenix and C4 symmetry yielded the highest correlation coefficient for all presented maps.</p><p>All published cryo-EM maps for TRPV1-TRPV6 channels included between 2% to 20% of total particles in final reconstructions after 2D classification. Our cryo-EM data falls in the same range of total TRPV2 channel particles in the final maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors describe the CBD-nanodisc structure as a potential intermediate, yet, this is the only CBD-bound structure where the ligand can be &quot;fully&quot; observed. This is particularly confusing given the amount of excess CBD added during complex preparation exceeded the concentration of CBD added to the CBD-detergent sample. Therefore, one would expect the CBD-detergent structure to represent a potential intermediate with low CBD occupancy. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the poor resolution of our detergent structures, we removed them from this version of the manuscript. We now only report data for rat full length TRPV2 in nanodiscs that could be directly compared to each other and text in the manuscript has been revised to reflect these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors claim that their CBD-bound TRPV2 structure (in detergent) adopts a &quot;partially open&quot; conformation, yet, M645 and V649 lie along the pore in positions that render the lower gate impermeable, even to fully dehydrated cations. If anything, addition of CBD results in a rearrangement of V649, placing it closer to the central pore axis and further blocking ion permeation. Despite these observations, it is unclear why the authors speculate that this structure was in the &quot;partially open&quot; conformation.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the poor resolution of our detergent structure, we removed it from this version of the manuscript.

Furthermore, it has been speculated for other TRPV family members that ions pass through the selectivity filter in a partially dehydrated form, which would require a pore radius of 1.5-3.5 Å.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the poor resolution of our detergent structure, we removed it from this version of the manuscript.

As the observation of the π-helix in S4-S5 is different between the two structures, i.e., present in the apo TRPV3 structure but missing in the apo TRPV2 structure, this &quot;stabilizing&quot; interaction is not 100% conserved. I encourage the authors to further develop this section of the manuscript to better clarify their message.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the newly obtained TRPV2 channel structures in nanodiscs, we elected not to discuss this in this version of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers feel that the current version of the manuscript is much improved and the authors have made a good effort to address the concerns expressed in the previous revision. However, the reviewers also think that the electrophysiological data is still lacking and does not strongly support the identification of the binding site. In particular, having a similar current magnitude in response to 2-APB between WT and mutant does not constitute evidence that the mutations do not affect sensitivity to 2-APB, because the current magnitude does not distinguish between changes in open probability or level of channel expression. This experiment should therefore be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that similar amplitude responses to 2-APB do not differentiate between open probability and expression level. As requested, we removed this panel from the supplemental figure in the revised version and no longer reference it in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect of the double mutation on the CBD to 2-APB current ratio is negligible, despite it being statistically significant. This data can be included in the manuscript, but the conclusion that this mutation identifies the binding site for CBD should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We toned down the discussion on the interpretation of the mutant data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
