Accordingly, the myelin observed in neocortical gray matter is thought to mostly ensheath excitatory axons connecting to subcortical regions and distant cortical areas. Using independent analyses of light and electron microscopy data from mouse neocortex, we show that a surprisingly large fraction of cortical myelin (half the myelin in layer 2/3 and a quarter in layer 4) ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons, specifically of parvalbumin-positive basket cells. This myelin differs significantly from that of excitatory axons in distribution and protein composition. Myelin on inhibitory axons is unlikely to meaningfully hasten the arrival of spikes at their pre-synaptic terminals, due to the patchy distribution and short path-lengths observed. Our results thus highlight the need for exploring alternative roles for myelin in neocortical circuits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15784.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15784.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15784.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is far away from the muscles that it controls. In humans, for example, the brain must be able to trigger the contraction of muscles that are more than a meter away. This task falls to specialized motor neurons that stretch from the brain to the spinal cord, and from the spinal cord to the muscles.</p><p>Neurons transmit information (in the form of electrical nerve impulses) along their length through cable-like structures called axons. The axons of the motor neurons are so long that, if they were ‘naked’, it would take at least a second for nerve impulses to travel their entire length. Such a long delay between thoughts and actions would make rapid movement impossible.</p><p>Nerve impulses are able to travel from the brain to the muscles much more quickly, because they are wrapped with a substance called myelin that acts like electrical insulation. Myelin helps the nerve impulses travel up to 100 times faster down the axon. Not surprisingly, diseases that damage myelin, such as multiple sclerosis, severely disrupt movement and sensation.</p><p>Not all of the brain’s myelin is found around the long axons of motor neurons. The outer layer of the brain, known as the cerebral cortex, also contains myelin. However, most neurons within the cerebral cortex are only a few millimeters long. So what exactly is myelin doing there?</p><p>Micheva et al. have now used electron microscopy and light microscopy to study the neurons in the cortex of the mouse brain. This revealed that up to half of the myelin in some layers of the cortex surrounds the axons of inhibitory neurons (which reduce the activity of the neurons they signal to). Moreover, one particular subtype of inhibitory neuron accounts for most of the myelinated inhibitory axons, namely inhibitory neurons that contain a protein called parvalbumin.</p><p>Exactly why parvalbumin-containing neurons are myelinated remains a mystery. Myelin covers only short segments of the axons of these neurons, so it would speed up the transmission of signals by less than a millisecond – probably not enough to make a meaningful difference. Parvalbumin-containing neurons often signal frequently, and thus require large amounts of energy. One possibility therefore is that myelin helps to meet these energy requirements or to reduce energy consumption. Further research will be needed to test this and other ideas.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15784.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15784.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>array tomography</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>basket cells</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH099797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS75252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS092474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>Davi D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons in the cortex have insulating myelin sheathes, despite forming only short-range connections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelination is well known to be important in increasing the speed of action potential propagation in long-axon connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Waxman and Bennett, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Moore et al., 1978</xref>). The axons of the central nervous system (CNS) connecting distant brain areas are typically wrapped in myelin, as are the axons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that connect the CNS to all skeletal muscles and many sensory neurons. Pathologies of myelinated axons are associated with numerous neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fields, 2008</xref>) and are fundamental to several, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calabrese et al., 2015</xref>), neuromyelitis optica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wingerchuk et al., 2015</xref>), and leukodystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because myelin increases the conduction velocity of action potentials and reduces their metabolic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nave, 2010</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Harris and Attwell, 2012</xref>), it has traditionally been viewed as ‘wire insulation’ for long-range neural projections. Recent findings have cast myelination as a dynamic process playing an active role in normal neural circuit function and plasticity. For example, adult-born oligodendrocytes (the myelin-producing cells of the CNS) contribute new myelin to axons in an ongoing fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Young et al., 2013</xref>), increased neuronal activity results in more myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>), and myelin remodeling in the CNS is required for motor skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>). Myelin also supplies ensheathed axons with lactate via the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1, possibly playing an important energetic support role in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rinholm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morrison et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The emerging diversity of roles for myelin calls for a more complete understanding of its distribution among neuronal cell types and along individual axonal arbors, particularly in the gray matter of the CNS. Excitatory pyramidal neurons in cortex are known to be a main source of long-range myelinated axons connecting the two cortical hemispheres or targeting subcortical structures. Foundational EM-based studies of individual Golgi- or dye-filled neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kisvárday et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Martin and Whitteridge, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>) have revealed that the local axon collaterals of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons may also be myelinated. However, population surveys of the distribution of myelin on the axonal arbor of individual neocortical neurons have been difficult to undertake with traditional methods. Golgi labeling of neurons halts where the axon first enters a myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeFelipe et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fairén et al., 1977</xref>), and bulk labeling of myelin reveals a laminar patterned thicket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nieuwenhuys, 2013</xref>), rather than individual neuronal arbors.</p><p>Recent advances in large volume, high resolution neuroanatomy methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Economo et al., 2016</xref>) now permit cortical myelin to be directly visualized on the axonal arbors of multiple individual identified neurons for all axons within the imaged volume. Myelin tracing in large EM datasets has revealed that myelination of the axons of pyramidal neurons in cortex is distinct from the known myelination patterns in subcortical white matter, and also differs between cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>). About 10–20% of neocortical neurons are inhibitory and some of these neurons may also have myelinated axons. For example, labeling of individual neocortical neurons during in vivo electrophysiological recording, followed by light-level reconstruction and electron microscopy (EM) of selected sub-arbors, has revealed that inhibitory neurons may be myelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeFelipe et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kisvarday et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thomson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>). Complementary immunohistochemical studies have shown that parvalbumin-positive (i.e., putative inhibitory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>]) axons may be myelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">McGee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>). Given that cortical interneuron types are implicated in distinct circuit functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>) and have distinct behavioral correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>), these results raise several important questions regarding the organization of neocortical neuronal networks: how widespread is inhibitory axon myelination? Is it specific to certain interneuron subtypes? Does inhibitory axon myelin differ from excitatory axon myelin at the molecular level?</p><p>Here we combine analyses of light-microscopy-based array tomography (AT) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collman et al., 2015</xref>) with a publicly hosted EM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Martone et al., 2002</xref>) generated using a custom transmission EM camera array (TEMCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bock et al., 2011</xref>), to obtain an integrated view of the myelination of inhibitory neurons in cortex. We find that an unexpectedly large proportion of myelinated axons in cortex arise from a specific subtype of inhibitory neuron: the parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cell. These PV+ axons are especially prominent in the middle cortical layers. They constitute about half of all myelinated axons in layers 2/3, and a quarter of myelinated axons in layer 4. We also find that the inhibitory myelinated axons in cortical gray matter differ from the excitatory myelinated axons in many respects, such as their structural organization, cytoskeletal content, and myelin protein composition. Taken together, the abundance and cell-type selectivity of neocortical myelinated inhibitory axons described here raise fundamental questions about the role of myelination both in normal function and in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We applied two microscopic approaches to determine the neurotransmitter content of cortical myelinated axons. Array tomography (AT) is based on digital reconstruction of images acquired from arrays of serial ultrathin sections (70 nm) attached to coverslips and imaged with different modalities, such as immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The use of ultrathin sections allows the unambiguous light level identification of individual myelinated axons even in regions with high myelin density (e.g., subcortical white matter), while the possibility of applying multiple immunofluorescent markers (10 or more) enables the molecular characterization of these axons. Conjugate SEM further reveals the underlying ultrastructure. TEMCA-based volume electron microscopy uses an array of high-speed cameras to efficiently image large numbers of serial ultrathin (40–50 nm) sections. The resulting image volumes are of sufficient size and resolution that the densely packed and intertwined axons and dendrites of the brain neuropil can be traced over relatively long distances, and the synaptic connections between them can be discerned. With this form of EM, all membranes and synapses are labeled, enabling neuronal structure and connectivity to be sampled in an unbiased fashion. Additional evidence was also obtained using immunohistochemical labeling of brain slices from transgenic mice expressing fluorophores in salient inhibitory interneuron subtypes. The EM and AT studies were initiated and conducted independently in two different laboratories and data were pooled once the complementary nature of the findings were ascertained (Materials and methods).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Array tomography shows that a large fraction of myelinated axons in upper layers of cortex contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA</title><p>Immunofluorescence AT is particularly well suited for the study of myelinated axons in cortex. The abundance of myelin proteins, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), and the size of myelinated axons (&gt;200 nm in diameter) make them an ideal target for immunofluorescence detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The ultrathin AT sections provide easy access of the antibodies against MBP and do not require lipid extraction. Conjugate light-electron AT confirms that immunofluorescence for MBP precisely outlines the myelinated sheaths of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Overall, the MBP immunolabel is of high quality as evidenced by the consistency of the signal from section to section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and the low background (mean gray value of 248 ± 6 a.u. on resin and 279 ± 2 a.u. on nuclei, vs 5754 ± 226 a.u. on myelin, mean and standard error). In addition, the use of ultrathin sections ensures that antigens can be detected equally well within myelinated and unmyelinated portions of the axon. For example, in our AT experiments GABA and PV immunostaining within axons is not affected by myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, 3), in contrast to preembedding immunocytochemistry where myelinated portions of axons are much more weakly stained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pawelzik et al., 2002</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15784.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A large fraction of myelinated axons in upper layers of cortex contain GABA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An ultrathin section (70 nm) through the mouse somatosensory cortex immunolabeled for MBP (cyan) and GABA (red).

This dataset was of sufficient size and resolution that both myelinated and unmyelinated axons could be traced over hundreds of microns, allowing them to be categorized on the basis of their synaptic ultrastructure as inhibitory or excitatory. A section from near the middle of the EM volume was selected, and all the myelin profiles from the center portion of this section were annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Each of these myelinated 'seeds' (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>) was used as a starting point for further tracing of the myelinated axon through the EM volume. Along their length, a majority of the traced axons unmyelinated and made a number of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>).

About half of them contain parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffering protein. Array tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that nearly all GABA myelinated axons (97.9 ± 0.8%, mean ± st.error from 3 animals) are immunopositive for parvalbumin and therefore originate from PV interneurons. Correspondingly, in the examined cortical AT volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>), examples of PV and GABA-positive cell bodies forming myelinated axons are seen in layers 2/3, 4 and 5. Blind to the AT results, we conducted independent experiments in three mice expressing the fluorescent protein tdTomato driven by Cre expression in PV neurons (<italic>Pvalb-ires-Cre;Ai9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Confocal imaging of 40 μm thick Vibratome slices from these mice immunostained with MBP corroborated the AT findings by showing that about half (53 ± 12%) of the myelinated axons in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex contain tdTomato and, therefore, PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Similar experiments were also performed on mice expressing tdTomato from SOM-Cre or VIP-Cre driver lines (<italic>Sst-ires-Cre;Ai9</italic>, and <italic>Vip-ires-Cre;Ai9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). After careful inspection of selected subareas, no myelinated axons containing reporter for the non-PV cortical interneurons vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>) could be observed. A small fraction (4.4%) of somatostatin (SOM)-positive myelinated axons were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>); however, the transgenic reporter line used was recently found to have a small but consistent false-positive expression pattern, wherein up to 10% of Cre-expressing neurons are SOM-negative and PV-positive when examined by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). At least some of the SOM-positive myelinated axon profiles we observe therefore may be false positives which actually express PV, not SOM; and some may be true positives, consistent with the AT data, which show that ~2% of GABA myelinated profiles are PV negative. Regardless, the data obtained from the three Cre-lines support the conclusion that the great preponderance of myelinated inhibitory axon profiles in layer 2/3 arise from parvalbumin-positive axons.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15784.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nearly all myelinated GABA axons are parvalbumin-positive.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A single section (70 nm) from layer 2/3 of mouse cortex, immunolabeled for MBP (white), GABA (red) and PV (green); nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue).

Basket cells and chandelier cells can readily be distinguished by their morphology and synaptic targets. When the axons from multiple basket cells are labeled and examined at the light level, they form ‘baskets’ of synapses around neuronal somata, hence the name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kisvárday, 1992</xref>). Chandelier cells have an axonal arbor which resembles a chandelier, with vertically oriented axonal cartridges that almost exclusively form synapses onto the axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>). Less than 2% of the inhibitory myelinated axons in our volume electron microscopy dataset were found to make contacts on axon initial segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the few axonal arbors that were seen contacting axon initial segments did not have the characteristic appearance of chandelier cell axons and made single contacts with axonal initial segments, instead of several (typically 3–5 for chandelier cells) synapses in a row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Therefore we can exclude the possibility that the myelinated inhibitory axons arise from chandelier cells. The great preponderance (93%) of postsynaptic targets of myelinated inhibitory axons in layer 2/3 of cortex were excitatory, likewise eliminating the possibility that these axons originated from the arbors of the known parvalbumin-positive long-range inhibitory afferents to cortex, all of which selectively target inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Freund and Gulyás, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gritti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The remaining possibility, that myelinated inhibitory axons arise from the arbors of local parvalbumin-positive basket cells, was well supported by the distribution of their postsynaptic targets. Although neocortical basket cells are best known for their synapses with cell bodies, a large (but variable) fraction of their synapses are with dendritic shafts and spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kisvarday et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>). Consistent with past surveys of basket cell synaptic targets, we found that 13% of the postsynaptic targets of the myelinated inhibitory axons were with somata, 49% were onto excitatory dendritic shafts, and 30% were onto dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the majority of myelinated inhibitory axons belong to the intracortical axons of parvalbumin containing basket cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibitory neurons exhibit a distinct pattern of myelination</title><p>Both our volume electron microscopy and array tomography data show that the axon of a parvalbumin interneuron becomes myelinated soon after exiting the cell body (usually within 20–50 μm), consistent with myelination commencing shortly after the axon initial segment. All of the axonal arbors that were traced back to the cell body in our volume EM dataset (n=8) had the same general appearance: a central core of partially myelinated axons (whose unmyelinated stretches rarely made synapses), from which emerged unmyelinated branches forming numerous synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,C</xref>).

Nodes of Ranvier were excluded and only non-myelinated stretches longer than 4 μm were considered. This analysis revealed several interesting differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). First, the cytoskeletal composition of axons is indeed related to the presence of GABA. Both the myelinated and the unmyelinated regions of the GABA axons have higher neurofilament content and lower microtubule content compared to non-GABA axons. There are also significant differences in cytoskeletal content between the different regions of GABA axons, where myelinated portions have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content compared to the unmyelinated portions of the same axons. While excitatory axons show similar trends of differences in cytoskeletal composition depending on myelination, the differences are more pronounced for GABA axons, especially regarding neurofilament content.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present work is the first to survey the targets of myelin in neocortex using recently developed high resolution, large-volume imaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggman and Bock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kleinfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Economo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>). These methods reveal that a surprisingly large fraction of myelin in cortical gray matter ensheathes the axons of a single inhibitory neuron subtype, the parvalbumin-positive basket cell. Based on cellular morphology and postsynaptic targets, other PV-expressing neuron types were essentially ruled out, and we found minimal evidence for the myelination of non-PV inhibitory axons. Although this cell-type-specificity of axon myelination was unexpected, especially since myelin has generally been thought to ensheath long-range axons of excitatory neurons, it is nevertheless consistent with earlier observations of individual myelinated inhibitory axons, including basket cell axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeFelipe et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Keller and White, 1987</xref>).</p><p>The more comprehensive survey presented in the present work was achieved through analysis of data arising from two different imaging modalities: array tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collman et al., 2015</xref>) and large-scale serial-section electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bock et al., 2011</xref>). Work based on each method was initiated independently and in parallel, and initial annotation and analysis was performed blind to preliminary results arising from the other method. The results from AT and volume EM were complementary. The AT data spanned all cortical laminae and revealed that many myelinated axons in mouse somatosensory cortex (almost half of layer 2/3, and a quarter of layer 4 myelinated axons) contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Practically all of these GABA axons also contain PV. AT-based comparison of GABA and nonGABA myelinated axons revealed several important differences. The nodes of Ranvier and the internodes are significantly shorter on GABA axons. In addition, AT multiplex imaging detected molecular differences, such as an enrichment of MBP in the myelin of GABA axons, as well as a high neurofilament and low microtubule content of their cytoskeleton.</p><p>The volume EM data provided independent evidence that half of the categorized myelinated axons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex are inhibitory, as indicated by the symmetric pre- and postsynaptic densities of the synapses that they formed after exiting the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colonnier, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Peters et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gray, 1959</xref>). Immunolabeling of myelin in a PV-Cre reporter line showed that about half of the myelin in layer 2/3 ensheathes PV+ axons, and similar experiments in VIP- and SOM-Cre lines (which comprise almost all non-PV interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Xu et al., 2010</xref>]) failed to show any myelinated axons arising from VIP+ neurons and very few (if any) from SOM+ neurons. Ultrastructural analysis also allowed us to deduce which of the two PV-expressing subtypes in neocortex was myelinated, by revealing that the myelinated axons’ postsynaptic targets were largely non-axonal, instead targeting the dendrites and somata of pyramidal cells. This finding ruled out PV-positive chandelier cells (which synapse onto axons), and strongly suggested that the other predominant PV subtype, basket cells, is the myelinated subtype. PV basket cells comprise about half of all neocortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Markram et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, the quantitative and qualitative consistency between the AT, volume EM, and immunohistochemistry datasets provides strong evidence that PV+ basket cell axons are the predominant myelinated inhibitory axons in neocortex.</p><p>Our axon reconstructions showed that the distribution of myelin on basket cell axons is patchy and seemingly localized to the axon arbor near the cell body (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–C</xref>). This patchiness qualitatively resembles the distribution of myelin on the descending axons of excitatory pyramidal cells measured in the same EM data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>), and is consistent with an observation of patchy myelination of an inhibitory neuron axon in an earlier study in mouse somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Keller and White, 1987</xref>). The concentration of myelin on the proximal arbor is also consistent with more complete reconstructions of individual filled cells in cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>) and macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeFelipe et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>There are several caveats and limitations to this study. First, our experiments allow for the possibility that a small fraction of somatostatin or other non-PV axons are myelinated. We found by AT that ~2% of myelinated GABA axons are PV-negative, and examination of the transgenic mouse line SOM-Cre;Ai9-TdTom revealed a small percentage of TdTomato-positive myelinated axons. However, the lack of PV immunostaining in some myelinated axons may reflect limitations of immunodetection rather than proving that these axons are PV-negative. Furthermore, the SOM-Cre-line used in this study was found to have a small but consistent false-positive expression pattern, where Cre is expressed in neurons that immunohistochemically are somatostatin-negative but PV-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Although additional studies of somatostatin-positive interneurons, as well as other inhibitory interneuron subtypes, will be needed to resolve this issue, we believe it does not materially affect our finding that the great preponderance of myelinated inhibitory axon profiles in layer 2/3 arise from parvalbumin positive basket cells.</p><p>A second limitation stems from the incomplete characterization of the distribution of myelin on the full arbors of inhibitory neuron axons. Myelinated axon profiles were traced until they exited the myelin sheath and formed a sufficient number of synapses to categorize the axon as excitatory or inhibitory, at which point tracing was halted (except in two cases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, where the entire arbor within the 450 × 350 × 50 μm EM volume was traced). The result was a set of axon fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) that cannot be positively identified according to morphological type. Their identification as arising from basket cells is based on a combination of immunolabeling results (that myelinated inhibitory axons are nearly always PV+) with the identification of the fragments’ post-synaptic targets as being almost entirely non-axonal (so the axons do not arise from chandelier cells, the other PV+ cell type besides basket cells). Ideally, direct confirmation of this deduction would also be obtained from complete volume EM axonal arbor reconstructions and subsequent confirmation of morphological type. However, the additional tracing effort to achieve this would be substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Helmstaedter, 2013</xref>), and, perhaps more importantly, such an investment might better be made in a larger cortical EM volume (e.g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lee et al., 2016</xref>]), so that a greater fraction of each neuron’s axonal arbor could be reconstructed. Such an approach would also permit assessment of whether all PV-containing basket cells have myelinated axons. Considering the functional and morphological heterogeneity of PV basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li and Huntsman, 2014</xref>), it is possible that some subtypes preferentially form myelinated axons.</p><p>Consistent with the possibility that not all basket cells (or basket cell subtypes) are myelinated, the fraction of somatic post-synaptic targets made by the inhibitory myelinated axons described here is at the low end of the previously reported range for cortical basket cells. The majority of myelinated inhibitory axons in our study contact dendritic shafts (53%) and spines (32%), and only 13% of the targets are cell bodies. These proportions are similar to those found in a study in rat frontal cortex of four individually filled fast-spiking basket cells, which made on average 53% of synapses onto dendritic shafts, 29% onto spines, and 18% onto cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</xref>). However, the four cells showed wide variability in the proportion of their somatic targets, which ranged between 4% and 35%. Studies in cat neocortex also reveal a wide variability between individual basket cells (between 20% and 69% of synapses targeting somata) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kisvarday et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tamás et al., 1997</xref>). These findings in neocortex contrast with measurements in hippocampus, where more than 50% of the synaptic targets of PV basket cells are cell bodies, and dendritic spines are only occasionally targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Seress and Ribak, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gulyás et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Halasy et al., 1996</xref>). The fraction of inhibitory post-synaptic targets made by the axons in this study (4.5%) is similar to, but somewhat lower than that previously observed in rat (8%) and cat (9%) neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</xref>). This variability is consistent with a recent study in mouse visual cortex which found wide variation between individual animals in the fraction of synapses made onto inhibitory interneurons by layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, the anatomical literature briefly described above shows that the post-synaptic targets of a given cell type can vary widely between species, brain regions, animals, and individual neurons. Determining whether discrete basket cell subtypes underlay any of this variability will require further study.</p><p>Our findings raise the question: what is the role of myelin on inhibitory interneurons in neocortex? The patchy distribution of myelin along GABA axons and the lack of correlation between myelin thickness and axon diameter imply that increased conduction velocity may not be the main consequence of this myelination. Rather, the presence of myelin may be due to the unique cellular properties and circuit functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hu et al., 2014</xref>) of PV basket cells. Nearly all cortical PV basket cells are fast-spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>), and fast-spiking neurons have very high tonic activity compared to other cell types in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gentet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hofer et al., 2011</xref>) — they generate long trains of action potentials with very high frequency (&gt;100 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>). Fast-spiking cells exhibit a number of biophysical specializations that enable high firing rates but incur an increased energy cost per action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hu and Jonas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carter and Bean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hasenstaub et al., 2010</xref>). Axonal myelination could help with these high energy demands in two ways: first, myelin is known to improve the energy efficiency of action potential propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>). Secondly, myelin can provide metabolic support to the axon by supplying lactate as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rinholm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morrison et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, myelin could reduce the basket cells’ metabolic needs and provide an additional external energy supply from oligodendrocytes.</p><p>At the circuit level, PV basket cells participate in regulating excitatory/inhibitory balance, in neuronal synchronization and cortical rhythm generation, and in plasticity associated with experience and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). Could basket-cell myelin hasten the delivery of synaptic input to their postsynaptic targets to an extent that would be functionally relevant? No estimates of conduction velocities of cortical myelinated PV axons exist in the literature; however, in young (~P30) mice, PV axon conduction velocities of ~0.5 m/s have been recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Casale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The majority of PV axons at this age are most likely unmyelinated, since cortical myelination is not complete until much later (after P60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Mengler et al., 2014</xref>). Using this conduction velocity estimate, an unmyelinated PV axon would conduct a spike in 0.4 ms to synapses located 200 μm away, which was the typical path length from cell body to proximal synapses in our EM-based reconstructions. Thus, any reduction in the spike arrival time to proximal synapses due to myelination will inevitably be in the sub-millisecond range, likely too small a difference to affect post-synaptic dendritic integration or spike-timing-dependent plasticity, given the much slower timescales of those functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dan and Poo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). However, spike time arrival differences on a sub-millisecond timescale might affect the magnitude of coordinated oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pajevic et al., 2014</xref>), which are a known circuit role of basket cells.</p><p>The present study also bears on the genesis and dynamics of myelination. Cortical myelin is dynamically remodeled during learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles and Richardson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>) and it redistributes during normal aging, where internode length decreases with age in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Peters, 2009</xref>). It is possible that these dynamics may differ between the myelin wrapping inhibitory and excitatory axons. This could be due to differences arising from local interactions between oligodendrocytic processes and individual axons, or from a possible allocation of distinct oligodendrocytes (or oligodendrocyte subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tomassy et al., 2016</xref>]) to axons of inhibitory or excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Hoz and Simons, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Further studies will also be needed to address the interesting question of myelin diversity at the molecular level. Between the two major proteins of myelin, our experiments reveal that inhibitory axons have higher MBP content than excitatory axons, while the proteolipid protein (PLP) content appears similar. Because MBP is one of the potential target antigens in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garg and Smith, 2015</xref>), this finding has important implications for pathologies of myelin. It is likely that other differences in the protein or lipid content of myelin exist, considering the accumulating evidence for CNS oligodendrocyte heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tomassy et al., 2016</xref>). Characterizing these differences as a function of neuronal type will be an important aspect of future studies.</p><p>The abundance of myelinated inhibitory axons in cortical gray matter also raises the possibility of their involvement in myelin perturbations in normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Peters, 2009</xref>) and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fields, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calabrese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wingerchuk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lucchinetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). For example, gray matter myelin degeneration is observed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartzokis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de la Monte, 1989</xref>), and, in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the presence of cortical lesions is strongly correlated with seizure occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calabrese et al., 2008</xref>). Several other diseases predicated on CNS demyelination, including neuromyelitis optica, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy may also display seizure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jarius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hynson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lima et al., 2006</xref>). Demyelination of PV interneurons may perturb the balance of large-network neuronal excitation and inhibition, biasing neocortical microcircuits toward seizure.</p><p>By combining data from two independent efforts, we show here that a large fraction of cortical myelin is allocated to the axons of inhibitory neurons, specifically to PV basket cells. This work alters our understanding of the distribution of myelin in neocortical gray matter, and opens new avenues in basic neurobiology, systems neuroscience, and neurological disease research. Finally, this study leverages an openly available EM data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Martone et al., 2002</xref>) that has been used in several other studies of neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>) since its publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bock et al., 2011</xref>), illustrating the value of image data sharing in biomedical research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Array tomography</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lowicryl freeze-substitution tissue preparation</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to NIH and University of North Carolina guidelines.

To sample a subset of myelinated axons in the volume systematically, a section near the center of the image volume was selected, and all myelinated axon profiles were annotated in TrakEM2 with ‘seed’ points for further tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Myelinated profiles near the edge of the imaged area were not seeded, to reduce the probability of the axon exiting the volume without making synapses. To categorize each myelinated axon as arising from an inhibitory or excitatory neuron, each seed was manually traced into the EM volume until the axon lost its myelin sheath and formed at least two synapses. The synapses were categorized as inhibitory or excitatory depending on whether the pre- and postsynaptic densities were symmetric (equal in thickness) or asymmetric (with a thicker postsynaptic density), respectively. Occasionally, individual synapses could not be definitively characterized as symmetric or asymmetric. This occurred most often when the section plane was oblique or parallel to the plane of the synapse. In these cases, tracing was continued until sufficient additional synapses were reached to make a definitive determination of axon type.

In all cases where a traced axon reached a cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), the categorization of the axon as excitatory or inhibitory based on synaptic ultrastructure was found to agree with somatic structure and synaptic interactions: excitatory axons were only found to arise from pyramidal neurons receiving only inhibitory synapses on the cell body, and inhibitory axons were only found to arise from non-pyramidal neurons with both inhibitory and excitatory synapses on the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Peters et al., 1991</xref>). Axons that could not be classified generally failed to unmyelinate within the bounds of the EM-imaged volume and had an orientation normal to the EM section plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). On this axis, the EM image volume is only ~50 μm thick, reducing the probability that these axons could be traced to an unmyelinated, synapse-forming portion of the axonal arbor.</p><p>The postsynaptic target at each annotated synapse was also classified as excitatory or inhibitory using ultrastructural criteria. The dendritic shafts of inhibitory neurons have much lower spine densities and receive many more asymmetric synapses than those of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">McGuire et al., 1991</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), allowing for unambiguous categorization. When the postsynaptic target was a dendritic shaft, categorization was therefore straightforward. When the target was a spine, the spine was traced through its neck to the shaft, and categorization was then based on shaft ultrastructure. In rare cases, the spine could not be traced to the shaft and in this case no attempt was made to categorize the postsynaptic target as excitatory or inhibitory (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, 'Uncategorized dendritic spines'). Postsynaptic axons were identified based on a combination of the following criteria: bundled microtubules and the presence of a characteristic dense layer beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Peters et al., 1991</xref>); their presynaptic relationships to other neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>); and their eventual entrance into myelin sheaths. Postsynaptic targets were identified after pooling of data between the two laboratories had begun.</p><p>Two myelin seeds were arbitrarily selected for complete tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Rather than halting tracing of these axons once they could be unambiguously categorized as inhibitory or excitatory, their arbors were traced to completion within the limits of the EM-imaged volume. In one case, the inhibitory cell body was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). All synapses were annotated and their postsynaptic targets were categorized as with the partially traced axons. The distribution of postsynaptic targets was nearly identical between the completely and partially traced axons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry of transgenic mice</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to HHMI-JFRC animal care and use protocols.

Three-color imaging was performed by sequential acquisitions with 405 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm lasers and pinhole parameters set to 1 Airy unit for any given laser. Detection was tuned to each fluorophore’s specific emission frequency using a 32-channel detector without the use of filters. Laser powers were scaled with increasing acquisition depth by spline interpolation to maintain constant fluorophore visibility. Images were acquired through a large region of S1 from layer 1 through layer 6 in sequential overlapping tile mosaics using the Multitime32 macro (Zeiss) and subsequently stitched using the Grid/Collection stitching plugin for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Quantification of fluorescence labeled myelin and transgene reporter axons</title><p>Three image stacks, each from a separate animal, were collected for the <italic>PV-ires-Cre;Ai9</italic> mouse line, while three image stacks were acquired from a single mouse from each of the <italic>SOM-ires-Cre;Ai9</italic> and <italic>VIP-ires-Cre;Ai9 lines</italic>. In the PV and VIP image stacks, an 85 × 85 μm ROI in layer 2/3 of S1 was selected for annotation and quantification. In the SOM image stack, a 200 × 200 μm ROI in layer 2/3 of S1 was quantified, to better quantify the frequency of rarely myelinated SOM-Cre+ axonal profiles. The z-plane with the most robust myelin labeling, typically within 15 μm of the surface of the vibratome slice, was selected for annotation of myelinated axons and <italic>Ai9</italic> reporter labeled neurites. Annotation was performed using the TrakEM2 plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>) for Fiji and consisted of manual treeline skeletonization of fluorescent neurites over multiple z-planes adjacent to the target ROI plane. The total number of myelinated axons colabeled for PV (as represented by Ai9-fluorophore expression) was quantified. Colocalization of myelin and the reporter fluorophore along a visible neurite spanning multiple z-planes was considered as a myelinated reporter-labeled axon. The fraction of myelinated reporter labeled axons was tallied for each ROI, and pooled within each reporter line. VIP fractions were not annotated and quantified since by careful visual inspection, no reporter-labeled neurites were found to colocalize with myelin signal. For preparation of figures, Adobe Photoshop was used to smooth and adjust gamma of raw confocal data, and to false-color myelinated profiles that were positive for either PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>) or SOM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>).

This correlation is influenced by antibody characteristics, but also the size of targets, with smaller targets displaying larger spatial variability from section to section. This could explain the lower R for NF-H which labels axons, as some axons can be very thin (&lt;100 nm). The comparison with an antibody against an <italic>overlapping antigen</italic> is a test for the specificity of staining. The following comparisons were done: MBP/PLP, GABA/GAD2, PV/GABA, NFHch/NFHr, αTub/ac αTub. The lower coefficients for GABA/GAD2 and PV/GABA reflect the fact that GAD2 and PV are present in only a subset of GABA containing structures. Another test for specificity is the comparison with an antibody against a spatially <italic>exclusive antigen</italic>. Values of R around 0 are expected in this case. MBP and PLP (present in the myelin sheath) were each compared with GABA (inside inhibitory neurons); GABA and PV (inhibitory neurons) were compared with VGluT1 (excitatory neurons); NFH, αTub and ac αTub (all predominantly neuronal) with glutamine synthetase (glial).

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A large fraction of neocortical myelin ensheathes axons of local inhibitory neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Inna Slutsky, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers judged that this is an interesting manuscript examining myelination of interneurons in cortical grey matter using two complementary microscopy approaches. The authors show that a significant proportion of cortical myelin ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons and that the vast majority of myelinated inhibitory axons belong to a specific interneuron subtype, the PV-positive basket cell. While early publications in cats and macaques demonstrated myelinated axons in basket cells, this study generalizes these findings to mice and provides additional quantification of postsynaptic partners, myelin distribution and composition in PV-expressing neurons. The study will be of great interest to readers in multiple disciplines and provides information relevant for future physiological studies of activity-dependent myelination and de-/re-myelination of grey matter in various neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The comparison of the myelinated axons in the GABAergic vs non-GABAergic axons and myelinated vs non-myelinated parts of PV-(+) cell axons is incomplete. More careful analysis of the data is required for improving the description of myelin protein composition, thickness and cytoskeletal composition of the myelinated inhibitory axons.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref> suggest that the inhibitory myelinated axons are larger in diameter than the excitatory myelinated axons, but they do not test or quantify this directly.</p><p>The relationship between the relative MBP levels and the properties of axons/myelin sheaths is unclear. There may be methodological concerns, because MBP is notoriously difficult to visualize and requires extraction of lipids for antibodies to get access. Since there is no calibration of the fluorescent intensity, quite what to make of the reported 30% greater intensity on the PV-(+) axons is unclear and the significance of this difference is greatly amplified in the Discussion.</p><p>Analysis of the starting and end points of myelination in the inhibitory axons should be provided. Does it follow axonal initial segment as in the excitatory axons and at which branches myelination disappears?</p><p>It would be important to understand the differences between myelinated and unmyelinated parts of PV-(+) axons in more details. For example, comparative literature analysis of several parameters such as number/release properties of PV's inhibitory terminals, mitochondrial content etc. between layer 2/3 and layer 5 would be helpful.</p><p>How similar is the morphology of oligodendrocytes between inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> does not provide a comparison of cytoskeletal composition between the myelinated and non-myelinated inhibitory axon segments on the same neurons, or between myelinated and unmyelinated inhibitory axons in general. The reported cytoskeletal differences may therefore be related to the inhibitory vs excitatory distinction rather than inhibitory myelinated vs. excitatory myelinated (i.e. inhibitory and excitatory axons may already have that difference regardless of their myelination).</p><p>2) The reviewers don't understand a discrepancy between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. For example, the equal density of GABA and non-GABA myelinated axons in layer 2/3 are shown in D, while 50% of myelinated axons in this layer are GABAergic, as seen in C. But in L4 and L5 the density shown in D does not look that different from L2/3, but in C it does. Do we miss something?</p><p>3) Some reviewers feel that the Introduction over-dramatizes the historic difficulties of studying myelin on identified cells. We encourage you to acknowledge the findings by DeFelipe, Hendry and Jones (1986) who used the Golgi stain in their study of large basket cells in the sensory-motor cortex of monkey and showed that the axon became myelinated where it lost its Golgi-staining. Similarly, other combined light and electron microscopic methods have been available for at least 30 years to analyze the individual myelinated axonal arbors.</p><p>4) The Discussion is over-long and over-speculative. The basic result showing that PV-(+) basket cells have myelinated axons is consistent with observations in other species. Too much speculation is devoted to what this might mean. Particularly speculative is the section on the clinical significance of the findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15784.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The comparison of the myelinated axons in the GABAergic vs non-GABAergic axons and myelinated vs non-myelinated parts of PV-(+) cell axons is incomplete.

To make this point clearer, we have added a panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (panel A, showing the frequency distribution of axon thickness for GABA and non-GABA axons).</p><p><italic>The relationship between the relative MBP levels and the properties of axons/myelin sheaths is unclear. There may be methodological concerns, because MBP is notoriously difficult to visualize and requires extraction of lipids for antibodies to get access. Since there is no calibration of the fluorescent intensity, quite what to make of the reported 30% greater intensity on the PV-(+) axons is unclear and the significance of this difference is greatly amplified in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the 30% greater intensity of MBP immunofluorescence in GABA-positive axons compared to their neighboring GABA-negative axons is uncalibrated. We have accordingly de-emphasized the importance of the quantitative difference in Results (subsection “GABA and non-GABA myelin differ in protein composition, but not thickness”, last paragraph), instead making it clear that the difference is qualitative. We have also shortened the corresponding discussion on the topic, for example, by deleting the speculation that “Our observation that inhibitory myelin has a higher content of MBP, a potential target antigen in MS<sup>92-94</sup>, suggests that inhibitory axons within the RRMS lesions might be more susceptible to demyelination than excitatory axons.”</p><p>We would like, however, to point out that the quality of MBP immunostaining with array tomography (AT) is exceptionally good, as evidenced, for example, by the correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9) of MBP immunofluorescence and ultrastructurally identified myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ultrathin 70 nm sections used in AT likely provide superior access to the MBP antigen in the myelin; additionally, the freeze-substitution approach to tissue preparation aids in the preservation of the antigen<sup>1,2</sup>. To further illustrate the high quality of the MBP immunofluorescence in AT, we have now added a panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, showing a higher magnification view of MBP immunofluorescence, and a supplemental image stack of raw images of serial sections through mouse cortex immunostained for MBP (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). We have also added text in the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of the Results. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, MBP immunofluorescence around individual axons is present as a clear and uniform outline, which is consistent from section to section. We have quantified the consistency of MBP immunolabel by comparing the MBP signal from individual myelin sheaths on adjacent sections (added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, panel B).</p><p><italic>Analysis of the starting and end points of myelination in the inhibitory axons should be provided. Does it follow axonal initial segment as in the excitatory axons and at which branches myelination disappears?</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, our anatomical data do not provide a good sample of the distribution of myelin on the complete axonal arbors of inhibitory neurons, as noted in the ‘caveats and limitations’ section of the Discussion (fifth and sixth paragraphs), and we therefore cannot systematically address this important question in the current study. However, in the cases where a myelinated inhibitory axon was traced back to a cell body in the AT and EM data sets, we noted that the axon “becomes myelinated soon after exiting the cell body (usually within 20-50 μm)” (subsection “Inhibitory neurons exhibit a distinct pattern of myelination”), consistent with myelination commencing shortly after the axon initial segment. We have edited the text at this point to highlight this relationship. Regarding the broader distribution of myelin, we note a qualitative impression, that “All of the axonal arbors that were traced back to the cell body in our volume EM dataset (n=8) had the same general appearance: a central core of partially myelinated axons whose unmyelinated stretches rarely made synapses, from which emerged unmyelinated branches forming numerous synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A, 5C</xref>). This is similar to the pattern reported for filled basket cells in both macaque somatosensory cortex (DeFelipe, Hendry and Jones, 1986) and cat visual cortex (Somogyi et al., 1983).”</p><p><italic>It would be important to understand the differences between myelinated and unmyelinated parts of PV-(+) axons in more details. For example, comparative literature analysis of several parameters such as number/release properties of PV's inhibitory terminals, mitochondrial content etc. between layer 2/3 and layer 5 would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We could not find published data comparing myelinated and unmyelinated regions of PV+ axons. We agree that the difference between the myelinated and unmyelinated parts of PV+ axons is an important question, which we did not address in our original submission. We therefore performed additional analysis on this topic and added panel (D) to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. This addition is discussed further below.</p><p><italic>How similar is the morphology of oligodendrocytes between inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons?</italic> </p><p>This very interesting question is related to the larger and still unsettled issue of whether individual oligodendrocytes or possible oligodendrocyte subtypes discriminate between different axons (for example discussed in de Hoz and Simons, 2015). Although array tomography could be used to address this topic in future studies, for example by adding an oligodendrocyte marker to visualize these cells alongside markers for myelin (MBP) and axonal type (GABA, PV), it is in our opinion a significantly different research focus from the one described in this article. However, we have added a sentence to the Discussion raising this question as a possible avenue for future work (eleventh paragraph).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> does not provide a comparison of cytoskeletal composition between the myelinated and non-myelinated inhibitory axon segments on the same neurons, or between myelinated and unmyelinated inhibitory axons in general. The reported cytoskeletal differences may therefore be related to the inhibitory vs excitatory distinction rather than inhibitory myelinated vs. excitatory myelinated (i.e. inhibitory and excitatory axons may already have that difference regardless of their myelination).</italic></p><p>As mentioned above we performed additional analysis of our AT data to address this question (added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, panel D; added to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>; and a new paragraph in Results, last paragraph). For this analysis, we identified individual axons that contained both a myelinated and a non-myelinated portion within the dataset volume. Nodes of Ranvier were excluded and only non-myelinated stretches longer than 4 µm were considered. This analysis revealed several interesting differences. First, as the reviewers suggested, there are indeed cytoskeletal differences that are related to the inhibitory vs. excitatory distinctions. Both the myelinated and the unmyelinated regions of the inhibitory axons have higher neurofilament content and lower microtubule content compared to excitatory axons. In addition, however, there are also statistically significant differences in the cytoskeletal content between the different regions of PV+ axons, where myelinated portions have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content compared to the unmyelinated portions of the same axons. While excitatory axons show similar trends of differences in cytoskeletal composition depending on myelination, the differences are more pronounced for PV+ axons, in particular for neurofilament content.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers don't understand a discrepancy between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. For example, the equal density of GABA and non-GABA myelinated axons in layer 2/3 are shown in D, while 50% of myelinated axons in this layer are GABAergic, as seen in C. But in L4 and L5 the density shown in D does not look that different from L2/3, but in C it does. Do we miss something?</italic></p><p>We forgot to mention that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> the y-axis scale is logarithmic. We have now added this to the figure legend, and thank the reviewers for helping catch this omission.</p><p><italic>3) Some reviewers feel that the Introduction over-dramatizes the historic difficulties of studying myelin on identified cells. We encourage you to acknowledge the findings by DeFelipe, Hendry and Jones (1986) who used the Golgi stain in their study of large basket cells in the sensory-motor cortex of monkey and showed that the axon became myelinated where it lost its Golgi-staining. Similarly, other combined light and electron microscopic methods have been available for at least 30 years to analyze the individual myelinated axonal arbors.</italic></p><p>Although the work of DeFelipe, Hendry and Jones was cited both in the Introduction and Discussion of the original manuscript, we agree that the text of the Introduction overstated the difficulty of studying myelin on individual filled cell axons and understated the impact the earlier studies have had. We have edited the Introduction accordingly (third paragraph) and included more references of earlier studies.</p><p><italic>4) The Discussion is over-long and over-speculative. The basic result showing that PV-(+) basket cells have myelinated axons is consistent with observations in other species. Too much speculation is devoted to what this might mean. Particularly speculative is the section on the clinical significance of the findings.</italic> </p><p>We have contracted the Discussion, especially the portions on cell physiology (ninth paragraph) and clinical significance (eleventh paragraph).</p><p>References</p><p>1) McDonald, K.
