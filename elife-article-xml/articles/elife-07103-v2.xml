samples. In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To demonstrate the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less within-species variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07103.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07103.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07103.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Comparing the genomes of different species can reveal how they are related to one another. Such comparative studies can also reveal how genomes are modified in species-specific ways to regulate gene activity. The genomes of humans and chimpanzees are very similar in sequence. It is therefore likely that differing patterns of gene regulation underlie many of the differences observed between the two species. However, only a few kinds of chimpanzee cell that can be grown in the laboratory are available for research; this lack of samples has limited the ability of researchers to perform such comparative studies.</p><p>One way around this problem is to use induced pluripotent stem cells (or iPSCs). IPSCs are created by exposing mature cells—for example, skin cells—to conditions and molecules that convert them into an embryonic-like state. This state—called ‘induced pluripotency’—allows the cells to be coaxed into becoming many different cell types that can be grown in the laboratory. But it is more difficult to establish high quality iPSCs from chimpanzees than it is from humans or mice.</p><p>Gallego Romero, Pavlovic et al. have now addressed this problem by creating iPSCs from skin cells taken from seven healthy chimpanzees. These cell lines were then analysed and compared to each other and to seven iPSC lines created from human cells. The chimpanzee iPSC lines were found to be much more similar to each other than the mature cells that were used to make them. Similar results were also observed for the human iSPCs, which likely reflects the conserved changes that take place when the genomes of mature cells are reprogrammed to pluripotency.</p><p>This high level of similarity between iPSCs from different individuals of the same species allowed Gallego Romero, Pavlovic et al. to discover many subtle differences in gene regulation between chimpanzees and humans. For example, over 4500 genes were found to be expressed differently in human and chimpanzee iPSCs, and over 3500 genomic regions had different patterns of certain DNA modifications that can help to regulate gene expression.</p><p>These newly created chimpanzee iPSC lines represent a valuable resource for comparative studies of gene regulation. In the future, this resource could help researchers to identify further differences in gene regulation between closely related primate species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comparative functional genomic studies of humans and other primates have been consistently hindered by a lack of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gallego Romero et al., 2012</xref>). In spite of their clear potential to inform our understanding of both human evolution and disease, practical and ethical concerns surrounding working with non-human primates have constrained the field to using a limited set of cell types collected in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner, primarily lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fibroblasts. Comparative studies of any other primate tissue have been limited to using post-mortem (typically frozen) materials, thereby precluding most experimental manipulation and yielding primarily observational insights (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blekhman et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>An alternative has been to use model organisms in an attempt to recapitulate inter-primate regulatory differences. The typical approach involves the introduction of sequences of evolutionary interest into a model system, and then searching for spatial or temporal differences in gene expression that can be ascribed to the introduced sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Enard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cotney et al., 2013</xref>). This is a difficult and challenging approach and, perhaps as a result, there are still only a handful of well-described examples of human-specific regulatory adaptations in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prabhakar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2011</xref>) and even fewer cases where the underlying regulatory mechanisms have been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rockman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pollard et al., 2006</xref>). While these studies are useful and often informative, they also entail assumptions of functional conservation between the model system and the species of interest that may not necessarily be true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gallego Romero et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can provide a viable means of circumventing these concerns and limitations, at least with respect to the subset of phenotypes that can be studied in in vitro systems. Reprogramming somatic cell lines to a stable and self-sustaining pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>) has become routine practice for human and murine cell lines, but extension to other animals, especially non-human primates, is not yet widespread despite some exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ezashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Nun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marchetto et al., 2013b</xref>). Instead, the broadest application of iPSCs to date has been the generation of lines derived from patients suffering from a variety of genetic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen and Melton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Israel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merkle and Eggan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), with the dual aims of providing a deeper understanding of disease phenotypes and developing new therapeutic avenues. These cell lines have been shown to display in vitro properties corresponding to relevant patient phenotypes observed in vivo, both as iPSCs and when differentiated into other pertinent cell types, supporting their utility in clinical applications; more generally, these properties also highlight the tantalizing flexibility of iPSCs as a means of exploring developmental and cell lineage determination pathways.</p><p>Thus, the development of an iPSC-based system for comparative genomic studies in primates will allow us to compare regulatory pathways and complex phenotypes in humans and our close evolutionary relatives using appropriate models for different tissues and cell types. This will be a powerful resource with which to examine the contribution of changes in gene regulation to human evolution and diversity. To demonstrate the validity of this approach, we have generated a panel of 7 chimpanzee iPSC lines that are fully characterized and comparable to human iPSC lines in their growth and differentiation capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We generated a panel of iPSC lines from seven chimpanzees through electroporation of episomal plasmids expressing <italic>OCT3/4</italic> (also known as <italic>POU5F1</italic>), <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>L-MYC</italic>, <italic>LIN28</italic>, and an shRNA targeting <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okita et al., 2011</xref>), as well as an in vitro-transcribed <italic>EBNA1</italic> mRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) that promotes increased exogenous vector retention in the days following electroporation.

We also calculated PluriTest novelty scores for all samples. In human PSCs, novelty values above 1.67 are suggestive of chromosomal duplications or expression of differentiation-associated genes. Human PSCs with high novelty scores are typically either difficult to maintain and expand in culture (because they differentiate spontaneously at a high rate), or cannot be consistently differentiated to all three germ layers. All of our chimpanzee lines had novelty scores above the 1.67 threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, in contrast to human PSCs with high novelty scores, our chimpanzee lines can be both easily maintained in culture and differentiated into all three germ layer lineages, as demonstrated by the embryoid body and teratoma assays detailed above.

We identified 63,791 probes that are DM between the two species at an FDR of 1%, 26,554 of which have a mean intergroup β difference ≥0.1, our arbitrary effect size threshold for retaining probes for DM region (DMR) identification and downstream analyses. Of these, 10,460 probes could be further grouped into 3529 regions of 2 or more DM probes within 1 kb, which we designated DMRs; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>); the numbers of probes and regions identified as DM at a range of mean interspecies β thresholds are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p>In order to consider the DNA methylation and gene expression data jointly, we focused on a subset of 2348 DMRs that could be associated with a single Ensembl gene. Overall, these DMRs were associated with 2141 genes, of which 1350 were also detectably expressed in the iPSCs, and 558 (41.3%) were classified as DE between the species, a slightly higher proportion than expected by chance alone (p = 0.1). We further classified the DMRs as either ‘promoter’, ‘genic’ or ‘mixed’ depending on their position relative to annotated gene transcripts (see ‘Materials and methods’). The overall set of DMRs, as well as genic DMRs, are significantly associated with 4 and 79 GO BP terms respectively (FDR &lt; 5%), including terms related to neurogenesis and skeletal system development. Enrichment of several terms related to neurogenesis and skeletal system development is likewise marginally significant amongst promoter and mixed DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>). However, the subset of inter-species DE genes that are also associated with DMRs are not significantly enriched with annotation for any GO BP or MF terms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparative histone modification data</title><p>We used ChIP-seq to characterize the genome-wide distribution of two types of histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) in three of our chimpanzee iPSCs (see ‘Materials and methods’). We compared the chimpanzee data to histone modification data from three human iPSC lines from the Roadmap Epigenomics project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To do so, we downloaded raw sequence files from GEO and processed data from both species using the same pipeline (see ‘Materials and methods’). We identified ChIP-seq peaks using MACS or RSEG, as appropriate, and accounted for differences in genome sequence between the species as well as for incomplete power to identify peaks across species (see ‘Materials and methods’). To relate the ChIP-seq data to genes (and integrate over data from all peaks that are in proximity to a given gene), we then generated enrichment ChIP scores for a set of previously defined 26,115 orthologous transcription start sites (TSSs, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The enrichment score (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details, also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>), reflects the ratio of mapped ChIP-seq read counts across all peaks within a 4 kb window centred on an orthologous TSS, relative to the genome-wide read count average after adjusting expectations based on the input control sample. We chose to classify as ‘enriched’ any region where the mean enrichment score across all three individuals in the species was larger than 1. This cut-off is arbitrary, but we confirmed that our qualitative results are robust by additionally testing enrichment cut-offs of 2, 5, and 10.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07103.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Overlap of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac signal between chimpanzee and human iPSCs at orthologous transcription start sites (TSSs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H3K27me3 enrichment near all genes with an orthologous TSS.

Overlap across the two species is considerably higher than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, χ<sup>2</sup> p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>), but it is somewhat unclear how to interpret this observation with respect to the expectation that human and chimpanzee iPSCs would have similar pluripotency potential. We thus focused on a set of 3913 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>) previously annotated as bivalently modified in human PSCs—that is, genes known to be associated with both high H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, indicative of a ‘poised’ or ‘primed’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). We expect the vast majority of these genes to also be associated with similar modifications in chimpanzee iPSCs. Only 2910 of the known bivalent genes were associated with clear orthologous TSSs and could be tested using our comparative H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data. Of these, 306 were not associated with the modification in either species, whereas of the 2604 genes that were associated with H3K27me3 in at least one species, 2368 (90.1%) were enriched for H3K27me3 in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, χ<sup>2</sup> p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>).</p><p>We then examined H3K27ac enrichment patterns in both species. This mark is indicative of active promoters and gene transcription. Overall, we find good agreement between human and chimpanzee genes enriched for H3K27ac, with 95.8% human genes associated with the mark also enriched in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, there is a clear excess of genome-wide H3K27ac signal in chimpanzee iPSCs relative to humans, possibly due to an overall more sensitive ChIP enrichment in the chimpanzee samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).</p><p>We proceeded by focusing on a list of 22 core pluripotency transcription factors (taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ng and Surani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011</xref>), where we expect to find H3K27ac signal shared across the two species at a higher rate than in the genome-wide data, given the role of these factors in maintaining pluripotency. Due to our stringent requirements for establishing orthology, we were initially able to examine data from 14 of those genes; 11 of which were associated with H3K27ac in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>)—one of the discrepancies is <italic>REX1</italic> (also known as <italic>ZFP42</italic>), which we discuss further below. We extended our analysis to include the full set of 22 pluripotency transcription factors regardless of orthology, by testing solely for absence or presence of signal peaks identified by MACS (i.e., without considering enrichment scores; see ‘Materials and methods’). We again found a high overlap in H3K27ac enrichment across species, with 15 of the 22 genes associated with H3K27ac enrichment in both species (including the three master regulators of pluripotency, <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, and <italic>NANOG;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of the remaining 7 genes, one (<italic>DAX1</italic>) was not found to be associated with H3K27ac in either species, four genes (<italic>ESSRB, KLF2, KLF4,</italic> and <italic>KLF5</italic>) were associated with H3K27ac only in chimpanzee (although this observation may reflect incomplete power to detect peaks in the human data), and only two genes (<italic>ZFX</italic> and <italic>REX1</italic>) were associated with H3K27ac in human but not in chimpanzee iPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>REX1 may be dispensable for chimpanzee pluripotency</title><p>In order to further consider inter-species differences in the core pluripotency regulatory network, we examined expression levels in our chimpanzee and human iPSCs in the same list of 22 core pluripotency TFs described above. Expression values in all iPSC lines are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the stringency of our interspecies analysis approach with respect to unique read mapping, we are unable to calculate RNA-seq-based expression estimates for six of these TFs, including <italic>OCT4</italic> or <italic>NANOG</italic>, both of which have multiple pseudogenes that can confound mapping algorithms (however, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, our qPCR results demonstrate that expression of those 2 genes is similar amongst all chimpanzee iPSC lines, and marginally higher than in our human iPSC control line). Of the 16 TFs with expression data for iPSCs from both species, 4 (<italic>E2F1, ESRRB, SALL4</italic> and <italic>REX1</italic>) are DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs at an FDR of 1%. Of these, <italic>ESRRB</italic> and <italic>REX1</italic> are associated with absolute inter-species expression log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes &gt;1. However, because <italic>ESRRB</italic> is expressed at very low levels across all samples (mean RPKM across all 14 samples = 0.47), we focused our subsequent analyses on <italic>REX1</italic>, which is expressed at low or undetectable levels in 6 of our 7 chimpanzee iPSCs (mean RPKM = 0.667), but at high levels in all human iPSC lines (mean RPKM = 180.58) and a single chimpanzee iPSC, C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our DNA methylation data is consistent with this gene expression pattern: all 10 probes located in the 5′ UTR or up to 1500 bp upstream from the <italic>REX1</italic> TSS are highly methylated in the six chimpanzee lines (mean β across all promoter probes = 0.87), but exhibit intermediate or low levels of DNA methylation in all of the human iPSC lines and the <italic>REX1</italic>-expressing C6 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); the entire region is a DMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Remarkably, both DNA methylation and gene expression levels in iPSCs are relatively homogeneous within species, far more so than in their corresponding precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>; p &lt; 10<sup>−14</sup> when comparing overall pairwise distances within all chimpanzee iPSCs and within all chimpanzee fibroblasts in the methylation data; p &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup> for the same comparison in the gene expression data). DNA methylation levels in iPSCs also have significantly reduced coefficients of variation relative to their precursor lines (range of CVs for chimpanzee iPSCs = 0.78–0.80, for chimpanzee fibroblasts = 0.87–0.90; p &lt; 10<sup>−06</sup>). We observed the same pattern in the human data, although in this case the multiple somatic origins of the cell lines of origin contribute to the higher level of variation.</p><p>We then performed analyses of gene expression and DNA methylation differences in the combined iPSC and somatic precursor dataset. First, we carried out a comparison of the iPSCs and the precursor cells within each species (see ‘Materials and methods’) and classified 9235 genes as DE between chimpanzee fibroblasts and the corresponding iPSCs. In humans the number of DE genes is 7765 if we consider all iPSC lines and their somatic precursors, 8087 if we only consider those derived from LCLs (n = 5), and 5489 if we only consider those derived from fibroblasts (n = 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Similarly, we identified 18,029 DMRs between chimpanzee fibroblasts and iPSCs, and 12,078 DMRs between all human somatic precursors and all human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data SD12-data">Supplementary files 11, 12</xref>). No GO categories are significantly overrepresented in any of these data sets.</p><p>Next, we focused on a comparison of inter-species differences in gene expression and DNA methylation levels across cell types. Following joint normalisation and modelling of data from all samples (see ‘Materials and methods’), we classified 5663 genes as DE between the chimpanzee precursor fibroblasts and the collection of human precursor LCLs and fibroblasts, as well as 84,747 DM probes and 9107 DMRs (always at an FDR of 1%). Most of these regulatory differences, however, reflect variation across cell types rather than across species (6324 genes and 70,312 probes are DE or DM between the human fibroblasts and LCLs, respectively). We thus considered only data from the fibroblast precursors in the two species. Only 2 of the human iPSCs were reprogrammed from fibroblasts, leading to a loss in power; we were nonetheless able to identify 1236 DE genes and 25,456 DM probes between human and chimpanzee fibroblasts, and 1118 DE genes and 16,392 DM probes between the corresponding iPSCs of the two species. None of these gene sets were significantly enriched for functional annotations using GO BP terms. Although the overlap of inter-species DE genes and DM probes between the iPSCs and the precursors is considerable (13.6% of DE genes and 11.8% of DM probes), a large number of regulatory differences are only observed between the iPSC lines of the two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). This observation is robust with respect to different approaches to normalising and modelling the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), strongly suggesting that many of the differences we observe between our chimpanzee and human iPSC lines may be intrinsic features of the pluripotent state in these two species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>iPSCs have the potential to transform our understanding of the biology of non-model organisms and facilitate functional comparative studies. To this end, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee iPSCs. All lines are capable of spontaneously giving rise to the three tissue germ layers in vitro and in vivo and meet all currently established criteria for pluripotency. The chimpanzee iPSC lines provide a tantalising avenue for investigating how changes in gene expression and regulation underlie the architecture of complex phenotypic traits in humans and our closest living relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gallego Romero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marchetto et al., 2013a</xref>). In particular, we believe that through the use of directed differentiation protocols, functional studies could be performed in cell types where strong a priori hypotheses support a role for selective pressure underlying inter-species divergence (e.g., liver, heart, kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>]). In that sense, we hope that this panel of cell lines will be a useful tool to researchers interested in overcoming current limitations of comparative studies in primates. To that purpose, all chimpanzee iPSC described in this publication the panel are available fully and without restrictions to other investigators upon request to the corresponding authors.</p><p>Other groups have previously generated pluripotent stem cells from primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tomioka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Nun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deleidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okamoto and Takahashi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wunderlich et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marchetto et al., 2013b</xref>) reported the generation of two chimpanzee and two bonobo (<italic>P. paniscus</italic>) iPSC lines through the use of retroviral vectors. However, in the course of our work we have found that retroviral vector silencing in chimpanzee iPSCs was not as stable as in human iPSC lines generated at the same time using the same method (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Our use of episomal vectors circumvents this problem, and more broadly the problems of both random exogenous gene reactivation and disruption of the host genome through retroviral integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sommer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>More generally, while the sum total of primate PSC generation efforts so far has resulted in a sizable number of lines being established from various donors and species, these have been generated through various reprogramming protocols and source cell types. We have generated iPSCs from a panel of seven individuals using a consistent protocol and cell type of origin. Given the panel size, it is powerful enough to robustly detect inter-species differences in gene expression, splicing and regulation. The fact that our panel contains both female and male lines also allows for future studies of sex-specific differences in gene expression in various cell types. Indeed, we have previously shown that this can be accomplished using as few as six individuals from each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blekhman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its future applications, however, our panel has already yielded insights into the pluripotent state in chimpanzees and humans. On the one hand, both at the transcriptional and epigenetic level, our iPSCs are remarkably homogeneous both within and between species, significantly more so than their precursors cells. This finding aligns with our current understanding of the reprogrammed pluripotent state as a complex, highly regulated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaenisch and Young, 2008</xref>), deviations from which are likely to result in loss of pluripotency and lineage commitment. Additional support for this notion was provided by the strong overlap in H3K27me3 signal between the two species, especially in known bivalent genes. It is remarkable that we have been able to observe this considerable conserved chromatin signature despite the obvious confounding technical batch effect in these comparative data.</p><p>On the other hand, we were also able to identify over 4500 genes that are DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs, as well as over 3500 DMRs between the two species. These numbers are greater than what has been previously observed in comparisons of other tissues across humans and chimpanzees with similar sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>). We believe that the reasons for this difference are likely to primarily stem from increased power to detect DE genes and DMRs in our sample relative to previous work. Given the small amount of intra-species variability we observed in RNA-seq and methylation relative to other tissues, we expect to have greater power to detect small, statistically significantly inter-species differences that would have been missed by studies that consider more variable tissue samples. This notion is supported by the fact that the fraction of genes with log FC &lt; 2 we detect as DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs is greater than in other comparison we have performed with any other tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Though small in magnitude, we expect that a subset of these regulatory differences may be biologically relevant (e.g., we find that inter-species regulatory differences in methylation levels are enriched in regions associated with developmental processes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data SD5-data">Supplementary files 4, 5</xref>).</p><p>We specifically highlighted an inter-species difference in <italic>REX1</italic> expression levels<italic>.</italic> This gene is considered an indispensible pluripotency marker in human and mouse PSCs, but our observations suggest that it may not be the case in chimpanzees. Although only one chimpanzee iPSC line expresses <italic>REX1</italic>, we were unable to identify any systematic differences between our human and chimpanzee iPSCs that would indicate a reduction in pluripotency. We also examined <italic>REX1</italic> expression levels in 73 human iPSC lines generated in-house from Caucasian individuals using the Illumina HT12v4 array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). All lines had PluriTest pluripotency scores &gt;20, yet 3 of 73 lines (4.1%) showed levels of <italic>REX1</italic> expression that were indistinguishable from background signal, suggesting that <italic>REX1</italic> may not be expressed in these individuals despite their high pluripotency scores. We also examined methylation status at the <italic>REX1</italic> locus in previously published human ESCs and iPSCs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ziller et al. (2011)</xref>, and found that although all ESC lines examined exhibited consistent levels of low methylation at the <italic>REX1</italic> promoter, human iPSC lines analysed in exhibited either hemi- or hyper-methylated <italic>REX1</italic> promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). In the absence of publicly available <italic>REX1</italic> expression data from either of the hiPSC lines with hypermethylated promoters we cannot be certain that the gene is not expressed in these lines, but the combination of these findings with our observations above and previous literature suggest that <italic>REX1</italic> may be important in regulation and maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs, but not necessarily so in iPSCS.</p><p>Additionally, in chimpanzees, the <italic>REX1</italic> gene has undergone multiple deletions and insertions relative to the human sequence, most significantly a 647 bp insertion in its first intron, and two insertions in the 3′ UTR region of approximately 300 bp each that may disrupt the local regulatory landscape; the gene has also been duplicated, with a second copy retrotransposed into chromosome 14; none of these changes are shared with gorillas or orang-utans. Although it is currently unclear whether some or all of these changes are also present in the bonobo, these findings might explain why we observed low or no <italic>REX1</italic> expression more frequently in chimpanzees than in humans, and suggests that the gene may not be necessary for maintaining pluripotency in the <italic>Pan</italic> lineage.</p><p>PSCs have been used to study developmental pathways in vitro (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paige et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wamstad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Although optimization of existing differentiation protocols will likely be necessary for application in the chimpanzee system, our panel of iPSCs makes it possible to carry out comparative developmental studies between humans and chimpanzees, and firmly test the hypothesis that changes in gene regulation and expression, especially during development, underlie phenotypic differences between closely related species, especially primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Britten and Davidson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carroll, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2008</xref>). In addition, we should be able to recreate and test the effect of inter-species regulatory changes in the correct cell type and species environment, enabling studies that cannot otherwise be performed in humans and non-human primates. The use of panels of iPSCs including lines from both humans and non-human primates will thus allow us to gain unique insights into the genetic and regulatory basis for human-specific adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation and culture of fibroblasts</title><p>All biopsies and animal care were conducted by the Yerkes Primate Research Center of Emory University under protocol 006–12, in full accordance with IACUC protocols.

All iPSC samples were multiplexed and sequenced on four lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500; while the precursor cell lines were multiplexed and sequenced on six lanes of the same sequencer. We generated a minimum of 28,010,126 raw reads per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>), and confirmed the raw data were of high quality using FastQC (available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>).

In all cases, 1000 ng of genomic DNA were bisulphite-converted and hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip at the University of Chicago Functional Genomics facility as directed by the manufacturer. Since the probes on the array were designed using the human reference genome, we followed the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernando-Herraez et al. (2013)</xref> to compare humans and chimpanzees. We retained those probes that had either a perfect match to the chimpanzee reference genome, or had 1 or 2 mismatches in the first 45 bp but no mismatches in the 3′ 5 bp closest to the CpG site being assayed. We also removed all probes that contained human SNPs (MAF ≥0.05) or chimpanzee SNPs (MAF ≥0.15) within the last 5 bp of their binding site closest to the CpG being assayed. Within each individual, probes with a detection p &gt; 0.01 were excluded. This resulted in the retention of 335,307 autosomal probes, and an additional 8210 X chromosome probes, which we normalized and analyzed separately by sex. In all cases we performed a two-color channel signal adjustment, quantile normalization and β-value recalculation as implemented in the lumi package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al., 2008</xref>). Because the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip contains two assay types which utilize different probe designs, we performed a BMIQ (beta mixture quantile method) normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Teschendorff et al., 2013</xref>) on the quantile-normalized autosomal data set. We did not perform this step on the X chromosome data, due to its methylation patterns. We built neighbor joining trees using Manhattan distances at all 335,307 probes using the nj function as above.</p><p>In order to identify DM probes we used an identical approach to that described above for the identification of DE genes. First, we identified probes that were DM between the iPSCs of both species using <italic>limma</italic> by using a reduced data set and model containing only data from the iPSCs themselves. Then, we fit a linear model to the data using limma with 6 parameters corresponding to the 6 tissue/species combinations in the data, classifying probes as DM at an FDR of 1%. As with the expression data, the reduced model has more power to identify DM probes between the two iPSC groups than the full model; however, there is great concordance between the two sets of results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). We excluded all probes with mean β inter-group differences &lt;0.1 in order to group DM probes into DMRs, which we define as 2 or more DM probes separated by &lt;1 kb, with the additional requirement that the effect be in the same direction in all DM probes within the region. Finally, to examine the content of these DMRs, we used annotation files for the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip provided by the manufacturer and discarded all DMRs associated with either multiple or no genes. We tested for enrichment of GO BP categories amongst the genes contained in the DMRs by using the R package topGO 2.16.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexa et al., 2006</xref>), using as a background set all genes in which it is theoretically possible to detect DMRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data</title><p>ChIP-seq assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>), with slight modifications. Specifically, approximately 60 million iPSCs from three chimpanzee individuals (C2, C5 and C7) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were lysed and chromatin sheared with a Covaris S2 (settings: 4 min, duty cycle 10%, 5 intensity, 200 cycles per burst in 4 6 × 16 mm tubes per individual). H3K27ac- and H3K27me3-enriched regions were isolated using 5 μg of either H3K27ac antibody (ab4729, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or H3K27me3 antibody (07–449, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). ChIP and input DNA from each individual were end-repaired, A-tailed and ligated to Illumina Truseq sequencing adapters before 18 cycles of PCR amplification. 200–300 bp DNA fragments were selected for sequencing. Input libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500 using the rapid run mode, ChIP libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on three lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2500 using the rapid run mode.</p><p>For comparison purposes, we downloaded ChIP input, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 data from 3 human iPSC lines (iPS 6.9, iPS-18a, and iPS.20b, all of them release 5) generated by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>) from the NIH GEO database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Human and chimpanzee samples were mapped to either hg19 or panTro3 using BWA 0.7.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>); reads that mapped outside chromosomes 1–22 + X were discarded, as were reads that did not map uniquely to a single genomic region with less than 2 mismatches, or reads that were marked by Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net">http://picard.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) as originating from PCR duplicates.</p><p>After mapping and filtering, we used MACS 1.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and RSEG 0.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song and Smith, 2011</xref>) to identify peaks in the H3K27ac and H3K27me3 data respectively. Our analyses in this section follow those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al. (2014)</xref>. Briefly, for MACS, we specified an initial p-value threshold of H3K27ac, 0.001, and used each line's ChIP input file for comparison. For RSEG, we used the ‘rseg-diff’ function to compare H3K27me3 enrichment against each individual's ChIP input file, with the recommended 20 maximum iterations for hidden Markov model training. We then filtered enriched regions or peaks identified by either program by retaining only those that overlapped a previously defined set of 200 bp orthologous windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), where at least 80% of bases are mappable across species using liftOver. We define mappability as the ability of each 20 bp kmer beginning in that window to be uniquely mapped to the genome.</p><p>To ensure that sequence divergence did not confound our analyses, we mapped each identified region or peak in humans to the chimpanzee genome, and vice versa, using liftOver, and excluded regions and peaks where 80% or greater of bases in the enriched peaks or regions failed to align to the other genome. To further minimise the number of false positive results in our interspecies comparison (due to incomplete power), we applied a two-step cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cain et al., 2011</xref>) to the list of enriched regions and peaks. For H3K27ac, we retained all peaks that were identified with a first, stringent cutoff of FDR &lt; 5% in one species and a, second, relaxed cutoff of FDR &lt; 15% in the other, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al. (2014)</xref>. Because RSEG does not report FDR values for enriched regions, we used each region's domain score, which is the sum of the posterior scores of all bins within the domain, and set a first, stringent cutoff of 20 in one species, and a second, relaxed threshold demanding only that the region be classified as ‘enriched’ by RSEG, without a specific score requirement.</p><p>Having done this, we integrated data from multiple peaks (when present) to generate a gene-level metric of ChIP signal in each individual. Specifically, we computed an enrichment score for each histone mark in each individual in a set of previously defined 26,115 orthologous TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) by dividing RPKM values at each TSS at gene <italic>i</italic> for either mark minus RPKM values in TSS at gene <italic>i</italic> for ChIP input, all of it over the genome-wide average RPKM for either mark minus the genome-wide average RPKM for ChIP input. Given the way in which we have defined this enrichment score, a score &gt;0 indicates those genes where we detected more histone mark reads than input reads, while a score &gt;1 indicates a gene with an excess of histone mark reads greater than what we would expect given the genome-wide distribution.</p><p>Because 8 of the 22 genes in the list of pluripotency master genes used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> do not have clearly defined orthologous TSSs, we also examined whether MACS identified peaks in the 2 kb ± TSS for all 22 genes and their orthologous position in the chimpanzee genome, identified solely through liftOver—that is, without taking into account whether there is evidence for a TSS at that position in the chimpanzee genome. To generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, we simply asked how many of the 22 genes had at least 1 peak at an FDR &lt; 5% in at least 1 individual in either species, regardless of orthology and sequence conservation.</p><p>We note that since different labs produced the human and chimpanzee data, we expect a considerable technical batch effect to be completely confounded with species annotation. Given this study design, we expect the technical batch effect to result in the appearance of inter-species differences; yet, our goal is to demonstrate similarity across species. Thus, our conclusions (of high overlap across species), are conservative with respect to the technical batch effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>REX1 expression and function</title><p>To examine the possible consequences of reduced expression of <italic>REX1</italic> in chimpanzee iPSCs, we retrieved genes that responded to a <italic>REX1</italic> knockdown in mESCs from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data SD3-data">Supplementary files 2, 3</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scotland et al.

We normalised expression estimates jointly with our own cell lines to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, and used all data points from a given species, irrespective of origin, to generate boxplots.</p><p>To generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, we took Illumina HT12v4 array data from 73 human iPSC lines generated in house and calculated Pluritest pluripotency and novelty scores as above, using the full probe set. Independently, we normalised and background-corrected the raw array intensities using the lumiExpresso function in <italic>lumi</italic> and extracted expression values for all 73 human iPSC lines at the single array probe associated with <italic>REX1</italic>.</p><p>In order to examine <italic>REX1</italic> methylation levels in other human PSCs, we obtained Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip for the lines reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ziller et al. (2011)</xref> from the authors, and normalised it jointly with our own data as described above. We then extracted normalised methylation β levels at the 13 probes that map to <italic>REX1</italic> in both chimpanzees and humans to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Other indicators of genomic stability</title><p>Finally, we assessed two broad indicators of stability in our chimpanzee lines. All iPSC lines derived from female chimpanzees, and 3 of 4 lines derived from human females, show strong evidence for elevated expression of XIST relative to male lines (FDR-adjusted p = 0.0010; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>) and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation during pluripotency. X-chromosome methylation patterns in females corroborate these observations, with the majority of probes mapping to the X-chromosome in our data being either hemimethylated (0.2 &lt; β &lt; 0.8) or hypermethylated (β ≥ 0.8) in females but not in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>). We also used a list of 168 imprinted probes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al. (2014)</xref> to check for maintenance of genomic imprinting after reprogramming. We find that the majority of imprinted loci remain hemimethylated following reprogramming in both human and chimpanzee iPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>). However, we identify two sets of probes that are consistently hypermethylated in pluripotent lines but were hemimethylated in their precursor cells. The first cluster contains 5 probes that are hypermethylated across both chimpanzee and human iPSCs; these probes are associated with the genes <italic>KCNK9</italic>, <italic>ANKRD11</italic> and <italic>MKRN3</italic>. The second cluster is comprised of 21 probes that are hypermethylated in all human iPSCs but only 2 chimpanzee iPSCs in our data, and is associated with the gene <italic>PEG3-ZIM2,</italic> which has been previously shown to be abnormally methylated in both hESCs and hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lund et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Data Access</title><p>All novel RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation and ChIP-seq data are available at the GEO under SuperSeries number GSE61343.

Your Tools and resources article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Duncan Odom (Reviewing editor), and two anonymous reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers felt that a panel of iPS cells from chimpanzee has real potential to be a valued Resource across the community, although there were substantial concerns that must be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Reviews abridged to elaborate specific points are found at the end of this note.</p><p>Required for publication:</p><p>1) In line with <italic>eLife's</italic> role as a premier open-access venue for high-impact science, all the reported iPS cell lines must be deposited for unrestricted access by any member of the community into ATCC (preferably) or an alternative, easily accessed depository.</p><p>2) Demonstration that these lines can be differentiated into neuronal cells (or an alternative differentiation pathway).</p><p>3) A few more molecular characterizations are required, including (a) adding a comparison with publicly available mouse iPS gene expression data and (b) addition of representative chromatin state experiments, in part to demonstrate activation of pluripotency genes.</p><p>4) Clarifications required. (a) <italic>REX1</italic> results were highlighted by two independent reviewers, below, as confusing. (b) Differentially expressed (and methylated) genes should be checked for functional pathway enrichments. (c) Degree of gene expression divergence is surprising and could be elaborated on.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>These cells need to be released to a public depository such as ATCC for widest community adoption. The most important influence publishing this manuscript would have, particularly in an open-access journal, is if many research groups adopt the Gilab lab's cells as the community standard for inter-primate functional genomics. This cannot occur unless the cells are accessible. Such easy access is a key selling point for publishing a resource in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the discussion makes it appear that the authors reserve the right whether or not to release the cell lines: “Crucially for this, all lines from the panel are readily available for sharing with investigators who may wish to address questions beyond the scope of our own research” (quote from the Discussion).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) The major value of these chimpanzee iPSCs is that they can be differentiated into defined cell types that could not normally be obtained from live animals. The chimp iPSCs appear to be pluripotent based on the embryoid body assays and gene expression analyses described in the paper. However, can they be differentiated into any other cell types of interest (e.g., neuronal progenitors or neurons)? It would go a long way towards establishing the value of the resource if the authors could demonstrate this.</p><p>2) The degree of gene expression divergence between human and chimp iPSCs is surprising: about 38% of genes that could be measured show significant differential expression. Are many of these low-expressed genes that show minor fluctuations in their expression levels? Do genes that show high expression in one species and low expression in the other coalesce into particular biological categories (the authors report no GO enrichments for DE genes overall)? It is a bit worrisome that the chimp and human iPSCs show such extensive differences in expression, since it may suggest a species-specific response to the (highly artificial) iPSC protocol rather than intrinsic differences.</p><p>3) Including expression data from mouse iPSCs may help put the human-chimp expression differences into better context. We would expect gene expression patterns in the primate iPSCs to be more similar to each other than either would be to mouse. I understand there may be some limitations to this analysis, notably derivation artifacts in mouse iPSCs not generated in the authors' own lab using their protocols. However, if chimp iPSCs turn out to be outliers compared to human and mouse, that would warrant more investigation.</p><p>4) The connection between the differential methylation analysis and differential expression analysis is weak, in that DMR regions do not appear to correlate well with DE genes. However, the authors report ∼550 genes that show both DE and are associated with DMRs. What are the functions of these genes?</p><p>5) I would have liked to see some analyses of chromatin states in these cells, specifically histone modification profiles for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (or H3K27ac). We have clear expectations of what these profiles should look like in pluripotent cells: pluripotency genes should be highly active, and many fate commitment genes should be bivalent. It would also serve as an additional quality control, since iPSCs with aberrant chromatin states could be identified and excluded. Also, combining the DE and chromatin analyses would reveal important species differences—genes that are strongly differentially expressed between species, and that are associated with clear differences in activation state, would be especially interesting.</p><p>6) The <italic>REX1</italic> result is a bit confusing: this gene is required for pluripotency maintenance in mouse and human, but not chimp? Also, one of the chimpanzee lines clearly expresses the gene. Is the locus itself intact in all the chimpanzee lines? Alternatively, does high <italic>REX1</italic> expression in one cell line and low expression in the others suggest incomplete reversion to the pluripotent state in the low-expressing lines?</p><p>7) The authors compare gene expression in human and chimp fibroblast precursors and derived iPSCs. They identify 1,118 DE genes between the iPSCs—are there any functional enrichments here, especially in the subset of DE genes that are not differentially expressed between the human and chimp fibroblasts?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The principal component analysis (PC) for both gene expression and methylation is just descriptive and does not add any new information (could go to a supplement).</p><p>The authors find that <italic>REX1</italic> is barely expressed in most of the generated chimpanzee iPSCells (6 out of 7). This finding is potentially interesting but incomplete. The main concern rises from the comparison with previously described studies as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>. The authors state: “Furthermore, and consistent with our observations, REX1 is either absent or expressed at low levels in both replicates of one of two retrovirally reprogrammed bonobo (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>, sister species to chimpanzees) iPSC lines generated by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marchetto et al. 2013b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>)”. This sentence is misleading since all the chimpanzee iPSCs (4 replicates) described by Marchetto el al. showed comparable levels of <italic>REX1</italic> expression with human iPSCs. What are the causes of this discrepancy, can it be due to the differences in reprograming? In addition, there are no follow up experiments showing the cause / consequences of lack of <italic>REX</italic> expression in chimpanzee iPSCs and further investigation of a potential compensation mechanism.</p><p>The authors should also clarify how they calculate the median for <italic>REX</italic> expression in chimpanzee iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07103.051</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>These cells need to be released to a public depository such as ATCC for widest community adoption.

That said, we now provide descriptions and the results of directed differentiations of chimpanzee iPSCs to hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes (please see the subsections “Characterizing the chimpanzee iPSCs” and “Directed differentiation of chimpanzee iPSCs to hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes”, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2– figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The degree of gene expression divergence between human and chimp iPSCs is surprising: about 38% of genes that could be measured show significant differential expression.

It is a bit worrisome that the chimp and human iPSCs show such extensive differences in expression, since it may suggest a species-specific response to the (highly artificial) iPSC protocol rather than intrinsic differences</italic>.</p><p>This is an important concern, and we indeed did not provide sufficient discussion of this observation. The short answer is that due to overall lower variation in gene expression levels in iPSCs both within and between species, we actually have more power to detect even small inter-species regulatory differences.</p><p>Here is a longer response (we also revised the text accordingly; please see the subsection headed “Interspecies analysis of gene expression and methylation data from iPSCs”, the fifth paragraph of the Discussion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>We acknowledge that the fraction of genes we identify as DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs is indeed greater than previously reported in other primary tissues, when studies considered similar sample sizes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blekhman et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blekhman et al. 2010</xref>). Yet, we believe that the reason for this difference is likely to be increased power to detect DE in our iPSC sample relative to previous work. Indeed, given the small amount of intra-species variability we observe in RNA-seq and methylation relative to other tissues, we expect to have greater power to detect small, statistically significantly inter-species differences that would have been missed by studies that consider more variable tissue samples. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the fraction of genes with log FC &lt; 2 we detect as DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs is much <italic>greater</italic> than in other comparison we have performed with any other tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, other than <italic>REX1</italic>, which is discussed at length in the text, we find no noteworthy differences between human and chimpanzee iPSCs in master pluripotency regulators genes (including in the new ChIP-seq data). These observations suggest that the core circuitry of pluripotency is behaving similarly in both species.</p><p>With regards to pathway enrichments, when we test for GO BP term enrichment amongst the 546 genes with an absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold-change difference in interspecies mean expression levels &gt; 2, we find 123 overrepresented terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>), none of which suggest (to us at least) a potential difference in pluripotency potential.</p><p>Therefore, we believe that that high number of DE genes we observed between human and chimpanzee iPSCs primarily reflects a combination of true biological differences and increased power to detect small differences in expression between the two species (that might not be of great biological significance).</p><p>Of note (though for obvious reasons we do not discuss this in the current manuscript): we have seen similar patterns when we map eQTLs in iPSCs compared with eQTLs in other tissues.</p><p><italic>3) Including expression data from mouse iPSCs may help put the human-chimp expression differences into better context. We would expect gene expression patterns in the primate iPSCs to be more similar to each other than either would be to mouse. I understand there may be some limitations to this analysis, notably derivation artifacts in mouse iPSCs not generated in the authors' own lab using their protocols. However, if chimp iPSCs turn out to be outliers compared to human and mouse, that would warrant more investigation</italic>.</p><p>The probability that our chimp data would be an outlier when mouse data are considered is remote, even due to technical considerations alone.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address this point we examined data from Guo et al., Cell 156(4): 649–662, which contains RNA-seq data from 4 independently derived mouse iPSCs through lentiviral reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We began our analysis using the table of reads mapped to known mouse genes (mm9) by the authors using TopHat 2.0.4 (the data is available in GEO as series GSE53074) and used the R package biomaRt to retrieve mouse and human homologous identifiers for all genes in the Guo et al. data. We intersected those genes with those in our own data set, and calculated TMM library sizes, CPM and loess normalised data across 10,580 retained genes from all three species jointly. We then computed RPKM in a species-specific manner. Because the Guo et al. data are provided at the gene level, we used the mean length of all known transcripts associated with a particular Ensembl ID as the gene length to calculate RPKM for the mouse data.</p><p>As expected, both PCA and a neighbour-joining tree built from Manhattan distances (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>) confirm that data from the chimpanzee iPSC (purple, C1-C7 on the figure in the right) lines are far more similar to data from human iPSCs (yellow-green, H1-H7 on the figure in the right) than from mouse iPSCs (blue, M1-M4 on the figure in the right).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07103.052</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07103.052">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07103.052</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07103-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We respectfully ask not to include these results in the paper.

However, the authors report ∼550 genes that show both DE and are associated with DMRs. What are the functions of these genes?</italic></p><p>In response to the suggestion, we performed enrichment analyses for genes that were both DE and were associated with DMRs at a 0.1 and 0.3 mean β difference threshold, and in neither case found any significant enrichments for GO BP or MF terms after correcting for multiple testing. This has now been clarified in the text (in the subsection “Interspecies analysis of gene expression and methylation data from iPSCs”).</p><p><italic>5) I would have liked to see some analyses of chromatin states in these cells, specifically histone modification profiles for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (or H3K27ac). We have clear expectations of what these profiles should look like in pluripotent cells: pluripotency genes should be highly active, and many fate commitment genes should be bivalent. It would also serve as an additional quality control, since iPSCs with aberrant chromatin states could be identified and excluded. Also, combining the DE and chromatin analyses would reveal important species differences—genes that are strongly differentially expressed between species, and that are associated with clear differences in activation state, would be especially interesting</italic>.</p><p>Following a discussion with the editor, we were asked to provide ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K27me3 from two representative chimpanzee iPSC lines. Accordingly, we have collected and analysed new ChIP-seq data for these marks in three chimpanzee individuals and compared the patterns we observed in the chimpanzee iPSC lines to similar ChIP-seq data from humans (collected by the Roadmap Epigenomics project).</p><p>As we report in the subsection headed “Comparative histone modification data”, genome-wide overlap in the enrichment of these histone modifications across the two species is considerably greater than expected by chance. When we consider histone modifications in proximity to genes known to either be poised in human iPSCs, or important for pluripotency, the overlap in mark enrichments across the species is even higher.</p><p>These results are presented in the new main text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplements 1-3</xref> and new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 9</xref>.

The authors state: “Furthermore, and consistent with our observations,</italic> REX1 <italic>is either absent or expressed at low levels in both replicates of one of two retrovirally reprogrammed bonobo (</italic>Pan paniscus, <italic>sister species to chimpanzees) iPSC lines generated by (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"><italic>Marchetto et al. 2013b</italic></xref><italic>) (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>)”. This sentence is misleading since all the chimpanzee iPSCs (4 replicates) described by Marchetto el al. showed comparable levels of</italic> REX1 <italic>expression with human iPSCs. What are the causes of this discrepancy, can it be due to the differences in reprograming? In addition, there are no follow up experiments showing the cause / consequences of lack of</italic> REX <italic>expression in chimpanzee iPSCs and further investigation of a potential compensation mechanism.</italic></p><p>Thank you, these are good points. We have addressed many of the reviewer's broader concerns above, in our response to reviewer 2's 6th point. With regards to specific question/concerns about the text, we have clarified the sentence highlighted as problematic by the reviewer as follows:</p><p>“Furthermore, and consistent with our observations, <italic>REX1</italic> is either absent or expressed at low levels in both replicates of one of two retrovirally reprogrammed bonobo (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>, sister species to chimpanzees) iPSC lines generated by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marchetto et al. 2013b</xref>) although it is expressed in both replicates of both chimpanzee iPCS lines from the same group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p>We are currently pursuing a more in-depth investigation of the causes and consequences of this difference in <italic>REX1</italic> expression levels, but we believe presenting in-depth experimental validation additional to the analyses already included is beyond the scope of this paper, and hope the reviewer agrees.</p><p><italic>The authors should also clarify how they calculate the median for</italic> REX <italic>expression in chimpanzee iPSCs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>The reported median expression values in this figure were calculated using all data points from a given species, as indicated in the figure legend and described in the Methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
