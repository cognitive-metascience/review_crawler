cancer in women and notwithstanding important therapeutic advances, remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite extensive research relating to the hormone ghrelin, responsible for the stimulation of growth hormone release and appetite, little is known of the effects of its unacylated form, especially in cancer. The present study aimed to characterize effects of unacylated ghrelin on breast cancer cells, define its mechanism of action, and explore the therapeutic potential of unacylated ghrelin or analog AZP-531. We report potent anti-tumor effects of unacylated ghrelin, dependent on cells being cultured in 3D in a biologically-relevant extracellular matrix. The mechanism of unacylated ghrelin-mediated growth inhibition involves activation of Gαi and suppression of MAPK signaling. AZP-531 also suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in xenografts, and may be a novel approach for the safe and effective treatment of breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unacylated ghrelin</kwd><kwd>3D culture</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>AZP-531</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001026</institution-id><institution>National Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NC-14-011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kristy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004752</institution-id><institution>State Government of Victoria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kristy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1007714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kristy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001114</institution-id><institution>The Endocrine Society of Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kristy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001026</institution-id><institution>National Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECF-16-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Kristy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001026</institution-id><institution>National Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Britt</surname><given-names>Kara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>3D culture of breast cancer in biologically relevant ECM potentiates the growth-inhibitory effects of unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531, and clinical response may be predictable based on a MAPK gene signature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and second only to lung cancer in terms of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noone et al., 2018</xref>). The majority of breast cancers occur after menopause and are hormone receptor positive, and in these women, first-line therapy usually involves endocrine therapy, for example aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reinert and Barrios, 2015</xref>). Despite the efficacy of endocrine therapy, a number of women experience severe and debilitating side effects due to the global inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis or action, and some will cease the use of their potentially life-saving treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lønning and Eikesdal, 2013</xref>). A proportion of women will also be resistant to treatment or develop resistance over time, and some will have tumors that cannot be treated with targeted therapies, that is triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Aggressive breast cancers are often associated with activation of RAS/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giltnane and Balko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santen et al., 2002</xref>), despite only a minority carrying a mutation in these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tilch et al., 2014</xref>). The prognosis for these patients is poor and hence, there is a need to identify alternative treatments that are safe and effective.</p><p>The unacylated form of ghrelin is closely related to the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. However, because it lacks octanoylation, it does not bind to the cognate ghrelin receptor, GHSR1a. Initially, unacylated ghrelin was believed to be produced as a by-product of ghrelin gene expression. However, recent studies have established an important role for this peptide hormone in regulating energy homeostasis, including reducing fat mass, improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). An unacylated ghrelin analog, AZP-531 (levolitide), is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome and type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allas et al., 2016</xref>). AZP-531 has an established safety profile and better pharmacokinetic properties than unacylated ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allas et al., 2016</xref>). The receptor for unacylated ghrelin is currently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au et al., 2016</xref>) and consequently, there is an important gap in our understanding of the mechanisms mediating its effects.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that unacylated ghrelin has activity in non-cancer tissue, including adipose stromal cells, where it suppresses the expression of the estrogen-biosynthetic enzyme aromatase, and breast adipose tissue macrophages, where it inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Docanto et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that the unacylated form of ghrelin is a potent suppressor of breast cancer cell growth, independent of effects on the stroma, and provide a novel mechanism of action via activation of Gαi, suppression of cAMP production, and inhibition of MAPK and Akt signaling. Importantly, the potent effects of unacylated ghrelin are dependent on growth of cells in 3D within a relevant extracellular matrix (ECM). Our findings, and that of others, suggest that tumor cell culture context affects response to therapy and that many translational failures may have resulted from the inappropriate model systems used to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian et al., 2015</xref>). It also suggests that others may have overlooked many effective therapies due to a lack of response in 2D cultures. We therefore believe that unacylated ghrelin is a prototypic 3D-specific breast cancer cell therapeutic and that characterizing its mechanism of action in a biologically relevant ECM will lead to a better understanding of how the tumor microenvironment affects response to therapy. We also demonstrate consistent effects in patient-derived breast cancer cells and breast cancer xenografts in preclinical models, where both unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531 are effective at causing growth inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unacylated ghrelin inhibits the 3D growth of breast cancer cells</title><p>Previous studies examining the effect of ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin on the growth of breast cancer cells showed little activity at doses below 1 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassoni et al., 2001</xref>). Considering the increasingly acknowledged role of the ECM in dictating the biology of tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, including aggressiveness and response to treatment, we sought to examine the effect of ghrelin and more importantly, unacylated ghrelin, in 3D cultures of breast cancer cells. Although both are hypothesized to bind alternate ghrelin receptors, beneficial effects on energy homeostasis have only been reported for unacylated ghrelin – likely due to ghrelin stimulating insulin resistance via its cognate receptor. The dependence on 3D culture was examined for unacylated ghrelin, where treatment of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells with 100 pM resulted in suppression of cell growth in matrigel and collagen, but not in 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). At this dose, no effects on MDA-MB-231 cell growth were observed in either 2D or 3D cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Inhibition of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cell growth was observed at 10<sup>-18</sup>-10<sup>-10</sup> M, with maximal effects observed at picomolar doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>). The degree of inhibition is directly related to the degree of growth stimulation induced by serum or estradiol. Again, no significant effect was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). The effects of unacylated ghrelin were mimicked by ghrelin, where 100 pM of either ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin were found to suppress the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells when grown in 3D in matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). To gain insights into the breadth of effects of unacylated and potential predictors of response, the effect of 100 pM unacylated ghrelin was tested in a panel of breast cancer cell lines grown in 3D, including ER+/PR+/HER2- (MCF7, T47D), ER+/PR+/HER2+ (ZR-75), HER2+ (SKBR3), TNBC (MDA-MB-468, DU4475, MDA-MB-157, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231), and tamoxifen-resistant (LCC2) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). In the presence of serum, unacylated ghrelin significantly inhibited the growth of all breast cancer cells examined except for three of the TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; DU4475, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231). Unacylated ghrelin also suppressed the estradiol-stimulated growth of ER+ breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Responsive cells included those having mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, while resistant cell lines carried mutations in <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>HRAS</italic> and/or <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To test whether these mutations confer resistance to treatment, the effects of unacylated ghrelin were examined in BRAFV600E-transfected MCF7 cells or colon cancer cells (RKO, HCT116) that carry mutations in <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic>, respectively. Transient transfection of MCF7 cells with mutant <italic>BRAF</italic> led to resistance to unacylated ghrelin treatment in estradiol- and serum-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Unacylated ghrelin had no effect on the growth of RKO and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). However, loss of the mutant alleles for <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> led to sensitization of RKO and HCT116 cells, respectively. Loss of the wild-type allele had no significant effect. Binding of Cy3-labeled unacylated ghrelin to responsive and non-responsive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>) suggests that resistance is not due to lack of binding or receptor expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unacylated ghrelin inhibits the 3D growth of breast cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>a, c</bold>) Unacylated ghrelin (UAG; 100 pM) inhibits the growth of a panel of breast cancer cell lines under serum-stimulated conditions (six replicates/group) or (<bold>b</bold>) ER+ breast cancer cell lines in the presence of estradiol (10 nM; six replicates/group).

Unacylated ghrelin significantly suppressed the formation of cAMP, but had no effect on intracellular calcium release. Effects on cAMP suggest a Gαi-dependent mechanism. Activation of Gαi by unacylated ghrelin was observed after 2 hr treatment, as measured by pull-down of GTP-bound Gαi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To test dependence of growth inhibitory effects of unacylated ghrelin on Gαi, 3D growth assays were performed in cells where the Gαi-encoding gene, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, alpha subunit (<italic>GNAI</italic>), was knocked out (CRISPR) or in the presence of Gαi inhibitor pertussis toxin.

Effects of unacylated ghrelin on ERK activity were examined in real-time using time-lapse confocal microscopy of the FRET-based extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity reporter (EKAR) in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Serum stimulated EKAR activity, whereas unacylated ghrelin and the MEK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited this effect. Effects of unacylated ghrelin on MAPK signaling were then examined. Unacylated ghrelin caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK and downstream target, p90RSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The effect on p90RSK was sustained for 24 hr in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but this suppression was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, at any time point (not shown). The levels of MAPK target cMyc, induced by serum, were also suppressed in cells treated with unacylated ghrelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Effects on Akt phosphorylation and activity were then examined by immunoblotting and by quantifying levels of FoxO3 nuclear localization in 3D in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and e</xref>). Unacylated ghrelin inhibited the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and downstream target p70S6K (Thr389). Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was noticeable at 5 and 15 min, and sustained for 24 hr. Effects on Akt activity, measured by examining the degree of serum-stimulated FoxO3 nuclear exclusion, were observed in real time, with unacylated ghrelin and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) causing a significant reduction in FoxO3 nuclear exclusion after 1 hr treatment. No effect of unacylated ghrelin on Akt phosphorylation or activity was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (not shown).

The effects of unacylated ghrelin on cell proliferation were examined by assessing EdU incorporation in breast cancer cell lines grown in 3D. Estradiol and serum caused a significant increase in EdU incorporation, and unacylated ghrelin suppressed DNA synthesis at 10, 100 and 1000 pM in MCF7, ZR75 and tamoxifen-resistant LCC2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The effect of unacylated ghrelin on phases of the cell cycle was assessed in live cells in 3D using the Premo FUCCI Cell Cycle Sensor, which consists of RFP-tagged cdt1 and GFP-tagged geminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In G1, geminin is degraded, leaving only the RFP signal. In S, G2 and M phases, cdt1 is degraded and hence, only the GFP signal is detected. During the G1/S transition, cells express both proteins with overlapping fluorescence appearing as yellow. Treatment of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells with unacylated ghrelin was associated with an increase in cells arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with no significant effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. Unacylated ghrelin also caused apoptosis in serum-stimulated MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, measured in 3D using membrane-impermeant nucleic acid dye ethidium homodimer III and using FACS analysis of Annexin V-stained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, unacylated ghrelin suppressed the serum-stimulated expression of CDK4 and cyclin D3, important for cell cycle G1 phase progression, and decreased phosphorylation of Rb at Ser795, known to prevent the degradation of this cell cycle arrest protein. Treatment with unacylated ghrelin was also associated with a decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, while stimulating the expression of pro-apoptotic factor BAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g–h</xref>).

It is a well-tolerated drug that is more stable than unacylated ghrelin. In order to determine whether this clinically available treatment has similar effects to parent peptide unacylated ghrelin, the effect of AZP-531 on breast cancer cell growth was examined in MCF7, MDA-MB-468, and patient-derived TNBC cells, and compared to chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>). AZP-531 caused the dose-dependent inhibition of the serum-stimulated growth of cells with greater potency than doxorubicin, but unlike doxorubicin, did not reduce cell number beyond that which was stimulated by serum. In order to confirm a similar mechanism of action, the effects of unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531 on cAMP levels within MCF7 cells were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Both unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the forskolin-mediated production of cAMP at 100 and 1000 pM, with no significant differences observed when both treatments were compared. Importantly, AZP-531 also caused the suppression of cell growth in preclinical models, including TNBC MDA-MB-468 xenografts and ER+ J110 allografts, at 200 µg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and f</xref>, respectively, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Little is known of the relationship between ghrelin, unacylated ghrelin and effects on breast cancer risk and progression. One report recently demonstrated that tumor ghrelin expression is associated with a favorable outcome in invasive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grönberg et al., 2012</xref>). More specifically, ghrelin immunoreactivity is significantly correlated with low histological grade, estrogen receptor positivity, small tumor size, low proliferation, as well as better recurrence-free and breast cancer-specific survival. The polyclonal antibody used was generated against full-length human ghrelin and hence potentially cross-reacts with unacylated ghrelin. In the present manuscript, both ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin were found to cause potent inhibition of breast cancer cell growth at picomolar doses when cells are grown in a biologically relevant extracellular matrix (ECM). Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> work examining the effects of ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin in breast cancer saw very little effects at sub-micromolar doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassoni et al., 2001</xref>). This is likely due to prior studies having been undertaken using traditional culture methods where cells were grown in 2D on plastic and highlights important mechanistic differences when cells are cultured in 3D surrounded by an ECM. The importance of modeling breast and other cancers using 3D systems has been emphasized in a number of recent studies. Importantly, differences in signaling pathway activation are noted and 3D systems are hypothesized to allow for better prediction of <italic>in vivo</italic> effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gangadhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weigelt et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings, and that of others, suggest that tumor cell culture context affects response to therapy and that many translational failures may have resulted from the inappropriate model systems used to date. It also suggests that others may have overlooked many effective therapies due to a lack of response in 2D cultures.</p><p>The cognate ghrelin receptor, GHSR1a, does not bind to unacylated ghrelin and is undetectable in most breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callaghan and Furness, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassoni et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that both ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin are acting at an alternate ghrelin receptor. In order to start dissecting the mechanism of action of unacylated ghrelin, cues were taken from our previous studies in adipose stromal cells where treatment results in inhibition of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Docanto et al., 2014</xref>). Results in the present study are consistent with these previous findings, and further demonstrate that unacylated ghrelin treatment is associated with activation of Gαi. The evidence for the importance of cAMP in breast cancer biology has been inconsistent. A number of studies have demonstrated pro-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronica et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Küng et al., 1983</xref>), while others show that cAMP and activation of PKA inhibit cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho-Chung et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fontana et al., 1987</xref>). Effects appear to be cell and context dependent. Directionality also seems more robust for studies performed using clinical samples. For example, cAMP levels have been shown to be 15 times higher in human breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Minton et al., 1974</xref>) and the overall ability to hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides has been shown to be decreased in faster growing and more invasive mammary cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fajardo et al., 2014</xref>). PKA regulatory subunit expression and catalytic activity have also been shown to be increased in malignant compared to normal breast tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordge et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that cAMP and PKA promote breast cancer growth. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of cAMP formation or action mimics the effects of unacylated ghrelin to inhibit breast cancer cell growth in 3D. Our findings demonstrating that cells are insensitive to the effects of unacylated ghrelin in the presence of a <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation also suggests that unacylated ghrelin acts upstream of these signaling proteins. Consistently, the growth-stimulatory effects of cAMP are dependent on MAPK signaling, known to be tightly regulated by BRAF/KRAS signaling.</p><p>Effects of unacylated ghrelin to inhibit cell cycle progression and stimulate apoptosis are also consistent with inhibition of MAPK and Akt signaling. Growth factor signaling has previously been shown to cause the accumulation of myc and cyclin D proteins, key drivers of the G1-to-S phase transition, as well as lead to the activation of CDK4 and the hyperphosphorylation of Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hipfner and Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Leary et al., 2016</xref>). Because cell number is not suppressed beyond what is stimulated by mitogens, effects are likely dependent on signaling downstream of the growth stimulus. The activity of unacylated ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin analogs to suppress MAPK and Akt signaling, myc, cyclin D3 and CDK4 expression, could therefore be leveraged in a therapeutic setting.</p><p>The unacylated ghrelin analog, AZP-531, was shown to be well tolerated in a phase I clinical trial performed in overweight and obese subjects with type II diabetes, and significant improvements in glucose variables were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allas et al., 2016</xref>). A phase II study was also undertaken in individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome, where daily subcutaneous injections of AZP-531 for 14 days caused a significant improvement in scores on the hyperphagia questionnaire, and a reduction in waist circumference, fat mass and post-prandial glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allas et al., 2018</xref>). We have demonstrated efficacy of AZP-531 in reducing the growth of breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived cancer cells, consistent with effects of unacylated ghrelin. Based on the data obtained using a panel of breast cancer cell lines and effects seen in patient-derived tumor cells, we also identify the subset of breast cancers that will be resistant to treatment, that is TNBCs with <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, or TNBCs with high MAPK activity. KRAS has been shown to maintain mesenchymal features of TNBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). As less than 1% of breast tumors carry these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tilch et al., 2014</xref>), it is likely that unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531 will be effective in the majority of breast cancers. Since unacylated ghrelin has also been shown to prevent chemotherapy-induced muscle cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nonaka et al., 2017</xref>), there is potential to combine unacylated ghrelin or AZP-531 with chemotherapy, while also reducing cardiotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Human breast cancer tissues and preclinical patient derived xenograft models</title><p>Patient-derived breast tumors (PDX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>]) were obtained from Dr. Giorgio Inghirami and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast tumors were obtained from Dr. Eleni Andreopoulou at Weill Cornell Medicine under IRB-approved protocols (WCM 1410015560 and 1603017108).

Once the tumor reached a volume of 200 mm<sup>3</sup>, the animal was randomized to receive saline (vehicle control) or unacylated ghrelin) via subcutaneous injection for a maximum of 28 days or until tumor size reached 10 mm in any axis, at which point the mice were humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation.</p><p>A syngeneic breast cancer mouse model was created in female FVB/N mice. 1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> J110 cells (obtained from Dr. Myles Brown) were injected into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old ovary-intact FVB (Immunocompetent) mice. Once the tumor reached a volume of 70 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomized to receive saline (vehicle control) or treatment (unacylated ghrelin or AZP-531) via subcutaneous injection. After 7 days of treatment, the mice were humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Additional studies were also performed in NSG mice. MDA-MB-468 (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were injected into the mammary fat pad of 6 week old ovary-intact NSG (immunodeficient) mice. Once the tumor reached a volume of 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomized to receive saline (vehicle control) or AZP-531 via subcutaneous injection. After 28 days of treatment, the mice were humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-14"><title>Measurement of apoptotic cells from xenograft/allograft studies</title><p>MCF7, ZR75 and J110 tumor sections post treatment with 100 μg/kg or 200 μg/kg of unacylated ghrelin were assessed using Hoechst nuclear stain and confocal microscopy. Quantification of cells with apoptotic nuclei was performed using Image J (Fiji).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microarray datasets</title><p>Gene expression profiles from GSE34412 were retrieved via GEO2R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/</ext-link>). Expression profiles were based on a Custom Human Agilent array (GPL8269). GEO2R was used to perform differential gene expression analysis between responders (GSM847888, GSM847905) and non-responders (GSM847901, GSM847893). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to determine regulatory pathways that distinguished between responders and non-responders. Differences in gene expression were consistent with activation of upstream regulator MAPK1 in non-responders <italic>vs.</italic> responders (Z-score 3.888; overlap p-value 3.07E-15), with 86 genes of 144 having measurements consistent with MAPK1 activation. Log expression values corresponding to the MAPK target genes were extracted from GEO2R for each sample. If a gene was represented by more than one probe, the expression value corresponding to the probe with the largest absolute fold-change between responders and non-responders was selected. Genes predicted by IPA to be activated were visualized in a heatmap (expression values were centered and scaled).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed at least twice with n ≥ 3 per experiment and all data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was carried out with software Graph Pad Prism 7. For experiments with multiple comparisons, statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett multiple comparison, where means of each column were compared to the mean of a control column. For experiments with comparison of two independent groups, statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett multiple comparison, where means of each experimental condition were compared to the control. A p-value was reported and significance was classified as p&lt;0.05(*), p≤0.005(**), p≤0.0005(***), p≤0.0001(****), n.s.: not significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R Clarke, J Yun, B Vogelstein, M Brown for providing cell lines.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yi Arial Zeng as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jason Carroll (Reviewer #2); Jeremy Borniger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>In particular, please pay attention to the comments 1-2 by reviewer 1 and comments 1-3 by reviewer 2. While some of these will require additional data, others may be addressed be a careful editing of the conclusions made in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Au et al., by the Brown lab uncovers a new role of unacylated ghrelin (UAG) for breast cancer cell inhibition.

The statement that &quot;UAG caused a significant reduction in the basal-like subset of TNBC cells, but not mesenchymal TNBCs&quot; (subsection “Unacylated ghrelin and cyclic analog AZP-531 inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models and patient-derived tumor cells”) is misleading, so does the labeling of basal and mesenchymal in the figure.

The authors assess the growth inhibitory effects of unacylated ghrelin and ghrelin in a panel of breast cancer cells grown in 3D or 2D, revealing a distinction in the anti-tumor activity in specific models. Unacylated ghrelin was shown to only elicit growth suppressive activity in full media and some work is conducted to show that MCF7 response is blunted in the presence of B-Raf mutants. Some mechanistic work is provided to show that G-alpha-i is a potential mediator of unacylated ghrelin activity in a process that involves cAMP. Additional work is provided to link unacylated ghrelin with the MAPK pathway and some downstream endpoints are explored, with follow-up work showing that unacylated ghrelin mediates its effects via both cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. Finally, in vivo and ex vivo efficacy of unacylated ghrelin and a therapeutic analogue called AZP-531 is explored.</p><p>This is an interesting paper, on a very niche and underexplored hormonal pathway. The paper is well written and the figures are clear and convincing. Overall, the work is well conducted and the conclusions are valid, but a few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>- I understand the rationale behind expressing B-Raf mutants in MCF7 cells to assess the altered response to unacylated ghrelin, but what are the basal physiological effects of this on the MCF7 model? Does it change estrogen dependence or basal cell viability/phenotype? Given that B-Raf mutations are not associated with ER+ disease, forcing a non-relevant mutant into a cell line model, likely has profound basal changes that will confound the experimental questions.</p><p>- In the in vivo experiments, there was no mention of weight loss or potential physiological consequences of giving unacylated ghrelin (or analogues) on normal tissue functioning. Did the authors assess some of the standard 'health' indicators in this experiment?</p><p>- The use of AZP-531 is justified because of improved chemical properties, but the assumption is that all the previous pathway work (on cAMP, MAPK etc) are valid for AZP-531. Is this the case or is there any evidence to support the conclusions that the mechanistic insight derived from unacylated ghrelin is directly applicable to the mode of action for AZP-531? it would be useful if even just one or two of the key functional endpoints explored with unacylated ghrelin, were validated with AZP-531.</p><p>- The start of the Results section was confusing to a non-expert. The text states &quot;The dependence on 3D culture was examined for unacylated ghrelin, where treatment with 100 pM resulted in suppression of cell growth in matrigel and collagen, but not in 2D (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and 1B). At this dose, no effects on MDA-MB-231 cell growth were observed in either 2D or 3D cultures&quot;. It's not clear what cell model the first sentence refers to. I assumed it was the MDA-MB-231 cells, but the first line suggests there is growth inhibition in 3D, but the second sentence suggested there isn't growth inhibition in this cell line model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors examined the effects of unacylated ghrelin (UAG) on breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in xenograft models. This is an important area given the limited amount of research that has been done on the mechanisms of UAG actions on cancer cells. I applaud the authors for systematically characterizing the effects of UAG on cancer cell growth using 3D growth assays as well as many different cell lines with well characterized mutational signatures. Step-by-step inhibitor studies on different components of the cAMP, MAPK, and Akt signaling pathways strongly supports their hypothesis that UAG actions are mediated (at least in part) via a GPCR coupled to Gai. For each of the conclusions presented in the manuscript, several parallel experiments were conducted and for the most part, all of these acted synergistically to support the conclusions drawn from the studies. The paper is also well written and I did not have a problem following the narrative flow. I have no major concerns for the manuscript at this time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Au et al., by the Brown lab uncovers a new role of unacylated ghrelin (UAG) for breast cancer cell inhibition.

As shown below, we have reanalyzed Figure 1D of the manuscript to examine the degree of stimulation by both E2 and FBS in cells transfected with mutant BRAF vs control vector by normalizing data to vehicle control treatment. We believe that this approach provides information related cell behavior, i.e. growth in response to stimuli, while retaining the key message related to response to UAG. As such, we have replaced Figure 1D in the manuscript with the revised Figure. Interestingly, while cells maintain similar response to growth factors (FBS), their response to estradiol is diminished. That said, cells do remain responsive to estradiol and UAG is unable to suppress either the estradiol- or growth factor-stimulated proliferation of mutant BRAF-transfected cells.</p><p>As a further morphological characterization of the cells, we examined the effect of mutant BRAF transfection on nuclear shape.

We had two unacylated ghrelin-treated mice in the MCF7 cell xenograft study assessed by Australian Phenomics Network Histopathology and Organ Pathology, The University of Melbourne, and compared to vehicle control. No abnormalities specific to treatment were identified in Adrenal glands, Bladder, Brain, Cecum, Cervix, Clitoral gland, Colon, Duodenum, Eyes, Gall bladder, Harderian glands, Head, Heart, Hind leg (Long bone, Bone marrow, Synovial joint, Skeletal muscle), Ileum, Jejunum, Kidney, Liver, Lungs, Mesenteric lymph node, Ovaries, Oviducts, Pancreas, Salivary glands and Regional lymph nodes, Skin, Spinal cord, Spleen, Stomach, Tail, Thymus, Thyroids, Trachea, Uterus, and Vagina. These data are consistent with published data showing that unacylated ghrelin and AZP-531 are safe in rodents and humans. The following sentence was added in subsection “Unacylated ghrelin and cyclic analog AZP-531 inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models and patient-derived tumor cells” “Treatment with unacylated ghrelin had no detrimental effect on weight and no abnormalities associated with treatment were observed with histopathology assessment of a subset of mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The use of AZP-531 is justified because of improved chemical properties, but the assumption is that all the previous pathway work (on cAMP, MAPK etc) are valid for AZP-531.

Ongoing studies in the laboratory in relation to characterization of AZP-531 mechanism of action demonstrate that similar to unacylated ghrelin (UAG), AZP-531 can suppress cAMP production from forskolin-stimulated MCF7 cells. We have included these new data (right) as Figure 6D in the manuscript.
