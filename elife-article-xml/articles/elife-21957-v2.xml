reported that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is pivotal for DNA damage-stimulated NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes (Fu et al., 2016). Here we show that Sam68 is critical for genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation in the γ-irradiated colon and animal and that Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation provides radioprotection to colon epithelium in vivo. Sam68 deletion diminishes γ-irradiation-triggered PAR synthesis and NF-κB activation in colon epithelial cells (CECs), thus hampering the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in situ and facilitating CECs to undergo apoptosis in mice post whole-body γ-irradiation (WBIR). Sam68 knockout mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb more rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than the control mice following WBIR. Our results underscore the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB activation signaling in the colon tissue and whole animal and reveal the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic DNA damage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21957.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21957.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sam68</kwd><kwd>KHDRBS1</kwd><kwd>radiodamage</kwd><kwd>NF-κB</kwd><kwd>colon epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Fengyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-13-052-01-MPC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Fengyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wier</surname><given-names>Eric M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Ryan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Fu et al., 2016), we demonstrate the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB signaling in the colon and the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation in colonic cell survival/recovery from extrinsic DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) plays a crucial function in a variety of human disorders, in particular inflammatory diseases and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scheidereit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wan and Lenardo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu and Miyamoto, 2007</xref>). Accumulating evidence highlights an important role of NF-κB signaling pathway in cellular responses to various genotoxic stresses and DNA damage-stimulated NF-κB signaling cascade in the nucleus that leads to NF-κB activation has been recently revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miyamoto, 2011</xref>). In particular, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), inhibitor of NF-κB kinase gamma subunit (IKKγ), protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) were reported to be indispensible for genoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mabb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Piret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, we recently revealed that Sam68/KHDRBS1 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1, encoded by <italic>KHDRBS1</italic> gene), a versatile single-strand nucleic acid binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lukong and Richard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Richard, 2010</xref>), is an important molecule in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB signaling in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, Sam68 is essential for DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and the subsequent polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Sam68 deletion dampens the PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling and transcription of an array of anti-apoptotic genes, thus sensitizing Sam68-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and colon epithelial cells (CECs) in culture to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). The levels of Sam68, PAR, NF-κB activation, and anti-apoptotic molecules B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) are elevated and positively correlated in colon tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue derived from either the tumor-laden <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice or human colon cancer patients. Moreover, downregulation of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colon cancer cells to spontaneous and genotoxic stress-induced cell death and retards colon tumor burden in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that upregulated Sam68 is crucial in orchestrating DNA damage-initiated NF-κB activation signaling in cultured cells and conferring the PAR-dependent NF-κB activation to respond to the intrinsic DNA damage frequently occurred in cancerous cells. However, the in vivo impact of physiological Sam68 levels on extrinsic genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling and activation in normal cells at the organ and even the whole animal levels has not been fully understood.</p><p>Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are extensively used in current-day cancer treatments. It has been recognized that γ-irradiation induced DNA damage triggers rapidly-proliferating tumor cells to undergo apoptosis; whereas non- and slowly-dividing cells rarely die of γ-irradiation. Of note, CECs in colon crypts are among the most rapidly dividing cells in the body, which makes them susceptible to γ-irradiation-induced cell death. Indeed, colon tissue injury remains one of the major adverse effects of radiotherapy, when γ-irradiation is employed to treat colon cancer and other intra-abdominal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Egan et al., 2004</xref>). Although greater antitumor effects could be produced by higher doses of γ-irradiation, the tolerance of patients to the acute side effects caused by γ-irradiation to the colon limits the administered dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Egan et al., 2004</xref>). Given the essential role of DNA damage-induced NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes in cell fate determination post genotoxic stresses, it will be extremely important to understand genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation signaling pathway not only in cancerous cells but also in normal cells under pathophysiological conditions. Besides the recently revealed critical function of Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation to overcome intrinsic DNA damage for the development and survival of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), whether Sam68-dependent NF-κB signaling is crucial in normal colon epithelium in response to extrinsic γ-irradiation remains elusive. We therefore examined the hypothesis that Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation offers an anti-apoptotic response in the γ-irradiated colon epithelium in vivo hence providing radioprotection to the organ and the animal following whole-body γ-irradiation (WBIR).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sam68 confers genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling in the γ-irradiated colon</title><p>To assess the in vivo impact of Sam68 on genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling and transactivation, <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> (Sam68 heterozygote) and <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (Sam68 knockout) mice were subjected to a sublethal dose of WBIR and we examined the γ-irradiation-initiated NF-κB activation signaling cascade in the derived colons at defined times post WBIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, vigorous PAR production, as illustrated by immunofluorescence staining on colon tissue sections, occurred in <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> colon 20 min post WBIR; whereas such an acute response was almost abolished in the colon from <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In support, immunoblot analyses showed that robust PAR chair formation in whole cell lysates of CECs from <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice at 20 min post WBIR, which was markedly tempered in <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice post WBIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that Sam68 is crucial for facilitating genotoxic stress-induced PAR production in the γ-irradiated colon tissue in vivo. Consistently, WBIR-induced p65 phosphorylation, one of the biochemical hallmarks of NF-κB activation, was profound in the CECs from γ-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, but was substantially tempered in <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, WBIR triggered nuclear translocation of p65, as assayed by immunohistostaining and subcellular fractionation, in <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> CECs; whereas p65 nuclear accumulation was greatly attenuated in the γ-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Of note, the levels of PAR, total p65, and nuclear accumulated p65 were comparable in CECs derived from mock-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>), suggesting that Sam68 deletion does not affect the physiological PAR synthesis and NF-κB signaling in the colon without any stimulation. In contrast, Sam68 deletion almost abolished genotoxic stress-triggered PAR formation and the signaling events that lead to NF-κB activation in the colon following WBIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). Consistent with our recent report that Sam68 plays a key role in DNA damage-initiated PAR synthesis and the PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling in the isolated and in vitro cultured CECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), these results further support the crucial function of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-triggered PAR production and signaling to NF-κB activation in the γ-irradiated colon from whole animals in vivo.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21957.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sam68 deletion diminishes genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling in the γ-irradiated colon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the experimental timeline for the impact of Sam68 deletion on DNA damage-induced NF-κB signaling pathway in γ-irradiated mice. <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice subjected to a sublethal dose (6.5 Gy) of whole body γ-irradiation (WBIR) or mock irradiation were euthanized at the indicated periods post WBIR, followed by the analyses as indicated.

In contrast, Caspase-3 cleavage was substantially augmented in the γ-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which correlates with the diminished NF-κB signaling in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and inefficient anti-apoptotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in the absence of Sam68. Moreover, immunoblot analyses of the CEC lysates further ascertained that the elevation in cleaved Caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1, another known biochemical hallmark for apoptosis, occurred in the whole-body γ-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but not <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such an inverse correlation between NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic gene expression and DNA damage-triggered apoptosis underscores the crucial function of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling and transactivation in the γ-irradiated colon epithelium.

Indeed, the colonic morphology, length, and structure of mock-irradiated <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were indistinguishable, suggesting that Sam68 is dispensable for mouse colon development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>).

Sam68 deletion substantially dampens the γ-irradiation-initiated signaling cascade essential for NF-κB activation, which includes PAR synthesis, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation, in the colon derived from mice at various time periods post WBIR. As a consequence, γ-irradiation-induced expression of NF-κB target genes, in particular <italic>Bcl2l1</italic> encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, is remarkably tempered in the colon epithelium from <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, compared to <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> controls. These results are consistent with our prior report that Sam68 deletion diminishes the genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling and NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic gene expression in the cultured MEFs and CECs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, WBIR fosters <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CECs to undertake apoptosis in situ in the colon from <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but not <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> controls, which also mirrors our prior report that <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CECs are hypersensitive to γ-irradiation and other genotoxic stresses in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Our results generated from whole-body γ-irradiated animals, along with our previous reports in the cultured cells, further support the physiological relevance of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB activation signaling in the colon epithelium in response to genotoxic stresses. As elucidated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), knockdown/knockout of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colon cancer cells to undergo spontaneous apoptosis and retards colon tumor development in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice, which highlights the critical role of Sam68-dependent NF-κB transactivation in the cellular responses to the intrinsic DNA damage that occurs frequently in the rapidly-dividing/proliferating cancer cells. We show here that <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than their <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> controls post the extrinsic DNA damage challenge by WBIR. These results, extending additional support to the reported key role of NF-κB in providing radioprotection to the colon epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Egan et al., 2004</xref>), highlight the pathophysiological relevance of the Sam68-dependent NF-κB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic/environmental DNA damage.</p><p>Elevation in Sam68 protein levels has been proposed as a prognostic marker in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), although the exact function of Sam68 in these cancers remains obscure. We recently revealed that Sam68 plays a crucial role in controlling DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation and PAR production; hence Sam68 deficiency dramatically dampens the PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling and DNA repair pathways initiated by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). As a key early signaling regulator that converges at the proxy of the DNA damage-triggered signaling cascade in the nucleus, Sam68 could provide a novel target for cancer therapeutics. In support of this notion, manipulation of Sam68 sensitizes colon cancer to DNA damage-triggered apoptosis in human colon cancer cell lines and retards colon tumor burden in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Besides its crucial role in cancer cells to overcome the frequently-occurred intrinsic DNA damage, our results here demonstrate that Sam68-dependent NF-κB transactivation is pivotal for normal cells in the colon epithelium by executing an important physiological function to prevent the radiodamage to the colon caused by extrinsic/environmental γ-irradiation. The levels of Sam68 proteins in both normal and cancerous colon tissues could be a potential biomarker to facilitate the optimization of the administered dose of γ-irradiation, when employed as a single therapy or combined with other means for cancer treatment, in order to achieve superior outcomes via an elegant balance between the antitumor effects to tumor tissue and the acute side-effects to normal tissue caused by γ-irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed according to protocol number MO16-H285, approved by the Johns Hopkins University’s Animal Care and Use Committee and in direct accordance with the NIH guidelines for housing and care of laboratory animals. <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and their gender-matched littermate <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were produced using heterozygous breeding pairs, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2016</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sam68/KHDRBS1-dependent NF-κB activation confers radioprotection to the colon epithelium in γ-irradiated mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Levens (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a nice follow up of the authors' recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper in which they reported a role for the Sam68 RNA binding protein in NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage in cultured cells. The new data show quite convincingly that in response to whole body irradiation (WBIR) Sam68-/- mice exhibited reduced induction of NF-κB target genes, such as BCl<sup>-</sup>XL, decreased PARylation of nuclear proteins, increased Casp3 cleavage and apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells compared to Sam68+/- mice. They also showed that the absence of Sam68 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of mice dying following WIBR, and concluded that Sam68 is required for protection against colonic damage in response to irradiation.</p><p>This is an important extension of their previous in vitro results, and the data show convincingly that Sam68 has a clear radioprotective role in the colon epithelium in vivo by controlling NF-κB activity.</p><p>Please address the following minor points in a revised version:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors call Sam68 an RNA-binding protein. It would be more correct and proper to call it a single-strand nucleic acid binding protein. This distinction is important as the authors have not yet implicated RNA in the pathway of DNA damage, and so it is entirely possible that the pathway is initiated or involves binding with ssDNA exposed during the damage response at an early stage.</p><p>2) The writing can be improved. It is in places unclear – for example in the Results section, the authors write &quot;…<italic>Khdrbs<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Khdrbs<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)&quot;, but this is not at all what they meant. The two genotypes yield different results; what the authors meant is that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref> report similar conclusions. The paper needs to be carefully re-read for precision and clarity.</p><p>3) The order in which the WT and KO samples are portrayed in the figures is switched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> when compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2. It is suggested that the sample order be rearranged so that it is uniform across all figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21957.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Please address the following minor points in a revised version:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In the Introduction, the authors call Sam68 an RNA-binding protein.
