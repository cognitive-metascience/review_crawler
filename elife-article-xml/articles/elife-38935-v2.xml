There is growing evidence showing that neural systems can efficiently process natural sensory input by matching their tuning properties to natural stimulus statistics, thereby removing redundancy and thus maximizing information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fairhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maravall et al., 2007</xref>). Theory posits that efficient coding is achieved by ensuring that the neural tuning function is inversely proportional to stimulus intensity as a function of frequency, thereby achieving a neural response whose amplitude is independent of frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rieke et al., 1996</xref>). While such ‘whitening’ has been observed across species and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pozzorini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pitkow and Meister, 2012</xref>), the nature of the underlying mechanisms remains unclear.</p><p>Weakly electric fish offer an attractive model system for studying the mechanisms underlying optimized coding of natural stimuli because of well-characterized anatomy and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berman and Maler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chacron et al., 2011</xref>). These fish generate a quasi-sinusoidal signal called the electric organ discharge (EOD) around their body, thereby allowing them to explore the environment and communicate with conspecifics. When two conspecifics are located close (&lt;1 m) to one another, each fish experiences an amplitude modulation of its own EOD (i.e., a beat or first-order) whose amplitude (i.e., envelope or second-order) is a function of the distance and relative orientation between two conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>) (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>) for review). Natural electrosensory envelopes due to movement measured in freely moving animals display scale invariance in that their spectral power decays as a power law as a function of increasing temporal frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>). Weakly electric fish furthermore give robust behavioral responses to movement related envelopes in which the EOD frequency tracks the stimulus’ detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Envelopes and other electrosensory stimuli are sensed by peripheral receptors scattered over the animal’s skin. These project to pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) which in turn project to higher brain structures, thereby giving rise to behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). ELL pyramidal cells also receive large amounts of descending inputs (i.e., feedback) from higher brain centers such as the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) and contact ELL pyramidal cells either directly (i.e., the direct feedback pathway) or indirectly (i.e., the indirect feedback pathway; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berman and Maler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sas and Maler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sas and Maler, 1987</xref>). Pyramidal cell responses to beats and other first-order electrosensory stimuli are well characterized in general (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chacron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marsat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krahe and Maler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang and Chacron, 2017</xref>) for review) and several studies have shown that both direct and indirect feedback inputs play important roles in shaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bastian, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bastian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chacron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chacron et al., 2005</xref>) as well as synthesizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Clarke and Maler, 2017</xref>) these.

However, whether and, if so, how direct and indirect feedback inputs mediate optimized coding of envelopes by ELL pyramidal cells has not been investigated to date.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38935.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Schematic of the experimental setup showing the awake-behaving preparation where a stimulus (left) is presented to the animal while neural (upper middle) and behavioral (upper right) responses are recorded simultaneously.</title><p>The stimuli consisted of amplitude modulations of the animal’s own EOD: shown are an example AM waveform (blue), its envelope (red), and the full signal received by the animal (cyan) with their respective frequency contents.

Peripheral receptors make excitatory synaptic contact with ON-type pyramidal cells (green) within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) and local interneurons (granule cells: GC) that inhibit OFF-type pyramidal cells (blue). All ELL pyramidal cells project to the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS) via the lateral lemniscus (LL), which in turn projects to higher brain areas (black) but also projects back to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP). Stellate cells (St) within nP receive input from TS and project back to ELL pyramidal cells via the tractus stratum fibrosum (TsF). This feedback loop is known as the direct feedback pathway. A subclass of ELL pyramidal cells (deep cells) projects to nP multipolar cells (MP) that, together with several other cell types within nP (not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sas and Maler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sas and Maler, 1987</xref>), in turn project to the Eminentia Granularis posterior (EGp) via the praeeminentialis electrosensory tract (PET). EGp granule cells (not shown) project back to ELL via parallel fibers (PF). This feedback loop is known at the indirect feedback pathway.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-38935-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Here we used a systems level approach to investigate how feedback input mediates optimized processing of natural envelope stimuli by ELL pyramidal cells. Pharmacological inactivation of all sources of descending input strongly reduced pyramidal cell and behavioral responses to envelopes. However, pyramidal cell responses to high envelope frequencies were relatively more attenuated than those to low envelope frequencies, such that the resulting tuning was no longer high-pass but independent of envelope frequency. As a consequence, optimized coding of natural stimuli by temporal whitening was compromised. In contrast, selective inactivation of indirect feedback input strongly increased both pyramidal cell and behavioral sensitivity to envelopes. However, enhancement was primarily seen for low envelope frequencies, such that the resulting pyramidal cell tuning curve was broadband, which also compromised optimized coding of natural stimuli by temporal whitening. Finally, we recorded from two different groups of nP neurons that project either directly or indirectly back to ELL pyramidal cells. nP neurons projecting directly to ELL displayed broadband envelope frequency tuning curves and thus did not perform temporal whitening. In contrast, nP neurons projecting indirectly to ELL displayed high-pass envelope frequency tuning curves that effectively opposed the decaying envelope stimulus spectral power content, thereby enabling temporal whitening. Our results demonstrate clear but distinct functional roles for both direct and indirect feedback pathways in determining how ELL pyramidal cells respond to envelopes. While the direct pathway enhances responses to envelopes independently of frequency, the indirect pathway instead selectively attenuates responses to low frequencies, thereby giving rise to the high-pass tuning that is necessary to optimize coding of natural envelopes via temporal whitening. Interestingly, our results also show that indirect feedback input to ELL is temporally whitened. Our results thus demonstrate an important new function for descending inputs onto sensory neurons in optimizing their responses to natural stimuli and their perception at the organismal level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We investigated the mechanisms that enable ELL pyramidal cells to optimally encode envelope stimuli. To do so, we performed recordings from these in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Data obtained from ON- and OFF-type ELL pyramidal neurons were pooled because, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>), we found no overall difference between their responses to envelopes. Our stimuli consisted of sinusoidal AMs with constant amplitude as well as noisy EOD AMs whose envelope varied sinusoidally at different frequencies. The left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows example traces of the AM (blue, first-order), envelope (red, second-order), and the full signal (cyan) received by the animal with their respective temporal frequency contents. It is further important to realize that the animal’s EOD is a carrier and that the meaningful stimulus here is the EOD AM. Thus, both first- and second-order features of the stimulus correspond to the second- and third-order features of the full signal received by the animal, respectively. We recorded both the neural activity as well as the animal’s behavioral response that consists of changes in the EOD frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows a simplified diagram of the relevant anatomy and circuitry of the electrosensory system. Peripheral receptors make synaptic contact onto ELL pyramidal cells either directly with excitation for ON-type cells or indirectly via local inhibitory interneurons for OFF-type cells. Pyramidal cells are the sole output neurons of the ELL and project to the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS) which in turn projects to higher brain areas. As mentioned above, ELL pyramidal cells receive large amounts of feedback input both directly from nP (direct feedback; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, brown) and indirectly via the Eminentia Granularis posterior (EGp) (indirect feedback; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, orange). As explained above, previous studies have shown that ELL pyramidal cells can optimally encode natural envelope stimuli because their high-pass tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, middle panel) are set to counter the decaying stimulus spectral power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, left panel).

We found that complete feedback inactivation strongly attenuated ELL pyramidal neural responses to envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, compare black and purple). Under control conditions, cells typically responded vigorously to the sinusoidal envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top panel, red) through changes in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel, black). However, after complete feedback inactivation, responses to the envelope were strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel, purple). We next varied the envelope frequency and investigated the effects of complete feedback inactivation on envelope tuning. Under control conditions, the tuning curve of ELL pyramidal cells is high-pass, such that neural gain increases as a power law when envelope frequency is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, black). Further, the power law exponent is set such as to oppose the decay of the spectrum of natural envelopes, thereby causing the response power to be independent of frequency (i.e., is ‘whitened’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black) as quantified by a white index (see methods) value near unity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, left panel, black), which is required for optimal coding. Complete feedback inactivation strongly affected tuning curves as well as temporal whitening. Indeed, we observed a strong attenuation in neural gain for all envelope frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare black and purple). However, the attenuation was more pronounced for higher envelope frequencies, such as the resulting tuning curve was flat as characterized by a power law exponent near zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, purple, see inset). Such a change in tuning strongly affected whitening as response power was no longer independent of frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, purple), as quantified by a lower white index value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, left panel, purple) together with a decrease in neural sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, right panel) indicating sub-optimal coding. These results imply that feedback inputs optimize neural coding of envelopes by enhancing neural responses in a frequency dependent manner. Indeed, higher envelope frequencies are more amplified relative to lower envelope frequencies, thereby whitening neural responses to natural envelopes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38935.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Feedback input enhances and optimizes information transmission via whitening.</title><p>Results are shown before and after complete feedback inactivation was achieved via injection of lidocaine into nP.

Pharmacological inactivation of both direct and indirect sources strongly attenuated pyramidal cell and behavioral responses to envelopes. Because responses to higher envelope frequencies were more attenuated, the resulting tuning curve became independent of frequency, thereby compromising optimized coding through temporal whitening. Pharmacological inactivation of indirect input instead increased pyramidal cell and behavioral responses to envelopes. However, enhancement was observed primarily for low envelope frequencies, such that the resulting tuning curve was independent of frequency, which also compromised optimized coding through temporal whitening. Finally, we investigated the nature of the feedback signals being received both directly and indirectly by ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, nP stellate cells that project directly to ELL displayed tuning curves that were independent of envelope frequency and did not perform temporal whitening. In contrast, nP multipolar cells that project indirectly to ELL displayed high-pass tuning and optimally encoded envelopes through temporal whitening. Thus, our results provide the first experimental evidence showing how descending pathways mediate optimized coding of stimuli by sensory neurons. While direct feedback input enhances neural responses independently of frequency, our results show that indirect feedback input selectively attenuates responses to low envelope frequencies, thereby giving rise to a high-pass tuning that opposes natural envelope statistics and optimizes coding through temporal whitening.</p><p>Our results provide a new function for this feedback pathway by showing that nP stellate cells enhance the responses of ELL pyramidal cells to envelopes. Indeed, while previous studies have suggested that the function of this feedback pathway was to enhance responses to salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berman and Maler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bratton and Bastian, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berman and Maler, 1998</xref>), experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis was lacking until recently when a clear role in synthesizing responses to motion stimuli consisting exclusively of first-order stimulus features was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Clarke and Maler, 2017</xref>). A recent study has furthermore shown that the direct feedback pathway enables neural responses to weak envelope stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metzen et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show an important novel functional role for the direct feedback pathway in enhancing both neural responses to and perception of behaviorally relevant second-order (i.e., envelope) stimuli that is independent of frequency. Interestingly, previous studies have suggested that the direct feedback pathway could function as a sensory searchlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berman and Maler, 1999</xref>), as originally proposed by Crick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crick, 1984</xref>), thereby enhancing salient stimulus features and attenuating others. Our results are consistent with descending input onto ELL pyramidal cells acting in this manner but instead suggest that concerted action from both direct and indirect sources is necessary. Indeed, while the direct pathway enhances responses to envelopes independently of frequency, the indirect pathway instead selectively attenuates responses to low frequencies, thereby favoring responses to higher frequencies.</p><p>Overall, our results are consistent with previous ones showing that the tuning function of ELL pyramidal cells must be matched to natural statistics in order to optimize coding, which in turn ensures that behavioral sensitivity is greatest for frequencies at which natural stimuli contain the most power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). However, we found that feedback inactivation altered ELL pyramidal cell tuning, thereby rendering coding sub-optimal, which caused a mismatch between behavioral sensitivity and natural statistics. However, our results suggest that the relationship between ELL pyramidal cell and behavioral responses to envelopes is more complicated than previously expected. Specifically, it was assumed that changes in the neural exponent of ELL pyramidal cells alone would determine changes in the behavioral exponent. Our current results show that this is not the case as pharmacological inactivation of both direct and indirect feedback input led to similar changes in the neural tuning exponent but led to opposite changes in the behavioral tuning exponent. Thus, it is not only the tuning exponent of ELL pyramidal cells that determines the behavioral exponent, but also the overall sensitivity. Further studies are needed to better understand how information transmitted by ELL pyramidal cells is decoded by higher brain areas in order to lead to behavioral responses.</p><p>Previous results have demonstrated important functions for the indirect feedback pathway such as gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bastian, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian, 1986b</xref>) as well as cancelation of both self and externally-generated low (&lt;15 Hz) frequency spatially diffuse AM (i.e., first-order) stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bastian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chacron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chacron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Clarke and Maler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastian, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian, 1998</xref>), thereby allowing better detection of spatially localized stimuli (e.g., those caused by prey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bastian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, previous studies have shown that this pathway generates a negative image of the stimulus, thereby strongly reducing ELL pyramidal cell responses. More recent studies have shed light on how short-term burst-timing dependent depression helps in sculpting this negative image in an adaptive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bol et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mejias et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, our results have demonstrated an important new function for indirect feedback in mediating optimized coding of envelope (i.e., second-order) stimuli by selectively attenuating responses to low frequencies.</p><p>How then can the same feedback pathway mediate attenuation of responses to both low-frequency AMs and envelopes? One possibility is that in both cases it is the same mechanisms that facilitate response attenuation. This is however unlikely to be the case because of the important difference between the frequency ranges of AMs and envelopes for which responses are attenuated, as mentioned above. Specifically, while the response to a 1 Hz AM will be strongly attenuated by feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bol et al., 2011</xref>), our results show that this is not the case for a 1 Hz envelope. Previous results have shown that SK1 channels strongly determine envelope but not AM tuning properties. Specifically, pharmacological inactivation of SK1 channels gave rise to minimal effects on responses to AMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toporikova and Chacron, 2009</xref>) but compromised optimized coding of envelopes by causing the tuning curve to become broadband (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, the effects of indirect feedback inactivation and of SK1 channel antagonists on ELL pyramidal cell tuning to envelopes were strikingly similar (compare our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>)). We propose that indirect feedback excitation provides the necessary intracellular calcium entry that activates SK1 channels. These in turn give rise to spike frequency adaptation, thereby selectively attenuating responses to low envelope frequencies and causing the envelope tuning curve to become high-pass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benda and Herz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deemyad et al., 2012</xref>) (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang and Chacron, 2017</xref>) for review). Thus, blocking indirect feedback input would strongly attenuate calcium entry via NMDA receptors, thereby effectively inhibiting SK1 channels and explaining why the effects on ELL pyramidal cell tuning to envelopes are similar to those previously observed after application of SK channel antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that calcium-permeable NMDA receptors are highly expressed within the apical dendrites of ELL pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harvey-Girard and Dunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bottai et al., 1997</xref>), where indirect feedback input terminates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berman and Maler, 1999</xref>) and SK1 channels are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ellis et al., 2008</xref>), supports our hypothesis. However, the exact mechanisms by which SK1 channels determine responses to envelopes but not AMs, though critical in order to enable the indirect pathway to perform multiple functions, are not well-understood and should be the focus of future studies. We also note that anatomical studies have shown that multiple cell types within nP project to EGp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sas and Maler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sas and Maler, 1987</xref>). However, with the exception of multipolar cells, the electrophysiological properties of these neurons are unknown to this day. It is very likely that projections from these multiple types underlie the different functions of the indirect feedback pathway but further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>It is important to note that the envelope stimuli considered here are behaviorally relevant and contain important information as to the relative position between both conspecifics. Since our results show that the indirect feedback did not attenuate responses to envelopes with higher (&gt;0.2 Hz) frequencies, it is conceivable that these could interfere with the detection of other behaviorally-relevant low frequency AM stimuli (e.g., those caused by prey) since the responses to both stimuli should be enhanced by the direct feedback pathway. This is unlikely to be the case however because: 1) the AM stimuli caused by prey are spatially localized whereas envelope stimuli are spatially diffuse and; 2) the temporal frequency content of envelopes tends to be much lower (0 – 1 Hz) than that of prey stimuli (0 – 10 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson and Maciver, 1999</xref>). We hypothesize that these differences in spatial extent and temporal frequency content are used by the animal to distinguish between both stimuli, but further studies are needed to verify that this is the case.</p><p>We have shown for the first time how neurons within nP that project either directly or indirectly back to ELL respond to envelopes. Stellate cells projecting directly to ELL pyramidal cells displayed broadband tuning curves. The fact that ELL pyramidal cells displayed broadband tuning curves after pharmacological inactivation of indirect descending input suggests that they perform little filtering of input from stellate cells. Interestingly, multipolar cells projecting indirectly have tuning properties that are similar to those of ELL pyramidal cells and optimize coding via temporal whitening. This result has important implications for understanding how temporal whitening of envelopes occurs in ELL pyramidal cells as it implies that the output of the nP received by EGp granule cells that project back to ELL is temporally whitened. It is very likely that the output of nP multipolar cells, which is critical in determining ELL pyramidal cell tuning and responses to envelopes, undergoes significant filtering both by EGp granule cells to enable filtering by SK1 channels in ELL pyramidal cells. Further studies are needed to gain further understanding as to the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Our results provide novel functional roles for the indirect feedback pathway in optimizing ELL pyramidal cell responses to envelopes through temporal whitening by selective attenuation of low frequencies. It should be noted that the architecture of the indirect feedback pathway by which parallel fibers emanating from the EGp terminate onto distal ELL pyramidal cell apical dendrites shares many similarities with the cerebellum and other cerebellum-like structures (e.g., the dorsal cochlear nucleus). Studies performed in cerebellum as well as cerebellum-like structures have shown clear common functions and mechanisms mediating how such descending input in attenuating or even cancelling responses to self-generated sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cullen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Requarth and Sawtell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warren and Sawtell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sawtell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singla et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that our results showing that feedback input from parallel fibers in the cerebellar-like ELL mediate optimized coding of natural stimuli through whitening will be applicable to the cerebellum as well as other cerebellum-like structures.</p><p>Finally, recent results have emphasized the critical role of descending pathways, which are found ubiquitously in sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cajal, 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holländer, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ostapoff et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sherman and Guillery, 2002</xref>), in determining accurate sensory neural and behavioral responses to sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, it was shown that feedback terminating on the apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons was essential in determining both responses and perception to somatosensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Critically, the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish displays many documented similarities with the mammalian visual, auditory, and vestibular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chacron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, given that temporal whitening has been observed across sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pozzorini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundstrom et al., 2010</xref>), it is likely that our results showing how feedback pathways mediate temporal whitening of sensory input by ELL pyramidal cells in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish will be generally applicable to other systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The wave-type weakly electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> was used exclusively in the present study. Fish were supplied by tropical fish suppliers and were housed in groups of 2 – 10 at appropriate water temperatures and water conductivities similar to their natural habitats according to published guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hitschfeld et al., 2009</xref>).

Experiments were performed in a tank (30 cm x 30 cm x 10 cm) filled with the fish’s home tank water. The fish were respired using a constant flow of 10 mL/min of oxygenated water over its gills for the duration of the experiment. A 2 mm<sup>2</sup> hole was then exposed over either the hindbrain and/or midbrain near T0 to gain access to either ELL pyramidal neurons or nP neurons respectively for electrophysiology and/or drug injection. Bilateral exposure of the brain was performed for experiments requiring bilateral drug injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stimulation</title><p>The electric organ discharge of <italic>A. leptorhynchus</italic> is neurogenic, and therefore is not affected by injection of curare. All stimuli consisting of AMs of the animal’s own EOD were produced by triggering a function generator to emit one cycle of a sine wave for each zero crossing of the EOD as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bastian et al., 2002</xref>). The frequency of the emitted sine wave was set slightly higher (30 – 40 Hz) than that of the EOD, which allowed the output of the function generator to be synchronized to the animal’s discharge. The emitted sine wave was subsequently multiplied with the desired AM waveform (MT3 multiplier; Tucker Davis Technologies), and the resulting signal was isolated from ground (A395 linear stimulus isolator; World Precision Instruments). The isolated signal was then delivered through a pair of chloridized silver wire electrodes placed 15 cm away from the animal on either side of the recording tank perpendicular to the fish’s rostro-caudal axis. Depending on polarity, the isolated signal either added or subtracted from the animal’s own discharge. The resultant signals which arrives at the fish’s skin was approximated using a dipole with 1 mm of distance between the two poles to simulate what the electroreceptors would pick up.</p><p>Both neural and behavioral experiments utilized stimuli consisting of a 5 – 15 Hz noise (4<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth) carrier waveform (i.e., AM) whose amplitude was further modulated (i.e., envelope) at frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 1 Hz, a behaviorally relevant range of frequencies which mimicked the envelope signals due to relative movement between two fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>). The depth of modulation for the envelope was approximately 20% of the baseline EOD amplitude as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Metzen and Chacron, 2017</xref>). This was confirmed using the dipole recording mentioned above.</p><p>We note that movement envelopes, which are the focus of the current study, are fundamentally different than so-called ‘social’ envelopes that are instead due to interaction between the EODs of three of more fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>) and which have been the focus of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Middleton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stamper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Savard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGillivray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, for social envelopes, the frequency content of the envelope is mostly determined by the frequencies of the three EODs. This is because the envelope frequency is given by the difference between the two resulting beat frequencies. In contrast, for movement envelopes occurring during interactions between two conspecifics, the envelope frequency content is not determined by the two EOD frequencies or the resulting beat frequency. Rather, it is determined solely by the relative movements of both fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>). We further note that field studies have shown that Apteronotid species tend to encounter movement envelopes much more frequently than social envelopes: this is because they tend to be found in groups of 2 much more frequently than in groups of 3+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stamper et al., 2010</xref>). It is expected that social envelopes will be more relevant for weakly electric fish species that tend to be more gregarious (e.g., <italic>Eigenmannia virescens</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>The composition of the vehicle/control saline was as follows: (all chemicals were obtained from Sigma): 111 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The pH of the saline solution was 6.8. Glutamate (Sigma), lidocaine (Astra Pharmaceuticals) and CNQX 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, Sigma) were dissolved in saline for application as done before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>). Drug application electrodes were made using either two-barrel KG-33 glass micropipettes (OD 1.5 mm, ID 0.86 mm, A-M Systems) pulled by a vertical micropipette puller (Stoelting Co.) or single barrel pipettes to a fine tip and subsequently broken to attain a tip diameter of ~5 μm for each barrel.</p><p>The two barrel pipettes were used for separate application of either lidocaine (1 mM) or CNQX (1 mM), as well as glutamate (1 mM) or saline. In order to block the indirect feedback, we injected CNQX into the ELL in proximity of a pyramidal neuron we were recording from, which we confirmed by using the excitatory response to glutamate application, as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>). We also blocked the indirect feedback pathway by injecting lidocaine into the praeeminential electrosensory tract (PET) (behavior: bilateral; neurons: ipsilateral) projecting to the ipsilateral EGp rostral to ELL, as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian, 1986b</xref>). We then compared ELL neural and behavioral responses before and after injection. In order to block both the direct and indirect feedback pathways, we instead inserted two pipettes containing lidocaine into both the ipsilateral and contralateral nPs. Again, both ELL neural and behavioral responses were compared before and after injection. Bilateral injections of lidocaine were performed in order to completely silence the respective feedback pathways to directly observe the effect on neural responses and behavior, as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>). In some cases, lidocaine was injected into the contralateral nP while recording from a pyramidal cell within the ipsilateral ELL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Saline controls were performed in the nP and we observed that there was no effect of the microinjection itself on either electrophysiology or behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> ). All pharmacological injections were performed using a duration of 130 ms at 103 – 138 kPa using a Picospritzer (General Valve).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>We used well-established techniques to perform extracellular recordings with Woods metal electrodes from pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frank and Becker, 1964</xref>) located within the lateral segment of the ELL based on recording depth and mediolateral placement of the electrode on the brain surface as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krahe et al., 2008</xref>). We recorded pyramidal cells for control in conjunction with their responses after either lidocaine (nP injections: n = 7; PET injections: n = 9), CNQX (n = 8), or saline (n = 8) injections. In addition, by tailoring the tip shape of our Woods metal electrodes, we also performed extracellular recordings from nP stellate (n = 11) and multipolar cells (n = 8) in the midbrain. We confirmed the identity of each cell type based on recording depth, spontaneous baseline firing rates, and AM tuning curves (Figure 6 - figure supplement 1). While stellate cells have low spontaneous firing rates (1.37 ± 0.42 Hz) and do not respond to high AM frequencies, multipolar cells have high spontaneous firing rates (55.53 ± 8.05 Hz and do respond well to high AM frequencies &gt; 32 Hz. These results match the results found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian and Bratton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bratton and Bastian, 1990</xref>), confirming our recordings were appropriate. All recordings were digitized at 10 kHz sampling rate using CED 1401 plus hardware and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) and stored on a computer hard disk for offline analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavior</title><p>Animals were immobilized by an intramuscular injection of 0.1 – 0.5 mg tubocurarine and set up in the recording tank similarly to the method described above. Different surgeries were performed depending on the pharmacology protocol. Both nPs or both ELLs were exposed on either side of the head in order to bilaterally inject lidocaine (nP injection: n = 9; PET injection: n = 8), saline (n = 8) or CNQX (n = 7), respectively. Pipettes containing lidocaine/saline were placed approximately 1000 – 1250 μm below the surface where the nP is located, while pipettes containing CNQX were placed superficially at about 200 – 300 μm below the surface of the hindbrain where the EGp feedback terminates on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. Additionally, lidocaine injections were performed 50 – 100 μm below the brain surface adjacent to the rostral end of the ELL, where the PET is located terminating on the EGp, in order to block indirect feedback. Multiple injections (typically 3 – 5) were performed to ensure that both hemispheres of nP and ELL were sufficiently affected by the pharmacological agents. Stimuli were then presented as described above in order to elicit behavioral responses before and after drug application. The animal’s behavior was recorded through a pair of electrodes located at the rostrum and tail of the animal. The zero-crossings of the recorded EOD signal were used to generate a binary sequence as described above that was low-pass filtered (2nd order Butterworth filter with 0.05 Hz cut-off frequency) to obtain the time-varying EOD frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data obtained from ELL pyramidal neurons were pooled as there is no difference in envelope response between ON- and OFF-type pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>). All data analysis was performed offline using custom written codes in MATLAB software (MathWorks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). The recorded potentials were first high-pass filtered (100 Hz; 8th order Butterworth). Spike times were sorted using Spike2 software and defined as the times at which the signal crossed a given threshold value from below. To quantify the neural responses and relate them to the stimulus envelope, we used linear systems identifications techniques to compute the gain relationships to envelope frequency. We approximated the gain by averaging over the cycles of the stimulus and fitting a sinewave to the resultant cycle histogram to determine the firing rate modulation. We then divided the amplitude of the firing rate modulation to the stimulus envelope amplitude observed in the dipole to obtain the gain to any given envelope frequency. Our filtered firing rates were obtained using a second-order Butterworth filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.2, 0.35, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 Hz for envelope frequencies 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 Hz, respectively, as done in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>). Gain values calculated for behavior was performed using similar methods.</p><p>Responses to AMs were calculated using standard techniques by determining the spike-triggered average (STA) change in amplitude of the AM stimuli. The STA is the mean stimulus waveform that triggers an action potential and was obtained by averaging the stimulus waveforms within a 2 s time window surrounding each spike. We used the same envelope stimuli containing 5 – 15 Hz AM in order to calculate our STAs and determine the response to AMs. The response was then quantified as the peak-to-peak amplitude of each STA change in amplitude and was compared before and after drug application. We then quantified the change before and after drug application as a percentage of control, where the control STA was normalized to 100%.</p><p>Temporal whitening performed by ELL pyramidal neurons and nP neurons were calculated based on their observed tuning properties by squaring the gain at a given envelope frequency and multiplying it by the power of the natural stimulus whose spectrum decays as a power law with exponent α = −0.8. The result provided us with an accurate estimation of the response power of the neuron across the range of frequencies we investigated. Indeed, previous studies have shown that an accurate approximation of the response power spectrum could be correctly predicted using the tuning function with this transfer function, as a change in the tuning curve of the neuron directly caused changes in the response power experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>). From the temporal whitening response power curves, the whitening index was calculated by taking the area under the power spectrum curve of the spiking response using a trapezoidal method and dividing by that obtained by replacing all values by the maximum value in the power spectrum. The whitening index ranges between 0 and 1, where one indicates complete whitening (i.e., a power spectrum that is independent of temporal frequency), as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the change in sensitivity between control and/or drug conditions was calculated using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi> <mml:mi/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula>where G<sub>Drug</sub> is the gain response of the neuron after drug injection at a given envelope frequency and G<sub>Control</sub> is the gain response of the neuron under control conditions at the same given envelope frequency.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Len Maler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The main strength of the manuscript is the insight into mechanisms whereby sensory neurons match their tuning properties to natural stimulus statistics.</p><p>The manuscript extends previous published work on the role of feedback to the first order electrosensory lobe (ELL) of a gymnotiform weakly electric fish. Previous work emphasized the response of ELL pyramidal cells to first order modulations (AMs) of the amplitude of the electric field produced by the sinusoidal electric organ discharge (EOD). A direct feedback pathway enhances responses to local AMs, i.e., those produced by objects causing AMs over a restricted portion of the body surface. The indirect feedback pathway attenuates the responses to the global low frequency AMs and thus prevents interference with prey detection. The novel contribution of this manuscript is that both feedback pathways also control the pyramidal cell responses to envelope signals. This is surprising because, not only are such signals detected via different neural mechanisms than AM signals, but their frequency content is mostly very low. The authors also show the effects on behavior and record from the cells that give rise to the direct and indirect pathways.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major issues with the manuscript appear to be with presentation. As one reviewer wrote &quot;if the Introduction clearly (and simply) gave the relevant background, the rest of the manuscript would be much easier to follow.&quot;</p><p>2) The regular and supplemental figures are intermixed (and sometimes repetitive). There is a lot of overlap between panels of different figures. Often the differences are difficult to see at first, it appears that at least three figures have half of the panels in common. Only after careful consideration one finds subtle differences between panels. The figures should be carefully re-evaluated.</p><p>3) It would be good to provide a concise summary of the anatomy rather than adding circuit descriptions piece by piece. For example, the authors mention that there are two different groups of nP neurons in the last paragraph of the Introduction, the notation for nP is clarified, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Descending input shapes neural responses and perception of envelopes”, as referring to the nuclei praeeminentialis, and the specific cell types are introduced in the subsection “Responses of nP neurons that give rise to descending input onto ELL pyramidal cells”. Also, more specifically in the sentences &quot;the former displayed broadband envelope frequency tuning curves.…&quot; and &quot;the latter displayed high-pass envelope frequency tuning curves.…&quot; it is ambiguous what former/latter refers to, because it could refer to nP/ELL cells or cells providing direct/indirect feedback.</p><p>4) The Introduction meanders between the discussion of how envelopes are represented, the contribution of SK1 channel, and feedback. The properties of SK1 channels are discussed in the Introduction but the interaction with feedback is only explained in the Discussion. The Introduction just sets them up as different and unrelated mechanisms for implementing optimal coding. This initially lends the impression that the present study contradicts previous published works by the authors.</p><p>5) A reviewer points out that stellate cells may be the only source of the direct feedback pathway. On the other hand, there are a number of nP neurons that project to the EGp and therefore contribute electrosensory input to the indirect feedback pathway. The authors should make clear that there are multiple nP cells that project to EGp and that therefore will contribute to the many effects of this complex feedback system. The multipolar cell does not respond very effectively to either low frequency global signals or object motion (local stimuli) and, as the authors show, it is well suited for modulation of envelope responses. The authors could put in one or two simple sentences just to make clear that the various functions of the indirect feedback pathway may be based on the multiplicity of nP cells projecting to EGp.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38935.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major issues with the manuscript appear to be with presentation.
