This behavioral inhibition critically relies on frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits. Within the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) has been hypothesized to mediate selective proactive inhibition: being prepared to stop a specific action, if needed. Here we investigate population dynamics of rat GPe neurons during preparation-to-stop, stopping, and going. Rats selectively engaged proactive inhibition towards specific actions, as shown by slowed reaction times (RTs). Under proactive inhibition, GPe population activity occupied state-space locations farther from the trajectory followed during normal movement initiation. Furthermore, the state-space locations were predictive of distinct types of errors: failures-to-stop, failures-to-go, and incorrect choices. Slowed RTs on correct proactive trials reflected starting bias towards the alternative action, which was overcome before progressing towards action initiation. Our results demonstrate that rats can exert cognitive control via strategic adjustments to their GPe network state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral inhibition</kwd><kwd>stop-signal</kwd><kwd>globus pallidus</kwd><kwd>neural population dynamics</kwd><kwd>stopping</kwd><kwd>movement initiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH101697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA045783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS078435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rats can pre-position the state of their basal ganglia neural networks to adaptively influence their subsequent response to a Go signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our capacity for self-restraint is critical for adaptive behavior. Dysfunctions in behavioral inhibition are involved in many human disorders, including drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ersche et al., 2012</xref>). A standard test of behavioral inhibition is the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Logan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verbruggen et al., 2019</xref>), in which subjects attempt to respond rapidly to a Go cue, but withhold responding if the Go cue is quickly followed by a Stop cue. The stop-signal task has been invaluable for revealing specific cortical-basal ganglia mechanisms involved in both movement initiation (‘Going’; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanes and Schall, 1996</xref>) and inhibition (‘Stopping’; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eagle et al., 2008</xref>). ‘Reactive’ inhibition – making quick use of a Stop cue – appears to involve at least two distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>): a rapid Pause process mediated via the subthalamic nucleus (STN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>) followed by a Cancel process achieved through pallidostriatal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral inhibition can also be ‘proactive’: restraint of actions, in advance of any Stop cue. Proactive inhibition may be particularly relevant to human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas reactive inhibition typically involves a global, transient arrest of actions and thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wessel and Aron, 2017</xref>), proactive inhibition can be selectively directed to a particular action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). A key behavioral signature of proactive inhibition is slowing of reaction times (RTs) for that action, when the anticipated Stop cue does not actually occur (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chikazoe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zandbelt et al., 2013</xref>). This overt behavioral signature presumably relies on covert shifts in information processing, yet the nature of these shifts is unclear. In some studies, fitting of models to behavioral data has suggested that slowed RTs reflect raising of a decision ‘threshold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahfari et al., 2012</xref>), but other studies have found evidence for a slower rate of progression toward threshold instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunovan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The neural circuit mechanisms by which proactive control is achieved are also not well understood. It has been proposed that proactive inhibition critically depends on the basal ganglia ‘indirect’ pathway via GPe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunovan et al., 2015</xref>). Yet clear support for this hypothesis is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Majid et al., 2013</xref>). There have been few electrophysiological studies of proactive inhibition at the level of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pouget et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>), and to our knowledge none in GPe. We therefore targeted GPe (often called simply GP in rodents) for investigating neural mechanisms of proactive control.</p><p>We also wished to integrate a dynamical systems approach into the study of behavioral inhibition, and the basal ganglia. Analysis of the collective dynamics of motor cortex neurons has provided insights into various aspects of movement control, including how brain networks may prepare actions without prematurely triggering them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>), and the origins of RT variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>). We demonstrate below that the analysis of GPe population activity can reveal distinct covert strategies underlying overt manifestations of proactive control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Action initiation is slower when a stop cue is expected</title><p>We trained rats in a modified version of our stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>). Freely-moving rats poked their noses into a hole and maintained that position for a variable delay (500–1250 ms) before presentation of one of two Go cues (1 kHz or 4 kHz tone), instructing leftward or rightward movements respectively into an adjacent hole. If initiated rapidly (RT limit &lt;800 ms), correct movements triggered delivery of a sugar pellet reward from a separate food hopper. On some trials the Go cue was quickly followed by a Stop cue (white noise burst), indicating that the rat instead needed to maintain its nose in the starting hole (for a total of 800 ms after Go cue onset) to trigger reward delivery. The delay between Go and Stop cue onsets (100–250 ms) ensured that stopping was sometimes successful and sometimes not. As expected, Failed Stop (error) trials had similar RTs to the faster part of the Go trial RT distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is consistent with the basic ‘race’ conceptual model of reactive inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Logan et al., 1984</xref>): failures-to-stop typically occur when an underlying Go process evolves more quickly than average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>), and thus wins the race against a separate Stop process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reactive and Proactive Behavioral Inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, operant box configuration; right, event sequence for Go and Stop trials.

Failed-Stop RTs are similar to the faster part of the Go RT distribution, consistent with the ‘race’ model in which a relatively-fast Go process produces failures to stop. The tail of the Failed-Stop distribution (RT &gt;500 ms) is presumed to reflect trials for which rats successfully responded to the Stop cue, but then failed to maintain holding until reward delivery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayse et al., 2014</xref>).

Additionally, under selective proactive inhibition rats were more likely to fail to respond quickly enough (RT limit errors; Wilcoxon signed rank tests, z = 7.2, p=5.41 × 10<sup>−13</sup>) and to select the wrong choice (uncued action direction; Wilcoxon signed rank tests, z = 7.0, p=2.59 × 10<sup>−12</sup>).

The three possible starting holes were associated with different Stop cue probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): no possibility of Stop cue; 50% probability that a left Go cue (only) will be followed by the Stop cue; or 50% probability that a right Go cue (only) will be followed by the Stop cue. Our index of proactive inhibition was a preferential increase in RT for the Maybe-Stop direction, compared to the No-Stop conditions. Among rats that began learning this task variant, approximately half acquired clear proactive inhibition within 3 months of training (see Materials and methods), and were thus considered eligible for electrode implantation. Here we report behavioral and neural results for six rats for which we were able to obtain high-quality GP recordings as rats engaged proactive control.</p><p>We selected for further analysis those behavioral sessions (n = 63) with a significant proactive inhibition effect (i.e. longer RT when a Stop cue might occur; one-tail Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;0.05) and distinct GP single units (n = 376 neurons included). Prior work has shown particular basal ganglia involvement in the control of contraversive orienting-type movements (i.e. directed towards the opposite side; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carli et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leventhal et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore focused on proactive control of movements contraversive (‘contra’) to the recorded cell locations; for example we included a left GPe cell only if the rat demonstrated proactive control for rightward movements during that recording session. For included sessions, median RT for correct contra movements was 251 ms when the Stop cue could not occur (No-Stop), and 385 ms when the Stop cue could occur (Maybe-Stop) but did not. Results from all sessions, and from individual animals, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>RT slowing due to proactive inhibition was highly selective to the Maybe-Stop direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; for Maybe-Stop-Contra trials without a Stop cue, median ipsiversive (‘ipsi’) RT was unslowed at 264 ms). The Maybe-Stop condition was also associated with an increase in errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in particular not responding quickly enough to the Go cue that might be followed by Stop (RT limit error; RT &gt;800 ms) and making the wrong choice (incorrect action selection).

However, contrary to our hypothesis, we were not able to identify a clear subgroup of individual neurons that strongly and persistently distinguished between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Yet there have been extended debates about which psychological and neural mechanisms support proactive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leunissen et al., 2016</xref>). We have demonstrated here that a key behavioral signature of proactive control – selective slowing of RTs when a Stop signal is expected - can arise through multiple covert strategies. These are visible as changes to the dynamic state of GPe by the time of Go cue presentation, and include a bias towards an alternative action, and/or starting further from the ‘point-of-no-return’ in action initiation.</p><p>Which internal strategies are employed for proactive inhibition is likely influenced by the specific experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). For example, we used a brief limited hold period (800 ms) to encourage subjects to respond rapidly to the Go cue rather than waiting to see if the Stop cue is presented. This time pressure may have led rats to sometimes make guesses as to which cues will be presented, and position their neural state accordingly. We also used a task design with asymmetric (ipsi/contra) stop probabilities, to probe the selectivity of proactive inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aron and Verbruggen, 2008</xref>). Motivational aspects are known to be important in proactive inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer and Bucci, 2016</xref>): the ipsi bias we observed on the Selection axis on Maybe-Stop (contra) trials may partly reflect asymmetric reward expectancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>), simply because ipsi movements are more consistently rewarded from that state. Unlike human subjects, we cannot verbally instruct rats to perform the task in a certain way (although human cognitive strategies do not always follow experimenter intentions either). It might seem simpler, and less error-prone, for the rats to just select from the slower portion of their regular RT distribution. We suggest that they are unable to consistently do so, given the high spontaneous variability in RTs. The degree to which specific neural strategies are employed may also vary between rats; we found some preliminary evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), though investigating this further would require more animals and more recorded cells in each animal.</p><p>The term ‘proactive’ or ‘cognitive’ control has been used to refer both to stop-signal tasks like this one, in which subjects are cued about the upcoming stop probability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahfari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zandbelt et al., 2013</xref>), and also to uncued behavioral adjustments that subjects make after each trial (e.g. longer RTs following trials in which Stop cues occurred; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pouget et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayse et al., 2014</xref>). Although not the focus of this study, our rats did slow down slightly on average after Stop trials or errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This slowing was associated with a modest shift on the Initiation Axis in the same, movement-opposed direction as in our main results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), but this effect did not reach significance. Thus both behavioral and neural data suggest that the cued component of proactive inhibition was substantially greater than post-trial adjustments under our particular task conditions.</p><p>Our ability to reveal distinct strategies for proactive inhibition relies on a dynamical systems approach with single-cell resolution. This method may be especially important for deciphering structures like GP, where projection neurons show continuous, diverse activity patterns. As intermingled GP neurons increased and decreased firing at each moment, the resulting network state changes would likely be undetected using aggregate measures such as photometry or fMRI. Speculatively, we suggest that an enhanced ability to make subtle adjustments to dynamical state may be part of the reason why GP projection neurons show high spontaneous activity, in contrast to (for example) the near-silence of most striatal projection neurons, most of the time.</p><p>Prior examinations of motor/premotor cortical dynamics during reaching movements in non-human primates have demonstrated distinct neural dimensions for movement preparation and execution (‘<italic>What</italic>’ to do) and movement triggering (‘<italic>When</italic>’ to do it) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>). Our Selection and Initiation axes are analogous, although our task lacks an explicit preparation epoch and has only two action choices (left vs. right). One notable difference in the non-human primate studies is that movement preparation occurred in distinct, orthogonal dimensions to movement execution, whereas we saw preparatory ‘bias’ along the same Selection axis that differentiated ipsi and contra trajectories during movement itself. Nonetheless, our observation that on correct Maybe-Stop trials, GP state evolved first along the Selection axis is consistent with evidence that movement preparation and movement initiation can be independent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thura and Cisek, 2017</xref>), and that these can be differentially modulated by the basal ganglia and dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leventhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manohar et al., 2015</xref>).

In standard, firing rate-based models of basal ganglia function, GPe activity restrains actions by preventing pauses in the firing of basal ganglia output, that are in turn required to disinhibit movement-related activity in the brainstem and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chevalier and Deniau, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, it is well-recognized that this model is too simple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurney et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>), and it does not account for the complex activity patterns within GPe that we and others have observed. For example, a straightforward application of the rate model might predict a systematic decrease in GPe firing rate with proactive inhibition, but we did not observe this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with the possible exception of trials with RT limit errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the current results, examining dimension-reduced population dynamics is a promising alternative approach for deciphering how subtle modulations in the firing of many basal ganglia neurons are coordinated to achieve behavioral functions.</p><p>At the same time, our study has several noteworthy limitations. Our reduction of complex dynamics to movement along Initiation and Selection axes is obviously a simplification. We did not record large populations of neurons simultaneously, which precludes effective analysis of neural dynamics on individual trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>). We did not classify GPe neurons by projection target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecassis et al., 2020</xref>) largely because we did not consistently record sleep data to enable that classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>). We do not yet know the extent to which these population dynamics are shared with upstream (e.g. striatum) and downstream (e.g. substantia nigra pars reticulata) structures, which will be essential for elucidating how these dynamic changes actually influence behavior. Finally, we have not yet determined how the population dynamics reported here relate (if at all) to oscillatory dynamics reported in cortical-basal ganglia circuits during movement suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>) and in pathological states such as Parkinson’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2007</xref>). These are all worthy subjects for future investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Key resources</title><p>Rat (adult, male, Long-Evans, bred in-house).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee for the Use and Care of Animals. Adult male Long-Evans rats were housed on a 12 hr/12 hr reverse light-dark cycle, with training and testing performed during the dark phase.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>Operant chambers (Med Associates, Fairfax VT) had five nose-poke holes on one wall, a food dispenser on the opposite wall, and a speaker located above the food port. The basic rat stop signal task has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). At the start of each trial, one of the three more-central ports was illuminated (‘Light On’) indicating that the rat should poke in that port (‘Center In’) and wait. After a variable delay (500–1250 ms), a higher (4 kHz) or lower (1 kHz) pitch tone was presented for 50 ms (‘Go Cue’), instructing a move to the adjacent port on the left or right side respectively. In Go trials (those without a Stop cue) if the rat left the initial center port (‘Center Out’) within 800 ms of Go cue onset, and then moved to the correct side port (‘Side In’) within 500 ms, a sugar pellet reward was delivered to the food dispenser with an audible click. As the rat left the center port, the center port light was turned off and both side port lights turned on. On Stop trials, the Go cue was followed by a Stop cue (white noise, 125 ms) with a short delay (the stop-signal delay, SSD). The SSD was randomly selected on each trial within a range (uniform distribution) of 100–200 ms (four rats) or 100–250 ms (two rats). Stop trials were rewarded if the rat maintained its nose continuously within the start hole for a total of 800 ms after Go cue onset. Stop trials in which the rat initiated movement before the Stop cue began were converted into Go trials (i.e. no Stop cue was presented). Failed-Stop trials with RT &gt;500 ms were excluded from electrophysiological analyses, since these were presumed to reflect trials for which rats successfully responded to the Stop cue, but then failed to maintain holding until reward delivery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayse et al., 2014</xref>). Inter-trial intervals were randomly selected between 5 and 7 s. For included sessions, the median number of Go trials was 266 (range, 167–361) and the median number of Stop trials was 57 (range, 27–95).</p><p>To vary proactive inhibition, we changed the Stop cue probabilities between starting holes (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The spatial mapping of probabilities was constant for each rat across sessions, but varied between rats. Within each session, the same start hole (and thus proactive condition) was repeated for 10–15 trials at a time. After ~3 months of training, rats showing consistent reaction time differences between Maybe-Stop and No-Stop conditions were eligible for electrode implantation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>We report GP data from six rats (all animals in which we successfully recorded GP neurons during contraversive proactive inhibition). Each rat was implanted with 15 tetrodes (configured as independently-driveable bundles of 2–3 tetrodes, each within a polyimide tube with outer radius 140 µm), bilaterally targeting GP and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). During task performance, wide-band (0.1–9000 Hz) electrophysiological data were recorded with a sampling rate of 30000/s using an Intan RHD2000 recording system (Intan Technologies). All signals were initially referenced to a skull screw (tip-flattened) on the midline 1 mm posterior to lambda. For spike detection we re-referenced to an electrode common average, and wavelet-filtered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiltschko et al., 2008</xref>) before thresholding. For spike sorting we performed automatic clustering units using MountainSort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) followed by manual curation of clusters. Tetrodes were usually moved by 159 µm every 2–3 sessions. To avoid duplicate neurons we did not include data from the same tetrode across multiple sessions unless the tetrode had been moved by &gt;100 µm between those sessions. Based on waveform and firing properties we further excluded an additional 25 units that appeared to be duplicates even though the tetrode had been moved. After recording was complete, we anesthetized rats and made small marker lesions by applying 10 µA current for 20 s for one or two wires of each tetrode. After perfusing the rats and slicing (at 40 µm) tissue sections were stained with cresyl violet and compared to the nearest atlas section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paxinos, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Smoothed firing rates were obtained by convolving each spike time with a Gaussian kernel (30 ms SD). Firing rates were normalized (<italic>Z</italic>-scored) using the neuron’s session-wide mean and SD. Normalized average time series for contra and ipsi actions (500 ms each, around Center Out) were concatenated and used to construct a population activity matrix <bold>R</bold> = TC by N, with T = 251 (timepoints, at 2 ms intervals), C = 2 (ipsi/contra conditions), and N = 376 (the number of neurons). We subtracted the mean of each of the N columns to make data zero-centered, then performed principal components analysis (PCA) over matrix <bold>R</bold> using the MATLAB ‘svd’ function. Using the right singular vectors (<italic>W</italic>), we can calculate the PC scores (<italic>S</italic>) as <italic>S</italic> = <bold>R</bold><italic>W</italic>. For example, the first column of <italic>S</italic> contains the first principal component (PC1) over time, and the first column of <italic>W</italic> contains the weights for each of the N units for PC1. We used the first 10 PCs for analysis, and the Euclidean distance between conditions was compared in this 10-D space. The projections onto the Initiation or Selection Axes were calculated as the dot product of the state space position vector and the axis vector. State-space positions around the Go cue (or Stop cue) were calculated using the set of weights <italic>W</italic> to project the Go cue–aligned (or Stop cue-aligned) firing rates into the 10-D PC space. In other words, each neuron has a weight for each PC, and we calculate a net population position along each PC by multiplying each neuron’s instantaneous firing rate by its weight, and summing across all neurons.</p><p>To test if whether state-space positions for two conditions (e.g. Successful- and Failed-Stops) are significantly separated, we ran permutation tests by randomly shuffling the trial conditions for each neuron (10000 shuffles for each test). Then, the distance in the population state space at each time point was reconstructed using the firing rate differences between the shuffled trial averages for each condition. For example, if the mean FR of a unit (n) in surrogate Failed Stop trials (c1) and surrogate Successful Stop trials (c2) at Stop cue time (t) is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively, the difference between two conditions in k-dimension, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Repeated shuffling produces a surrogate data distribution for differences at each time point, and the original difference between conditions is compared to this distribution to determine statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Michael Farries and Ali Mohebi for technical advice, Wei Wei and Vikaas Sohal for comments on the manuscript, and Alejandro Jimenez Rodriguez for discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Daeyeol Lee as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is “in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>”. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have recorded the activity of neurons in the rat globus pallidus (GPe) while the animal performed a stop-signal task. The goal of this study was to examine the possible contribution of GPe in proactive inhibitory control whereby the animal could adjust the preparation of upcoming movement in order to reduce the initiation of undesired movements, namely, the movements that need to be canceled upon the arrival of stop signals. By examining the population activity in the state-space, the authors nicely demonstrated that increasing the probability of stop signal trials cause two different changes in GPe activity. First, the GPe population moved away from the region where movements can be triggered along the so-called initiation axis (along which the activity moves around the time of movement initiation). Second, the GPe activity moved away from the action that might be canceled along the different, so-called selection axis. The analyses and results are described clearly. Overall, the manuscript provides an important insight into the role of the basal ganglia in behavioral inhibition. Nevertheless, there are some interpretational limitations that the authors might need to discuss more.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One unfortunate consequence of the task design adopted in this study is that the position of the center port changes across 3 different conditions, and therefore could potentially influenced the activity of GPe neurons at the time of go cues. Can the authors exclude the possibility the changes in the GPe trajectory might result from the changes in the animal's body posture rather than from the preparatory bias for movement cancelation? Similarly, is it possible that activity during stop trial reflects the direction of the movement they need to make to get reward (i.e., the location of the food dispenser)? This would vary across trial-types (i.e., maybe- and no-stop trials) depending on the location of the central port.</p><p>2) The authors have used the phrase &quot;cognitive control&quot; (only) in the Abstract. While the results in this manuscript clearly provide important insights into the role of the basal ganglia in action selection and cancellation, however, it is unclear whether the type of control demonstrated in this study is analogous to cognitive control studied in human literature. In particular, there is no evidence that the adjustment is applied in response to the outcomes of recent trials, as in human and non-human primate studies. Another difference is that in this study, proactive control is applied directionally, which might not be the case in the standard stop signal task. How clearly can proactive &quot;inhibitory&quot; control be distinguished and separated from bias in action selection? These issues might need more careful discussion.</p><p>3) How will proactive control/state space approaches to these signals apply in instances of proactive control looking at trial history? For instance, as validation of the findings in this manuscript, can the authors show similar changes in neural firing/behavioral data on trials where rats experience multiple stops or goes in a row (e.g., conflict adaptation; post error slowing)? Presumably having just experienced a stop or an error, rats might slow their responding on the next trial and engage the strategies that the authors discuss. A similar story could be told for when there are multiple goes in a row.</p><p>4) Overall, some results can be explained well and more details can be included. Often results and analysis that explain fairly complicated figures are described in 1-2 sentences. Here are some examples.</p><p>a) It is not clear what Figure 2C,D is showing from the 1 sentence description in the text. It is said the contra and ipsi are equally represented but no statistic is given. It is not clear what &quot;proactive control was associated with altered activity in different sets of GP neurons at different times&quot; means and why the data is not shown.</p><p>b) It appears that the CDF in Figure 1D shows only the RT in non-stop (go) trials, whereas Figure 1B compares the RT in non-cancelled (error) stop trials, but this was not clearly explained. Also, it would be helpful to explain what RT and MT limit errors refer to at this point.</p><p>5) It is possible that GPe network state is not positioning anything strategically but is a reflection of upstream processing and/or the state that the body is in. Could GP activity states reflect that the animal has or is currently positioning its body in a certain way? Just because the rat is in the central port doesn't necessarily mean it is holding still or is not physically leaning in one direction or the other. My general feeling about these results is that the authors would get the exact same results in any task-related brain area using this analysis (e.g., dorsal striatum, SNr).</p><p>6) Figure 2 doesn't explain properly why these effects could not be observed at the level of single and population levels. It might be helpful to show firing rates for movements made in both directions for each of these figures. Also, how do these neurons and populations fire on errors (not moving quickly enough and going in the wrong direction). For the population histogram, the authors are averaging over all neurons, which may be problematic. From the heat plot it seems like half the neurons increase whereas the other half decrease firing during the trial. Averaging them all together would wash out any effects.</p><p>7) Some steps in the behavioral analysis might rest on assumptions that might not be valid. For example, it might be dangerous to group the stop trials where movements occur after stop cue together with go trials, since this strictly assumes that the go and stop processes are completely independent. The results from the primate literature (Schall) have shown that this assumption is not valid. In addition, it seems strange that stop trials with RT&gt;500 ms were excluded. Were go trials with such long RT also removed from the analysis?</p><p>8) One interesting claim was that the trajectories of GP population activity were consistent with a spatial, not a temporal, offset along the initiation axis, but this was not entirely convincing. It appears that a temporal offset would require all (or most) of the neurons to have exactly the same delay. If only a subset of neurons showed this delay, or if the neurons showed different delays, wouldn't it also appear as a spatial offset? It might be useful to perform some simulations to document the sensitivity and specificity of using the PC-based analysis to uncover any relationship between neural activity and model predictions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57215.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One unfortunate consequence of the task design adopted in this study is that the position of the center port changes across 3 different conditions, and therefore could potentially influenced the activity of GPe neurons at the time of go cues.

Our specific Maybe-Stop variant was directly inspired by, and based upon, human Maybe-Stop studies by Adam Aron and colleagues (e.g. Cai et al., 2011, Majid et al., 2013). Both those studies, and ours, were designed to study the movement-selectivity of proactive inhibition, using explicit cues in advance to prompt adjustments in stopping performance. Aron hypothesized (2011) that the GP was especially involved in movement-selective proactive inhibition, hence our choice to study GP here using a similar task design. We now make clear in the Abstract that we are studying selective proactive inhibition.</p><p>Our distinction between proactive effects on Initiation and Selection Axes is directly intended to help distinguish between inhibiting actions in general, and being biased in the preparation and selection of actions. We observed both effects. An interesting question is whether <italic>any</italic> situation that produces a directional bias is reflected in a similar GP population shift along the Selection Axis as defined here. We are currently investigating this using a probabilistically-rewarded task where contra and ipsi actions are associated with different reward expectation (see related part of Discussion).</p><p>It is true that “proactive inhibition” has also been used to refer to uncued behavioral adjustments after trial outcome (i.e. trial history-dependent effects). We observe this form of proactive inhibition as well, and it may involve overlapping neural mechanisms (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We have now noted this in the text, and clarified the differences between these distinct manifestations of cognitive control in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How will proactive control/state space approaches to these signals apply in instances of proactive control looking at trial history?

A similar story could be told for when there are multiple goes in a row.</p></disp-quote><p>Our rats do indeed slow their responding slightly after stops or errors, and this is associated with a slight shift along the Initiation Axis in the same direction as in our main results (i.e. starting further from movement onset; Figure 4—figure supplement 2). However, the effect is smaller than the main proactive effects we report, and does not reach significance with our current data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall, some results can be explained well and more details can be included.

Nonetheless, we have revised and extended the Results text to be hopefully more clear. We do give a statistical result for equal representation of contra and ipsi in Figure 2E (p=0.87) and have updated the legend to indicate that this is the same Wilcoxon signed rank test as in the previous panel.</p><p>The data that was previously not shown is now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. This indicates that although some individual GP neurons significantly distinguish the Maybe-Stop and No-Stop conditions, we did not observe a neuronal subpopulation that maintains this distinction across extended periods (the timing of the Go cue is unpredictable). Our failure to observe such a subpopulation lead us to examine population dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It appears that the CDF in Figure 1D shows only the RT in non-stop (go) trials, whereas Figure 1B compares the RT in non-cancelled (error) stop trials, but this was not clearly explained. Also, it would be helpful to explain what RT and MT limit errors refer to at this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified Figure 1B to indicate that the RT distribution purple line refers specifically to Failed Stop trials (on Correct Stops, there is no RT to plot). We have noted in the legend that Figure 1D refers specifically to trials in which no Stop cue is presented, as the reviewer surmised. We have also added the definition of RT and MT limit errors to the Figure 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is possible that GPe network state is not positioning anything strategically but is a reflection of upstream processing and/or the state that the body is in.

In any stop-signal study, regardless of species, one may be concerned that some unknown, uncontrolled aspect of behavior is contributing to the results. However, the specific character of our neural results (shifting away from contralateral movement initiation when contralateral movements may have to be cancelled) is very consistent with the proactive control interpretation that we favor.</p><p>Our GP results might indeed be mirrored in upstream and/or downstream structures, and determining whether this is the case is an important question we are addressing in ongoing research. Based on very preliminary data from SNr, it is not the case that the exact same results are present in any task-related brain area, but data collection for that study is not yet complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2 doesn't explain properly why these effects could not be observed at the level of single and population levels.

We still do not see any significant difference between Maybe-Stop and No-Stop conditions as rats wait for the Go cue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Some steps in the behavioral analysis might rest on assumptions that might not be valid.

We now clarify (in Results and Figure 1D legend) that the RT comparison between Maybe-Stop and No-Stop trials includes only trials in which no Stop cue occurs.</p><p>The exclusion of Stop trials with RT&gt;500ms serves to distinguish between “failures-to-stop” and “failures-to-wait”, in which the rat successfully cancels the action but then fails to sustain the hold for the required period (noted in Figure 1 legend). A prior, in-depth analysis (Mayse et al., 2014) demonstrated that it is important to distinguish between these, for example to correctly estimate stop-signal reaction times. In addition, we previously showed that this distinction between two types of errors is apparent in neural signatures of the stop process. For example, a pulse of beta oscillations is rapidly evoked by the Stop cue on Correct Stop trials, and Failed Stops with RT&gt;500ms, but not on Failed Stops with RT&lt;500ms (Leventhal et al., 2012). Finally, even we include RT&gt;500ms stop failed trials, the key result on reactive stopping is unchanged (at the time of the Stop cue, GP position along the Initiation Axis is significantly different for Correct and Failed Stop trials; p&lt;0.0001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) One interesting claim was that the trajectories of GP population activity were consistent with a spatial, not a temporal, offset along the initiation axis, but this was not entirely convincing.

We provide compelling evidence for an altered neural state in advance of the Go cue, manifested as a spatial offset in state-space. Although interesting changes in information processing subsequent to Go cue onset can also occur (e.g. Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2) they cannot account for changes before the Go cue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
