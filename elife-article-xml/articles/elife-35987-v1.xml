Redox potential is an important environmental feature affected by both host and microbial actions. We assessed how antibiotics, which can impact host and microbial function, change redox state and how this contributes to post-antibiotic succession. We showed gut redox potential increased within hours of an antibiotic dose in mice. Host and microbial functioning changed under treatment, but shifts in redox potentials could be attributed specifically to bacterial suppression in a host-free ex vivo human gut microbiota model. Redox dynamics were linked to blooms of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae. Ecological succession to pre-treatment composition was associated with recovery of gut redox, but also required dispersal from unaffected gut communities. As bacterial competition for electron acceptors can be a key ecological factor structuring gut communities, these results support the potential for manipulating gut microbiota through managing bacterial respiration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35987.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The gut is home to a large and diverse community of bacteria and other microbes, known as the gut microbiota. The makeup of this community is important for the health of both the host and its residents. For instance, many gut bacteria help to digest food or keep disease-causing bacteria in check. In return, the host provides them with nutrients. When this balance is disturbed, the host is exposed to risks such as infections. In particular, treatments with antibiotics that kill gut bacteria can lead to side effects like diarrhea, because the gut becomes recolonized with harmful bacteria including <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p>Reese et al. have now investigated what happens to the gut environment after antibiotic treatment and how the gut microbiota recovers. Mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics showed an increase in the âredox potentialâ of their gut environment. Redox potential captures a number of measures of the chemical makeup of an environment, and provides an estimate for how efficiently some bacteria in that environment can grow. Some of the change in redox potential came from the hostâs own immune system releasing chemicals as it reacted to the effects of the treatment. However, Reese et al. found that treating gut bacteria in an artificial gut â which has no immune system â also increased the redox potential. This experiment suggests that bacteria actively shape their chemical environment in the gut.</p><p>After the treatment, bacteria that thrive under high redox potentials, which include some disease-causing species, recovered first and fastest. This, in turn, helped to bring redox potential back to how it was before the treatment. Although the gutâs chemical environment recovered, some bacterial species were wiped out by the antibiotic treatment. The microbiota only returned to its previous state when the treated mice were housed together with non-treated mice. This was expected because mice that live together commonly exchange microbes, for instance by eating each otherâs feces, and the treated mice received new species to replenish their microbiota.</p><p>These findings are important because they show that the chemical environment shapes and is shaped by the bacterial communities in the gut. Future research may investigate if altering redox potential in the gut could help to keep the microbiota healthier in infections and diseases of the digestive tract.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>redox potential</kwd><kwd>succession</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Aspen T</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Justin P</given-names></name><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Lawrence A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Lawrence A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Extensive research to date has focused on how host factors like diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claesson et al., 2012</xref>), genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodrich et al., 2014</xref>), geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>), and immune state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>) shape the gut microbiota. Yet, work in free-living microbial systems reveals that bacteria typically play active roles in shaping their own environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi and Norton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gobbetti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goddard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Osono, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gerbersdorf et al., 2009</xref>). Identifying how these drivers interact is necessary both for a more complete understanding of the gut microbiota and for developing rational interventions. If ecological forces prove important, then compositional changes will likely be the result of feedbacks between the microbes and their environment.</p><p>Redox potential, a metric of the environmental capacity for reducing chemical reactions (<italic>i.e.</italic>, those involving the gain of electrons) to occur, is a composite measurement of various factors that influence gut microbiota structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cowley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dhall et al., 2014</xref>). Much of our knowledge for how gut redox potentials are determined involves host-associated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spees et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivera-ChÃ¡vez et al., 2016</xref>). Passive diffusion of oxygen from the epithelium increases redox potential and stimulates growth of aerobic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Espey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albenberg et al., 2014</xref>). Secretion of redox-active immune molecules such as reactive oxygen species or nitrate is known to be a feature of inflammation that imposes oxidative stress on commensal microbes and can be exploited by select pathogens to colonize the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spees et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivera-ChÃ¡vez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">David et al., 2015</xref>). Maintenance of redox homeostasis in host tissue can also have spillover effects on luminal redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Circu and Aw, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yet, redox potential is likely to also be shaped by microbial metabolism. In free-living microbial communities, variation in available electron acceptors dictates where microbes that employ respiration can thrive; the differential microbial metabolism that follows can produce further changes in electron acceptor availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris and Schmidt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orcutt et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, microbial metabolism has been proposed as a mechanism for low redox potential states in the lung of cystic fibrosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cowley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the nature of redox potential dynamics under antibiotic treatment to assess the importance of host and microbial processes in structuring gut bacterial communities. Antibiotics directly disturb the microbiota but are also expected to alter host biology related to redox potential. Specifically, antibiotics have been found to increase gut epithelium oxygenation as a result of altered microbial composition and metabolic signaling to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivera-ChÃ¡vez et al., 2016</xref>). Increases in luminal oxygen due to diffusion from the microvasculature supplying the epithelium would lead to a higher redox potential under antibiotic treatment. In addition, host inflammation responses to antibiotic treatment and antibiotic-associated pathogen colonization have been shown to produce electron acceptors and other redox active molecules that cause oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spees et al., 2013</xref>). While these pathways have been demonstrated previously, their overall impact on redox potential has not been measured. Furthermore, the contribution of microbial metabolism to gut redox potential has not been tested, although it is known that a wide range of resident gut bacteria can respire aerobically and anaerobically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravcheev and Thiele, 2014</xref>). Antibiotic-driven bacterial inhibition could increase the availability of electron acceptors and thus serve as another mechanism for antibiotic induced changes in gut redox potential. On the other hand, antibiotic inhibition could limit bacterial production of oxidizing agents thereby resulting in an overall decrease in redox potential under antibiotics.</p><p>Changes in redox potential under antibiotics would in turn be expected to yield insight into the forces structuring the composition and function of the microbiota. Elevated redox potential due to a host immune response could restrict the microbiota beyond direct antibiotic mortality as inflammation would introduce additional oxidative stress into microbial ecosystems. By contrast, elevated redox potential due to the accumulation of oxygen or anaerobic electron acceptors would foster the growth of respiring bacteria. Antibiotic disturbance produces reproducible community succession in the gut following treatmentâmost notably, a transient bloom in Enterobacteriaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">David et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Young and Schmidt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theriot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peterfreund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dethlefsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Looft and Allen, 2012</xref>), which has been ascribed to an increase in oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">David et al., 2015</xref>). But, the role of redox potential during this successional process has not previously been studied. If redox potential changes due to antibiotic treatment, we would predict that redox state recovery would be necessary for community resilience, thatÂ is for compositional recovery to a pre-disturbance state to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shade et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we expect that feedback between the community (<italic>i.e</italic>. the biotic component of the system) and their environment (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the abiotic component) would drive further redox potential changes during the successional period. Such a pattern would highlight the potential of manipulating redox potential to alter community dynamics after disturbance.</p><p>Here, we combined in vivo and ex vivo antibiotic studies to isolate the effects of host and microbial pathways on redox state in the mammalian gut. We confirmed that redox potential increased during antibiotic treatment in association with some changes in host immune state. However, multiple lines of evidence in both mice and an artificial human gut model suggested that antibiotic-induced changes in microbial metabolism were sufficient to cause an increase in redox potential. After antibiotic treatments ended, we observed redox recovery within a week. A successional return to conventional community composition only occurred, though, when mice were co-housed and shared gut microbiota, indicating that microbial dispersal is necessary above and beyond environmental recovery for the return of normal microbiota community structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Antibiotics caused a significant increase in mouse fecal redox potential within a day of treatment</title><p>For five days, we orally gavaged a cohort of conventional mice with a cocktail of antibiotics (ampicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and neomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reikvam et al., 2011</xref>]) to broadly inhibit gut bacteria.

The increase in <italic>Nos2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) led us to hypothesize that nitrate would increase as it is a gene which encodes inducible nitric oxide synthase and whose expression has been found to confer a growth advantage to nitrate respiration competent <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winter et al., 2013</xref>). Lower levels of microbial respiration could also lead to an accumulation in nitrate separate from changes in host expression. We measured fecal nitrate levels with the chromotropic acid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">West and Ramachandran, 1966</xref>) for a subset of time points when redox varied, and found a significant increase in nitrate (p=0.03, Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) beginning less than 24 hr after the first dose of antibiotics. This increase persisted throughout treatment, and overall antibiotic treatment produced a significant increase in nitrate (p=0.02, linear mixed effects model likelihood tests).</p><p>Finally, we used a colorimetric enzyme assay to measure fecal fumarate levels for a subset of time points during antibiotic treatment. Fumarate reductases have been found in over one third of gut microbe genomes, and fumarate is the most common terminal electron acceptor for bacterial anaerobic respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">KrÃ¶ger et al., 1992</xref>).

Overall, there was a significant effect of treatment on fumarate levels (p&lt;0.001, linear mixed effects model likelihood tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We observed a spike in fumarate levels 4 hr after the first antibiotics dose (p=0.004, Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test); however, this increase had dissipated by 8 hr after the first dose and later during treatment, we observed a significant decrease (to below the detection limit) in fumarate levels.

Members of this bacterial family were enriched at the end of treatment in our clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Enterobacteriaceae can also employ many terminal electron acceptors to perform aerobic and anaerobic respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravcheev and Thiele, 2014</xref>) and thus could likely thrive under high redox potential conditions and directly impact gut redox state. We found that the relative abundance of the Enterobacteriaceae was marginally correlated with redox potential (p=0.1, r=,0.18, repeated measures correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) throughout treatment and recovery. Moreover, the change in redox potential during the earlier recovery period was negatively correlated with changes in Enterobacteriaceae absolute abundance (calculated as total 16S rRNA gene copy number multiplied by relative abundance) for both treated animals (p=0.03, rÂ =Â â0.42, repeated measures correlation) and for all animals (p=0.02, rÂ =Â â0.34, repeated measures correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that increased respiration by the Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic treatment may lead redox potentials to decrease below conventional levels. More broadly, our observations support the hypothesis that Enterobacteriaceae dynamics contribute to natural redox potential variation in the gut.</p><p>We next investigated if abiotic recovery led to compositional recovery or if dispersal (<italic>i.e</italic>., migration of microbes) from unimpacted microbial populations was necessary for microbiota to exhibit resilience and return to a pre-treatment state. Previous research has shown that singly housed mice treated with antibiotics will exhibit altered community composition for weeks after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore co-housed half of the treated mice with control animals during the recovery period and kept half in single housing. Because mice practice coprophagy (<italic>i.e.</italic>, ingestion of feces), we would expect that co-housing would re-introduce normal commensal microbes to compete with the Enterobacteriaceae and other early successional species thereby reducing their abundance. At the end of the one-week treatment period, we indeed observed differential success in community recovery between the housing groups. Co-housed mice communities had returned to control composition while singly housed mice had not. For co-housed mice, by the end of the recovery period, the gut microbiota of treated animals was equally dissimilar from baseline as it was for control mice indicating that the community had recovered (p&gt;0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Both fecal redox potential and Enterobacteriaceae levels also returned to conventional levels more quickly in co-housed mice than singly housed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). By contrast, singly-housed treated mice continued to be more dissimilar at the end of recovery than singly-housed control mice (p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Such drift is qualitatively consistent with arguments that stochastic variation can influence how communities respond to perturbation, as seen in soil microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). More broadly, the differences between singly- and co-housed mice here highlight that environmental recovery is not sufficient to produce biotic recoveryâdispersal is also necessary for a resilient community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we found that a key feature of the microbial environment, redox potential, can be rapidly and dramatically altered in the gut under antibiotic treatment. This shift was accompanied by changes in electron acceptor availability. The direction and timing of the redox potential shift was associated with microbial dynamics and could be reproduced with an ex vivo model of the human gut absent host effects. Moreover, we found evidence that redox potential kinetics were driven by shifts in microbial load and metabolism, specifically among facultative anaerobes from the family Enterobacteriaceae. Although there was evidence of increases in certain host pathways of electron acceptor production, we did not find persistent and significant changes in host inflammation. Therefore, we propose microbial respiration of host sourced electron acceptors acts as a major determinant of redox potential in the gut, in addition to the host production itself. Redox potential consequently shaped successional dynamics following the cessation of treatment, but return to control redox conditions was insufficient to produce community recovery. Dispersal was required for community structure to exhibit full resilience to antibiotic disturbance.</p><p>Our findings imply that electron acceptors are a critical resource normally competed over by the resident bacteria and, as such, are key factors structuring gut microbial ecology. The ability to respire a broad range of electron acceptors is already known to be crucial for pathogens to colonize the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faber et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, ecological research to date on commensal microbiota has primarily focused on substrate availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Donaldson et al., 2016</xref> and references therein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira and Berry, 2017</xref>) or, to a lesser extent, oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Espey, 2013</xref>). Our results here support the hypothesis that the availability of other electron acceptors is an important ecological factor driving the structure of resident bacterial populations as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>). If true, this hypothesis would imply that pathogen colonization resistance by commensal microbes could be mediated by bacterial competition involving respiratory pathways.</p><p>Future work will be needed to comprehensively chart the dynamics and chemical landscape across which bacteria in the gut compete for electron acceptors. While any redox active molecule could contribute to redox potential changes (hence testing all possible chemical drivers of redox is infeasible), we focused here on three relevant electron acceptor species (oxygen, nitrate, and fumarate) that derive from independent pathways and may be representative of overall dynamics. Our data lead us to conjecture that oxygen availability transiently increased due to the decreased respiration capacity of an antibiotic-constrained bacterial community. But, as oxygen grew increasingly available, the remaining facultative anaerobes switched to aerobic respiration leaving other host-sourced electron acceptors, such as nitrate, to accumulate. Accrued electron acceptors, especially nitrate, may also have been contributed by changes in host physiology as evidenced by an upregulation of the <italic>Nos2</italic> gene, which is linked to reactive nitrogen species levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dedon and Tannenbaum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Winterbourn, 2008</xref>). Still, not all electron acceptors accumulated during antibiotic treatment. Notably, our data suggest that ones produced by the microbiota rather than the host, like fumarate, were less available under antibiotic pressure.</p><p>Our data also support a model where consumption by specific bacterial taxa shape redox homeostasis in the gut. We observe that facultative anaerobes like the Enterobacteriaceae behave as pioneer taxa whose dynamics inversely track redox dynamics after antibiotic treatment, providing new understanding of the deterministic mechanism driving the consistent bloom of these bacteria following antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">David et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Young and Schmidt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theriot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peterfreund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dethlefsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Looft and Allen, 2012</xref>). Enterobacteriaceae are especially suited to exploiting electron acceptor availability because their diverse repertoire of respiration pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravcheev and Thiele, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>) allow for fast growth rates under a high redox regime. Enterobacteriaceae and respiration pathway genes more generally are also more prevalent in inflamed mouse guts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>), another environment where heightened redox potential is expected. Under experimental inflammation, though, Enterobacteriaceae expansion can be prevented by treatment with tungstate, a respiration inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). This result corroborates our model that members of the Enterobacteriaceae use respiration to bloom under disturbed conditions, and it highlights the potential for manipulating electron acceptor availability or usability to engineer the microbiota.</p><p>An increase in resource availability is common following ecological disturbance and can promote the growth of pioneer taxa, which are best suited to quickly respond to a resource spike but which draw down the resource thereby bringing about their own displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Connell and Slatyer, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peet and Christensen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tilman, 1985</xref>). Here, as in many cases of ecological succession, the Enterobacteriaceae were eventually replaced by more conventional community members that typically grow better under more limiting conditions; in fact, the relationship between change in Enterobacteriaceae abundance and change in redox state is consistent with these taxa facilitating the success of secondary colonizers. However, why redox recovery was ultimately hysteretic (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the gut temporarily became a reducing environment following the end of treatment) remains unclear. It has previously been shown that members of the Enterobacteriaceae will produce reducing agents, such as H<sub>2</sub>S, in response to antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shatalin et al., 2011</xref>), but this theory requires further investigation in a community and host-associated context.</p><p>Beyond identifying a role for microbiota in shaping gut redox potentials, our results more broadly illustrate how microbial factors can be important in addition to host factors for determining abiotic conditions in the gut through the balancing of production and consumption of resources. While the host is ultimately the source of all substrates in the gut, microbial action determines the realized environment which shapes community composition and function. Such microbial ecosystem engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wright and Jones, 2006</xref>) is consistent with our understanding of how microbes can shape their environments in free-living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gerbersdorf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goddard, 2008</xref>). The altered resource availabilities that result from microbial action then contribute to structuring the microbial community itself. Such feedbacks may contribute to a number of phenomena in host-associated systems. Common constituents of the gut (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) could perpetuate similar hospitable environments for themselves regardless of host biology leading to the broad, phylum-level consistency of composition seen between humans regardless of diet, geography, or genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claesson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>). Variations in how the gut environment is dictated by microbes may also help explain inter-individual differences in response to interventions in the absence of consistent host effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Venkataraman et al., 2016</xref>). Microbial metabolic signaling additionally can alter host production of substrates including redox active molecules. Most notably reduced butyrate levels, a change observed here, have been demonstrated to increase gut nitrate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byndloss et al., 2017</xref>) and host epithelial oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivera-ChÃ¡vez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, our findings suggest new ecological models for how antibiotics reshape the gut microbiota and for how redox shifts could be associated with enteric disease. Antibiotics are triumphs of modern medicine that have dramatically reduced infectious disease mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>). But, we are increasingly learning that antibiotics also meaningfully reshape the resident gut microbiota, leaving an imprint that can last for months to years after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>) and predisposing hosts to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), food allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stefka et al., 2014</xref>), auto-immune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Russell et al., 2012</xref>), and increased infection risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stecher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">WistrÃ¶m et al., 2001</xref>). While these drugs reduce levels of susceptible organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keeney et al., 2014</xref>), an additional ecological mechanism of action is decreasing microbial competition and allowing primary metabolites (<italic>e.g.</italic>, primary bile acids, sugars) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theriot et al., 2014</xref>), as well as host-sourced electron acceptors like oxygen and nitrate to accumulate. This concept complements recent discoveries that electron acceptors facilitate antibiotic-associated enteric pathogen colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rivera-ChÃ¡vez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2010</xref>). Such increases in electron acceptor availability likely are not unique to antibiotic treatment and could generalize to various enteric disturbances. Indeed, germ-free animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Celesk et al., 1976</xref>) and humans suffering from inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Circu and Aw, 2011</xref>) and malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Million et al., 2016</xref>) exhibit increased gut redox potential. Thus, novel treatments for microbial disorders or preventing antibiotic-associated infections may include chemical alterations of redox potential or introduction of competitors for excess electron acceptors. More broadly, we propose adding redox potential to the list of abiotic conditions frequently assayed and manipulated to improve host well-being.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals using protocols approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

These measurements were collected for only a single cohort of mice due to availability of samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-13"><title>RNA isolation and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from fecal pellets stored in RNALater (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) using the MoBio PowerMicrobiome RNA Isolation kit with an added phenol chloroform extraction step.Â â¤15 ng RNA was reverse transcribed using cDNA Prep Reverse Transcription Master Mix (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) following manufacturerâs instructions. Target transcripts were preamplified for 18 cycles and then diluted 10x. RT-PCR was performed using a BioMark (Fluidigm) on a 48 Ã 48 chip with Taqman Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher). Three ERCC RNA Spike-in Mix (Thermo Fisher) positive controls and a nontarget negative control of nuclease-free water were also run on the chip. Expression levels were quantified for thirty genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Of these, six genes could be quantified for at least 20 time points, and so only these genes were included in statistical analyses. Expression levels were normalized to mouse <italic>Actb</italic> (ÎCt) expression for each time point for each mouse and then compared to the average of control mice for that time point (ÎÎCt). Fold change (2^ÎÎCt) is represented. These measurements were collected for only a single cohort of mice due to availability of samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-14"><title>NMR metabolomics</title><p>Samples were prepared by mixing fecal pellets with 200 Î¼l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prepared inÂ 95%Â D<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.5 and homogenizing for 5 min at 30 Hz. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging the samples for 10 min at 14K x g at 4Â°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 Î¼m centrifugal filter. To maximize the metabolite extraction, each pellet from the first centrifugation was mixed with 200 Î¼l PBS in 95% D<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.5 and homogenized for 5 min at 30 Hz. The solutions were filtered through a 0.22 Î¼m centrifugal filter as before. The supernatants were combined and 300 Î¼l was taken and mixed with 300 Î¼l of 99.9% D<sub>2</sub>O containing 500 Î¼M 3-(trimethylsilyl)â1-propanesulfonic acid-d<sub>6</sub>, sodium salt (DSS-d<sub>6</sub>).</p><p>NMR spectra were collected on an Avance III 700MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA) with a TXI triple resonance probe operating at 25C. A 1D NOESY pulse sequence was used with a spectral width of 12 ppm. Each spectrum was digitized with 32768 points over a 3.9 s total acquisition time. The sequence used a 100 ms mixing time and an inter scan relaxation delay of 2.0 s. These measurements were collected for only a single cohort of mice due to availability of samples.</p><p>The spectra were processed using Advanced Chemistry Development Spectrus Processor (version 2016.1, Toronto, ON, Canada). Processing parameters included zero filling to 65526 points, 0.3 Hz decaying exponential multiplication. Phase correction was applied using the automated algorithms in the ACD software and a third order polynomial baseline correction was applied to all samples. Quantitative profiling of the metabolites was carried out with the Chenomx NMR Suite (version 8.2, Edmonton, AL, Canada). The chemical shifts and concentrations were referenced using DSS-d<sub>6</sub> added to each sample at a concentration of 250 Î¼M and set to a chemical shift of 0.00 ppm. The Chenomx 700MHz library included acetate, acetoacetate, acetoin, alanine, asparagine, aspartate, B-hydroxybutyrate, butyrate, DSS-d6, ethanol, formate, glucose, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, isoleucine, isopropanol, lactate, leucine, lysine, methionine, propionate, sarcosine, threonine, and valine. Signals in the bile acid regions of the spectrum, from approximately 0.6 to 0.9 ppm, were fit as synthetic Lorentizan functions and each signal given a generic assignment as a bile acid methyl group. Concentration for bile acids are presented as arbitrary concentration units and relative comparisons should be made. The fitting of each spectrum was carried out in batch mode. Manual adjustment of the fitting was carried out in some samples to correct for errors arising from spectral overlap.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ex vivo experiments</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Culture conditions and treatment</title><p>Gut microbiota were cultured from human stool in a flow-through bioreactor system (Infors, Bottmingen Switzerland) following previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDonald et al., 2013</xref>). Healthy human subjects (nÂ =Â 3) that self-reported no use of antibiotics within a month of enrollment provided a single donation of stool. The sample size was calculated using a power analysis to allow for Î² less than 0.1. This experiment was only performed with a single cohort of donors. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the protocol was approved by the Duke Health Institutional Review Board. Subjects collected samples by placing disposable commode specimen containers (Fisher Scientific, Hampton NH) under their toilet seats before bowel movements. Intact stool samples were moved within roughly 15 min into anaerobic conditions after collection. All bioreactor vessels had a total vessel volume of 400 ml and a continuous turnover of 400 ml per day for the media to emulate the 24 hr average passage time of the human gut. The bioreactors communities were subject to a two-day adjustment period before treatment began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Vessels were then randomly assigned a treatment condition. Antibiotic treated cultures were subjected to daily single doses of 3.896 ml antibiotic treatments on two consecutive days. Antibiotics were prepared as above for mice. Control and antibiotic vessels had 1 L per minute N<sub>2</sub> gas bubbled in. Redox was measured continuously with Hamilton (Reno NV) EasyFerm Plus ORP K8 225 probes, which has a measuring range ofÂ Â±2000 mV. Redox probes were calibrated in Hamilton ORP buffer before autoclaving the bioreactor setup at the beginning of each replicate run. Because of differences in the construction and calibration between the in vivo and ex vivo redox probes, direct comparisons between the in vivo and ex vivo redox values should not be performed. Samples were collected daily and frozen immediately at â80Â°C for subsequent analysis of microbial community composition. Abiotic data were averaged for five minute increments for analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We performed linear mixed effects model analysis to determine the effects of antibiotics on redox potential, oxygen concentration, fecal lipocalin-2 concentration, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. As fixed effects, we entered antibiotic treatment and time with an interaction term into the model. We included mouse identity as a random effect. P values were obtained by likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model against a model including only time and mouse identity and were performed with the âanovaâ function in the âlme4â package. Repeated measures correlations were used to assess correlations where multiple time points from the same mouse were included in the statistical analysis. Repeated measures correlations were calculated with the ârmcorrâ function in the ârmcorrâ package. These and all other statistical analyses were carried out in R (R core team, version 3.3). All statistical tests performed were non-parametric except where a Shapiro-Wilks test indicated that data were normally distributed, in which case parametric tests were used. All data points were included in analyses and outliers were not treated in any manner.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Elise Cowley provided advice on experimental procedures and interpretation of redox dynamics.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Antibiotic induced changes in the microbiota disrupt redox dynamics in the gut&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jon Clardy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this paper represents a very interesting study of how intestinal bacteria shape the chemical environment of the intestine. The authors address this question by characterizing changes in redox state during antibiotic treatment, finding that intestinal redox potential increases following antibiotic treatment. A major claim is that bacterial metabolic activity is the primary determinant of redox potential, and that host metabolic activity plays a lesser role. The authors also find that the antibiotic-induced changes in redox state coincide with a characteristic bloom of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, which accords with numerous prior published studies showing that electron receptors, such as nitrate, support <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> expansion.</p><p>Overall, the study represents a novel exploration of how a major perturbation to the gut microbiome, antibiotic addition, affects a key environmental factor, redox potential. The study is logical, well conducted and controlled with a straightforward experimental approach, and an impressive amount of data is included. Although some of the conclusions were unsurprising, the reviewers felt that overall, the work provides valuable insight to the gut microbiome field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major claim of this study is that the increase in redox potential after antibiotic treatment is due to bacterial metabolic activity and not because of host processes. However, the authors also show that the major electron acceptor that increases after antibiotic treatment is nitrate, which is necessarily derived from the host, and they further show that this correlates with an increase in NOS expression in the intestine. Indeed, it is not surprising that host-derived electron acceptors would increase in abundance when bacterial density is reduced, as there are fewer bacteria present to consume them. Overall, the logic underpinning their conclusion that the altered redox state in vivo is strictly due to bacterial activity needs to be clarified.</p><p>2) A question was raised about the reproducibility of the work. In the Materials and methods, it is stated that C57BL/6 mice male mice were purchased from Charles River. However, it is unclear whether the mouse work was repeated with groups of mice ordered at different times. The microbiota can differ even in mice from the same vendor, especially if mice are housed in different rooms/facilities. Thus, the authors should clarify whether the mouse microbiota was similar in mice ordered at different times.</p><p>3) Some of the statistical analyses looked marginal, which probably reflects the difficulty of making measurements on complex samples (e.g., Figure 1C). A brief explanation of what was done to the data in the text of the figure legend would help.</p><p>4) Most, if not all, the results are not surprising, and this should be made clearer. In the Abstract the last sentence is &quot;Together, our results argue that bacterial competition for electron acceptors is a key ecological factor structuring gut microbial communities.&quot; This is known in many contexts and should be rephrased to something about a generalized function of antibiotics or implications for understanding and controlling the human microbiota and disease.</p><p>5) It would be appropriate for this manuscript to cite the 2018 Nature paper &quot;Precision editing of the gut microbiota ameliorates colitis&quot; by Sebastian Winter and co-workers. The Winter paper describes how inhibiting a bacterial redox process in vivo (Mo-dependent reduction) can be used to reshape the community in cases where terminal electron acceptors are determinants of community composition. It provides a nice contrast in approaches: in this manuscript a general conclusion, in the other a specific approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35987.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major claim of this study is that the increase in redox potential after antibiotic treatment is due to bacterial metabolic activity and not because of host processes.

We found that redox responses were not solely due to changes in host gene expression â as evidenced by our ability to recreate in the ex vivo bioreactor system â or pathogen colonization â which had been argued elsewhere in studies which did not isolate pathogen colonization effects from antibiotic effects. Still, we agree the nitrate and NOS expression results highlight the contribution that host processes can play in shaping redox potential. As suggested, we have edited the text to clarify and balance these points:</p><p>âAlthough there was evidence of increases in certain host pathways of electron acceptor production, we did not find persistent and significant changes in host inflammation. Therefore, we propose microbial respiration of host sourced electron acceptors acts as a major determinant of redox potential in the gut, in addition to the host production itselfâ¦â</p><p>âBut, as oxygen grew increasingly available, the remaining facultative anaerobes switched to aerobic respiration leaving other host-sourced electron acceptors, such as nitrate, to accumulate. Accrued electron acceptors, especially nitrate, may also have been contributed by changes in host physiology as evidenced by an upregulation of the <italic>Nos2</italic> gene, which is linked to reactive nitrogen species levels (Dedon and Tannenbaum 2004, Winterbourn 2008).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A question was raised about the reproducibility of the work. In the Materials and methods, it is stated that C57BL/6 mice male mice were purchased from Charles River. However, it is unclear whether the mouse work was repeated with groups of mice ordered at different times. The microbiota can differ even in mice from the same vendor, especially if mice are housed in different rooms/facilities. Thus, the authors should clarify whether the mouse microbiota was similar in mice ordered at different times.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question given the variation in gut microbiota known to exist between mice both within and between vendors (Rosshart et al. 2017, Rausch et al. 2016, Ivanov et al. 2009, Campbell et al. 2012). Indeed, our mouse experiments were repeated with different groups of mice ordered 4 months apart, although they were housed in the same room at the vivarium during each experimental period.</p><p>In response to overall concerns about reproducibility, we re-analyzed the two cohorts of mice from which we collected 16S rRNA gene sequence data (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 5). We observed significant differences in community composition at the OTU level based on mouse cohort, which appeared to persist throughout the experiment (P=0.01, R<sup>2</sup>=0.17; PERMANOVA). This suggested that despite coming from the same vendor, our mice indeed had different microbiota. Still, significant compositional changes accompanied antibiotic treatment (P=0.01, R<sup>2</sup>=0.07; PERMANOVA). These treatment effects were not dependent on initial community composition (i.e. there was not a significant interaction between cohort and treatment (P=0.3)). Moreover, we note that the overall bloom of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in response to treatment has been shown by other groups in using different mouse models and in multiple animals under many antibiotic types; and, the comparability in compositional shifts and environmental shifts documented in our human ex vivo gut model. These findings support the replicability of high level features of our mouse results.</p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate overall concerns regarding the reproducibility of mouse work and now discuss both our re-analysis, as well as limitations regarding analysis of mouse litters from different time points:</p><p>âBecause baseline microbiome is expected to differ between mouse litters over time as well as between vendor (Rosshart et al. 2017, Rausch et al. 2016, Ivanov et al. 2009, Campbell et al. 2012), we examined whether the effects observed were reproducible between the two cohorts sequenced. [â¦] Because the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> bloom response to antibiotics has been found to be consistent between humans and mice, as well as between mouse vendors (Antonopoulos et al. 2009, David et al. 2015, Young and Schmidt 2004, Theriot et al. 2014, Peterfreund et al. 2012, Dethlefsen et al. 2008, Jakobsson et al. 2010, Looft and Allen 2012), we believe that the overall trends observed here are indicative of what may be occurring in other conventional gut microbiota contexts.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the statistical analyses looked marginal, which probably reflects the difficulty of making measurements on complex samples (e.g., Figure 1C). A brief explanation of what was done to the data in the text of the figure legend would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Two main statistical test classes were used in this paper when analyzing the time series of biotic and abiotic variables. To assess overall impacts of treatment, we ran linear mixed effects models and tested for increased model performance in models including treatment as a fixed effects versus models which only included time as a fixed effect (in all models mouse ID was included as a random effect to correct for inter individual differences). These were the results reported in the text and the figure legends. In addition, we performed non-parametric post-hoc tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) to determine at which time points the treatment groups differed. These post-hoc tests were indicated on the figures to allow for ease of interpretation, but they were not considered the optimal assessment of treatment effects because they do not take into account trends in individuals over time or repeated measure non-independence, and they require extensive multiple-hypothesis correcting. As such, results such as the lipocalin-2 occurred wherein there was an overall effect of treatment captured in the mixed effects models but only small differences between treatment groups at any given time point. Due to the limitations of using post-hoc tests to analyze time series, the non-parametric single time point results were not included in the main text or specified in the legends.</p><p>Still, we acknowledge how our decisions regarding data presentation gave the appearance that some statistical outcomes were marginal. To clarify the differences between test types, and direct readers attention mainly to the mixed effects model results, we have adjusted all figure legends to read âPost-hoc test results (* indicates P&lt;0.05 Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test) are included for visualization purposesâ where previously they read â* indicates time points where post-hoc tests indicate significant difference from control (P&lt;0.05 Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test)â. In addition we have updated all figures to include the statistical results for the mixed effects model test on any panel where such a test is being reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most, if not all, the results are not surprising, and this should be made clearer. In the Abstract the last sentence is &quot;Together, our results argue that bacterial competition for electron acceptors is a key ecological factor structuring gut microbial communities.&quot; This is known in many contexts and should be rephrased to something about a generalized function of antibiotics or implications for understanding and controlling the human microbiota and disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe it notable that many of our results had not been previously shown in assessments of the effects of antibiotics. Furthermore, while individual electron acceptors are sometimes considered in studies of the gut microbiota, they are rarely presented in concert nor is overall redox potential measured. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge that many of our results could have been predicted from first principles. Hence, we have now tempered the language in the abstract and refocused the final sentence for implications for understanding the relationship between the gut microbiota and health. The new sentence is reproduced below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>âAs bacterial competition for electron acceptors can be a key ecological factor structuring microbial communities, these results support the potential for manipulating gut microbiota through managing bacterial respiration.â</p><p>5) It would be appropriate for this manuscript to cite the 2018 Nature paper &quot;Precision editing of the gut microbiota ameliorates colitis&quot; by Sebastian Winter and co-workers.

It is now discussed and cited:</p><p>â<italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and respiration pathway genes more generally are also more prevalent in inflamed mouse guts (Hughes et al. 2017), another environment where heightened redox potential is expected. [â¦] This result corroborates our model that members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> use respiration to bloom under disturbed conditions, and it highlights the potential for manipulating electron acceptor availability or usability to engineer the microbiota.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
