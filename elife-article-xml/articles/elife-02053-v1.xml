pyramidal neurons and plays important role in cognition. Most of its inhibitory effects are mediated by signaling from GABAB receptor to the G protein-gated Inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. Here, we show that RGS7, in cooperation with its binding partner R7BP, regulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Deletion of RGS7 in mice dramatically sensitizes GIRK responses to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation and markedly slows channel deactivation kinetics. Enhanced activity of this signaling pathway leads to decreased neuronal excitability and selective disruption of inhibitory forms of synaptic plasticity. As a result, mice lacking RGS7 exhibit deficits in learning and memory. We further report that RGS7 is selectively modulated by its membrane anchoring subunit R7BP, which sets the dynamic range of GIRK responses. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role of RGS7 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02053.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02053.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02053.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. The arrival of an electrical signal known as an action potential at the first cell causes molecules known as neurotransmitters to be released into the synapse. These molecules diffuse across the gap between the neurons and bind to receptors on the receiving cell. Some neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, activate cells when they bind to receptors, thus making it easier for the second neuron to ‘fire’ (i.e., to generate an action potential). By contrast, other neurotransmitters, such as GABA, usually make it harder for the second neuron to fire.</p><p>Many of the effects of GABA involve a type of receptor called GABA<sub>B</sub>. When GABA binds to one of these receptors, a molecule called a G-protein is recruited to the receptor. This activates the G-protein, triggering a cascade of events inside the cell that lead ultimately to the opening of potassium ion channels, which as known as GIRKs, in the cell membrane. Positively charged potassium ions then leave the cell through these channels, and this makes it more difficult for the cell to fire.</p><p>Now, Ostrovskaya et al. have revealed that a complex of three proteins regulates the interaction between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRK channels. In neurons that lack either of these proteins, the receptors have less influence on GIRKs than in normal cells. Moreover, mice that lack one of the proteins (called RGS7) perform less well in various learning and memory tests: for example, they take longer than normal animals to learn the location of an escape platform in a water maze, or to retain a memory of a fearful event.</p><p>By identifying the proteins that regulate the interaction between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRKs, Ostrovskaya et al. have helped to unravel a key signaling cascade relevant to cognition. Given that GIRK channels have recently been implicated in Down’s syndrome, these insights may also increase understanding of cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02053.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02053.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>GPCR signaling</kwd><kwd>RGS protein</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>GIRK channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA021743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA026405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH061933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wickman</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA034696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wickman</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Education and Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU-2012-38348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lujan</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CONSOLIDER</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSD2008-00005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lujan</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL105550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical regulator of inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling in the hippocampus has been identified in experiments on mice and been shown to play essential role in synaptic plasticity and memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling through G protein-coupled receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (GABA<sub>B</sub>R) has been recognized to play key roles in mood, nociception, memory, reward, and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padgett and Slesinger, 2010</xref>). In the hippocampus, activation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R on pyramidal neurons produces slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), which counteract the excitatory influence of ionotropic glutamate receptors to shape neuronal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulrich and Bettler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luscher and Slesinger, 2010</xref>).

Among more than 30 RGS genes found in mammalian genomes, the R7 family of RGS proteins (R7 RGS) stands out for its prominent roles in a range of fundamental neuronal processes, from vision to motor control to reward-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). The four members of this group (RGS6, RGS7, RGS9 and RGS11) form heterotrimers with two subunits (Gβ5 and R7BP), and these interactions regulate the localization and/or expression of the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jayaraman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Gβ5 serves as a central scaffold that bridges the catalytic (RGS) and targeting (R7BP) subunits and ensures the stability of R7 RGS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheever et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sandiford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masuho et al., 2011</xref>).

However, the identity of the RGS isoform that modulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampus, as well as the relative impact of the R7BP subunit, are unknown. Furthermore, the relevance of RGS-dependent modulation of GIRK-dependent signaling to hippocampal circuit function, plasticity, and behavior remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we examined the importance of RGS and R7BP subunits to hippocampal physiology and hippocampal-dependent behavior.

Since GIRK activation kinetics could be influenced by the G protein deactivation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doupnik et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>), we did not put significant emphasis on the analysis of the differences in the raising phases of the response. The impact of RGS7 ablation on deactivation rates was consistent at different agonist concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Combined with the observations that GABA<sub>B</sub>R continues to increase the amount of activated G proteins past the saturation point of the GIRK channel response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hensler et al., 2012</xref>), these data suggest that the lag time reflects the clearance of free βγ subunit produced above the stoichiometric level relative to the GIRK channel.</p><p>To provide an independent evidence that increase in the lag time reflects changes in stoichiometry of Gβγ subunits relative to their effector molecule, we utilized a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based approach that monitors interactions of Gβγ with a reporter derived from an effector (GRK3) upon reconstitution in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In hippocampal neurons, RGS7 is closely co-localized with both GABA<sub>B</sub>R and GIRK2-containing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fajardo-Serrano et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in transfected cells, RGS7 can directly interact with GIRK channel subunits as demonstrated by both co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence energy transfer approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>).

Knockout of Gβ5 greatly slows GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK response deactivation rates and dramatically increases agonist sensitivity of the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to mediating interactions with the channel, Gβ5 is essential for the expression of all four R7 RGS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). With several R7 RGS proteins expressed in hippocampus, the identity of the exact isoform that participates in GIRK channel regulation in the region, through complex formation with Gβ5, remained unknown. The elimination of RGS7, reported in this study, largely phenocopies the loss of Gβ5, both in terms of kinetics and agonist sensitivity. This argues that in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, GIRK signaling is regulated by RGS7 and not by other R7 RGS proteins. Indeed, while RGS6 regulates GIRK signaling in cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maity et al., 2012</xref>) and sinoatrial pacemaking cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Posokhova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), RGS6 ablation had no effect on any GIRK response parameters in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The function of R7 RGS proteins is regulated by the membrane anchor R7BP, which augments the ability of R7 RGS proteins to deactivate G protein signaling in reconstituted systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drenan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masuho et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we show that knockout of R7BP reduces plasma membrane localization of RGS7 and slows GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK current deactivation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Our results also agree well with a recent study reporting similar deceleration of GIRK deactivation kinetics in <italic>R7bp</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). However, the consequences of RGS7 and R7BP elimination are different in two important ways. First, relative to the loss of RGS7 or Gβ5, elimination of R7BP had a very modest effect on GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK deactivation kinetics, and was seen only at high GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist concentrations. This suggests that the RGS7/Gβ5 complex can regulate GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling without R7BP. Secondly, loss of R7BP and RGS7 has different effects on GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK coupling sensitivity. While elimination of RGS7 (or Gβ5) results in a parallel leftward shift in the concentration-response relationship, the concentration-response measured in <italic>R7bp</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons shows markedly greater cooperativity. Thus, at low levels of GABA<sub>B</sub>R stimulation, R7BP is dispensable and its elimination fails to affect response amplitude. As the response reaches saturation, R7BP becomes indispensable and its elimination has the same effect on response amplitude as loss of RGS7. These observations are inconsistent with the proposed role for R7BP as a critical factor in the assembly of RGS7-GIRK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), which postulates the equivalence of R7BP effects across agonist concentrations and a similar impact of R7BP and RGS7 elimination on GIRK channel kinetics, and certainly not an increase in cooperativity of GIRK channel activation.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose an alternative model, where R7BP sets GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK coupling efficiency. In this model, at low levels of GIRK activation, when released Gβγ subunits do not saturate the GIRK channel, deactivation kinetics are primarily mediated by RGS7/Gβ5 directly associated with the GIRK subunits. Under these conditions, there are virtually no genotype-dependent differences in the lag time of GIRK deactivation upon agonist removal. With higher agonist concentrations, as GABA<sub>B</sub>R produces more Gβγ subunits, the amount of available free Gβγ exceeds that of activatable GIRK channels, evidenced by a delay that precedes GIRK current deactivation upon agonist removal. Under these conditions, R7BP elimination affects response sensitivity as much as elimination of RGS7. While response deactivation kinetics reflect Gβγ inactivation after it had a chance to interact with the channel, response sensitivity likely relates to the efficiency of the Gβγ reaching the GIRK channel. Considering that R7BP affects both of these parameters only when free Gβγ is produced in excess, we think that the RGS7/Gβ5 complex exists in two states: (1) anchored to the GIRK complex where it affects deactivation kinetics, and (2) anchored via R7BP to the plasma membrane outside of GIRK complex where it primarily determines response sensitivity.</p><p>In agreement with this model, we observe an increase in cooperativity of GIRK channel activation upon R7BP loss that suggests that RGS7/Gβ5 alone, but not in complex with R7BP, promotes more productive association of Gβγ with the channel. On an intuitive level, this may reflect larger proportion of Gβγ subunits that reach GIRK while being deactivated in its vicinity by RGS7/Gβ5. In contrast, complexes of RGS7/Gβ5 with R7BP may predominantly act elsewhere on the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing the number of Gβγ subunits capable of reaching the channel. By physically binding to the GIRK channel, RGS7/Gβ5 may further act to promote productive interactions of Gβγ (and/or Gα) with the channel, thus increasing cooperativity of its activation. This model is also consistent with the observed decrease in RGS7 on the plasma membrane but largely preserved localization at specific postsynaptic sites where it might be anchored via complex formation with GIRK channels. Thus, the main role of R7BP appears to be in tuning the sensitivity of the response by endowing RGS7/Gβ5 complexes with an ability to deactivate G proteins before they reach the GIRK channel.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RGS7 is a new player in learning and memory and synaptic plasticity</title><p>RGS proteins are potent negative regulators of both the extent and duration of neurotransmitter signaling via G protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sjogren, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xie and Martemyanov, 2011</xref>). As a result, knockout of individual RGS genes in mice is frequently associated with augmented GPCR signaling. This makes the analysis of changes in sensitivity of behavioral or cellular reactions to neurotransmitter actions associated with elimination of individual RGS proteins a powerful strategy that allows for establishing physiological receptor-RGS pairings. Using this strategy, two RGS proteins have been previously implicated in controlling GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in vivo: RGS6 in cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maity et al., 2012</xref>) and RGS2 in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labouebe et al., 2007</xref>). Now, our findings establish that in hippocampal neurons, GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling is negatively regulated by RGS7. These observations complement earlier findings with RGS14, the only other RGS protein implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). However, in contrast to RGS7 that acts in the CA1 region, RGS14 functions in CA2 synapses and its ablation augments LTP and improves spatial learning in mice.</p><p>The major forms of synaptic plasticity (LTP, LTD and depotentiation) in the hippocampus have been implicated in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2000</xref>). Recent models propose that all three forms cooperate to affect distinct aspects of spatial information storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007</xref>). In relevance to this thinking, we found a selective disruption of LTD and depotentiation in <italic>RGS7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, but normal LTP. There is a mounting evidence suggesting an active and selective role of LTD in object recognition and creation of spatial representation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007</xref>). For example, LTD but not LTP was found to be important for spatial memory consolidation and memory enhancement for novelty acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals show facilitation of LTD during novelty exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manahan-Vaughan and Braunewell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of LTD via genetic mutations often results in memory deficits, particularly affecting behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 2008</xref>), while LTD enhancement can lead to improvement in spatial reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, our findings resemble the phenotype of SRF<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which exhibited a selective disruption of LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons paralleled by an inability to learn hippocampus-dependent tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etkin et al., 2006</xref>). While specific knowledge on how depotentiation contributes to memory is still lacking, it has been observed that exposure to novel environment and spatial exploration depotentiates previously-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). Together, our observations in mice lacking RGS7 reinforce the idea that normal inhibitory synaptic plasticity (LTD and depotentiation) is required for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.</p><p>Although, it has never been systematically addressed in a single study, GIRK channel elimination was reported to enhance LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cramer et al., 2010</xref>). Given that the <italic>Girk2</italic><sup><bold><italic>−/−</italic></bold></sup> neurons are relatively depolarized, the enhanced LTP likely results from a general increase in excitability. Conversely, GIRK2 over-expression in transgenic models of Down syndrome leads to reduced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kleschevnikov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siarey et al., 2005</xref>), but enhanced LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siarey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, GIRK2 over-expression and ablation both resulted in decreased depotentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Similar to Down syndrome mouse models, <italic>Rgs7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice also exhibited augmented GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling. However, in the case of <italic>Rgs7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, this augmentation resulted in yet another distinct phenotype: selective deficits in LTD and depotentiation, with normal LTP. Several lines of evidence argue that these changes in synaptic plasticity are driven by a postsynaptic mechanism whereby RGS7 controls inhibitory GIRK-dependent signaling in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. First, CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking RGS7 are hyperpolarized and less excitable relative to wild-type neurons, a property that is significantly shaped by the GIRK channels. Second, basal excitatory transmission is unaltered in <italic>Rgs7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> slices. Third, direct measurements of events that reflect excitatory presynaptic function (e.g., FV and PPR) reveal no changes caused by the elimination of RGS7. Given these observations, we propose that GIRK signaling sets the general excitability of postsynaptic pyramidal neurons, which in turn determines a sliding scale window for the induction of different forms of synaptic plasticity. By adjusting signaling strength in the hippocampal GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK pathway, the RGS7/Gβ5/R7BP complex influences the range of neuronal responses necessary for memory formation. While dysregulation of GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampus may be sufficient for explaining the effects of RGS7 on learning an memory, at this point we cannot rule out a contribution of other brain regions and/or signaling pathways in the process. In any event, we believe that the results of this study establish RGS7 complex as an important molecule for understanding and/or correcting the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with disruptions in synaptic plasticity and imbalances in inhibitory signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and were granted formal approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Scripps Research Institute.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard W Aldrich (Reviewing editor); David Clapham (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Ostrovskaya et al. continue their investigation of the hippocampal metabotropic GABAB activation of the GIRK (Kir3) channel. This pathway is initiated by gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter binding to its G protein coupled receptor, GABAB. This initiates Gβγ activation of Kir3 heterotetramers, which hyperpolarize neurons. RGS proteins (30 members) regulate GPCR coupling to effectors.</p><p>In this paper, the authors use knockout mice to suggest that both <italic>Rgs7</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>R7bp</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> are in a complex with the GABA-GIRK axis to dampen the response to GABA agonist in hippocampus. Deletion of <italic>Rgs7</italic> in mice sensitizes GIRK responses to GABAB receptor agonist and slows channel deactivation kinetics. CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking <italic>Rgs7</italic> are thus more hyperpolarized and less excitable. Interestingly, GIRK onset kinetics (but not deactivation rates) were affected by <italic>Rgs7</italic> ablation only at low agonist concentrations while <italic>R7bp</italic> ablation significantly affected deactivation kinetics only at higher agonist concentrations. Basal excitatory transmission and excitatory presynaptic function (inferred from FV and PPR) are not changed in <italic>Rgs7</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Loss of R7bp results in ineffective targeting, and consequent decrease Rgs7 function. The authors propose that Rgs7/Gβ5/R7bp adjusts signaling strength in the hippocampal GABAB-GIRK pathway. This disrupts LTD and depotentiation, and this somehow interferes with associative learning and formation of contextual memory.</p><p>The following issues must be adequately addressed for a revised version to be accepted:</p><p>1) Some may consider that the results overlap with the authors' paper in Nature Neuroscience in 2010 – “β5 recruits R7 RGS proteins to GIRK channels to regulate the timing of neuronal inhibitory signaling”.

To reach this conclusion, we examined the phenotype of mice lacking Gβ5, a subunit of the complexes that could involve four different RGS proteins in the R7 RGS subfamily: RGS6, RGS7, RGS9 or RGS11. We performed analysis of GIRK kinetics in primary hippocampal cultures, recorded evoked sIPSCs in hippocampal slices, and examined the pharmacological sensitivity of mice lacking Gβ5 to baclofen. The identity of the RGS protein within the Gβ5 complex that mediates regulation of hippocampal GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling remained unknown. Further unknown was whether another subunit of the complex, R7BP, was involved in GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling regulation. Finally, the relevance of observed alterations in GIRK channel function to the physiology of the intact hippocampal circuit and synaptic plasticity has not been explored. The current study fills these gaps by identifying RGS7 to be the main RGS isoform in the Gβ5-RGS complexes that regulate GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in the hippocampus, by establishing the role of R7BP subunit in this regulation, and by demonstrating that these complexes play a key role in synaptic plasticity and memory. We have further clarified the distinction between our prior and this current study in the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Readers will be confused by</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>.

Cartoon representations are inherently limited by the restrictive nature of the graphic space. As a result, we found that attempts to emphasize one aspect of the study resulted in an unwarranted misperception to other issues. However, we did leave the verbal description of the model in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It is not valid to conclude much about activation rates from measurements of “rising” phases when the records also decay. In this case the rising phase contains contributions from both activation and inactivation. If a treatment changes the decaying phase also, then conclusions about activation are invalid, as the two processes cannot be well separated. The treatment of activation rates needs to take this into account, at least by some textual qualification</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that the analysis of the “activation” phases of the GIRK channel responses could be complicated. In fact, slowing the activation phase has repeatedly been shown to be related to deceleration of GTP hydrolysis rates in the absence of RGS proteins. However, from the channel perspective, upon agonist application, the steady-state of the G protein cycle is shifted tremendously towards favoring channel opening with no appreciable channel inactivation, which becomes prominent only when the agonist is removed. Indeed, our additional analysis reveals no significant genotype differences in current inactivation during baclofen application (desensitization). In our mind, this allows a rather uncomplicated analysis of the rising phases that do not seem to be contaminated much by channel inactivation. We agree with the reviewers’ point, however, that analysis of the activation kinetics may not allow us to conclude much and we further qualified this in the revised manuscript. We did not put much of an emphasis on analysis of activation kinetics. Instead, our model mostly relies on sensitivity (steady-state currents) and the response deactivation, which directly correlates with the GTPase activity of the G proteins, and as a result is much more interpretable.</p><p><italic>4) Readers would appreciate some more explanation of how increasing LTD and depotentiation are needed for memory. If no one knows how, say so</italic>.</p><p>We supplied more information regarding the relevance of LTD and depotentiation to learning and memory.</p><p><italic>5) Has the lag been previously reported in the Gβ5 KO or R7BP KO? If not, what explains the difference and the presence of the lag in the current work? Do the authors have independent evidence for enhanced levels of free Gβγ relative to GIRK? Also, it seems that there is a 'hook' before the lag in the RGS7 KO. Is this reproducible? How can this be explained by</italic> <italic>changes in Gβγ activation?</italic></p><p>The lag has been described before for the wild-type neurons and noted to be present in both activation and deactivation phases (Otis 1993, JPhysiol; Sodickson 2006, J Neurosci; Zhang 2002, J Physiol). To the best of our knowledge, the present study for the first time reports an analysis of changes in the lag time induced by the loss of RGS protein complex components. To obtain independent evidence that this lag is related to changes in Gβγ stoichiometry relative to the effector (e.g., the GIRK channel), we modeled changes in Gβγ to effector ratios in a reconstituted system using a BRET-based reporter assay. The results of these experiments are entirely consistent with electrophysiological recordings of GIRK channel kinetics in the native system and show increase in response deactivation lag time upon an increase in Gβγ stoichiometry over an effector. These results are now reported in the revised version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The “hook” mentioned by the reviewer is a recording artifact that sometimes affects responses upon fast solution change in our perfusion setup. It randomly affects cells regardless of their genotype. In the revised manuscript, we substituted the traces that showed a prominent “hook” with cleaner traces.</p><p><italic>6) RGS7 is widely expressed and knocked-out in the whole mouse. Some of the changes in behavior could be due to changes in signaling outside of the hippocampus or in multiple brain regions. This needs to be discussed</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point. At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that some behavioral changes observed in this study may be contributed by changes in other brain regions. We have added the discussion of this point to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) It is not readily apparent how the ec50 and slope change in R7BP KO, but only the EC</italic><sub><italic>50</italic></sub> <italic>changes in RGS7 KO (which also has decreased R7BP). Why would the cooperativity increase in the absence of R7BP? Modeling the currents with different scenarios for G protein turnover could be very helpful. At minimum this should be thoroughly discussed</italic>.</p><p>First, we would like to point out that elimination of either R7BP or RGS7 changes the EC<sub>50</sub> for GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling. As already discussed in the paper, and entirely consistent with biochemical characterization, the total loss of RGS7 (that also leads to reduction of associated R7BP) results in the biggest EC<sub>50</sub> change – from 1.48-2.14 μM for wild-type to 0.35- 0.58 μM for <italic>RGS7</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>. However, knockout of R7BP, which affects RGS7 in subtler way (via membrane localization and activity regulation) also results in a significant EC<sub>50</sub> reduction (to 0.65-0.81 μM for <italic>R7BP</italic><sub><italic>-/-</italic></sub>; 95 % CI). We feel that the extent of the collected data and insufficient quantitative knowledge of the key parameters for protein/protein interactions in the GABA<sub>B</sub>R- GIRK signaling cascade significantly limits our ability to build an accurate model with a significant predictive value without doing substantially more work. On an intuitive level, however, we think that the observed increase in the cooperativity of GIRK channel activation upon R7BP loss may reflect larger proportion of Gβγ subunits that reach an effector (GIRK) while being deactivated in its vicinity by RGS7/Gβ5 bound to the channel. By physically binding to GIRK channel RGS7 alone, but not its complex with R7BP, may further act to promote productive interactions of Gβγ (and/or Gα) with the GIRK channel, thus increasing cooperativity of its activation. We have discussed these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
