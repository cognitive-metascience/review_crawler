development of depression and anxiety. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying stress-responsive behaviors are not fully understood. Here, we identified the orphan receptor GPR158 as a novel regulator operating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that links chronic stress to depression. GPR158 is highly upregulated in the PFC of human subjects with major depressive disorder. Exposure of mice to chronic stress also increased GPR158 protein levels in the PFC in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner. Viral overexpression of GPR158 in the PFC induced depressive-like behaviors. In contrast GPR158 ablation, led to a prominent antidepressant-like phenotype and stress resiliency. We found that GPR158 exerts its effects via modulating synaptic strength altering AMPA receptor activity. Taken together, our findings identify a new player in mood regulation and introduce a pharmacological target for managing depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orphan receptors</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>GPCR signaling</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH105482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL105550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH107460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Hyungbae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA019921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>Kenneth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Samuel M</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008893</institution-id><institution>University of Iowa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Samuel M</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Samuel M</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sutton</surname><given-names>Laurie P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The orphan receptor GPR158 is highly regulated by stress exposure and acts on key neuronal signaling pathways in the prefrontal cortex to control depressive-like behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An individual’s emotional response to stress is determined by genetic and environmental factors. While most reactions to stressful events trigger adaptive changes to maintain normal psychological and physical functioning, their derailment could produce maladaptive behavioral responses leading to the development of major depressive disorders (MDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayberg et al., 1999</xref>). It has been well recognized that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in controlling mood regulation. Changes in the morphology and/or function of mPFC neurons and local circuitry are well documented to contribute to the development of MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drevets et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rajkowska et al., 1999</xref>). Studies in animal models indicate that loss of mPFC control drives anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>), while treatments that act within the mPFC promote a therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of MDD are complex and not fully understood but most models agree that they are related to abnormal processing of neurotransmitter signals most notably by the monoamine, GABA and glutamate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamon and Blier, 2013</xref>). It is thought that these changes occur as a result of maladaptive plasticity in response to several biological and environmental factors and that understanding the mechanisms behind this connection would be a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic or prophylactic interventions.</p><p>Exposure to chronic stress is among the most powerful insulting factors that exerts significant negative effects on mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lucassen et al., 2014</xref>). Exposure to stressful events is thought to underlie long-term neuroadaptations observed in MDD including dendritic remodeling, spine loss, and altered synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnsten, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radley et al., 2006</xref>). Much of these effects are mediated by the glucocorticoids whose unrestraint release during chronic stress often triggers development of maladaptive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Myers et al., 2014</xref>). Glucocorticoids engage steroid receptors to initiate transcription of responsive genes responsible for lasting alterations in cellular function well beyond the time period of stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadmiel and Cidlowski, 2013</xref>). However, the roles of stress-induced genes in mediating cellular changes in mPFC and driving maladaptive behavioral phenotypes are not well understood.</p><p>Several GPCRs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as the effects of stress and pharmacological modulation of monoamine GPCRs is a mainstay practice in treating MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamon and Blier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomita et al., 2013</xref>). Still, therapeutic efficacy of available medications is limited, which is largely attributed to insufficient understanding of signaling cascades and neuronal circuits involved in modulating mood and stress responses, making identification of new players an attractive goal. In this study, we tap into the uncharted biology of orphan GPCR-like receptors screening for the novel stress-regulated genes in the mPFC. We identify the orphan receptor GPR158 as a key modulator of stress-induced depression. We show involvement of GPR158 in pathology of MDD in humans and demonstrate that manipulation with GPR158 in animal models produces antidepressive-like behaviors and stress resilience.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of GPR158 as a stress-inducible receptor modulated by glucocorticoids in the PFC</title><p>With the intent of identifying novel players involved in the regulation of stress-mediated responses we focused our attention on orphan receptors, increasingly recognized for their potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Civelli et al., 2013</xref>). We first defined the landscape of orphan receptors expressed in the brain by performing next generation sequencing of coding mRNAs, revealing that many orphan receptors are abundantly expressed in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequent proteomic profiling confirmed the expression of many of them specifically in the PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then analyzed the effect of chronic physical restraint stress (PRS) on the protein levels of several candidates from this list in the mPFC. Mice subjected to PRS revealed a significant upregulation in the levels of GPR158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), coincidently amongst the most prominent GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and, by far, the most abundant orphan receptor in the PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PRS exposure did not affect GPR158 levels in other brain regions including the hippocampus, caudate-putamen or cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In support of an involvement of chronic stress in controlling GPR158 levels in the mPFC, we observed that a second stress paradigm, unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), and an independent cohort of mice subjected to PRS showed, again, a significant upregulation of GPR158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, a positive correlation between GPR158 levels in the mPFC and immobility in the tail suspension test was found in both models pointing to the involvement of GPR158 in stress behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, we found that mice subjected to acute PRS did not show a significant up-regulation of GPR158 protein levels in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Since stress is a significant risk factor for MDD, understanding the cellular and molecular factors underlying behavioral vulnerability or resilience to stress-induced behavioral responses is poised to shed light on mechanisms of MDD initiation and progression. Several lines of evidence obtained in this study suggest that orphan receptor GPR158 may be one of the key molecular factors determining an individual’s susceptibility or resiliency to stress-induced depression. The vast majority of evidence was obtained studying responses of mice to stress-induced depression, validated to model salient features of MDD including anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviors and physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Covington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elizalde et al., 2008</xref>). We found that suppression of GPR158 produced an antidepressant-like phenotype and promoted a resiliency to stress. In contrast, induction of GPR158 induced a depressive-like effect. In addition to these causative effects, we found a strong correlation between levels of GPR158 and the emotional state of the animal in a way serving as a ‘biomarker’ of maladaptive responses. Notably, this relationship was further observed in humans where subjects diagnosed with MDD were found to also have elevated GPR158 levels as compared to unaffected individuals, although it is unknown if stress was a contributing factor. Mechanistically, stress induces changes in GPR158 expression via glucocorticoids. It is well established that prolonged glucocorticoid release precipitated by chronic stress leads to changes in transcription of multiple genes through direct engagement of nuclear receptor complexes and that this regulation plays a key role in the long-term structural and functional changes associated with mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papadopoulou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, we found that GPR158 upregulation requires sustained corticosteroid elevation induced by chronic but not acute stress exposure. Such differential sensitivity is thought to be underpinned by several mechanisms including epigenetic control and feedback at the glucocorticoid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunter et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these findings make GPR158 bona fide glucocorticoid responsive gene in the brain.</p><p>Anatomically, we pinpoint that GPR158 exerts its effects on depressive-like behaviors in mPFC. Although the involvement of other regions in mediating the actions of GPR158 on depression-like and stress related behaviors cannot be ruled out, its effects in PFC appear to be sufficient for driving behavioral changes supported by both gain and loss of function experiments. Given GPR158 broad expression pattern throughout the brain, this orphan receptor may be involved in regulating other physiological functions. As such, GPR158 has been shown to play a role in hippocampal-memory function, a process mediated by osteocalcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khrimian et al., 2017</xref>). At this time, it is unknown if osteocalcin is involved in mediating the effects of GPR158 in stress-induced depression and further investigation is warranted. It is unclear whether osteocalcin is the only endogenous ligand of GPR158 across the entire brain or whether different ligands may be involved on modulation GPR158 activity in a region-specific manner. The latter possibility appears to be possible given that signaling changes that we observe in the PFC neurons are consistent with GPR158 serving as an inhibitory GPCR as opposed to Gq-coupled excitatory action in the hippocampus. In any event, it is clear that changes in the levels of GPR158 in the mPFC contribute to modulation of emotionality responses. Intriguingly, the mPFC is a key region targeted by stress hormones, including glucocorticoids and that stress-induced changes in mPFC are firmly linked to neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress. Manipulation of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC have been shown to control behavioral responses to stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>), while optogenetic stimulation induced an antidepressant-like response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Covington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchikami et al., 2015</xref>). Studies in animal models indicate that loss of mPFC control drives anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>), while treatments that act within the mPFC promote a therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we provide evidence that within PFC, GPR158 modulates properties of the glutamatergic neurons in layer 2/3. Intriguingly, recent studies provide strong support for a role of layer 2/3 in the PFC in stress and depression. Stress-induced depression was documented to reduce spine densities and branch points in layer 2/3 of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Radley et al., 2004</xref>) whereas activation of their subpopulation induced rapid and distinct changes in depression-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Warden et al., 2012</xref>). Given that these neurons innervate various limbic and brainstem structures, and serve as the main projections for intracortical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>) it seems possible that modulation of stress and depression-like behaviors by GPR158 to some extent involves its effects on layer 2/3 neurons.</p><p>At the cellular level, we determined that GPR158 exerts its effects by profoundly influencing the synaptic strength. These changes are evident at both the structural and functional level as reflected by increase in spine density and enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, respectively. We found that these changes are largely attributed to an increase in postsynaptic AMPAR function due to an increase in both GluA2 expression and GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser845 which increases its content on the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Esteban et al., 2003</xref>) and synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, our findings establish GPR158 as a critical negative regulator of synaptic strength, which is likely mediating its cellular and behavioral effects. In addition, to the direct functional effects on processing synaptic inputs, increase in AMPAR signaling has been also shown to increase the expression of key neurotrophic factor BDNF via local protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zanos et al., 2016</xref>). Although the actions of BDNF are complex and not fully understood, it is thought to further exert anti-depressant effects through structural alterations, transcriptional and epigenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Björkholm and Monteggia, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, our findings establish GPR158 as a critical negative regulator of both synaptic strength and BDNF production, which are likely key effector systems mediating its cellular and behavioral effects. Several lines of evidence support the role of synaptic adaptations and AMPAR function in depression, stress and the development of MDD. For example, reduction in AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic responses in the PFC has been observed in models of stress-induced depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuen et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, ketamine and its metabolites exert rapid and powerful antidepressant effects in animal models of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Autry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parise et al., 2013</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zarate et al., 2006</xref>) by increasing synaptic strength defined as upregulation in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio by either blocking NMDAR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) or augmenting AMPAR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zanos et al., 2016</xref>), respectively. In accordance with our GPR158 results, the antidepressant effects of ketamine or traditional antidepressant medication is blocked by the inhibition of AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, chronic treatments with typical antidepressants have been shown to affect AMPA receptor levels in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbon et al., 2011</xref>). The increased cAMP levels observed in the mPFC of <italic>Gpr158<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice suggest that cAMP-dependent PKA activation may be responsible for the increased phosphorylation of GluA1. Thus, GPR158 may function at the critical nexus of stress, depression, and synaptic plasticity linking these processes at the molecular level.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrates that GPR158 plays a prominent role in the regulation of stress-induced depression via adaptations in synaptic plasticity. These findings implicate GPR158 signaling in the pathophysiology of depression and identify a new therapeutic target to block or reverse the effects of chronic stress and depressive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

All measurements were performed by an experimenter blind to the mice genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings</title><p>Coronal slices (300 µm) containing prefrontal cortex (AP +1.7–1.9) were cut in ice-cold aCSF (in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, pH 7.5, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) using a vibrating tissue slicer (VT1200, Leica). The slices were placed into individual wells of a custom slice incubation chamber where they remained in oxygenated aCSF at 32–36°C until use. During recording, PFC slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber where they were continuously perfused with oxygenated aCSF with picrotoxin (100 µM), and maintained at 32–36°C. Voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings were obtained with borosilicate glass pipettes (2–5 MΩ) filled with the following solution (in mM): 115 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 20 TEA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 5 QX314, with a pH of 7.35 and osmolarity of 310 mOsmol. Data were collected from neurons with resting membrane potential (RMP) more negative than −60 mV and initial series resistance ≤20 MΩ. Cells with series resistance changed more than 25% during recording period were excluded from analysis. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded at – 70 mV. Evoked EPSCs were recorded using a bipolar stimulating electrode located ~100 µm away from the neurons. AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated components were identified according to their distinct activation mechanisms and deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myme et al., 2003</xref>). AMPAR mediated EPSCs were recorded at – 70 mV and measured as the peak response following the stimulus. NMDAR mediated EPSCs were recorded at +40 mV and measured as the mean current over a 5 ms window, 50 ms after the stimulus. Mean EPSCs were an average of 10–15 sweeps obtained at 0.1 Hz. For paired-pulse ratio (PPR) recordings, a paired-pulse protocol of two stimuli at an inter pulse interval of 50 ms was applied while the cells were voltage-clamped at – 70 mV. Paired-pulse ratio was defined as the second peak amplitude (P2) divided by the first peak amplitude (P1). Mean PPRs were an average of 5–10 sweeps acquired at 1/15 Hz. Synaptic responses were collected with a HEKA EPC10 amplifier system (HEKA Instruments, Holliston, MA). Data were transferred to a PC computer using an ITC-16 digital-to-analog converter (HEKA Instruments). The signals were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using Patchmaster software (HEKA Instruments). Data were analyzed offline using Patchmaster. Voltages were not corrected for the liquid-liquid junction potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Preparation of acute cortical slices</title><p>Acute coronal cortical slices containing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were prepared from C57BL/6 wild type and <italic>Gpr158<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, P50-60. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was removed from the skull and rapidly placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 215 sucrose, 20 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.6 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2.5 KCl. Cortical slices (400 μm thick) were prepared using a VT1000S vibrating microtome (Leica). Slices were incubated at 32°C for 30 min in a holding chamber containing 50% cutting solution and 50% artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; in mM: 127 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 25 D-glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After 30 min, this solution was replaced with ACSF at room temperature. Slices were allowed to recover for more than 1 hr in ACSF before recording. All solutions were equilibrated for at least 30 min with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Two-photon imaging, electrophysiology, and glutamate uncaging</title><p>Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of prelimbic (PrL) subregion in the mPFC at depths of 20–40 μm were imaged using a two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies, Inc) with a pulsed Ti::sapphire laser (MaiTai HP DeepSee, Spectra Physics) tuned to 920 nm (2–2.5 mW at the sample) in recirculating ACSF aerated with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> containing (in mM): 2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.001 TTX, and 2.5 MNI-caged-glutamate. For each neuron, image stacks (512 × 512 pixels; 0.035 µm / pixel) with 1 μm z-steps were collected from one segment of secondary or tertiary apical and/or basal dendrites 30–80 μm from the soma. All images shown are maximum projections of 3D image stacks after applying a median filter (2 × 2) to the raw image data. Whole-cell recordings (electrode resistances 5–8 MΩ; series resistances 20–40 MΩ) were performed at 25°C on visually identified PrL layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons within 40 μm of the slice surface using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). In brief, to record uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (uEPSCs), PrL neurons were patched in voltage-clamp configuration (Vhold = −65 mV and +40 mV for AMPA receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated uEPSCs, respectively) using cesium-based internal solution (in mM: 135 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na2 phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl2, 4 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 3 Na L-ascorbate, 0.2 Alexa 488,~300 mOsm, ~pH 7.25) in ACSF. uEPSC amplitudes from individual spines were quantified as the average (8–10 test pulses of 1 ms duration at 0.1 Hz) from a 2 ms window centered on the maximum current amplitude after uncaging pulse delivery for AMPA currents and from a 10 ms window between 70 and 80 ms after stimulus for NMDA currents. Laser pulses were delivered by parking the beam at a point ∼0.5 μm from the center of the spine head with a pulsed Ti::sapphire laser (MaiTai HP, Spectra-Physics) tuned to 720 nm (16–18 mW at the sample). Integrated green (Alexa 488) fluorescence intensities were measured from background-subtracted green fluorescence using the integrated pixel intensity of a boxed region surrounding the spine head. Estimated spine size was calculated by normalizing the fluorescence intensities (as described above) for each individual spine to the mean fluorescence intensities measured from four ROIs on the dendritic shaft.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Post-mortem tissues were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank at the University of Pittsburg, University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank and the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center (Los Angeles).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Orphan receptor GPR158 controls stress-induced depression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Thomas L. Kash (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised manuscript.</p><p>This paper proposes that the abundance of an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (Gpr158) in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) increases with stress (or glucocorticoid treatment) and that promotes depression-like behaviors of mice. Deliberate overexpression of GPR158 (by viral transduction) in PFC promotes depression-like behaviors and knockout of Gpr158 gene (everywhere) has anti-depression effects.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is an intriguing study that begins to assign a function to Gpr158; however, there are some major concerns that need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It is important to delineate the functions of Gpr158 in specific populations of PFC neurons because the functions in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons may differ. Without that information, overexpression of Gpr158 in all PFC neurons is difficult to interpret.</p><p>2) Of the many GABAergic neurons, is Gpr158 expression restricted to the parvalbumin-expressing neurons?</p><p>3) The signaling pathways engaged in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons should be established, at least to the level of knowing whether it is excitatory or inhibitory.</p><p>4) Because Gpr158 is expressed widely in the brain, the effect of knockout or knockdown of Gpr158 in the PFC (ideally in pyramidal or glia cells) on behavior is needed.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the possibility that osteocalcin is an endogenous ligand for Gpr158 and what significance that has for interpretation of their results.</p><p>6) The authors should validate the antibody used in their studies more thoroughly and describe the genetic background and breeding strategy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The GPR158-Ad virus presumably infects all cells in the PFC, including those that do not normally express this GPCR. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that upregulation of GPR158 in cells where it is normally expressed promotes depression-like behaviors, it only shows that this ectopic expression paradigm seems to work. There is no evidence that the PFC is a specific region where GPR158 can affect depression-like behaviors-perhaps increasing GPR158 levels in other brain regions is also effective.</p><p>The observation that GPR158 is in both excitatory pyramidal neurons and GABAergic PV neurons in the PFC raises the question of whether this GPCR signaling is more important and whether the signaling mechanism is the same in both cell types.</p><p>The behavioral studies with GPR158 KO and WT mice are nice, but they do not bear on the brain region where this orphan receptor is important. Restoring GPR158 in neurons that normally make it in the PFC on a KO background and performing the behavioral and electrophysiological experiments would go a long way towards solidifying this story.</p><p>The genetic background of the GPR158 WT and KO mice used here should be indicated. Were the WT and KO mice used for these studies littermates derived from breeding heterozygotes? If not, there is concern that WT and KO mice used for studies may have subtle genetic background differences.</p><p>A recent study suggests that GPR158 is activated by osteocalcin (J Exp Med 214, 2859), that it participates in hippocampal memory and that it is coupled to G-α-q signaling. The results in this study do not seem to be compatible with G-α-q signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a novel finding, identifying GPR158 as an important mediator of stress induced depression like behavior. The authors test this idea by over expressing and knocking out this receptor and assessing behavior. In addition, the authors provide data showing changes of this GPCR in human MDD patient brain. This is a nice addition that lends cross species generalizability. However, some of the experiments are concerning:</p><p>1) Over-expression is not directed to any cell type, so while the behavioral data is robust, it is challenging to interpret. Of additional concern, this is only explored in male mice. given later data in the KO mice was examined in males and female mice, seem like a useful comparison.</p><p>2) The knockout data is compelling in such that deletion from birth can induce changes in behavior, synaptic function independent of stress exposure. This raises the issue that there could be a developmental compensation from the deletion of the receptor.</p><p>Because of these issues, I think a more robust analysis would be a viral knockdown of GPR158 prior to stress exposure to parse out role of developmental deletion. These issues are not addressed in the manuscript, and given the novelty of these findings and the potential length of time it would take to repeat these experiments with a knockdown approach, I would also be favorable if there were a more in depth discussion of these concerns in the manuscript.</p><p>3) The authors present data showing that layer 2/3 neurons in the mPFC are altered. Given the expression of this protein in nearly all GABA neurons, this is an incomplete analysis. These particular experiments, recording from different cell types in KO and WT mice, would be very helpful in clarifying molecular/synaptic adaptations.</p><p>4) The near total exclusion of this GPCR in SST neurons is stunning. It is a bit confusing how the expression in GABA neurons is so high, but nothing in SST. It would be useful to flush this out a bit more with triple labeling, to provide further evidence of this selective expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript from Martemyanov and colleagues showing that expression of the orphan GPCR GPR158 is glucocorticoid-regulated, is highly expressed in rodent prefrontal cortex, and is upregulated in post-mortem dlPFC from depressed human patients and in rodents subjected to behavioral procedures that precipitate depression-like behavioral responses. Furthermore, virus-mediated GPR158 overexpression in PFC precipitates depression-like behaviors in rodents and that knockout mice show the opposite.</p><p>Overall, this is a rigorously-performed and well-written study that is likely to be of considerable interest to the field, particularly those interested in new medications development.</p><p>I have only a few comments for the authors' consideration:</p><p>1) It is important to validate the antibody used for immunofluorescence work in the KO mice. If it is selective, then the signal should not be detected in the PFC (or elsewhere) in the KO mice. It is understood that bands were not detected in KO tissues when using this antibody for immunoblotting. But, frequently antibodies that are relatively selective when used for immunoblotting will bind nonspecifically when used for immunoimaging.</p><p>2) It appears from the presented immunoimaging that GPR158 is not cortically-enriched but rather expressed in most brain regions captured in the representative brain slice that is shown, with the exception of the white matter tracts as expected. This begs the question of whether GPR158 is active in other brain regions and if similar effects as those reported for the PFC in mice would have been detected when GPR158 expression is manipulated in other brain regions implicated in the regulation of depression-related behaviors, such as the hippocampus, accumbens etc. In other words, there are no anatomical controls in the current data-set to confirm that reported effects are anatomically selective. This is not a major issue, as the reported data are compelling, but some data related to other brain sites would have further strengthened the manuscript.</p><p>3) Greater consideration should be given to the endogenous agonist for GPR158, and more broadly the likely signaling mechanisms for the receptor should be presented in the manuscript. I am not suggesting that the authors seek to de-orphanize the receptor as this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, is there any evidence from the published literature that hints at the identity of the endogenous agonist? Is GPR158 directly activated by glucocorticoids? To which intracellular signaling complex does GPR158 couple?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33273.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It is important to delineate the functions of Gpr158 in specific populations of PFC neurons because the functions in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons may differ. Without that information, overexpression of Gpr158 in all PFC neurons is difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>The current manuscript deals primarily with the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the PFC. The following lines of evidence that we present indicates that Gpr158 significantly impacts their function. 1) morphological changes induced by Gpr158 loss occur in glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); 2) changes in synaptic strength and AMPA receptor function upon ablation of Gpr158 also happen in glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The identity of neurons examined in these datasets may not have been made sufficiently clear and we clarified this upon revision. Additionally, we solidify the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic neurons by supplying the following new data in the revised manuscript. 3) We showed that stress specifically regulates Gpr158 levels only in glutamatergic and not GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). In these experiments we subjected mice to stress and examined cell-specificity of Gpr158 modulation. Because Gpr158 plays a role in controlling depressive–like phenotypes that we document by both gain and loss of function studies and because these changes are precipitated by stress we think that these data serve as an additional evidence for the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic neurons in controlling behavioral outcomes. 4) We additionally report changes in processing neurotransmitter inputs onto glutamatergic neurons obtained by patch clamping glutamatergic neurons specifically and recording their sEPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The modulation of sEPSC frequency that we observe in this population further argues for the involvement of Gpr158 in controlling the signal processing by glutamatergic neurons. We feel that together this dataset provides compelling evidence pointing to Gpr158 action in glutamatergic neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Of the many GABAergic neurons, is Gpr158 expression restricted to the parvalbumin-expressing neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The format and quantification that we used in the original manuscript may have been unclear and did not directly support the intent of examining the cell specificity of Gpr158 expression. In our study we used latest generation of in situ hybridization technique that provides cellular resolution of mRNA expression to define the expression of Gpr158 in the cellular populations of the PFC based on double labeling with known cellular markers. In accordance with the published literature we detect that ~70% in the region are glutamatergic, ~11% are GABAergic and ~19% are glia. The expression of Gpr158 is detected in all glutamatergic neurons and none in glia. We also detect Gpr158 expression in most GABAergic neurons. However, given their diversity, the attribution to specific subtypes is not as straightforward due to overlapping marker expression, lack of the specific subtype markers for many Gpr158-expressing cells and limitation of the in situ technique that only allows dual labeling. On re-examination of the data we came to the conclusion that we cannot confidently determine the identity of the SST+ cells that do not express Gpr158. In the revised manuscript we simplified the analysis to avoid possible confusion and misattribution by focusing on Gpr158 expressing cells and defining what markers they express. This analysis is straightforward and shows that 90% of Gpr158 positive cells are glutamatergic neurons, 10% are Gad1 positive, 1.5% are parvalbumin positive and none of the ~750 cells examined in each double in situ hybridization experiment show co-expression with glial markers or somatostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We feel that because the current study emphasized the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic neurons and does not study the effects in GABAergic population, subdivision of their expression in GABAergic neurons may be not essential but rather detracting from the main points of the paper, hence these claims were de-emphasized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The signaling pathways engaged in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons should be established, at least to the level of knowing whether it is excitatory or inhibitory.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we provide the results of systematic analysis of signaling pathways engaged by Gpr158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We performed a screen looking at a variety of signaling molecules impacted by Gpr158 ablation in the PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-B</xref>). Most notably this includes the discovery that Gpr158 loss significantly upregulates neurotrophic factor BDNF and that this effect is mediated by changes in eEF2 phosphorylation which regulates local translation rather than affected by transcriptional upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-E</xref>). Identification of BDNF as a signaling mediator of Gpr158 effects is exciting because it further mechanistically links signaling changes to observed changes in neuronal morphology as well as antidepressant effects that alter AMPA/NMDAR function, such as ketamine. Given consistent increase in virtually all measures reporting increase in neuronal activity: synaptic strength, sEPSC), spine number, cAMP, AMPA receptor currents and BDNF expression observed upon Gpr158 loss, we think this data strongly suggests that Gpr158 is an inhibitory receptor. This point is addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Because Gpr158 is expressed widely in the brain, the effect of knockout or knockdown of Gpr158 in the PFC (ideally in pyramidal or glia cells) on behavior is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The main emphasis of this paper is on molecular mediators that control stress induced changes in depression. We identified that stress upregulates Gpr158 levels specifically in the PFC. To further reinforce regional specificity of this effect we added results examining modulation of Gpr158 levels across different brain regions involved in depressive like behaviors (Cerebellum, Caudate/Putamen, Nucleus Accumbens and Hippocampus) that shows exclusive modulation of Gpr158 in the PFC prompting us to focus current study on this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The viral overexpression of Gpr158 in the PFC and the rescue of Gpr158 specifically in the PFC of knockout mice provides sufficient evidence supporting the contribution of Gpr158 in this region to stress mediated depression. Given that we report that Gpr158 upregulates AMPA receptor function in the PFC, we solidify our evidence by demonstrating that partial blockade of AMPA receptor function by subthreshold doses on NBQX administration reverses the antidepressant-like effects in Gpr158 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Lastly, given the lack of Gpr158 expression in glia, the neuronal specific tropism of Ad virus with synaptophysin promoter that we used for the expression of Gpr158 in the PFC, we do not think that glial specific knockdown or rescue experiments are warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the lack of Gpr158 regulation by stress in GABAergic neurons makes knockdown or rescue of this protein specifically in this population tangential to the main emphasis and conclusions of this study.</p><p>We would also like to note that although we show changes in PFC to be sufficient in explaining Gpr158 behavioral effects (viral overexpression/knockout in the PFC) we cannot formally exclude possible role that Gpr158 also plays in other regions in contributing to anti-depressant behaviors (unrelated to stress), which in no way invalidates our findings in the PFC. Collectively, we are able to conclude that Gpr158 in the glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC is sufficient to drive stress-induced changes in the behavior. This will not completely exclude the role Gpr158 has in GABAergic neurons but we believe this line of research is beyond of the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss the possibility that osteocalcin is an endogenous ligand for Gpr158 and what significance that has for interpretation of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. The rapid progress in understanding GPR158 functions in the brain is exciting. We would like to note that the osteocalcin report was published while this manuscript was already in the peer review process. We are certainly happy to discuss this new development, however, we feel that extending our report along these lines experimentally may better be suited for future studies. Comparing our results in PFC with the data reported in the hippocampus reveals that there may be major significant differences in GPR158 signaling properties between neurons of PFC and hippocampus. While this is not entirely unusual for a GPCR to exhibit region selective signaling bias, determining the exact mechanisms and possible presence of additional endogenous ligands is outside of the scope of the current report, which is already quite extensive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should validate the antibody used in their studies more thoroughly and describe the genetic background and breeding strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>The antibodies used were for Western blotting and have been thoroughly validated using KO tissues. The results showed the complete lack of the band that we consider to be Gpr158, thus confirming the specificity for this application. We did not use these antibodies for the immunohistochemistry because they produce diffuse neuropilar staining pattern (although specific), which does not allow easy attribution of cell specificity. Therefore, instead we have used the latest generation fluorescent in situ hybridization that provides sensitive detection of mRNA expression with high specificity and cellular resolution. We may not have been sufficiently clear as to what technique we have used to characterize Gpr158 expression and we have since clarified this in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have included control that established specificity of in situ hybridization reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>In terms of the genetic background – the mice were generated on a pure C57BL6 background and have been maintained as heterozygous breeding pairs producing -/- and +/+ littermates used of all of the studies in the paper. We relied exclusively on littermates for all the comparisons. Again, we will clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The GPR158-Ad virus presumably infects all cells in the PFC, including those that do not normally express this GPCR.

Restoring GPR158 in neurons that normally make it in the PFC on a KO background and performing the behavioral and electrophysiological experiments would go a long way towards solidifying this story.</p></disp-quote><p>The current paper focuses on the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic neurons. Here we have shown that the morphological changes induced by Gpr158 loss occur in glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the changes in synaptic strength and AMPA receptor function in Gpr158 KO also happen in glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The identity of neurons examined in these experiments may not have been made clear and we have clarified this in the revision. Furthermore, we have added additional data to demonstrate the role of Gpr158 in glutamatergic neurons. In series of experiments we examined the cell-specific modulation of Gpr158 levels following chronic stress. We found that the increase in Gpr158 levels were only found in glutamatergic and not GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also investigated the changes in processing neurotransmitter inputs onto glutamatergic neurons obtained by patch clamping glutamatergic neurons specifically and recording their sEPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref>). Together, this demonstrates the role of Gpr158 action in glutamatergic neurons. We do not argue that Gpr158 in the GABAergic neurons may have an additional role in modulating behavioral outcomes but it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine this contribute in depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The genetic background of the GPR158 WT and KO mice used here should be indicated. Were the WT and KO mice used for these studies littermates derived from breeding heterozygotes? If not, there is concern that WT and KO mice used for studies may have subtle genetic background differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The breeding strategy and genetic background has been clarified in the Materials and methods section. The mice were generated on a C57/BL6 background and were maintained as heterozygous breeding pairs to generate Gpr158<sup>-/-</sup> and Gpr158<sup>+/+</sup> mice that were used in the studies. We relied exclusively on littermates for all the comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A recent study suggests that GPR158 is activated by osteocalcin (J Exp Med 214, 2859), that it participates in hippocampal memory and that it is coupled to G-α-q signaling. The results in this study do not seem to be compatible with G-α-q signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to major point #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Over-expression is not directed to any cell type, so while the behavioral data is robust, it is challenging to interpret. Of additional concern, this is only explored in male mice. given later data in the KO mice was examined in males and female mice, seem like a useful comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that the over-expression of Gpr158 from the viral manipulations is not specific to any cell type. However, to address the concerns of cell-type specificity we have identified in which cell-type Gpr158 is affected following chronic stress. In these experiments mice were subjected to chronic stress and using in situ hybridization techniques we were able to quantify Gpr158 mRNA levels in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that stress specifically regulates Gpr158 levels only in glutamatergic and not GABAergic neurons. This additional data can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We found that both male and female knockout mice showed the same phenotype in the behavioral assays (marble burying, elevated plus maze, tail suspension and force swim test) and as such the subsequent viral overexpression studies were only performed in male mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The knockout data is compelling in such that deletion from birth can induce changes in behavior, synaptic function independent of stress exposure. This raises the issue that there could be a developmental compensation from the deletion of the receptor.</p><p>Because of these issues, I think a more robust analysis would be a viral knockdown of GPR158 prior to stress exposure to parse out role of developmental deletion. These issues are not addressed in the manuscript, and given the novelty of these findings and the potential length of time it would take to repeat these experiments with a knockdown approach, I would also be favorable if there were a more in depth discussion of these concerns in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Like all studies involving transgenic mice there is always a concern that the deletion of a specific protein maybe due to a developmental compensation. However, the viral studies whereby we overexpressed Gpr158 in mPFC of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and rescued Gpr158 in the knockout model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) of adult mice suggests that the behavioral effects are not due to developmental compensation from the lack of Gpr158. We have also addressed this issue in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors present data showing that layer 2/3 neurons in the mPFC are altered. Given the expression of this protein in nearly all GABA neurons, this is an incomplete analysis. These particular experiments, recording from different cell types in KO and WT mice, would be very helpful in clarifying molecular/synaptic adaptations.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have performed additional experiments directly recording from glutamatergic neurons in layer of 2/3 PFC. The results additionally corroborated our conclusions about alterations in the function of these neurons caused by GPR158 deletion and were incorporated in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref>). For the reasons explained above (see responses to major points #1 and #2) we restricted our focus on studying glutamatergic neurons only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The near total exclusion of this GPCR in SST neurons is stunning. It is a bit confusing how the expression in GABA neurons is so high, but nothing in SST. It would be useful to flush this out a bit more with triple labeling, to provide further evidence of this selective expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in our response to the major point #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) It is important to validate the antibody used for immunofluorescence work in the KO mice. If it is selective, then the signal should not be detected in the PFC (or elsewhere) in the KO mice. It is understood that bands were not detected in KO tissues when using this antibody for immunoblotting. But, frequently antibodies that are relatively selective when used for immunoblotting will bind nonspecifically when used for immunoimaging.</p></disp-quote><p>The antibodies used were for Western blotting and have been thoroughly validated using KO tissues. The results showed the complete lack of the band that we consider to be Gpr158, thus confirming the specificity for this application. We did not use these antibodies for the immunohistochemistry because they produce diffuse neuropilar staining pattern (although specific) which does not allow easy attribution of cell specificity. Therefore, instead we have used the latest generation fluorescent in situ hybridization that provides sensitive detection of mRNA expression with high specificity and cellular resolution. The current manuscript may have not been sufficiently clear as to what technique we have used to characterize Gpr158 expression and we have since clarified this issue. In addition, we included control that establishes specificity of in situ hybridization reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It appears from the presented immunoimaging that GPR158 is not cortically-enriched but rather expressed in most brain regions captured in the representative brain slice that is shown, with the exception of the white matter tracts as expected. This begs the question of whether GPR158 is active in other brain regions and if similar effects as those reported for the PFC in mice would have been detected when GPR158 expression is manipulated in other brain regions implicated in the regulation of depression-related behaviors, such as the hippocampus, accumbens etc. In other words, there are no anatomical controls in the current data-set to confirm that reported effects are anatomically selective. This is not a major issue, as the reported data are compelling, but some data related to other brain sites would have further strengthened the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Gpr158 is indeed broadly expressed in the brain. To address regional specificity, we have analyzed Gpr158 protein levels following stress in other brain regions including nucleus accumbens, caudate/putamen, cerebellum and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We only observed the upregulation of Gpr158 in the mPFC following chronic-stress exposure. While we cannot rule out the importance of Gpr158 in other brain regions, we can conclude that Gpr158 in the mPFC is sufficient to drive stress-mediated responses. We have also addressed this concept of regional specificity in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Greater consideration should be given to the endogenous agonist for GPR158, and more broadly the likely signaling mechanisms for the receptor should be presented in the manuscript. I am not suggesting that the authors seek to de-orphanize the receptor as this is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, is there any evidence from the published literature that hints at the identity of the endogenous agonist? Is GPR158 directly activated by glucocorticoids? To which intracellular signaling complex does GPR158 couple?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we provide evidence for signaling pathways engaged by Gpr158. We performed a screen looking at a variety of signaling molecules impacted by Gpr158 ablation in the PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-B</xref>). Most notably this includes the discovery that Gpr158 loss significantly upregulates neurotrophic factor BDNF and that this effect is mediated by changes in eEF2 phosphorylation which regulates local translation rather than affected by transcriptional upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-E</xref>). Identification of BDNF as a signaling mediator of Gpr158 effects is exciting because it further mechanistically links signaling changes to observed changes in neuronal morphology as well as antidepressant effects that alter AMPA/NMDAR function, such as ketamine. We have also discussed possible endogenous agonists for Gpr158 and its possible region selective effects on signaling in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
