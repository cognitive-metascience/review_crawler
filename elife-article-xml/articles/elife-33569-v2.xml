Synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies, a phenomenon called codon usage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikemura, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sharp et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comeron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hershberg and Petrov, 2008</xref>). Highly expressed proteins are mostly encoded by genes with preferred codons, and codon optimization has been routinely used to enhance heterologous protein expression. In addition, positive correlations between codon usage and protein expression levels are observed in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiraoka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999</xref>). These results suggest that codon usage plays an important role in regulating gene expression levels. Efficient and accurate translation was thought to be a major selection force for codon usage biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiraoka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lampson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pershing et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies also demonstrated that codon usage affects co-translational protein folding by regulating translation elongation rate in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spencer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pechmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the correlation between codon usage and gene expression level can be explained by translation efficiency, recent studies suggest that overall translation efficiency is mainly determined by translation initiation, a process that is mostly determined by RNA structure but not codon usage near the translational start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pop et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, codon usage was found to be an important determinant of RNA levels in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boël et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kudla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krinner et al., 2014</xref>). In some organisms, codon usage was shown to affect RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boël et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kudla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krinner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mishima and Tomari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic> and mammalian cells, codon usage has also been shown to be an important determinant of gene transcription levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Newman et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, codon usage can regulate gene expression beyond the translation process.</p><p>Transcription termination is a critical process in regulating gene expression. In eukaryotes, the maturation of mRNA is a two-step process involving endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent RNA followed by the synthesis of the polyadenosine (poly(A)) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian and Graber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>). The polyadenylation sites, also known as the poly(A) sites or pA sites, are defined by surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements recognized by multiple proteins. These <italic>cis</italic>-elements, called poly(A) signals, are generally AU-rich sequences and have conserved nucleotide composition in eukaryotes. In mammals, the hexamer AAUAAA (or other close variants), referred as polyadenylation signal (PAS), is one of the most prominent poly(A) signals. Other <italic>cis</italic>-elements, such as upstream U-rich elements, downstream U-rich element, and downstream GU-rich element, also play important roles in the transcription termination process. In yeast, poly(A) signals include an upstream efficiency element (EE), an upstream position element (PE), which is equivalent to PAS in mammals, and two U-rich elements flanking the poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mata, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlackow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017a</xref>). Mutation of these poly(A) signals impairs the efficiency of transcription termination and leads to defect in mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian and Graber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although most of the transcriptional events terminate in 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of protein-coding genes, premature transcription termination (PTT) also occurs in 5’ UTR, intron and exon, which is also referred as premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). For example, premature transcription termination occurs in the intron of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FCA gene and is involved in the control of flowering timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quesada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macknight et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, PCPA in intron is a conserved regulatory mechanism for CstF-77 gene from fly to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchelson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). Recent genome-wide studies have shown that PCPA within introns is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>). In addition, PCPA also occurs within coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>). It has been shown that the expression of heterologous gene can be suppressed due to PCPA in coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diehn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tokuoka et al., 2008</xref>). PCPA also occurs in coding regions of endogenous genes in both yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Georis et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, many poly(A) sites have been mapped to coding regions using poly(A) sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Codon optimization has been previously shown to increase heterologous gene expression in <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tokuoka et al., 2008</xref>). However, the effect of codon usage on premature transcription termination of endogenous genes is not clear.</p><p>The filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> exhibits a strong codon usage bias for C or G at wobble positions and has been an important model organism studying the roles of codon usage biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Radford and Parish, 1997</xref>).In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, codon usage is a major determinant of gene expression levels and correlates strongly with protein and RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). We showed previously that codon usage can regulate mRNA levels at the level of transcription by influencing chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we showed that premature transcription termination within open reading frames is affected by codon usage bias. Moreover, a similar phenomenon is observed in mouse, another C/G-biased organism. Therefore, in addition to effects on translation, transcription termination serves as a conserved driving force in shaping codon usage biases in C/G-biased organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Codon deoptimization of the amino-terminal end of the <italic>frq</italic> open reading frame abolishes the production of full-length mRNA</title><p>We previously showed that codon optimization of circadian clock gene <italic>frequency</italic> (<italic>frq</italic>) leads to changes in FRQ expression level and protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the impact of non-optimal codons on FRQ expression, we codon deoptimized the amino-terminal end of <italic>frq</italic> ORF (amino acids 12–163) by replacing the wild-type codons with non-optimal synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the <italic>frq</italic>-deopt1 construct, 59 codons were replaced by non-optimal codons. In the <italic>frq</italic>-deopt2 construct, 98 codons were replaced by the least preferred codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These two constructs and the wild-type <italic>frq</italic> (wt-<italic>frq</italic>) construct were transformed individually into an <italic>frq</italic> knock-out strain (<italic>frq<sup>KO</sup></italic>) at the <italic>his-3</italic> locus by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronson et al., 1994a</xref>). In the strains expressing the wild-type <italic>frq</italic> construct, the production of conidia (asexual spore) was rhythmic with a period of about 22 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the conidiation rhythm of the strains expressing the two codon-deoptimized <italic>frq</italic> constructs was abolished, indicating that the deoptimized <italic>frq</italic> genes are not functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, no FRQ expression was detected in either of the deoptimized strains by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using an H3K9me3 antibody, however, showed that the H3K9me3 levels at the <italic>frq</italic> locus were comparable in the wild-type <italic>frq</italic> and <italic>frq</italic>-deopt2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that the loss of full-length <italic>frq</italic> mRNA in the deoptimized <italic>frq</italic> is not due to H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional silencing. Transcription of <italic>frq</italic> is activated by the binding of the complex of White Collar-1 (WC-1) and White Collar-2 (WC-2) to the <italic>frq</italic> promoter, and the expression of FRQ inhibits WC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heintzen and Liu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunlap, 2006</xref>).

Consistent with this result, strand-specific RT-qPCR using a set of primers targeted to an intronic region in the 5’ UTR of <italic>frq</italic> showed that the <italic>frq</italic> pre-mRNA was increased significantly in the <italic>frq</italic>-deopt2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we performed northern blot analysis using a probe targeted to the 5’ end of <italic>frq</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To limit false positive reads, we used a low concentration of reverse transcription (RT) primer during sequencing library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scotto-Lavino et al., 2006</xref>) and a stringent filtering procedure for data analysis (see Materials and methods). It should be noted that the poly(A) sites identified by this method may not be only limited from those generated by the PAS-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">West et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LaCava et al., 2005</xref>). Two biological replicates of 2P-seq results were highly consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating the reliability of the method. Approximately 20 million reads were generated from two independent samples. The vast majority of these reads were mapped to 3’ UTRs of genes (i.e. annotated 3’ UTR plus 1000 nt downstream) and the rest of reads were mapped to ORFs, introns, 5’ UTRs, and intergenic regions. We focused our analysis on the reads mapped to the 3’ UTRs and ORFs, with deduced poly(A) sites referred as 3’ UTR-pA and ORF-pA, respectively. The putative PAS regions (including −30 ~ −10nt A-rich region and −10 ~+10 nt U-rich region) are referred as 3’ UTR-PAS and ORF-PAS, respectively.

Similar to previous results from analysis of yeast transcription termination regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian and Graber, 2012</xref>), the sequence profile surrounding 3’ UTR-pA sites in <italic>Neurospora</italic> has an upstream A-rich region located at −30 to −10 nucleotides from poly(A) site and two U-rich regions at −10 to 0 nucleotides and at 0 to +10 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, the U-rich region immediately downstream of the poly(A) site is much less prominent than that in yeast (see below). The poly(A) site is usually located between C and A nucleotides. A motif search of most enriched hexamers within the A-rich region was performed to identify putative PAS motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, AAUAAA and AUUAAA are the two most frequently used PAS motifs and are found in ~80% of all 3’ UTR-PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian and Graber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manley, 2015</xref>). The PAS motifs in <italic>Neurospora</italic> are much more degenerated with AAUGAA being the most abundant and AAUAAA is the third most-enriched motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Although the nucleotide profile surrounding ORF-pA sites was similar to that of 3’ UTR-pA sites with A-rich and U-rich elements upstream of the C/A poly(A) site, there does not appear to be a U-rich region downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, the hexamer motifs in the A-rich region of ORF-PASs were quite degenerative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Among the top 15 most enriched hexamer motifs, only five were shared between ORF-PAS and 3’ UTR-PAS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). To further compare 3’ UTR-PAS and ORF-PAS, we generated consensus PAS sequences to build position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for PAS regions by using sequences (−30 ~+10 nt) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). The PSSMs were then used to score all 3’ UTR-PASs and ORF-PASs. A high PAS score indicates a high similarity to the consensus and, presumably, a stronger signal for transcription termination. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, ORF-PASs generally show lower PAS scores than that of 3’ UTR-PASs. These results suggest that premature transcription termination within ORFs occurs through a mechanism similar to that in the 3’ UTR with recognition of the poly(A) site mostly mediated by non-canonical poly(A) signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Strong genome-wide correlations between codon usage and premature transcription termination</title><p>To understand the role of codon usage in PCPA, we examined the genome-wide correlations between gene codon usage and transcription termination events within <italic>Neurospora</italic> ORFs.

The ratios were less than 10% for 95% of the genes with ORF-pA, which should be due to that these non-canonical poly(A) signals within ORFs are less efficient in promoting premature cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2011</xref>) or that the premature terminated RNAs are unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doma and Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vanacova and Stefl, 2007</xref>).

Codon optimization led to not only the loss of the putative PAS motif (AAUCAA) but also mutation of its immedi﻿﻿﻿ate surrounding sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that the codon optimization completely abolished the premature termination product of the <italic>gfp-NCU09435</italic> fusion gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating the importance of the PAS motif and its surrounding sequence on premature transcription termination.</p><p><italic>NCU02034</italic> has no detectable premature termination events even though it has a potential PAS motif (AAUAAA) within its ORF.

Using this reporter, we showed that codon deoptimization abolished the expression of full-length transcript, and transcription was prematurely terminated around the deoptimized region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results demonstrate the importance of codon usage and <italic>cis</italic>-elements around the PAS motif in promoting premature transcription termination.</p><p>To further understand how codon usage bias influences premature transcription termination, we determined the codon usage frequency of every codon within the −10 to −30 regions upstream of all identified ORF-pA sites. The frequency of each codon was then normalized to the frequency of the same codon from randomly chosen regions from the same gene set to create the normalized codon usage frequency (NCUF). For a given codon, a positive NCUF value means that this codon occurs more frequently within the PAS region relative to other regions of the gene; a negative value indicates that a codon occurs less frequently. Overall, there is a strong negative correlation (r = −0.55) between NCUF with the relative synonymous codon adaptiveness (RSCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roth et al., 2012</xref>) of all codon groups with at least two synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, amino acids encoded by A/T-rich codons, such as isoleucine, lysine, asparagine, and tyrosine, are over-represented within the region upstream of poly(A) sites in ORFs. These results indicate that rare codons are preferentially used upstream of the poly(A) sites within ORFs.</p><p>In addition to codon usage bias, pairs of synonymous codons are also not used equally in the genome, a phenomenon called codon pair bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutman and Hatfield, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moura et al., 2007</xref>). Since PAS motifs are hexamers, we examined codon pair usage in the region surrounding the ORF-pA sites. We determined codon pair frequencies in 12106 ORF-PAS sequences (−30 ~ −10nt) that belongs to 4557 genes and normalized the values with background codon pair frequencies randomly chosen from the same gene set to generate normalized codon pair frequency (NCPF). For a given codon pair, a positive value of NCPF means that this codon pair is over-represented. Remarkably, when codon pairs are ranked based on NCPF, the five most enriched codon pairs are all made of two of the least preferred codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). For example, AAUAGA is the most enriched codon pair and is 25-fold enriched in this region relative to the genome frequency and is one of the most often observed PAS motifs in 3’ UTRs and ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). These results support our hypothesis that the use of rare codons leads to the formation of potential PAS motifs and transcription termination, whereas the use of preferred codons in <italic>Neurospora</italic> genes suppresses premature transcription termination events to ensure expression of full-length mRNAs by depleting the formation of potential PAS motifs.</p><p>To examine whether the presence of single PAS motif is sufficient to terminate transcription, we performed the following analysis. We searched for all the DNA fragments containing a putative PAS motif in ORFs and 3’ UTRs of all <italic>Neurospora</italic> genes and divided them into two groups: ‘true PAS’, which have at least one identified pA site within the 5-35nt downstream region, and ‘false PAS’, which don’t have a pA site (see Materials and methods for details). In 3’ UTR, 17404 are true PAS motifs and 20643 false PAS motifs. We compared the nucleotide composition between these two groups and found out that the AU contents of surrounding the true PAS motifs were higher than those of the false PAS motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the coding region, 4468 true PAS and 80086 false PAS were found. The ratio of true PAS to false PAS in ORF (true PAS/false PAS=0.086) is much lower than that in the 3’ UTR (1.03), indicating that a single PAS motif alone is not sufficient to trigger PCPA in the ORFs. Similar to the 3’ UTR, AU contents of surrounding true PAS motifs were also higher than those of false PAS motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>cis</italic>-elements surrounding PAS are also important for transcription termination in the 3’ UTR and ORF. Consistent with this conclusion, a false PAS in <italic>NCU02034</italic> can be turned into a true PAS by deoptimizing the codons surrounding PAS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the codon usage surrounding true PAS or false PAS (see Materials and Methods). We determined the codon usage frequency of every codon surrounding true PAS and then normalized by that of the same codon surrounding false PAS to create the relative codon usage frequency (RCUF) (see Method and Material for details). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>, there was a strong negative correlation (r = −0.66) between RCUF with RSCA of all codon groups with at least two synonymous codons. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between RCUF and RSCA within every codon group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results indicate that rare codons are preferentially used in the regions surrounding true PAS motif and are critical for promoting premature transcription termination. Together, these results suggest that codon usage affects premature transcription termination in <italic>Neurospora</italic> by creating potential PAS motif and its surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Transcription termination events in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, an organism with A/U-biased codon usage</title><p>The mechanism of transcription termination is largely conserved in eukaryotic organisms and requires similar A/U-rich motifs despite distinct codon usage biases of different genomes.

To examine whether premature transcription termination is also affected by codon usage bias in mammals, we analyzed the recently available high-quality poly(A)-seq data from mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). By combining the data from four replicates of C2C12 myoblast control samples, we identified 2564 poly(A) sites within the ORFs of 1429 genes. We compared the nucleotide profile of ORF-PAS to that of 3’ UTR-PAS and we found that the upstream U-rich region (−15 to −1) and the downstream GU-rich region (+5 to+20) largely disappeared and the AU content decreased in ORF-PASs, suggesting that non-canonical poly(A) signals are used for the premature transcription termination in ORFs in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with this result, we found that ORF-PASs have significantly lower PAS scores than 3’UTR-PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, although AAUAAA and AUUAAA are the top two most frequently used PAS motifs in ORF-PAS, their frequencies are much lower than to that in 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). As in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>), widespread premature transcription termination events in introns were found in mouse with 10923 poly(A) sites in the introns of 8345 genes.

We found that there was a negative correlation between normalized ORF/3’UTR termination and CBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) or CAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that premature transcription termination is also affected by codon usage in mouse. Although C or G is also preferred at the wobble positions in mouse, its codon usage bias is not as strong as that is observed in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, unlike in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, ORFs in mouse are often consist of small exons, which are separated by large introns. These facts may explain the negative correlations between the normalized ORF/3’UTR termination and codon usage bias in mouse is not as strong as that in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Next, we calculated the normalized codon usage frequency for the −10 to −30 regions upstream of all ORF-pA sites in mouse. As in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, a negative correlation between NCUF and RSCA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, the negative correlation between NCUF and RSCA was found within most synonymous codon groups, except for histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In addition, PAS motifs (AAUAAA and AUUAAA) were among the top three most enriched codon pairs and are over 16-fold enriched in this region relative to the genome frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results indicate that codon preference surrounding ORF-PAS is substantially different from the rest of ORFs. As in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the nucleotide U content surrounding the true PAS motifs of 3’ UTR and ORF was higher than that of the false PAS in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). Together, these analyses suggest that codon usage biases co-evolved with transcription termination machinery to limit premature transcription termination in C/G-biased organisms from <italic>Neurospora</italic> to mouse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Codon usage is an important determinant of protein expression levels in different organisms. The effects of codon usage bias were thought mainly due to its influence on protein translation. We previously showed that codon usage affects chromatin structures and is a major determinant of mRNA levels by affecting gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that codon usage can impact gene expression beyond translation. In this study, we demonstrated that premature cleavage and polyadenylation in coding region is affected by codon usage biases.</p><p>Our conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, replacing wild-type codons with rare codon in parts of the circadian clock gene <italic>frq</italic> abolished expression of the full-length mRNA transcript due to premature transcription termination. Second, by identifying the rare codons important for premature transcription termination, we showed that rare codons created potential poly(A) signals, including PAS motif and other upstream and downstream <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Introduction of a single rare codon in the correct context caused premature transcription termination and had a significant effect on <italic>frq</italic> gene expression. In contrast, the use of optimal codons can suppress premature transcription termination and promote the expression of full-length transcript. Third, genome-wide identification of mRNA poly(A) sites uncovered 12106 premature termination sites in the ORFs of 4557 genes, indicating that premature transcription termination within ORFs is a wide-spread phenomenon in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. Importantly, we discovered a strong genome-wide negative correlation between gene codon usage and premature transcription termination events in <italic>Neurospora</italic> genes. Fourth, the regions around the premature termination sites are highly enriched in rare codons and rare codon pairs. Fifth, by comparing nucleotide profile and codon usage bias between true PAS and false PAS, we found that rare codons not only create PAS motif but also other surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements important for transcription termination. Since gene codon usage strongly correlates with mRNA and protein expression levels in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), these results suggest that differential effects of synonymous codons on transcription and premature transcription termination contribute to the determination of gene expression levels. Consistent with our conclusion, a previous study in yeast has shown that codon usage affects stability of antisense transcripts by generation or depletion of the Nrd1 and Nab3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cakiroglu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The codon usage of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> genome is strongly C/G biased at the wobble positions. Transcription termination in eukaryotes relies on multiple A/U rich <italic>cis</italic>-elements around the poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian and Graber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuehner et al., 2011</xref>). Clusters of rare codons in <italic>Neurospora</italic> appear to form the A/U rich poly(A) signal that can be recognized by transcription termination machinery. Our analyses of poly(A)-seq results in mouse cells, which also has a C/G-biased codon usage, suggest that codon usage bias also play a role in suppressing premature transcription termination within ORFs. Therefore, codon usage bias is a conserved mechanism for C/G-biased genomes to promote gene expression by suppressing PTT. Consistent with this conclusion, it has been previously shown that codon optimization is required for high-level expression of heterologous genes in <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, probably by preventing premature transcription termination in an exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tokuoka et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although a similar mechanism as that of 3’UTR is employed, non-canonical poly(A) signals are used for premature cleavage and polyadenylation within coding regions. First, the nucleotide profile of ORF-PAS is different from that of 3’ UTR-PAS. In <italic>Neurospora,</italic> the downstream U-rich region is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) whereas the upstream U-rich region and the downstream GU-rich region largely disappeared in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, compared to the PAS motifs in 3’ UTR, the non-canonical poly(A) signals within ORFs are less efficient to terminate transcription, resulting in the low ratio of ORF to 3’ UTR termination events observed both in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). The use of non-canonical poly(A) signals may also affect the fate of prematurely terminated transcripts. It has been shown that prematurely terminated transcripts are rapidly degraded in the cytosol and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Hoof et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doma and Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vanacova and Stefl, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic> and mouse, the ratio of true PAS motifs in coding regions is much lower than that in the 3’ UTR, suggesting that PCPA in coding region is mostly suppressed by optimal codons surrounding PAS signal. Even though the non-canonical poly(A) signals are less efficient, a gene with poor codon usage can have multiple such sites, which can have a major impact on mRNA levels.</p><p>By analyzing the mRNA termination sites in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> which has a strong A/U-biased codon usage, we also identified many premature transcription termination events in ORFs. In contrast to <italic>Neurospora</italic>, there is little or no correlation between codon usage and premature transcription termination events in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> suggesting that codon usage does not contribute significantly to premature transcription in organisms with A/U-biased genomes. Comparison of the nucleotide composition around transcription termination sites in 3’ UTRs and in ORFs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> showed that they share a U-rich motif downstream of the cleavage sites, which has been shown to be important for transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dichtl and Keller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Helden et al., 2000</xref>). Such a U-rich element is largely missing in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. These results suggest that both C/G- and A/U-biased genomes adapt with transcription termination mechanisms to use different mechanisms to prevent premature transcription termination. The C/G-biased organisms such as <italic>Neurospora</italic> use C/G-biased codons to prevent the formation of poly(A) signals, thus suppressing premature transcription termination, whereas the A/U-biased organisms relies on more stringent sequence requirements for poly(A) signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>gene (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td><italic>frequencey</italic> (<italic>frq</italic>)</td><td>NA</td><td>NCBI Gene ID:3876095</td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td><italic>NCU09435</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>NCBI Gene ID:3874734</td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td><italic>NCU00931</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>NCBI Gene ID:3880910</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td>4200</td><td>PMID:155773</td><td/><td>Strain maintained in Yi Liu's lab</td></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td>303–3 (<italic>bd</italic>, <italic>frq10</italic>, <italic>his-3</italic>)</td><td>PMID:8052643</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>strain (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>)</td><td>301–6 (<italic>bd</italic>, <italic>his-3</italic>, A)</td><td>PMCID: PMC180927</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-FRQ</td><td>PMID:9150146</td><td/><td>Rabbit polyclonal;

First, nuclear RNA was used instead of total RNA. Second, the primer sequence was re-designed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), so that multiple libraries could be sequenced in the same lane using Illumina sequencer. Third, a lower concentration of RT primer was used during reverse transcription to reduce internal priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scotto-Lavino et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, poly(A) RNA was purified using oligo-dT25 beads (Invitrogen) and eluted directly into 25 μl of RNase T1 buffer. RNase T1 digestion was performed for 20 min at 22°C using 0.5 U RNase T1 (biochemistry grade, Ambion). After this partial RNase T1 digestion, reverse transcription was performed by addition of 1 μl 1 μM RT primer. Single-stranded cDNAs of 200–400 nucleotides were purified on a 6% TBE-urea gel, then circularized by CircLigaseII (Epicentre). Circularized cDNA was amplified by high-fidelity PCR for 10 cycles using barcoded PCR primers, then gel purified and sequenced using the Illumina Read one primer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay</title><p>ChIP assays were performed as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2013b</xref>). The tissues were cultured in 50 mL minimal medium and were fixed by adding 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The tissues were harvested and ground in the liquid nitrogen, and 100–200 μl tissue powder was suspended in 300 μl ChIP lysis buffer. Chromatin was sheared to about 500 bp fragments by sonication. In each reaction, 500 μg of total lysate and 2 μl antibody were added and incubated at 4°C overnight. The antibodies used in this study were: WC-2 (96), pol II S2P (Abcam, ab5095), and H3K9me3 (Active Motif, 39161). The ‘Input’ was 50 μg of total lysate. G-protein coupled beads (25 μl) were added, and samples were incubated for 2 hr. The beads washed at 4°C for 5 min with the following buffers: ChIP lysis buffer, low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LNDET buffer, and twice with TE buffer. We then added 140 μl 10% chelex beads (Sigma) and heated the samples at 96°C for 20 min. After centrifugation, 100 μl supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The Input DNA was de-crosslinked and extracted with phenol. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. For S2P and H3K9me3, the results were normalized to Input DNA and presented as Input %. For WC-2 ChIP, the results were further normalized to the internal control <italic>β-tubulin</italic>, and data are presented as relative WC-2 levels.

Trimmed raw reads were mapped strand specifically to the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> genome (v10) using Tophat software (v2.1.1). The reads with multiple targets identified using SAMtools were discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2009</xref>). To identify reads due to false priming at internal poly(A) stretches of mRNA, we searched for genomic sequences in the 20 nt downstream of the 3’ end position of mapped reads, and discarded the reads with six consecutive adenosines or ≥7 adenosines in 12-nt sliding windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoing et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tian et al., 2005</xref>).

We performed the analysis using the following steps: 1) Remove adapter sequences and retain reads with at least one adenosine at the 3’ end. 2) Remove the poly(A) stretch (≥1A), record the length of the poly(A) stretch for each read and discard the reads with a length shorter than 20 nt. 3) Map the processed reads with Tophat (v2.1.1) to the corresponding reference genome (Ensembl EF2 for <italic>S. pombe</italic> and UCSC mouse mm10, downloaded from iGenomes (Illumina). 4) Remove reads with multiple targets. 5) In order to avoid false positive signals, only the genomic sequences downstream of the 3’ end of mapped reads and retained reads with at least one untemplated A were analyzed. 6) Create bedgraph files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Poly(A) site or pA site identification in 3’ UTR and ORFs:</title><p>We first clustered sequences within 24 nt of the poly(A) site signals into peaks with BEDTools and recorded the number of reads falling in each peak (command: bedtools merge -s -d 24 c 4 -o count). We only retained those peaks with at least five reads for further analysis. We next determined the summit of each peak (i.e., the position with the highest signal) and took this peak to be the poly(A) site.</p><p>We classified the peaks into two different groups: peaks in 3’ UTRs and peaks in ORFs. Because of the likely inaccurate 3’ UTR annotations of genomic reference (i.e., GTF files of respective species), we set the 3’ UTR regions of each gene from the end of the ORF to the annotated 3’ end plus a 1-kbp extension. For a given gene, we analyzed all the peaks within the 3’ UTR region, compared the summits of each peak and selected the position with the highest summit as the major poly(A) site of the gene.</p><p>For ORFs, we retained the putative poly(A) sites for which the PAS region fully overlapped with exons that are annotated as ORFs. The range of PAS regions for different species was empirically determined as a region with high AT content around the ORF poly(A) site. For each species, we did the first round of test setting the PAS region from −30 to −10 upstream of the cleavage site, then analyzed AT distributions around the cleavage sites in ORFs to identify the actual PAS region.

Specifically, we focused on the putative PAS regions from either 3’ UTRs or ORFs. (1) We identified the most frequently occurring hexamer within PAS regions. (2) We calculated the dinucleotide frequencies of PAS regions, randomly shuffled the dinucleotides to create 1000 sequences, then counted the occurrence of the hexamer from step 1. (3) We tested the frequency of the hexamer from step one and retain it if its occurrence was ≥2 fold higher than that from random sequences (step 2) and if P-values were &lt;0.05 (binomial probability).

We also randomly selected 10 sequences with the same number of codons from the same ORFs and counted all possible codon and codon pairs.

Since condonW does not support mouse, CBI for each mouse gene is calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennetzen and Hall, 1982</xref>): CBI = (N<sub>opt</sub> –N<sub>ran</sub>)/(N<sub>tot</sub>-N<sub>ran</sub>). N<sub>opt</sub>, N<sub>ran</sub>, and N<sub>tot</sub> represent the number of optimal, random and total codons in a given gene, respectively. We arbitrarily define optimal and random codons as RSCA ≥0.9 or 0.3 &lt; RSCA &lt; 0.9, whereas codons with RSCA &lt;0.3 are defined as rare codons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-8"><title>Calculation of codon adaptation index (CAI):</title><p>We calculated CAI values for all predicted protein-encoding genes in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and mouse.

Specifically, we extracted all sequences surrounding 3’ UTR poly(A) sites (e.g. −30 ~+10 nt for <italic>Neurospora</italic>) to generate position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Each entry in the PSSM was calculated by M<sub>ij</sub> = log<sub>2</sub> (f<sub>ij</sub>/g<sub>i</sub>), where f<sub>ij</sub> is the frequency of nucleotide i at position j, and g<sub>i</sub> is the genomic frequency of nucleotide i. For each PAS sequence, the PAS score is the sum of scores retrieved based on the position of nucleotides. It can be shown as S =∑ <sub>j</sub>m<sub>i, j</sub>, where m<sub>i, j</sub> is the score of nucleotide i at position j in the PSSM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Identification of sequence and codon context surrounding 6nt PAS motif</title><p>We selected the top 40 6nt PAS motifs in 3’UTR in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, which account for 58% of 3’ UTR pA events of all expressed genes. For mice, we only selected the first 2 PAS motifs (AAUAAA and AUUAAA), which account for 77% of 3’ UTR pA events. We first determined the genome-wide location of those motifs in a strand-specific manner. Then we classified these motifs into two major groups (true PAS and false PAS) based on whether the downstream region (5-35nt) after the motifs have pA signals at same strand. Each of these two groups is further categorized into two subgroups, based on whether these motifs are fully located inside the coding region (ORF true/false PAS) or at 3’ UTR (UTR true/false PAS). For each group, 80nt DNA sequences flanking the motifs were collected and the A/T contents were calculated. Based on the A/T content difference between ORF true and false PAS group, we extracted codon sequences flanking the PAS motif with length equivalent. For <italic>Neurospora,</italic> we extract 15 codons at both upstream and downstream of PAS motif. For each group, we first counted the occurrence of each codon and then divided it by the number of all codons from selected regions to obtain the ratio of each codon. For each codon, the relative codon frequency is the base two logarithm (log2) of the normalized ratio by dividing the ratio from ORF-true PAS group with that from ORF-false PAS group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Noah Spies for providing the 2P-seq protocol and the members of our laboratory for technical assistance and discussion.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Judith B Zaugg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The presented data are of good quality and the observations are interesting. Yet, concerns are raised, of both analytical and interpretative character that should be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic> can be considered. The major points below are essential to consider and we strongly suggest that the authors also improve the manuscript based on the additional considerations listed in the individual reviews.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The title of the article is &quot;Codon usage biases suppress premature transcription termination to promote gene expression&quot;. As formulated, it implies that there is actually an active mechanism that &quot;senses&quot; rare codons and feeds back this information to the transcription termination machinery. This would be very intriguing, but it appears that the most likely explanation is that codon bias on the one hand and transcription termination signal on the other hand co-evolved to adapt to a G/C rich genome. In other words, there is no direct cause and effect relationship between codon bias and transcription termination. Despite this likely explanation, the authors, in many instances, strongly indicate that there is a direct mechanism that couples the two phenomena. For example: &quot;These results suggest that codon usage plays an important role in mediating premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]suggesting that codon usage bias also plays a role in premature transcription termination in mouse&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage biases are a conserved mechanism that affects premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage bias is a conserved mechanism[…]&quot;.</p><p>These formulations are way too strong. Codon bias and transcription termination signals are correlated but it is not a &quot;mechanism&quot;. Thus, these sentences, as well as the title, are misleading (obviously provocative, but also simply wrong) and the title should be changed and the text re-written accordingly.</p><p>2) A huge body of literature exists on premature transcription termination, which is ignored in the present manuscript. The findings should be discussed in the context of the relevant literature on (1) the link between codon bias and termination in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and (2) premature termination at – typically intronic – premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) sites in mammals.</p><p>3) Since these rare codons can make up a canonical polyA site, more analyses on codon pairs would be welcome, and if it holds true that premature termination is not simply due to the formation of a PAS by two rare codons, it would be great if the authors could speculate on any other mechanism, e.g. by genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data. If it is not only the formation of a PAS (based on pair-wise analysis), what are the authors proposing as a mechanism? Is there any ChIP-seq data or similar available in Neurospora that shows an enrichment over the rare codons? For sure there is lots of ChIP-seq data available in mouse where the authors could look for factors potentially enriched at rare codons. Or does this coincide with PolII pausing? Moreover, the authors have excluded an effect on chromatin based on looking at one mark in one locus. Is there any genome-wide data available that the authors could use for checking this statement across the naturally occurring rare codons? For sure in mouse there would be enough data for that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Zhou et al. reports evidence for a role of codon usage biases affecting premature transcription termination in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. This was discovered through codon deoptimisation of the Neurospora <italic>frq</italic> gene, which leads to the loss of protein the full-length mRNA. The authors further show that this phenotype is due to premature transcription termination that generates short polyadenylated transcripts. Through generation of other mutants of the <italic>frq</italic> gene, Zhou et al. determined this mechanism to depend on multiple sequence elements that they further describe to be low-efficiency non-canonical transcription termination sites, based on genome wide analysis of endogenous 3'UTR and ORF polyadenylation sites. Characterisation of these polyadenylation sites revealed a genome wide correlation between codon usage and premature transcription termination. Finally, a similar genome wide analysis in <italic>Saccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> provided information suggesting that such a mechanism is not conserved in A/U-rich organism as <italic>S. pombe</italic> but might be present in G/C-rich ones as well (<italic>M. musculus</italic>).</p><p>Overall, the data shown are convincing and provide a conceptually new, though possibly not very surprising, link between codon bias and polyadenylation-dependent termination. The major caveat is that the findings are not discussed in the context of the relevant literature on (1) the link between codon bias and termination in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and (2) premature termination at – typically intronic – premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) sites in mammals.</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>- (regarding deopt3): &quot;suggesting that these products may be rapidly degraded&quot; and &quot;Because premature transcription termination products are usually rapidly degraded in the cytosol (van Hoof et al., 2002; Frischmeyer et al., 2002)&quot;. This point is probably of general relevance and should be discussed more explicitly. That is, the mostly low abundance of ORF PAS usage may well be due to the unstable nature of prematurely terminated transcripts. It is also worth noting that the prematurely terminated transcripts could well be subjected to nuclear decay as implicated in decay of human PCPA terminated RNAs, in addition to the non-stop decay suggested by the authors. This should be referenced together with a more general discussion of yeast and human premature termination systems.</p><p>- &quot;The ratios were less than 10% for 95% of the genes with ORF-pA, indicating that only a small portion of transcription terminated in ORFs.&quot; The authors should discuss this more carefully. The RNA 3' ends do not mark transcription termination as RNA polymerase is present well beyond the PAS, as also found by the authors themselves. In addition, the low levels of ORF-pA may be partially due to the unstable nature of prematurely terminated transcripts.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: Is this understood correct that the authors claim that the antisense gene is also prematurely terminated when the sense <italic>frq</italic> is codon deoptimized? This warrants further explanation. Where does the premature termination occur and do the mutation create PAS on the antisense? I wonder whether this is some kind of artefact. If no plausible explanation for the premature termination of the antisense gene can be found also this should be mentioned.</p><p>- The authors find that ORF PAS are generally &quot;weaker&quot;. Could this be a technical issue since those sites are generally also less abundant and hence less well defined? On a different note, the experimentally found pA events may be derived from alternative PAS-independent events. This could be discussed.</p><p>- In the case of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> data, it may be interesting to further compare to PAS motifs of intronic PCPA sites.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The authors show that the AAUAAA element in <italic>NCU02034</italic> is not used due to optimal codons in the vicinity. This may allow for a supporting bioinformatic analysis where the codon optimality surrounding all ORF AAUAAA (or perhaps the AAUGAA) motifs is compared for genes, which use those sites, compared to genes where they are not used.</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: despite the confirmation of the absence of protein by the absence of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), some information regarding the anti-FRQ antibody would be needed (these do not seem to be provided either in the previous references). Is this antibody homemade? Which part of the protein does it target?</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D: a</xref> proper Western blot quantification would require a serial dilution to estimate the protein concentration range in which the signal is linear (such a dilution do not require to be shown but should be mentioned in the Materials and methods).</p><p>- &quot;other <italic>cis</italic>-elements such as U-rich upstream auxiliary element and U-rich downstream element also play important roles. In plants and yeast, the downstream element can be replaced by a U-rich element.&quot; These sentences are confusing and should be rephrased.</p><p>- Potential typo: &quot;-30 ~ -10&quot;.</p><p>- Discussion concerning the previous findings that codon usage affects chromatin structure and transcription initiation. For the reader it would be interesting to relate those earlier findings in the context of the premature termination. That is, is it possible that changes in chromatin structure and transcription levels are indirectly due to premature termination and vice versa?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors report interesting observations. <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> exhibits a strong GC rich sequence bias, which translates in a strong codon bias with synonymous codons with G or C at the wobble position being preferred. When changing codons of the <italic>frq</italic> gene to non-optimal codons, which are thus overall more A/T rich, they observed a complete disappearance of not only the expressed FRQ protein but also of the full-length mRNA.</p><p>They further show that it results from a different mechanism than the one described by the same group (Zhou et al., 2016), where they showed that a poor codon bias in <italic>N. crassa</italic> results in a poor transcription efficiency of the gene (and not a decreased stability as one would have expected). Here they show that the effect results from a premature termination event with a short transcript accumulating in place of the mRNA.</p><p>Performing the genome-wide mapping of mRNA 3'-ends, they identify a number of poly(A) sites (PAS) within ORFs and show that the occurrence of these are strongly correlated with a poor codon bias, genes enriched with rare codons being much more prone to exhibit transcription termination within ORFs. They show that this is not true for the A/T rich <italic>S. pombe</italic> but also true, yet to a much lower extent, for the mouse, which also exhibits a G/C enriched genome.</p><p>They conclude, &quot;[…]codon biases are conserved mechanisms that affects premature transcription termination events in C/G-biased organisms[…]&quot;.</p><p>The presented data are of quality and the observations undoubtedly interesting.</p><p>Yet, I have some strong concerns that, I think, should be addressed before considering publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>My most important concern should be relatively easy to address. It might seem to simply be a question of semantics, but I think it goes much more beyond than that. The title of the article is &quot;Codon usage biases suppress premature transcription termination to promote gene expression&quot;. As formulated, it implies that there is actually an active mechanism that &quot;senses&quot; rare codons and feeds back this information to the transcription termination machinery. This would have been most intriguing and I was very curious to see what kind of mechanism the authors could propose for such a mechanism. But, in the core of the text, you understand that the most likely explanation is that codon bias on the one hand and transcription termination signal on the other hand coevolved to adapt to the G/C rich genome. In other words, there are no direct cause and effect relationship between codon bias and transcription termination, simply that both phenomenon, which are obviously linked to the same DNA sequence, co-evolved with it such as you could not change one without influencing the other. This is indeed the most likely explanation for these observations. Yet, in many instances, the way the text is written strongly implies that there is a direct mechanism that couples the two.</p><p>For examples: &quot;These results suggest that codon usage plays an important role in mediating premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]suggesting that codon usage bias also plays a role in premature transcription termination in mouse&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage biases are a conserved mechanism that affects premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage bias is a conserved mechanism[…]&quot;.</p><p>I strongly disagree with these formulations. Both, codon bias and transcription termination signals are correlated but, no, codon bias is not a &quot;mechanism&quot;. These sentences, as well as the title, are very misleading (obviously provocative, but simply wrong) and the text should be re-written accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors present evidence that shows that specific codons can trigger premature transcription termination in the organism Neurospora. They further analyse the sequence content of the 3'UTR polyA sites (PAS) and intragentic, what they call ORF-PAS and find slight differences in the PAS signals. They further show a strong anticorrelation of codon adaptation index and codon bias index with the ratio of ORF/3' termination. They do not find a similar mechanism in other fungi (<italic>S. pombe</italic>) yet in the mouse genome a similar albeit less significant correlation between codon usage and intragenic stop is observed. Another important observation was that the most frequent codon-pair was made up of two of the rarest codons and in fact resembles a canonical poly-A site.</p><p>Overall, the authors provide good evidence for a role in codon usage in transcription termination. However since these rare codons can make up a canonical polyA site, I would welcome some more analyses on codon pairs, and if it holds true that the mechanism of premature termination is not simply the formation of a PAS by two rare codons, it would be great if the authors speculate on the mechanism, e.g. by genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data (see comments below).</p><p>- It looks like the deoptimized codons to some extent act as stop codon, but not always. Also, when looking at pairs it seems it is easy to create a PAS, are the deoptimized codons introduced into the <italic>frq</italic> gene forming pairs that make up PAS?</p><p>- Does the premature stop in <italic>NCU09435</italic> and <italic>NCU00931</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) happen at non-optimal codons? Similarly, I'm missing a global analysis that counts the number of natural premature stop events per codon (rather than a correlation of indexes with ratios).</p><p>- Negative correlation of CAI and CBI with ratio of ORF-PAS vs. 3'PAS: what about the codon, or even codon-pair at the exact location of the premature stop? Are these predominantly non-optimal codons? Or is the mechanism rather additive and PolII needs to encounter a couple of non-optimal codons to stop?</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: would be easier to read if it was on the same axis. Also the red line for K is somehow shifted. How does this correlation look for all AA within the same plot? Is it still visible or is it important to split them by AA?</p><p>- Is it just the formation of PAS that makes these rarer codons affect premature stop? I would welcome an analysis that looks at rare codons that do form a canonical PAS vs. those that don't and compare their effect on premature transcription stop. If it is mainly the formation of PAS that drives the termination I think the authors should be more explicit about this and say the mechanism of how rare codons affect premature termination is through forming non-canonical PAS.</p><p>- If it is not only the formation of a PAS (based on pair-wise analysis), what are the authors proposing as a mechanism? Is there any ChIP-seq data or similar available in Neurospora that shows an enrichment over the rare codons? For sure there is lots of ChIP-seq data available in mouse where the authors could look for factors potentially enriched at rare codons. Or does this coincide with PolII pausing?</p><p>- The authors have excluded an effect on chromatin based on looking at one mark in one locus. Is there any genome-wide data available that the authors could use for checking this statement across the naturally occurring rare codons? For sure in mouse there would be enough data for that.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Codon usage biases co-evolve with transcription termination machinery to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Other <italic>cis</italic>-elements surrounding the PAS motif are also very important for PCPA. Using the <italic>frq</italic> gene as an example in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, we showed that a cluster of rare synonymous codons can potentially form the A/U rich poly(A) signal, including PAS motif and other surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements, which could be recognized by transcription termination machinery. On the other hand, PCPA didn’t occur in the wild-type <italic>NCU02034</italic> gene even though a canonical PAS motif was present in the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We showed that by introducing rare codons surrounding the PAS signal, transcription was fully terminated in the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To further address this issue, we performed genome-wide analyses in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and mouse by identifying “true PAS” and “false PAS” motifs based on the presence of poly(A) sites downstream of the PAS motifs and determined the nucleotide composition surrounding the groups of PAS motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results clearly showed that in the ORFs, single PAS motif cannot trigger PCPA. In addition, the AU contents surrounding true PAS motifs are higher than in false PAS motifs, indicating that surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements are also required for triggering PCPA. These results are consistent with our results that the regions surrounding true PAS motifs are enriched for rare codons. Therefore, we propose that rare codons can potentially promote PCPA by the formation of PAS motif and its surrounding <italic>cis</italic>-elements.</p><p>As for the potential effect of chromatin on PCPA, we did the following analysis. We showed that the H3K9me3 levels at <italic>frq</italic> promoter were comparable in the wt-<italic>frq</italic> and <italic>frq</italic>-deopt2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that the loss of full-length <italic>frq</italic> mRNA in the <italic>frq</italic>-deopt2 strains is not due to H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional silencing. We have also done polII, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 ChIP-seq previously in the lab and we found that polII, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 enrichment positively correlates with codon usage and mRNA levels in <italic>Neurospora</italic>.

That is, the mostly low abundance of ORF PAS usage may well be due to the unstable nature of prematurely terminated transcripts. It is also worth noting that the prematurely terminated transcripts could well be subjected to nuclear decay as implicated in decay of human PCPA terminated RNAs, in addition to the non-stop decay suggested by the authors. This should be referenced together with a more general discussion of yeast and human premature termination systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that prematurely terminated transcripts may be degraded in the nucleus in addition to the non-stop decay in the cytosol.

It might seem to simply be a question of semantics, but I think it goes much more beyond than that. The title of the article is &quot;Codon usage biases suppress premature transcription termination to promote gene expression&quot;. As formulated, it implies that there is actually an active mechanism that &quot;senses&quot; rare codons and feeds back this information to the transcription termination machinery. This would have been most intriguing and I was very curious to see what kind of mechanism the authors could propose for such a mechanism. But, in the core of the text, you understand that the most likely explanation is that codon bias on the one hand and transcription termination signal on the other hand coevolved to adapt to the G/C rich genome. In other words, there are no direct cause and effect relationship between codon bias and transcription termination, simply that both phenomenon, which are obviously linked to the same DNA sequence, co-evolved with it such as you could not change one without influencing the other. This is indeed the most likely explanation for these observations. Yet, in many instances, the way the text is written strongly implies that there is a direct mechanism that couples the two.</p><p>For examples: &quot;These results suggest that codon usage plays an important role in mediating premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]suggesting that codon usage bias also plays a role in premature transcription termination in mouse&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage biases are a conserved mechanism that affects premature transcription termination[…]&quot;; &quot;[…]codon usage bias is a conserved mechanism[…]&quot;.</p><p>I strongly disagree with these formulations. Both, codon bias and transcription termination signals are correlated but, no, codon bias is not a &quot;mechanism&quot;. These sentences, as well as the title, are very misleading (obviously provocative, but simply wrong) and the text should be re-written accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.
