We examined the NETosis pathways induced by five stimuli; PMA, the calcium ionophore A23187, nigericin, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and Group B Streptococcus. We studied NET production in neutrophils from healthy donors with inhibitors of molecules crucial to PMA-induced NETs including protein kinase C, calcium, reactive oxygen species, the enzymes myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase. Additionally, neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients, carrying mutations in the NADPH oxidase complex or a MPO-deficient patient were examined. We show that PMA, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS use a related pathway for NET induction, whereas ionophores require an alternative pathway but that NETs produced by all stimuli are proteolytically active, kill bacteria and composed mainly of chromosomal DNA. Thus, we demonstrate that NETosis occurs through several signalling mechanisms, suggesting that extrusion of NETs is important in host defence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24437.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24437.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24437.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects the body against microorganisms that can cause infections and diseases. Neutrophils are a type of immune cell that patrol the blood in search of germs. Once they encounter potentially harmful microbes, neutrophils eradicate them in different ways. One way to catch the germs is by using ‘neutrophil extracellular traps’, or NETs for short, to confine and kill the invaders.</p><p>NETs are web-like structures made up of anti-microbial proteins and the neutrophil’s own DNA. The process of making NETs kills the neutrophil, as it eventually explodes to release the NETs. NETs play a key role in disease prevention, but producing too many NETs or producing them at the wrong time or in the wrong place can actually make certain diseases worse. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the signaling pathways and molecules the neutrophils use to make NETs.</p><p>Kenny et al. exposed neutrophils from healthy people to five different compounds known to cause the cells to make NETs, including some harmful molecules, a fungus and a bacterium. Microscopy was then used to count how many neutrophils made NETs in response to each of the five stimuli. Further experiments showed that neutrophils from patients with an immune system disorder produced fewer NETs when stimulated with some of the compounds, while the other stimuli caused neutrophils to produce the same levels of NETs as healthy individuals.</p><p>Kenny et al. also revealed that neutrophils use several different ways to produce and release NETs, depending on the stimulus used. Some of the ways required reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide and enzymes, while others produced NETs without the need for these molecules. Lastly, Kenny et al. showed that the way the cells die after the NET is released is unique from other pathways that are known to kill cells.</p><p>Future work will aim to identify a single molecule that can block neutrophils from releasing NETs at the wrong time and place, without affecting the important role NETs play in fighting germs. Such a molecule could be developed into a drug for people with diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, where the release of NETs makes the disease worse not better.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24437.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24437.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Neutrophil</kwd><kwd>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps</kwd><kwd>NETs</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>Elaine F</given-names></name><name><surname>Herzig</surname><given-names>Alf</given-names></name><name><surname>Zychlinsky</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muth</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>Santanu</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NETs induction, a central component of the innate immune response, utilises assorted signalling pathways as demonstrated through the analysis of healthy and patient neutrophils treated with five distinct stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell in the circulation and serve as the first line of host defence against pathogen attack. They are terminally differentiated, short lived cells that emerge from the bone marrow ready to react to the presence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Once a foreign molecule or endogenous threat is identified the neutrophil has a battery of mechanisms it can deploy to insure optimum removal of the hazard. These include the ability to phagocytose, degranulate and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The neutrophil can also produce chemokines and cytokines to alert other cells in the vicinity to the danger and thus maximise the host’s immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scapini and Cassatella, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another form of defence utilised by the neutrophil is the release of decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial peptides that can capture the pathogen in a process termed neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). NETosis has been primarily examined in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent mitogen and a robust NET inducer. Neutrophils also initiate NETosis in response to microbial infections and, similarly to PMA, these activate protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn leads to calcium fluxes within the cell and activation of the NADPH oxidase signalling cascade resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hakkim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaplan and Radic, 2012</xref>). The hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) produced is in turn consumed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to produce hypochlorous acid as well as other oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). The production of ROS is responsible for the activation of the azurosome, a protein complex composed of MPO, the serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G among other granular proteins. The generation of oxidants by MPO liberates NE from the azurosome, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it aids in the decondensation of the chromatin by proteolyzing histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzler et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the cytoplasmic milieu mixes with the nuclear material as the nuclear and subsequently the plasma membrane break down, resulting in release of the NET.</p><p>This study describes the different pathways leading to NETs by comparing the induction of NETosis by several stimuli. Primary neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with five stimuli: (1) PMA, (2) the calcium ionophore A23187, (3) the bacterial toxin nigericin that acts as a potassium ionophore, (4) the dimorphic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and (5) the gram-positive bacteria Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and examined for the production of NETs. We tested a range of inhibitors against proteins involved in NETosis to clarify the essential elements in NET induction.</p><p>To study the role of ROS in NETosis, we tested neutrophils isolated from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients. These patients have mutations in genes coding for subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex and as such their neutrophils cannot make ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heyworth et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, these patients are highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. We also tested neutrophils from a patient with a mutation in MPO.</p><p>Citrullination is a post-transcriptional modification resulting in the conversion of arginine to citrulline and is catalysed by a group of calcium-dependent proteins known as peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuhrmann et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that citrullination occurs during NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore also investigated if histone H3 is citrullinated during the induction of NETosis in response to the different stimuli.</p><p>Finally, we showed that the NETs generated by the five stimuli have similar properties and that NETosis is a unique form of cell death, different from classical cell death pathways involving apoptosis and necroptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A wide range of stimuli induce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)</title><p>We selected five representative and well-described NET inducers that are effective over a 2.5–4 hr time period: (1) PMA, (2) the calcium ionophore A23187 which is produced during the growth of <italic>Streptomyces chartreusensis</italic>, (3) the potassium ionophore nigericin which is derived from the bacteria <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic>, (4) <italic>Candida albicans</italic> hyphae and (5) <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> or Group B streptococcus (GBS) and examined NETosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We visualised and quantified NETs in samples that were fixed and stained with antibodies directed against a complex of histone 2A, histone 2B and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Losman et al., 1992</xref>) and against neutrophil elastase (NE). Finally, the DNA was stained with the DNA-intercalating dye Hoechst 33342. We used the DNA stain to count the total number of neutrophils and NETs were quantified based on the presence of extracellular chromatin and a size exclusion protocol previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brinkmann et al., 2012</xref>). Activating neutrophils with each of the stimuli resulted in a similar NET structure containing extracellular DNA co-localised with NE and chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24437.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NETosis induction by a range of stimuli.</title><p>Primary human neutrophils were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 nM PMA, 5 µM A23187, 15 µM nigericin, MOI 5 opsonized <italic>C. albicans</italic> or MOI 10 opsonized group B streptococcus (GBS), fixed with 2% PFA and incubated with a DNA stain (Hoechst) and immunolabeled with antibodies directed against Neutrophil Elastase (NE) and chromatin (<bold>A–G</bold>).

Early work on neutrophil signalling revealed that ionomycin can induce a massive influx of calcium into the neutrophil, reaching a concentration greater than 1 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gennaro et al., 1984</xref>). This abundance of intracellular calcium may have overwhelmed the ability of the BAPTA-AM to chelate the calcium at the concentration used.

Intriguingly, and in contrast to data obtained with the ROS scavenger, there was no significant difference in the levels of NETosis comparing healthy vs. CGD patient neutrophils in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic>. This discrepancy was explained by the fact that <italic>C. albicans</italic> can induce a ROS burst itself in the absence of neutrophils and this was inhibited in the presence of the ROS scavenger pyrocatechol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that <italic>C. albicans</italic> produces sufficient ROS to allow NETosis. We pre-incubated the fungus with pyrocatechol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and showed that scavenging <italic>C. albicans-</italic>derived ROS also inhibited NET production. Moreover, by inhibiting ROS in both the neutrophils and the fungus NETosis was inhibited to a greater extent. Thus, the amount of ROS produced by the <italic>C. albicans</italic> was sufficient to allow NETs induction in CGD neutrophils. The amount of NETs were, however, decreased in CGD neutrophils infected with GBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) when compared with cells isolated from healthy donors.</p><p>Overall, these data show that ROS generated by the NADPH oxidase, while absolutely essential for PMA-induced NETosis, are not necessary for NET production in response to both ionophores and only partially required for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS-induced NETosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential myeloperoxidase requirements of NETs</title><p>We explored whether myeloperoxidase (MPO) is also differentially required by the different stimuli.

Neutrophils were pre-treated with three inhibitors of PAD proteins: Cl-amidine and BB-Cl-amidine, both of which inhibit PAD2 and PAD4, and Thr-Asp-F-amidine (TDFA), a potent specific PAD4 inhibitor. Treating neutrophils with Cl-amidine, BB-Cl-amidine or TDFA did not induce NETosis spontaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Importantly, in response to A23187 or nigericin stimulation, NETosis remained intact after incubation with the three inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Similarly, these inhibitors did not affect <italic>C. albicans</italic> or GBS-induced NETosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

This was further confirmed by assaying the degradation of FITC-labelled casein in the presence of NETs isolated from healthy neutrophils treated with the five stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). NETs from all five stimuli were capable of degrading FITC-labelling casein to a similar level indicating they are proteolytically active.

These discrepancies may arise from technical issues such as differences in neutrophil isolation protocols, the culture of neutrophils in different types of cell culture media and the concentration of stimuli used. With this in mind, we aimed here to confirm that our stimuli of interest generate NETs by use of the benchmark for NETosis analysis: quantifiable analysis along with fixed cell imaging and live cell videos.</p><p>Using these methods, we demonstrate here that NETs can be robustly induced by a broad range of stimuli, including PMA, the ionophores A23187 and nigericin and the more physiologically relevant stimuli <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS. Using neutrophils isolated from healthy donors and patients as well as small molecule inhibitors, we show that NET formation occurs through different signalling pathways. The NETs generated by all five stimuli were proteolytically active, kill bacteria and composed mainly of chromosomal DNA. We also show that NETosis is distinct from other cell death pathways such as apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis.</p><p>The data shown here demonstrates that PMA-induced NETs require PKC, calcium, ROS, MPO and NE. Conversely, Histone H3 is not citrullinated upon stimulation with PMA and transcription plays no role as has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sollberger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Clarifying the mechanisms of NET formation in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS proved to be challenging, perhaps due to the need to culture fresh microbes for each experiment. Similar to PMA both microbes require PKC, MPO and NE and do not require transcriptional activation for NET formation. However, both microbes induce the citrullination of histone H3. Despite this PAD2/PAD4 activity is not required for NETosis in response to the microbes.</p><p>The role of ROS is less conclusive as there is a discrepancy between comparing healthy neutrophils treated with ROS scavengers and cells isolated from CGD patients. Indeed, <italic>C. albicans</italic> induces significantly less NETs when ROS were pharmacologically abrogated in neutrophils from healthy donors. In contrast, neutrophils from CGD patients produced similar amounts of NETs as those isolated from healthy controls. This suggests that the ROS used by <italic>C. albicans</italic> do not originate from the NADPH oxidase complex. We show here that indeed <italic>C. albicans</italic> itself can produce ROS thus circumventing the ROS requirements of the neutrophil by producing sufficient levels of ROS to allow CGD neutrophils to form NETs. These results are very much in line with the clinical phenotype in which patients with CGD suffer more frequently from invasive infections with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> than with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henriet et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a study demonstrated that CGD patient neutrophils produce significantly less NETs in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> than healthy neutrophils further adding to our evidence that neutrophils from CGD patients react diversely to fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gazendam et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The role of ROS in GBS-induced NETosis is confounded by the ability of healthy neutrophils to produce normal levels of NETs in the presence of the ROS scavenger but a significantly reduced level of NETosis in the CGD patient neutrophils. The CGD patient data suggest a requirement for NAPDH oxidase-dependent ROS for GBS induced NETs that is perhaps not revealed by the ROS scavenger. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, there was some residual ROS production in response to GBS in the presence of the ROS scavenger. This level of ROS may be sufficient for the GBS to induce NETosis in a manner similar to <italic>C. albicans</italic> in which the amount of ROS produced by the fungus allows NETosis to occur in the CGD patient neutrophils. It must also be noted that although the ability of GBS to induce NETosis was significantly reduced in the CGD patients, a high level of NETosis still occurred in these cells. Taken together, these data suggest that while PMA absolutely relies on NADPH oxidase derived ROS for NETosis <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS can circumvent this need to some degree. This could be due to the ability of the microbes to generate ROS themselves that is then hijacked by the neutrophil to generate NETs in the absence of a self-source of ROS.</p><p>This is in contrast with NETosis induction by <italic>S. aureus</italic> which was dependent on the ability of the neutrophils to generate ROS as outlined in the original study on NETosis in CGD patient neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that NETosis induced by physiologically relevant stimuli is also very diverse in the signalling pathways utilised and hence challenging to clarify. Indeed, <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> can induce NETosis in the absence of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rochael et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSouza-Vieira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The role of ROS production in the generation of NETs is further confounded by recent work demonstrating that the mitochondria can also be a source of ROS in NETosis in response to calcium ionophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douda et al., 2015</xref>) or ribonucleoprotein-containing immune complexes (RNP ICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lood et al., 2016</xref>). These data demonstrate that outside of the NADPH-oxidase complex the neutrophil has other ROS sources that are sufficient to induce NETosis.</p><p>Conversely, activation with the ionophores A23187 and nigericin does not require PKC, ROS, MPO or NE or transcriptional activation and calcium only has a limited role. Histone H3 is citrullinated upon activation by these stimuli; however, pre-treatment with PAD inhibitors does not affect the ability of the neutrophils to make NETs. This suggests that citrullination (of histone H3 at least) is a consequence of NETosis, and that PAD4 is not required for NET formation. Ionophore and PMA-induced NETosis appears to be distinct, at least in the few components of the signal transduction cascade already described.</p><p>A23187 is a calcium ionophore that causes a massive influx of calcium and nigericin stimulates potassium effluxes in cells which also results in the influx of calcium demonstrating the similarity between the ionophores in their mechanism of NET induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yaron et al., 2015</xref>). This flooding of the neutrophil with calcium ions could thus result in perturbation of the membrane potential and cell death that ultimately releases NETs. While the method to initiate NET induction by the ionophores is very different to that seen in response to PMA, the end product appears to be similar.</p><p>Auto-antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins are commonly found in the serum of rheumatoid arthritis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Venrooij et al., 2004</xref>) and as such elucidating the origin of these modified proteins is of great therapeutic interest. Recent research suggests that PAD enzymes, in particular PAD4, are associated with the induction of NETosis. Consistent with this, PAD4-deficient mice do not generate NETs in response to a calcium ionophore which is in direct contrast to the data presented here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinod et al., 2013</xref>). However, the readout for NETosis used in this study was the presence of extracellular DNA decorated with citrullinated histone H3. Since deficiency in PAD4 results in no citrullination of histones this study lacks a readout in the PAD4-deficient cells that would confirm the presence or absence of NETs such as staining with antibodies against NE or MPO on the extracellular DNA. It is also important to note that these experiments were carried out using murine neutrophils which may not behave similarly to human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardoel et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, studies examining the requirements of the PAD enzymes in human NETosis, using the same PAD inhibitors, also demonstrate a very limited inhibition of NETosis in response to a calcium ionophore and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosseinzadeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it appears that while PAD enzymes might be important for murine neutrophils to generate NETs, this effect is not seen in human neutrophils.</p><p>One additional discrepancy between our data and published reports is the observation that PAD inhibitors (both selective and pan-PAD) show efficacy in multiple mouse models of SLE and RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawalkowska et al., 2016</xref>). These studies suggest that citrullination is important in disease pathogenesis and as such could affect NET function. We do not understand how NETs function as antimicrobials, immune cell activators or in coagulation. It is possible that these NET functions are altered by the citrullination of NETs components. Indeed, the phenotype observed in the PAD4-deficient mice could potentially be attributed to the effectiveness of NETs and not necessarily NET formation.</p><p>A recent review highlights the wide range of proteins and pathways required for NETosis in response to a variety of stimuli with emphasis on the questions surrounding the role of citrullination in NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Konig and Andrade, 2016</xref>). It states that ionophores and bacterial pore-forming toxins induce a pathway within neutrophils that results in the citrullination of histones but that is distinct from NETosis. They term this form of neutrophil cell death leukotoxic hypercitrullination (LTH) and suggest it is not antimicrobial but a bacterial strategy to kill neutrophils. The data shown here demonstrates that in the presence of the calcium ionophore or nigericin nuclear decondensation occurs and results in the extrusion of DNA, chromatin and peptides from neutrophils, albeit in a different manner to that utilised by PMA, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS. Whether these extruded DNA and proteins are antimicrobial, however, requires further investigation.</p><p>The different mechanisms of neutrophil cell death have been studied in detail and as such the data presented here can be included in the body of evidence that NETosis is in fact a distinct cell death mechanism utilised to aid in pathogen killing by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remijsen et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011a</xref>). However, two recent studies on the role of necroptosis in NETs induction present contrasting evidence for and against the requirements of necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desai et al., 2016</xref>). Our data strengthens the argument that necroptosis is a separate cell death signalling cascade that is not required by neutrophils to induce NETosis.</p><p>Our observations show that there are different paths to NETosis in human cells. The elucidation of these pathways is of importance due to the ancient nature of chromatin release as a form of host defence as has been identified in both the animal and plant kingdoms. Therefore, it is unsurprising that NETosis is induced through a wide range of pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tran et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, the clarification of these different pathways to NETosis has definite therapeutic relevance. There is a genuine need to identify NET inhibitors to alleviate or prevent many diseases including cystic fibrosis, thrombosis, malaria and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaplan and Radic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinkmann and Zychlinsky, 2012</xref>). NETs are present in the sputum of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and contribute to the viscosity of the sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manzenreiter et al., 2012</xref>). NETs are evident in the thrombus in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and disease activity is reflective of NET markers in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2012</xref>). Many autoimmune diseases such as Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis also show a very strong NET phenotype with regard the presence of autoantibodies against proteins readily released from neutrophils in the process of NETosis such as anti-dsDNA and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hakkim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kessenbrock et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>This study will aid in the development of tools to help combat the detrimental effects of NETosis while balancing this with the need for the neutrophils to fulfil their purpose in the presence of a pathogen and induce their unique cell death program.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Inhibitors</title><p>Gö6976 (PKC, Biozol), BAPTA-AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Actinomycin D, GW311616A (NE) and pyrocatechol (Sigma-Aldrich), 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH, Cayman chemical), Cl-amidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Causey and Thompson, 2008</xref>), BB-Cl-amidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knight et al., 2015</xref>), TDFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>), caspase-3 inhibitor and necrostatin (Merck-Millipore).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Donor consent</title><p>Blood samples were collected according to the Declaration of Helsinki with study participants providing written informed consent.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps appear to have several functions including defence against some bacterial and fungal pathogens. In the current manuscript, the authors investigated mechanisms involved in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. The authors stimulated neutrophils with 5 widely varied stimuli; the mitogen PMA, the ionophores A23187 and nigericin (bacterial toxin), the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and the gram positive bacteria Group B Streptococcus (GBS). According to their results, PMA, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS use a related pathway for NET induction whereas ionophores require an alternative pathway. Thus, NETosis occurs through several signalling mechanisms, suggesting that extrusion of NETs is important in host defence. The analysis of signalling pathways also relied on the test of neutrophils from patients with deficiencies in pathways important for NET induction (CGD patients, and an MPO-deficient individual) along with primary healthy neutrophils treated with small molecule inhibitors of proteins required for PMA-induced NETosis. The authors also demonstrate that while apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis can be induced in primary healthy neutrophils these pathways do not result in NET formation. Also inhibiting the induction of these cell death pathways has no effect on NETosis thus verifying that NETosis is a novel cell death pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found the work interesting and important. It clarifies that the pathways involved in NET formation vary depending on the stimulus to which neutrophils are exposed. However, at the same time some important questions arose which need to be carefully addressed:</p><p>1) One very interesting finding described in the manuscript is the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on NET formation by CGD neutrophils. From their data, the authors conclude that <italic>C. albicans</italic> provided ROS for NET formation. They hypothesise that this might be the difference to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and explain why CGD patients are more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis rather than to a <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. I think the data are suggestive for this conclusion. However, it would add strength if the authors had some experimental hints. It is most likely that ROS derive from the NADPH oxidase complex present in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Possibly, the authors could carry out an experiment in which the NADPH oxidase is inhibited by DPI in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and such cells are used for the co-incubation experiment. Alternatively, an NADPH oxidase mutant of <italic>C. albicans</italic> could be used.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Why are there 2 bands for the A23 lane of citrullinated H3?</p><p>3) Depending on the donor, netting neutrophils appear to differ in their ability to downregulate NET formation in response to PAD inhibitors. It would be important to expand the PAD inhibitor experiments to about 10 healthy controls. In addition, it was found that difference sources of PAD inhibitors may differ in their ability to inhibit NETosis. As Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine has been shown by several groups to inhibit NETs in human neutrophils obtained from individuals with various inflammatory conditions as well as healthy controls (Smith CK A&amp;R 2014; Subramaniam V J Med Chem 2015; Kusunoki Y. Front Immunol 2016; Rocha et al. Science Rep 2015; Hosseinzadeh et al. JLB 2016; Khandpur. ScienceTrans Med 2013), perhaps adding this compound to in vitro experiments would also be helpful.</p><p>4) A time course would be good. Especially at quite early times to see how quickly molecules like the ionophore release NETs.</p><p>5) Do all of these stimuli induce significant LDH release?</p><p>6) Do all of the stimuli induce the same quality of NETs? For example do they all have the same proteolytic activity?</p><p>7) Are all of the NETs equally capable of killing bacteria?</p><p>8) Are all of the NETs primarily from nuclear rather than mitochondrial material?</p><p>9) Include the demographics of the donors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24437.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers found the work interesting and important.

Possibly, the authors could carry out an experiment in which the NADPH oxidase is inhibited by DPI in C. albicans and such cells are used for the co-incubation experiment. Alternatively, an NADPH oxidase mutant of C. albicans could be used.</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point, to address it we treated the <italic>C. albicans</italic> with 10 µM pyrocatechol during the 30 minute opsonisation step prior to NET induction. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> and described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Differential ROS requirements of NETs”. It revealed that blocking ROS in <italic>C. albicans</italic> also reduced the amount of NETs generated by healthy neutrophils. Moreover, pre-treating the neutrophils with pyrocatechol and then adding <italic>C. albicans</italic> that were pre-treated with the ROS scavenger as well resulted in even greater NET inhibition. This demonstrates that fungus generated ROS can contribute to make NETs.</p><p>Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that CGD patients produce significantly less NETs in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> than to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Gazendam et al., 2016). This data addresses the observation of the reviewer on the susceptibility to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> in CGD patients and is now discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Why are there 2 bands for the A23 lane of citrullinated H3?</italic></p><p>The reviewer correctly points out that this blot is confusing to the reader. Therefore, we included new data showing that during the process of NETosis histone H3 is processed by granule proteases. In the new version of the manuscript we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and subsection “All stimuli induce NETs that are proteolytically active, kill bacteria and are composed primarily of nuclear DNA”, first paragraph) that histone H3 is cleaved 90 minutes post stimulation in response to all stimuli. These data show that the two bands seen in response to A23187 stimulation are the result of histone cleavage.</p><p><italic>3) Depending on the donor, netting neutrophils appear to differ in their ability to downregulate NET formation in response to PAD inhibitors. It would be important to expand the PAD inhibitor experiments to about 10 healthy controls. In addition, it was found that difference sources of PAD inhibitors may differ in their ability to inhibit NETosis. As Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine has been shown by several groups to inhibit NETs in human neutrophils obtained from individuals with various inflammatory conditions as well as healthy controls (Smith CK A&amp;R 2014; Subramaniam V J Med Chem 2015; Kusunoki Y. Front Immunol 2016; Rocha et al. Science Rep 2015; Hosseinzadeh et al. JLB 2016; Khandpur. ScienceTrans Med 2013), perhaps adding this compound to in vitro experiments would also be helpful.</italic></p><p>The reviewer correctly points out a discrepancy in the field and we followed his/her suggestion. To address this comment we tested the three PAD inhibitors on neutrophils from 10 independent healthy donors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Histone citrullination occurs but is not required for NET induction”, pre-treatment of the cells with the Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine PAD inhibitor had no effect on NETosis. This was also true for cells pre-treated with BB-Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and TDFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is the mean ± SEM of the 10 independent experiments. These experiments are also shown individually in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> which confirm that these inhibitors do not affect NET induction in response to any of the stimuli tested.</p><p>As an important control, we also included data showing that the Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine blocks citrullination of histone H3 in response to A23187, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and GBS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This demonstrates that the compound was active under our experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>4) A time course would be good. Especially at quite early times to see how quickly molecules like the ionophore release NETs.</italic></p><p>This is a helpful suggestion by the reviewer and the data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and are described in the second paragraph of the subsection “A wide range of stimuli induce Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs)”. These data show that all 5 stimuli tested generate NETs over a 3-4 hour time course.</p><p><italic>5) Do all of these stimuli induce significant LDH release?</italic></p><p>We addressed this relevant question and show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref> that all five stimuli induce LDH release in the process of making NETs. This is described in the second paragraph of the subsection “NETosis is distinct from other forms of cell death”.</p><p><italic>6) Do all of the stimuli induce the same quality of NETs? For example do they all have the same proteolytic activity?</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises interesting questions about the quality of the NETs in this and the next two questions. To address proteolytic activity we examined the ability of neutrophils to degrade histone H3 during NETosis and show that all 5 stimuli lead to degradation within 90 minutes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. We also isolated the NETs produced in response to the 5 stimuli and tested their ability to breakdown FITC-labelled casein using the Pierce Fluorescent Protease Assay Kit (Thermo scientific) as directed in the manufacturer’s instructions. This data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “All stimuli induce NETs that are proteolytically active, kill bacteria and are composed primarily of nuclear DNA”.</p><p><italic>7) Are all of the NETs equally capable of killing bacteria?</italic></p><p>To address this question we include a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> which is described in the second paragraph of the subsection “All stimuli induce NETs that are proteolytically active, kill bacteria and are composed primarily of nuclear DNA”. In this experiment we induced NETs and 4 hours later treated the neutrophils with Cytochalasin D to inhibit phagocytosis. We included samples treated with DNase 1 at 50U/ml to degrade the NETs. Tetracycline resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> (XL1-Blue, Stratagene. Used to differentiate between the GBS, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> growth on agar plates) at a MOI of 1 was added to the cells/NETs and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> were then scrapped and collected. One set of samples were sonicated to release any bacteria trapped by the NETs and unavailable for counting. Finally serial dilutions were carried out and the <italic>E. coli</italic> were plated on agar plates containing tetracycline, incubated at 37°C for 24 hr before counting. The data showed that all NETs produced killed <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p><italic>8) Are all of the NETs primarily from nuclear rather than mitochondrial material?</italic></p><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and described the results in the third paragraph of the subsection “All stimuli induce NETs that are proteolytically active, kill bacteria and are composed primarily of nuclear DNA”. This figure shows that all NETs generated are primarily composed of nuclear DNA.</p><p><italic>9) Include the demographics of the donors.</italic></p><p>The demographics of the CGD patients has been included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1.
