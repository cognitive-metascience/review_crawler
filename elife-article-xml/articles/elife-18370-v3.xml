Most canonical cell signaling pathways (e.g. Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, TGF-β) regulate transcription and major advances have been made unraveling their molecular mechanisms. Yet virtually no studies of any canonical signaling pathway have tackled the question of how they modulate nuclear transcription (i.e. generation of nascent transcripts at active transcription sites) during animal development. Does signaling orchestrate a synchronous nuclear response? Or does it tune the probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts produced? Answers to these questions are fundamental to our molecular understanding of intercellular signaling.</p><p>To analyze the effect of intercellular signaling in its natural context during development, we focus on Notch signaling and its regulation of a stem cell pool in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The Notch pathway is strongly conserved across animal phylogeny (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gazave et al. 2009</xref>). Moreover, like other canonical signaling pathways, Notch is central to development and homeostasis, with dysfunction or misregulation causing disease (e.g. cancer, stroke) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Pompa and Epstein, 2012</xref>). The molecular mechanism of Notch signaling is essentially the same across metazoans, including nematodes, flies and vertebrates. Briefly, Notch ligands trigger cleavage of the Notch receptor to release its intracellular domain (NICD), which assembles into a nuclear complex to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). The transcriptional response to Notch signaling has been analyzed in diverse systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shimojo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ilagan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoyle and Ish-Horowicz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenkins et al., 2015</xref>), but no analyses have been done at the resolution of nascent transcripts at active transcription sites in the nucleus. Transcriptional reporters are a common readout of the Notch transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imayoshi et al., 2013</xref>), but they are both artificial and indirect. Conventional RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to endogenous Notch targets has also been used as a readout of Notch signaling, for example during segmentation of the zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoyle and Ish-Horowicz, 2013</xref>), but this method cannot resolve individual chromosomal loci and typically cannot resolve individual cells.</p><p>Our focus on Notch signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad was inspired largely by unanswered questions about the spatial extent of Notch activity in this system. It had been known for some time that Notch, known as GLP-1/Notch in this system, is crucial for the regulation of the germline stem cell pool and establishing polarity in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>). The single-celled mesenchymal niche, called the distal tip cell (DTC), uses Notch signaling to maintain a pool of germline stem cells (GSCs) at the distal end of the ‘progenitor zone’ in the distal gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimble and White 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies suggested that Notch signaling might function throughout the GSC pool or even beyond. Transcripts from key Notch target genes are expressed in the distal gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>), but this previous study did not define expression at the level of single cells, much less at single chromosomal loci. The site of Notch signaling is ambiguous, because of the elaborate architecture of the signaling cell — the DTC cell body caps the distal gonad and extends ultra-thin processes intercalating throughout the GSC pool as well as long external processes along the entire progenitor zone and sometimes beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzgerald and Greenwald, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2014</xref>). Which parts of the DTC are actually signaling and how sustained is the transcriptional response once the receptor is cleaved? Answers to these questions are critical to understanding how GLP-1/Notch regulates this stem cell pool and will be of heuristic value for other systems.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18370.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualization of <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcripts using smFISH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite with two U-shaped gonadal arms, each with a single-celled niche (DTC, black crescent) and a progenitor zone of mitotically dividing germ cells at the distal end.

Visualization of nascent transcripts has been technically possible for some time, due to the advent of single-molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raj et al., 2008</xref>), but the application of this method to intercellular signaling has faced numerous challenges. Signaling and receiving cells within an intact organism are often poorly defined; signaling is often transient or subject to changing regulatory circuitry; and signaling in tissue culture cells typically relies on overexpressed components and reporter readouts, either of which has potential to alter or mask the response. Several features of Notch signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad circumvent these issues. Not only is the signaling cell defined, but signaling is continuous rather than transient. Thus, the DTC expresses DSL ligands in both larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nadarajan et al., 2009</xref>); mitotically dividing germ cells express the GLP-1/Notch receptor at all stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crittenden et al., 1994</xref>), and GLP-1/Notch signaling controls GSC maintenance throughout life of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, two direct Notch target genes are available for assays: <italic>sygl-1</italic> (<italic><underline>sy</underline>nthetic <underline>Gl</underline>p</italic>) and <italic>lst-1 </italic>(<italic><underline>l</underline>ateral <underline>s</underline>ignaling <underline>t</underline>arget)</italic> encode key stem cell regulators, whose removal mimics the loss of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, GLP-1/Notch appears to regulate a pool of cells, enabling quantitation of many receiving cells at one time. This feature would be particularly useful if Notch affects probability of transcriptional firing, as might be expected. Together, these features circumvent common challenges and establish the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad as a superb model for visualizing Notch-dependent transcriptional activation in the nucleus.</p><p>Here we use smFISH and a custom MATLAB code to visualize and quantitate the transcriptional response to Notch signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> distal gonad. We have been able to distinguish nascent transcripts at active transcription sites (ATS) in the nucleus as well as mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm, both from endogenous target genes in wild-type gonads. Therefore, this study reveals the response to Notch signaling in its natural context – no reporters and no manipulated signaling components. We find that Notch regulates both the probability of transcriptional firing at individual chromosomal loci and the number of nascent transcripts produced at active transcription sites. Surprisingly, we discover a gradient in the probability of generating a Notch-regulated ATS across the GSC pool. Yet the steeply graded ATS create a more uniform field of mRNAs that extends beyond the gradient. Therefore, nuclear ATS provide a direct measure for effective engagement of the Notch-dependent transcription complex at its target genes. Finally, we analyze the transcriptional response to two well-characterized Notch mutants. A weaker than wild-type NICD lowers the extent of the Notch-dependent transcriptional response, including the magnitude of transcription probability, number of transcripts generated per active transcription site and range of the spatial gradient, a finding with implications for both patterning and disease. By contrast, an unregulated Notch receptor drives an ectopic transcriptional response at an essentially wild-type level of intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of <italic>sygl-1</italic> active transcription sites (ATS) and cytoplasmic mRNAs</title><p>To visualize the GLP-1/Notch transcriptional response in wild-type gonads, we monitored <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcripts with two probe sets, designed to either <italic>sygl-1</italic> exons or introns and coupled to spectrally-distinct fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As reported previously using conventional <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>), we detected <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNAs in both the distal and proximal gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>); here we focus on the distal <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNAs, because only they are Notch-dependent. The <italic>sygl-1</italic> exon probe set revealed a multitude of spots in germ cells within the niche, with most spots dim but a few bright (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top); by contrast, the intron probe detected many fewer spots that were mostly bright (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle). Importantly, foci seen with the intron probe overlapped with the brighter spots seen with the exon probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>); both also overlapped with DAPI and were therefore nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Nuclear localization was confirmed by labeling with both smFISH and an antibody to the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The same pattern of signals was observed either when the exon and intron probe sets were used together or independently.</p><p>The <italic>sygl-1</italic> exon probes likely highlight Notch-dependent nascent transcripts in the nucleus as well as mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm, while intron probes likely mark only nascent nuclear transcripts. Two experiments confirmed that interpretation. First, treatment with α-amanitin, a standard RNA polymerase II inhibitor, abolished the nuclear dots for both exon and intron probes, but not the cytoplasmic dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, nuclear dots are nascent transcripts and identify active transcription sites (ATS). Second, <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNAi eliminated the cytoplasmic but not the nuclear dots seen with exon probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because RNAi depletes mature but not primary transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maamar et al., 2013</xref>), the cytoplasmic dots must be mRNAs; this experiment also confirms the specificity of the <italic>sygl-1</italic> exon probe. Finally, we confirmed Notch dependence: <italic>sygl-1</italic> smFISH signals were not found in <italic>glp-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) whereas transcription from a non-target gene, <italic>let-858,</italic> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>); moreover, <italic>sygl-1</italic> smFISH signals expanded in a <italic>glp-1</italic> gain-of-function mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). We conclude that <italic>sygl-1</italic> smFISH provides a high-resolution view of Notch-activated nascent transcripts in the nucleus and Notch-dependent mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantitation of <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS and cytoplasmic mRNAs</title><p>We developed a custom MATLAB code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>) to score the presence, intensity and spatial distribution of smFISH signals in confocal images of adult gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Briefly, the code uses DIC to define the tissue edge and DAPI to generate a 3-D reconstruction of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Positions were recorded in 3-D, but are reported here as sites along the gonadal distal-proximal axis in microns (µm) from the distal end; microns were then translated into the more conventional metric of 'germ cell diameters (gcd)' from the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The code excludes the DTC nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and includes all germ cell nuclei within the field of view, corresponding to roughly 60 µm or 13 gcd from the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This field of view includes all <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS and mRNAs in the distal gonad. Following tissue and nuclear reconstruction, we used the code to quantify smFISH signals as a function of both subcellular location (cytoplasm versus nucleus) and position in the gonad (µm/gcd from distal end). As expected, spots seen with the exon probe fell into two groups: one with bright spots co-localizing with both DAPI and the intron-probe-detected ATS, and the other with dimmer spots found outside DAPI and failing to co-localize with intron-probe-detected ATS. Signal intensities of individual spots were normalized to background in each gonad, and then pooled from 78 gonads after normalization between gonads (see Materials and methods). The intensities of the <italic>sygl-1</italic> cytoplasmic mRNAs clustered tightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), a nearly uniform signal that likely corresponds to a single mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raj and Tyagi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS intensities spanned a broad range using either the exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) probe. Comparison of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities, obtained with the same probe set (exon), revealed a mean ATS intensity roughly 17-fold greater on average than the mean single mRNA intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This 17-fold value suggests that roughly 17 nascent transcripts are generated at individual <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS, on average. This estimate is rough because ATS intensities combine signals from short beginning transcripts and longer elongating transcripts. The progenitor zone includes ~4% germ cells in G1, ~71% in S-phase, ~22% in G2 and ~3% in M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seidel and Kimble, 2015</xref>).

We also compared ATS intensities within single nuclei in all pairwise combinations, relying on those nuclei with two or more ATS.

As described above, ATS signal intensity provides a measure of the number of nascent transcripts, but only an estimate. Although ATS signal intensities varied considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), their mean was relatively constant across the distal third of the progenitor zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, blue line). Therefore, unlike the steep gradient in probability of <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcriptional activation, the mean number of transcripts per ATS was not graded.

Alternatively, mRNAs might move between germ cells given their interconnections via a cytoplasmic core or ‘rachis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirsh et al., 1976</xref>). We were not able to assay the movement of individual mRNAs, because live imaging of RNAs has not yet been achieved in this system. Instead, we asked if neighboring cells had similar mRNA densities and found cells with many <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNAs residing immediately adjacent to a neighbor with few or no <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also assessed mRNA densities in ATS-positive cells, ATS-negative cells and the rachis. The <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNAs in the rachis are evidence for movement from cells to rachis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, ATS-positive cells had more <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNAs than did ATS-negative cells, and both had more than the rachis in the distal-most gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This analysis does not exclude a role for mRNA movement, but suggests that free diffusion of mRNAs between cells through the rachis is unlikely. We favor instead the idea that <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcriptional pulses are of shorter duration than mRNA half-life and that this ‘bursty’ transcriptional activation generates a nearly uniform field of mRNAs (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DTC contact correlates with firing of <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS but is not sufficient</title><p>To explore the relationship between the signaling DTC and germ cells activated for <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcription, we analyzed <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS in gonads with the DTC cellular architecture marked using myristoylated GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

We considered two explanations of that graded pattern. One idea was that Notch activity might be graded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left). For example, the abundance or activity of Notch ligand might be graded with most in the DTC cell body and less in DTC processes, but we emphasize that activity of any pathway component might serve the same end. A second idea is that signaling is localized to the distal-most end but that the stability of the Notch transcription complex decays as germ cells move proximally within the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right). One way to distinguish between these two models is to measure abundance, half-life and activity of each pathway component according to position. However, this approach is challenging, in part because many Notch ligands exist in this system and in part because activity assays are not available for most of the components. Instead, we tested predictions of the two models, which are vastly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The first model predicts establishment of the graded pattern at the rate of ATS generation, and the second predicts its establishment at the rate of germ cell movement within the niche. What are those rates? Neither is known with any precision, but rough estimates can be made. In diverse eukaryotic cells, transcriptional elongation occurs at a rate of roughly 1–5 kb/min (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Ari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>). If the <italic>sygl-1</italic> elongation rate falls in a similar range, <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS should be generated relatively quickly, certainly within an hour.

We find that Notch does not orchestrate a synchronous nuclear response but instead tunes the probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts produced. Consistent with that conclusion, Notch activates transcription independently at individual chromosomal loci. We also overturn expectations that the pattern of nuclear active transcription sites (ATS) is essentially the same as the pattern of cytoplasmic mRNAs. ATS are generated in a steep probability gradient across the stem cell pool, but mRNAs are more uniform in the same region and extend beyond it. We also find that NICD strength determines both probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts per ATS, providing a new metric for Notch strength. Below we place these insights in context and discuss their broader implications.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Notch regulates the probability of transcriptional firing</title><p>We find that GLP-1/Notch regulates the probability of transcriptional firing at two target genes, <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1,</italic> and does so independently at individual chromosomal loci. For both genes, Notch activates transcription most commonly at only one chromosomal locus, though in some nuclei, both loci are activated and in others, three or even all four loci can fire in this proliferating population. When both <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> are assayed in the same cells, these genes too are activated independently: some nuclei activate only <italic>sygl-1</italic>, others activate only <italic>lst-1</italic>, and some activate both or neither. The possession of any one Notch-activated ATS marks that cell as having received the Notch signal, while absence of other Notch-activated ATS in the same cell confirms the probabilistic nature of firing. Importantly, the existence of ATS-negative nuclei is unlikely a problem with detection, because cytoplasmic mRNAs, which are significantly dimmer than ATS, are seen in the same cells.</p><p>Transcriptional bursting has emerged as a general phenomenon in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boettiger and Levine, 2009</xref>), and a few studies revealed transcriptional bursting in response to signaling.

We suggest that the sporadic appearance of Notch-responsive ATS is best explained by transcriptional ‘bursts’ or ‘pulses’ separated by periods of quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We do not yet know if Notch regulates frequency or duration of these pulses, or if timing of Notch-dependent transcriptional activation follows a set rhythm once initiated. Answers to these questions must await live imaging of nascent RNAs. Regardless, our results show that Notch regulates the probability of transcription firing at endogenous genes in a wild-type intact tissue, which provides a critical foundation for future investigations with live imaging, which is expected to have lower resolution and typically relies on manipulated reporters.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18370.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Gradient of Notch-dependent active transcription sites: models for underlying mechanism (<bold>A</bold>) and relation to mRNA distribution (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Top, Notch signaling from the DTC niche maintains a pool of germline stem cells (GSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>).

The receptors tested differ at a single amino acid in the GLP-1/Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which is integral to the Notch transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kovall and Hendrickson, 2004</xref>). In yeast and in vitro, the mutant NICD is incapable of assembly into the Notch transcription complex at a higher temperature and less capable of assembly than the wild-type NICD at a lower temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petcherski and Kimble, 2000</xref>). Here we show in nematode germ cells that this same mutant NICD is incapable of Notch-activated transcription at the restrictive temperature and weaker than the wild-type NICD at the permissive temperature. The wild-type and mutant NICDs each had a characteristic probability of transcriptional firing and produced a characteristic number of nascent transcripts, with the mutant at the permissive temperature being about two-fold less effective than wild-type. The simplest interpretation is that the mutant NICD is less capable than wild-type of forming or maintaining the Notch transcription complex in germ cells. The molecular consequence of the mutant’s two-fold lower transcriptional response is the generation of a shorter than normal ATS gradient (this work), and its biological consequence is a reduced progenitor zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox and Schedl, 2015</xref>). The discovery that NICD strength modulates both probability and intensity of the Notch transcriptional response underscores the importance of the NICD for fine-tuning the Notch response, with implications for pattern formation and disease. This finding also highlights the power of a high-resolution ATS assay for assessing molecular consequences of any condition (e.g. defects in any component in the pathway as well as physiological or environmental factors) that affect Notch transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A GLP-1/Notch-regulated gradient in ATS probability across the stem cell pool</title><p>GLP-1/Notch signaling from the DTC niche not only maintains a pool of germline stem cells but also establishes polarity and patterning in the germline tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimble and White 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). Yet the spatial extent of GLP-1/Notch influence was poorly understood prior to this work. We now learn that GLP-1/Notch activates transcription over a defined region (7 germ cell diameters from the distal end) and that its nuclear response is steeply graded over that region. Importantly, GLP-1/Notch forms a gradient of ATS probability rather than ATS size, and to our knowledge, no gradient of this type has been seen before. We imagine that Notch generates this ATS probability gradient by tuning either the frequency or duration of transcriptional pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), possibilities that can be distinguished once live imaging of nascent transcripts has been established.</p><p>One mechanism for generating the ATS probability gradient might have been that Notch signaling was restricted to the distal end and that the gradient formed by gradual decay of the Notch transcription complex as germ cells moved proximally within the niche. However, after abolishing the Notch nuclear response, recovery of the gradient was too fast to support such a mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We favor instead a mechanism that establishes the graded activity of the Notch transcription complex. Possibilities include graded changes in ligand abundance or activity, graded changes in NICD abundance or activity or graded changes in chromatin modifications, any of which could play a role in forming the ATS probability gradient. Regardless, we suggest that graded loss of active transcription sites at loci encoding key stem cell regulators is likely the molecular basis of the long sought 'initial trigger' for stem cells to begin their transition towards a differentiated state and, as such, this gradient is likely to be critical for establishing size of the stem cell pool.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ATS provide an accurate assay of productive notch activity</title><p>Cytoplasmic mRNAs provide a commonly used readout of the Notch transcriptional response and clearly their distribution is crucial biologically.

The images acquired in this study were packaged in LIF format and were read in MATLAB with their metadata (<italic>e.g.</italic>pixel size, z-step size and total number of z slices). The X, Y and Z coordinates and signal intensity of gonadal boundaries, nuclei, mRNAs, and ATS (nuclear spots) were recorded as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Whole gonadal images (~0–60 µm from the distal end) were quantitated except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G,H</xref> (0–30 µm). The gonad boundary was detected using DIC from the central 8 Z-planes. The MATLAB code reoriented the gonads with DTC to the left for further analyses. The gonads were reconstructed in MATLAB as rounded and often not straight cylinders with radii changing along the distal-proximal axis. The gonadal boundaries were used for removing non-specific fluorescent signal located outside the gonad. Next, the nuclei were detected using DAPI signal. In each Z-plane, the function ‘imfindcircles’ was used to draw concentric nuclear circles to define the nuclear boundary and the threshold for DAPI signal (background level) was determined by 150% of output values of the function ‘greythresh’ in MATLAB. DAPI signal in each Z-plane was normalized to the mean background intensity within that Z-plane, in a location without nuclei. To generate a 3-D nucleus, a best-fit sphere was drawn to fit concentric circles from different Z-planes. A nucleus was scored as present if (1) concentric circles were identified in ≥4 consecutive Z-planes and (2) the variation of centers within the concentric circles was &lt;0.5 μm in the X,Y direction (Euclidean distance). To estimate nuclear size, the radius of the 3-D spherical nucleus was recorded.

Only ATS spots identified with both detection methods were considered further. Irregularly shaped objects (circularity &lt;0.7) were discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al. 2015</xref>). The criteria used to identify ATS candidates were validated by manually comparing detection results to micrographs (training set of 15 gonads). The ‘supervised machine learning’ was used to determine parameters for ATS determination (<italic>e.g</italic>. ATS background level, threshold for signal/background ratio). The criteria were that each ATS within a Z-plane must have: (1) a &gt;1.27 (for <italic>sygl-1</italic>) or &gt;0.8 (for <italic>lst-1</italic>) ratio of signal to mean overall background in the gonad; (2) a &gt;1.9 (for <italic>sygl-1</italic>) or &gt;0.9 (for <italic>lst-1</italic>) ratio of signal to local background (the area located within 3X the distance [~10–17 pixels] from the ATS center); (3) a &lt;9*10<sup>−10</sup> (for <italic>sygl-1</italic>) or &lt;1*10–1 (for <italic>lst-1</italic>) p-value in t-tests comparing all pixel values in candidate ATS to its local background; and (4) a size of &gt;3 × 3 pixels (average detected mRNA size is ~4 × 4 pixels) for both <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>.

First, nuclear spots, identified with exon-specific probes, were removed. mRNA candidates were identified in each Z-plane using image segmentation tools (as above). Size, volume, shape and fluorescence signal intensity were used to identify and calculate number/intensity of mRNA spots. We calculated mean mRNA intensity and mean mRNA size in each Z-plane. After thus scoring mRNA candidates, the gonad was 3-D reconstructed and any spots &lt;20% of mean mRNA intensity and &lt;20% of mean mRNA size were removed. Using this calculated mean intensity and size, we were able to determine if a single cytoplasmic spot contained one or multiple mRNAs (≥ 2 X brighter and larger). The presence of multiple mRNAs in one spot was rare (&lt;5%). The basal mRNA level in each gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>) was calculated by averaging rare dim signals in germ cells located 40–60 μm (~9–13 gcd) from the distal end (in 5 μm sections). mRNA density was calculated as the total number of mRNAs divided by the volume of the region counted (5 μm sections). The gcd (germ cell diameter) was estimated as 4.55 µm from the mean distance of two neighboring nuclei (from 78 wild-type gonads). We confirmed gcd by manually counting the germ cells in maximum Z-projected distal gonads with DAPI-staining. <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNA density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref> was calculated from total number of mRNAs divided by total cytoplasmic volume of ATS-positive or ATS-negative cells, whose boundaries were defined using a Voronoi diagram in 3-D or in the rachis. Cytoplasmic volume excludes nuclear volume. Non-cell core region of gonad at 0–20 µm (4–5 gcd) was used to calculate the volume of the rachis.</p><p>Signal intensities for each gonad were determined above. We then set out to normalize exon probes (both ATS and mRNAs) across gonads and strains for direct comparison.

Briefly, samples were blocked in PBSTw containing 0.5% BSA (PBSB) for 30 min at RT. Fixed gonads were incubated with 1:10 guinea pig LMN-1 (provided by Jun Kelly Liu) in PBSB overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed 3X for 15 min with PBSB and incubated with secondary antibody at 1:500 (Goat anti-guinea-pig AlexaFluor 488, Life Technologies) for 1.5 hr at RT. Samples were washed three times with PBSB and mounted in Antifade Prolong Gold mounting medium.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Many thanks to Sarah Crittenden, Hannah Seidel, Marvin Wickens and Sarah Robinson for critical comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Eric Haag (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and the editor all agree that the data presented are of very high quality and add to our understanding of Notch signaling in maintaining germ line stem cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the claim of a novel linkage between cell signaling and stochastic transcription was felt not to be fully justified. The crux of your argument was interpreted as: 1) Not all cells are in the same state with respect to transcription, and therefore this means there is a stochastic process at work 2) Because there is nevertheless a clear impact of Notch-GLP-1 signaling on the distribution of transcription, &quot;modulated stochasticity&quot; is a key mechanism of signal transduction. However, mere non-homogeneity of transcription cannot on its own prove that stochastic forces are at work. When nascent transcripts are short-lived, and produced sparsely and asynchronously, many cells will lack them, yet the underlying process could actually be highly regular. In addition, there is now considerable existing evidence for the generality of stochasticity so that it is not clear that your findings represent an entirely novel insight.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Lee et al. perform cytological analysis of GLP-1/Notch transcriptional targets <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> to examine the relationship between transcriptional output and Notch signaling. They find that nascent, intron containing, <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNA is limited to the distal ~1-5 germ cell diameters, that cytoplasmic <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNA is present in the distal ~1-10 cell diameters and that the presence of both nascent and cytoplasmic RNA is dependent on GLP-1/Notch activity. Lee et al. find that in a number of cells, within in the 1-5 cell diameters that shows evidence of GLP-1/Notch dependence, lack nascent intron containing <italic>sygl-1</italic>, which is interpreted as stochastic transcription. Nascent intron containing RNA from the <italic>let-858</italic> gene, which is not known to be spatially regulated, showed distal-to-proximal spatially unrestricted expression, which also can be interpreted as stochastic, as a number of nuclei lacked signal. The presence or absence of nascent <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNA was found to be independent of cell cycle stage. The spatial distribution of nascent and cytoplasmic <italic>sygl-1</italic> RNA is concordant but reduced in cell diameters, when analysis was performed in a mutant <italic>glp-1</italic> background that has partially reduced activity. Finally, using a temperature shift regimen, Lee et al. showed that the abundance of nascent and cytoplasmic <italic>sygl-1</italic> smFISH foci was a function of GLP-1/Notch activity, implying that as germ cells move farther away from the distal end, the GLP-1/Notch transcriptional output decreases.</p><p>This is a thorough and well controlled investigation of spatial control of GLP-1/Notch transcriptional targets, where the findings from Lee et al. are consistent with what was previously known and inferred from work from the Kimble, Schedl, Hubbard and Engebrecht groups.</p><p>The major assertion of the manuscript is that GLP-1/Notch signaling modulates transcriptional stochasticity of its targets, <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>. The prevailing view from the field is that Pol II transcription of all genes in inherently stochastic [1], [2], [3] &amp; [4], which is consistent with data presented for the non-spatially regulated gene <italic>let-858</italic>. In the case of <italic>sygl-1</italic>, which has an mRNA half-life of ~1hr, if there was continuous (non-stochastic) transcription, then there would be such high levels of cytoplasmic <italic>sygl-1</italic> mRNA that the stem cell control mechanism would likely become spatially unregulated.</p><p>Given the prevailing view, then essentially all mechanisms that upregulate transcription, like Notch or RTK signaling, must do so by modulating the frequency of transcriptional initiation/elongation, within the context of stochasticity. The extent of stochastic gene expression depends mostly on the mean level of that gene's expression [5], [6] &amp; [7], which generates a linear relationship on a plot of log (ln) of variance of gene expression versus log (ln) mean of gene expression. A gene that shows specific regulation of stochastic expression would be found off the diagonal of the plot of log of variance of gene expression versus log mean of gene expression; <italic>sygl-1</italic> should show such an off-diagonal location based on the assertion of the authors. This reviewer appreciates that while an analysis to generate a plot of log variance of gene expression versus log mean gene expression is straightforward with genome wide approaches like RNA-seq, it would be very labor intensive to do the analysis cytologically, one gene at a time, as would be necessary for the system under study. Nevertheless, the information present in this manuscript is not sufficient to demonstrate that regulation of GLP-1/Notch targets is specifically through modulation of stochasticity.</p><p>1) Levsky, J.M. and R.H.

The comparisons should only be among cells at the same distance, in μm or cell diameters from the distal tip. Thus, while stochasticity is present, it is likely to be overestimated by the current approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper examines the expression of Notch target genes in germline stem cells of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It uses powerful fluorescent probes to detect what are likely single mRNAs, either nascent transcripts associated with active transcription sites (ATS) in the nucleus or mature spliced mRNAs in the cytoplasm. The microscopy and image analysis are carefully done, and the numerous controls leave little doubt that we are indeed looking at transcripts from Notch target genes. The authors also demonstrate convincingly that the <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> transcriptional events are not coupled in a given cell, and that both ATS and cytoplasmic mRNA density are correlated with Notch signaling (as judged by a <italic>glp-1</italic> conditional mutation) and proximity to the distal tip (niche) cell.</p><p>This manuscript is technically impressive and it clarifies the relationship between transcription and steady-state mRNA levels in a developing animal tissue. Though one might imagine that a cell being stimulated by a signaling pathway would produce their various positively regulated target gene transcripts more or less constantly, it instead appears that at a given time only a minority of cells are actually doing so, at least at a level detectable using the imagining tools used here.</p><p>With the above overall enthusiastic evaluation in mind, I do have some concerns:</p><p>1) The authors present strong evidence to suggest that Notch targets are less transcribed as germ cells move away from the DTC niche cell. They note that this is correlated with cells being increasingly likely to lose contact with the finger-like processes of the DTC. This all makes sense given current models for germ cell differentiation. Another simple explanation (and not mutually exclusive with the authors') might be that DSL ligand proteins are also spatially graded along the processes of the DTC. Might the lovely myristoylated GFP probe the Kimble lab recently published (Byrd et al. 2014) be combined with a LAG-2 protein fusion like that described by Gengyo-Ando et al. (2006)?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, I am perplexed as to why there is not a bimodal distribution of DNA content, as would be expected if S-phase were relatively short compared to other parts of the cell cycle. Looking at the X axis, it is also a bit odd that the DAPI signal varies by five-fold, when the real difference cannot be greater than two-fold. This suggests that use of DAPI images for quantitation is very noisy. Why might that be? Permeability variation? Quenching by other fluorescent probes? Are there reasons to believe panel 2J might be more reliable? Some comment on this is probably in order.</p><p>3) I also have a statistical concern (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>The term &quot;stochasticity&quot; has been used to describe the observation that genetically identical cells in a common environment have variable gene expression at a given moment in time. Further, in eukaryotic cells a simple Poisson model (in which stochasticity is characterized by a constant probability of transcription over time) often fails to capture the dynamics of new transcription. Instead, a model of quiescence alternating with bursts of relatively frequent transcriptional initiation fits the data much better. Nevertheless, in a population of cells (or as a single cell is followed longitudinally over long periods of time) more predictable, uniform behaviors emerge. In this sense, transcriptional stochasticity is similar to how quantum-level phenomena lead to classical predictability in physics.</p><p>In this study of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> distal germ line, there is a predictable decline in cytoplasmic Notch target transcripts as cells move away from the DTC, yet even at the very tip ATS are only found in a few cells at any one time. Notch signaling could be seen as a parameter that increases the probability of a target gene ATS forming, but not as an &quot;all on, all the time&quot; situation. Provided the method used is not missing a large proportion of the actual ATS present, this is consistent with the above idea of stochasticity. As the authors state, &quot;The transcriptional response to Notch signaling can vary from one receiving cell to another. This means that Notch signaling does not abolish the inherent stochasticity of transcription, but instead modulates that stochasticity.&quot;</p><p>The authors' interpretation is reasonable, but we could dig deeper to ask whether the dynamics are truly stochastic, and if so whether they are &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;bursty,&quot; as has been found in other eukaryotic systems. The non-stochastic alternative goes like this:</p><p>Germ cells are all expressing Notch targets at the exact same rate, but they (and their two allelic copies of any given target gene) are out of phase with each other;</p><p>Most of a cycle of transcription is spent in the initiation phase;</p><p>When transcripts are elongated, they are rapidly spliced and exported to the cytoplasm;</p><p>Notch signaling functions to consistently shorten the initiation phase for all responding cells.</p><p>Because cells are asynchronous and the initiation phase is invisible, ATS would appear in a minority of cells, just as for a stochastic process. However, the canalized timing of ATS formation described above would produce a normally distributed range of ATS counts in replicated populations of cells at any given moment. In contrast, a one-state stochastic process would produce a Poisson-like distribution, while a multistate process would fit neither. I therefore encourage the authors to try some new analyses or simulations to see which of these alternative models fit their data best.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>C. elegans</italic> GLP-1/Notch activates transcription in a probability gradient across the germline stem cell pool&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant as the Senior editor and Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that the reviewers would like you to consider in your final submission. They are intended to improve your manuscript and we would appreciate your consideration of their inclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>Lee et al. manipulated GLP-1/Notch activity through the use of a temperature sensitive reduction of function mutation. The authors also briefly described results with a gain of function GLP-1/Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A major question in the field is whether Notch gain of function mutants that, for example, contribute to cancer through disregulation of INTRA levels, have increased signaling activity or unregulated-ectopic signaling activity. From visual examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, it appears that the <italic>glp-1</italic> gain of function mutant has ATS signal distribution similar to wild type within the distal most 5 cell diameters, suggesting that this <italic>glp-1</italic> gain of function mutant, while displaying ectopic signaling does not have increased signaling activity in the distal most germ cells. Given that Lee et al. have n = 10 for this mutant they should be able to perform the same analysis described in the manuscript and provide important information as to whether the gain of function mutation has similar or increased signaling over wild type ligand dependent signaling in the distal most 5 cell diameters and more proximally.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>I believe the unresolved biological question we are all interested in is this: Why don't cells at a given distance from the DTC behave identically? One could even imagine a stripe of coordinated ATS-bearing cells N nuclei from the DTC, at least if the tissue were fixed at just the right time. After hundreds of such fixations we never see anything remotely like that. So, we can safely conclude that transcription of target gene copies is not coordinated in time. But, as I noted before, lack of coordination doesn't necessarily equate with randomness. It could be that each allele of a target gene in a field of cells experiencing the same level of Notch signal is following the exact same timetable for transcription, but because they are not coordinated to start with, heterogeneity is maintained. The simplest alternative is that the timetable itself is variable from allele to allele, but within some range given the amount of signaling. That is, there is a distribution of transcription cycle durations for any given level of Notch signaling. It's important to note that these alternatives exist even with a constant level of Notch signal. Were Notch signal strength to be increased, then in the first scenario the length of a uniform timetable is shortened, while in the latter there is a leftward shift in the distribution of timetable lengths, either of which would give predictably higher transcription population-wide.</p><p>It's my sense that the author's new language can accommodate either of the above scenarios, but if they agree with the alternatives above, then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> might be modified to reflect them. Because the <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript review interface doesn't allow uploading of files, I will submit my own attempt to do this to the editors via email in hopes that it be shared with the authors. I think the authors are leaning towards the second model, but we don't yet have the data to rule out the first.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18370.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] The reviewers and the editor all agree that the data presented are of very high quality and add to our understanding of Notch signaling in maintaining germ line stem cells in C. elegans.

As a result, we have reframed our conclusion to state that signaling does not orchestrate a uniform response in receiving cells, but that it instead activates transcription in a “probabilistic” manner at target genes and does so independently at each locus.</p><p>What is new:</p><p>The analysis of nascent transcripts at active transcription sites in cells responding to a canonical signaling pathway has not been before in any organism. I have presented our results at meetings and in seminars over the past year. These included a Cancer Research meeting on signaling and its control of stem cells, a Genetics Society meeting on model organisms and a Gordon Research Conference on Notch signaling. In all cases, the reaction to our findings was incredibly positive – ranging from “best talk of the meeting, it transformed my way of thinking about signaling”, to “we better start looking at our pathway this way as it is clearly the way to go” to “wow, we never would have thought that the germ cell response to Notch signaling would be graded like that”. When I presented the results at HHMI, Spyros was visibly jazzed and asked if I would be interested in helping with a meeting centered on Notch-regulated transcription. All in all, our results have gotten a very positive response from the relevant communities, consistent with them making an important advance forward.</p><p>We find that Notch signaling does not orchestrate a uniform response in receiving cells, but that it instead activates transcription in a “probabilistic” manner. Expectations varied considerably. Many people assumed that signaling would orchestrate a uniform response in receiving cells, and many others assumed that signaling would activate transcription in a “probabilistic” manner. The former group were largely cell or developmental biologists, many of whom work on developmental cell-cell signaling; the latter group were largely biochemists and molecular biologists. Regardless, this is the first study to provide quantitative data on the nuclear response to any canonical signaling pathway, and the answer is clear that Notch activates transcription in a “probabilistic” manner.</p><p>Discovery of a gradient in the probability of transcriptional activation is new. Gradients of course are not new, but a gradient of this type could not have been discovered without looking quantitatively at active transcription sites during signaling and no one had done that before.</p><p>Our analysis of different-strength NICDs demonstrates that a wild-type NICD drives a higher probability of transcriptional activation and larger number of nascent transcripts than a weaker mutant NICD. This may not be unexpected, but it has never been analyzed before and our results validate use of ATS as a new metric for Notch signaling and one that should be of general use. This metric opens a new approach for analysis of pathway mutants, including those with clinical effects, and also for engineering new pathway components, for example, to increase NICD strength or to act specifically on either probability or number of nascent transcripts.</p><p>What is unexpected:</p><p>Our finding that the shape of the ATS gradient is different from that of the mRNA gradient was not expected. My talk at the recent GRC on Notch signaling turned on a lot of light bulbs about the importance of assaying transcriptional activity in the nucleus as the most accurate assay for Notch-dependent transcriptional activation. Our manuscript now includes a figure highlighting this discrepancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and argues explicitly that ATS provide a more direct and more accurate readout of canonical signaling.</p><p>Our finding that a steep ATS probability gradient can generate a near uniform and more extended field of mRNAs was not expected. Virtually all prior studies of canonical signaling analyzed mRNAs rather than ATS with many analyzing reporter mRNAs. A uniform field of mRNAs would have been interpreted as a uniform field of signaling. But now we find a graded signaling readout. This was a surprise!</p><p>We found a gradient in the probability of transcriptional activation that occurs across the <italic>C. elegans</italic> GSC pool, which is composed of developmentally equivalent cells. This was not expected. Cells in the pool are not only developmentally equivalent but they are surrounded by processes of the signaling distal tip cell. So the prevailing hypothesis was that the signaling response would be uniform. At the recent GSA meeting in Orlando, the many worm GSC experts who heard my talk were surprised and excited by these findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Lee et al perform cytological analysis of GLP-1/Notch transcriptional targets sygl-1 and lst-1 to examine the relationship between transcriptional output and Notch signaling. They find that nascent, intron containing, sygl-1 RNA is limited to the distal ~1-5 germ cell diameters, that cytoplasmic sygl-1 mRNA is present in the distal ~1-10 cell diameters and that the presence of both nascent and cytoplasmic RNA is dependent on GLP-1/Notch activity. Lee et al find that in a number of cells, within in the 1-5 cell diameters that shows evidence of GLP-1/Notch dependence, lack nascent intron containing sygl-1, which is interpreted as stochastic transcription. Nascent intron containing RNA from the let-858 gene, which is not known to be spatially regulated, showed distal-to-proximal spatially unrestricted expression, which also can be interpreted as stochastic, as a number of nuclei lacked signal. The presence or absence of nascent sygl-1 RNA was found to be independent of cell cycle stage. The spatial distribution of nascent and cytoplasmic sygl-1 RNA is concordant but reduced in cell diameters, when analysis was performed in a mutant glp-1 background that has partially reduced activity. Finally, using a temperature shift regimen, Lee et al showed that the abundance of nascent and cytoplasmic sygl-1 smFISH foci was a function of GLP-1/Notch activity, implying that as germ cells move farther away from the distal end, the GLP-1/Notch transcriptional output decreases.</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a thorough and well controlled investigation of spatial control of GLP-1/Notch transcriptional targets, where the findings from Lee et al are consistent with what was previously known and inferred from work from the Kimble, Schedl, Hubbard and Engebrecht groups.</italic> </p><p>Yes everything is consistent with what was previously known but our study takes regulation of this stem cell model to an entirely new level and makes a number of new insights, some of which could have been inferred and others that were not even imagined.</p><p>An example of a result that might been inferred is the effect of NICD strength on transcriptional activation. The GLP-1 q224 NICD was postulated to be weaker because of its mutant phenotype, and our study confirms that idea in nematodes. Prior to this work, NICD strength could not be quantitated at a molecular level in an intact organism. Our findings also validate use of ATS quantitation as a metric, as described in the “what’s new” section above.</p><p>An example of a result that had not even been proposed is the gradient in ATS probability across the stem cell pool. Prior to this work, a gradient in the probability of firing an ATS had not been seen in any developing tissue and it was certainly not proposed for this one. See “what’s new” and “what’s unexpected” sections above.</p><p><italic>The major assertion of the manuscript is that GLP-1/Notch signaling modulates transcriptional stochasticity of its targets, sygl-1 and lst-1. The prevailing view from the field is that Pol II transcription of all genes in inherently stochastic [1], [2], [3] &amp; [4], which is consistent with data presented for the non-spatially regulated gene let-858. In the case of sygl-1, which has an mRNA half-life of ~1hr, if there was continuous (non-stochastic) transcription, then there would be such high levels of cytoplasmic sygl-1 mRNA that the stem cell control mechanism would likely become spatially unregulated.</italic> </p><p><italic>Given the prevailing view, then essentially all mechanisms that upregulate transcription, like Notch or RTK signaling, must do so by modulating the frequency of transcriptional initiation/elongation, within the context of stochasticity. The extent of stochastic gene expression depends mostly on the mean level of that gene's expression [5], [6] &amp; [7], which generates a linear relationship on a plot of log (ln) of variance of gene expression versus log (ln) mean of gene expression. A gene that shows specific regulation of stochastic expression would be found off the diagonal of the plot of log of variance of gene expression versus log mean of gene expression; sygl-1 should show such an off-diagonal location based on the assertion of the authors. This reviewer appreciates that while an analysis to generate a plot of log variance of gene expression versus log mean gene expression is straightforward with genome wide approaches like RNA-seq, it would be very labor intensive to do the analysis cytologically, one gene at a time, as would be necessary for the system under study. Nevertheless, the information present in this manuscript is not sufficient to demonstrate that regulation of GLP-1/Notch targets is specifically through modulation of stochasticity.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Levsky, J.M. and R.H.

We now conclude that signaling does not orchestrate a uniform response in receiving cells, but that it instead activates transcription in a “probabilistic” manner at individual target genes and does so independently at each locus. This reviewer mentions that a plot of log variance of gene expression versus log mean gene expression is a common way to test for stochasticity of gene expression. However, that analysis is done with RNA-Seq data and focuses on mRNAs, which are not applicable to our ATS analysis. Instead, we followed the suggestion of reviewer #2 to estimate stochasticity of <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS by comparing their spatial pattern to a Poisson random simulation (see below).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>Comparisons made in panel D should not be grouped into 0-30μm, because as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, there is as much as a two-fold difference in number of mRNAs based on distal - proximal position in the 0-30μm region. The comparisons should only be among cells at the same distance, in um or cell diameters from the distal tip. Thus, while stochasticity is present, it is likely to be overestimated by the current approach.</italic> </p><p>We do not understand this comment because we never argued for stochasticity of mRNA abundance. We also note that the revised manuscript no longer focuses on stochasticity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors present strong evidence to suggest that Notch targets are less transcribed as germ cells move away from the DTC niche cell. They note that this is correlated with cells being increasingly likely to lose contact with the finger-like processes of the DTC. This all makes sense given current models for germ cell differentiation. Another simple explanation (and not mutually exclusive with the authors') might be that DSL ligand proteins are also spatially graded along the processes of the DTC. Might the lovely myristoylated GFP probe the Kimble lab recently published (Byrd et al. 2014) be combined with a LAG-2 protein fusion like that described by Gengyo-Ando et al. (2006)?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we find an ATS gradient, but in fact we do not find the correlation with loss of DTC contact that the reviewer suggests. Just the opposite. The DTC or its processes contact virtually all cells with ATS as well as the lion’s share of cells lacking ATS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> response to reviewer #1). In unpublished work, we have found that a LAG-2::GFP fusion protein is visible in all DTC processes (both short intercalating as well as long external processes), but this is not terribly informative – it tells us where a transgenic DSL ligand is expressed, but not where that ligand is triggering a response. The transgenic LAG-2::GFP rescues a <italic>lag-2</italic> null mutant, but its biological phenotype is not fully wild-type so we prefer to CRISPR tag endogenous LAG-2 and APX-1, which is on our list of things to do, but not yet accomplished. More importantly, <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> ATS provide an unprecedently accurate readout of where signaling has achieved a transcriptional response and this is the focus of our paper.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, I am perplexed as to why there is not a bimodal distribution of DNA content, as would be expected if S-phase were relatively short compared to other parts of the cell cycle. Looking at the X axis, it is also a bit odd that the DAPI signal varies by five-fold, when the real difference cannot be greater than two-fold. This suggests that use of DAPI images for quantitation is very noisy. Why might that be? Permeability variation? Quenching by other fluorescent probes? Are there reasons to believe panel 2J might be more reliable? Some comment on this is probably in order.</italic> </p><p>S-phase is not short relative to other phases of the cell cycle. Instead, G1 is very, very short and S-phase consumes about ~70% of the length of the cell cycle, as we published in an <italic>eLife</italic> paper last year (Seidel and Kimble, 2015). The revised manuscript now includes the lengths of the various cell cycle phases to address this misconception. As for the DAPI signal variability, the difference between low and high DAPI intensity value is ~2.6-fold after we remove outliers (data points more than 1.5 interquartile range); this number is closer to what one might expect. Possible sources of error that might generate outliers include variation in DAPI staining from gonad to gonad and capture of nuclear images every 0.3 µm on the z-axis. Moreover, we used nuclear size as another metric to support the DAPI measurement. All in all, our data strongly support our conclusion that activation of <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS does not correlate with any phase of the cell cycle. We note that this result was also not expected, at least by some workers in Notch signaling, but this surprise is sufficiently minor that we did not include it in the “not expected” results above.</p><p><italic>3) I also have a statistical concern (see below).</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p><italic>The term &quot;stochasticity&quot; has been used to describe the observation that genetically identical cells in a common environment have variable gene expression at a given moment in time. Further, in eukaryotic cells a simple Poisson model (in which stochasticity is characterized by a constant probability of transcription over time) often fails to capture the dynamics of new transcription. Instead, a model of quiescence alternating with bursts of relatively frequent transcriptional initiation fits the data much better. Nevertheless, in a population of cells (or as a single cell is followed longitudinally over long periods of time) more predictable, uniform behaviors emerge. In this sense, transcriptional stochasticity is similar to how quantum-level phenomena lead to classical predictability in physics.</italic> </p><p><italic>In this study of the C. elegans distal germ line, there is a predictable decline in cytoplasmic Notch target transcripts as cells move away from the DTC, yet even at the very tip ATS are only found in a few cells at any one time. Notch signaling could be seen as a parameter that increases the probability of a target gene ATS forming, but not as an &quot;all on, all the time&quot; situation. Provided the method used is not missing a large proportion of the actual ATS present, this is consistent with the above idea of stochasticity. As the authors state, &quot;The transcriptional response to Notch signaling can vary from one receiving cell to another. This means that Notch signaling does not abolish the inherent stochasticity of transcription, but instead modulates that stochasticity.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors' interpretation is reasonable, but we could dig deeper to ask whether the dynamics are truly stochastic, and if so whether they are &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;bursty,&quot; as has been found in other eukaryotic systems. The non-stochastic alternative goes like this:</italic> </p><p><italic>Germ cells are all expressing Notch targets at the exact same rate, but they (and their two allelic copies of any given target gene) are out of phase with each other;</italic> </p><p><italic>Most of a cycle of transcription is spent in the initiation phase;</italic> </p><p><italic>When transcripts are elongated, they are rapidly spliced and exported to the cytoplasm;</italic> </p><p><italic>Notch signaling functions to consistently shorten the initiation phase for all responding cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>Because cells are asynchronous and the initiation phase is invisible, ATS would appear in a minority of cells, just as for a stochastic process. However, the canalized timing of ATS formation described above would produce a normally distributed range of ATS counts in replicated populations of cells at any given moment. In contrast, a one-state stochastic process would produce a Poisson-like distribution, while a multistate process would fit neither. I therefore encourage the authors to try some new analyses or simulations to see which of these alternative models fit their data best.</italic> </p><p>In the originally submitted manuscript we used the term “stochasticity” to describe the independent Notch-dependent transcription of its target genes at chromosomal loci. We appreciate suggestions to “dig deeper” into whether the ATS dynamics are truly stochastic, but suggest that this issue is tangential to our reframed conclusion that Notch signaling does not orchestrate a uniform response in receiving cells, but that it instead activates transcription in a “probabilistic” manner at individual target genes and does so independently at each locus. The data backing up this conclusion are strong: lack of correlation between intensities of ATS at loci within single nuclei for both <italic>sygl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and <italic>lst-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), lack of correlation between numbers of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> ATS in the same nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and lack of correlation of the summed ATS intensities of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> in the same nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>We appreciate reviewer #2’s thoughtful suggestions about testing stochasticity of ATS timing but respectfully suggest that these tests are premature. Although we can do simulations, the experimental data for comparison do not yet exist. We are generating constructs to attempt live imaging of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> ATS and hope to have that data at some point in the future. However, these experiments rely on introduction of many reiterated copies of MS2 binding sites, and such reiterated sequences are often silenced in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells. Thus, we will try but do not know if and when it will work. Once we have overcome this hurdle and have data for frequency and/or duration of transcriptional pulses, we can do the requested simulations and test this question.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have done two things in an attempt to address Reviewer 2’s concerns. First, we added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, which illustrates models for ATS timing possibilities even though testing them lies in the future. Second, we did simulations based on our current data to demonstrate that ATS are not generated stochastically. Given the steep ATS gradient, this is no surprise and we do not suggest that these simulations be incorporated into the paper. Because the reviewers might be interested, we have included them below.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18370.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Tests to ask if positions of sygl-1 ATS is stochastic among cells in the GSC pool.</title><p>A, B) We recorded positions of <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS-positive and -negative cells within the region harboring ATS (0-30 µm from distal end) for each gonad examined (n=60 gonads) and then used a Poisson distribution to position ATS-positive cells randomly.

The authors also briefly described results with a gain of function GLP-1/Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A major question in the field is whether Notch gain of function mutants that, for example, contribute to cancer through disregulation of INTRA levels, have increased signaling activity or unregulated-ectopic signaling activity. From visual examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, it appears that the glp-1 gain of function mutant has ATS signal distribution similar to wild type within the distal most 5 cell diameters, suggesting that this glp-1 gain of function mutant, while displaying ectopic signaling does not have increased signaling activity in the distal most germ cells. Given that Lee et al. have n = 10 for this mutant they should be able to perform the same analysis described in the manuscript and provide important information as to whether the gain of function mutation has similar or increased signaling over wild type ligand dependent signaling in the distal most 5 cell diameters and more proximally.</italic> </p><p>We have now done this analysis and included it as a new supplementary figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Our results show that the percentage of cells with <italic>sygl-1</italic> ATS is uniform in the strain with the unregulated receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement1A</xref>) and that the intensity is also about the same as the intensity of ATS in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because this <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> analysis had to be done in L4 gonads for technical reasons, we also include in this supplementary figure two additional panels to document the response in wild-type L4 germ cells, which is very much like wild-type adult germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>We also revised the text to describe this new data (–subsection “Gradient of Notch-dependent <italic>sygl-1</italic> transcriptional activation”, last paragraph) and include a legend for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p><italic>I believe the unresolved biological question we are all interested in is this: Why don't cells at a given distance from the DTC behave identically? One could even imagine a stripe of coordinated ATS-bearing cells N nuclei from the DTC, at least if the tissue were fixed at just the right time. After hundreds of such fixations we never see anything remotely like that. So, we can safely conclude that transcription of target gene copies is not coordinated in time. But, as I noted before, lack of coordination doesn't necessarily equate with randomness. It could be that each allele of a target gene in a field of cells experiencing the same level of Notch signal is following the exact same timetable for transcription, but because they are not coordinated to start with, heterogeneity is maintained. The simplest alternative is that the timetable itself is variable from allele to allele, but within some range given the amount of signaling. That is, there is a distribution of transcription cycle durations for any given level of Notch signaling. It's important to note that these alternatives exist even with a constant level of Notch signal. Were Notch signal strength to be increased, then in the first scenario the length of a uniform timetable is shortened, while in the latter there is a leftward shift in the distribution of timetable lengths, either of which would give predictably higher transcription population-wide.</italic> </p><p><italic>It's my sense that the author's new language can accommodate either of the above scenarios, but if they agree with the alternatives above, then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> might be modified to reflect them. Because the eLife manuscript review interface doesn't allow uploading of files, I will submit my own attempt to do this to the editors via email in hopes that it be shared with the authors. I think the authors are leaning towards the second model, but we don't yet have the data to rule out the first.</italic> </p><p>We agree that either of these two scenarios is possible but have no real reason to favor one over the other. To address this suggestion, we therefore added the text as follows:</p><p>“We do not yet know if Notch regulates frequency or duration of these pulses, or if timing of Notch-dependent transcriptional activation follows a set rhythm once initiated. Answers to these questions must await live imaging of nascent RNAs.”</p><p>We also considered the idea of making this point in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, but decided that this addition would complicate an already speculative figure with further speculation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
