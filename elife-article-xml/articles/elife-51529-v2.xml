brain originate from tightly controlled growth and division of neural stem cells, regulated systemically by important known stem cell-extrinsic signals. However, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the distinctive proliferation rates of individual neural stem cells are unknown. Here, we show that the size and division rates of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells (neuroblasts) are controlled by the highly conserved RNA binding protein Imp (IGF2BP), via one of its top binding targets in the brain, <italic>myc</italic> mRNA. We show that Imp stabilises <italic>myc</italic> mRNA leading to increased Myc protein levels, larger neuroblasts, and faster division rates. Declining Imp levels throughout development limit <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability to restrain neuroblast growth and division, and heterogeneous Imp expression correlates with <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability between individual neuroblasts in the brain. We propose that Imp-dependent regulation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability fine-tunes individual neural stem cell proliferation rates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is a highly complex organ made up of huge numbers of different cell types that connect up to form a precise network. All these different cell types are generated from the repeated division of a relatively small pool of cells called neural stem cells. The division of these cells needs to be carefully regulated so that the correct number and type of nerve cells are produced at the right time and place. But it remains unclear how the division rate of individual neural stem cells is controlled during development.</p><p>Controlling these divisions requires the activity of countless genes to be tightly regulated over space and time. When a gene is active, it is copied via a process called transcription into a single-stranded molecule known as messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). This molecule provides the instructions needed to build the protein encoded within the gene.</p><p>Proteins are the functional building blocks of all cells. The conventional way of controlling protein levels is to vary the number of mRNA molecules made by transcription. Now, Samuels et al. reveal a second mechanism of determining protein levels in the brain, through regulating the stability of mRNA after it is transcribed.</p><p>Samuels et al. discovered that a key regulatory protein called Imp controls the growth and division of individual neural stem cells in the brains of developing fruit flies. The experiments showed that Imp binds to mRNA molecules that contain the code for a protein called Myc, which is known to drive cell growth and division in many different cell types. Both human Imp and Myc have been implicated in cancer.</p><p>Using a technique that images single molecules of mRNA, Samuels et al. showed that the Imp protein in stem cells stabilises the mRNA molecule coding for Myc. This means that when more Imp is present, more Myc protein gets produced. Thus, the level of Imp in each individual neural stem cell fine-tunes the rate at which the cell grows and divides: the higher the level of Imp, the larger the stem cell and the faster it divides.</p><p>These findings underscore how important post-transcriptional processes are for regulating gene activity in the developing brain. The methods used in this study to study mRNA molecules in single cells also provide new insights that could not be derived from the average measurements of many cells. Similar methods could also be applied to other developmental systems in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>myc</kwd><kwd>single molecule fish</kwd><kwd>neuroblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105363/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samuels</surname><given-names>Tamsin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096144/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Järvelin</surname><given-names>Aino I</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Ilan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209412/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samuels</surname><given-names>Tamsin J</given-names></name><name><surname>Järvelin</surname><given-names>Aino I</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Ilan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ish-Horowicz</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecule mRNA imaging uncovers post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, via a cell-intrinsic mechanism allowing individualised control of neural stem cell proliferation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The many cells of the brain are produced through the highly regulated repeated divisions of a small number of neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs grow and divide rapidly in order to supply the cells of the developing brain, but must be restrained to prevent tumour formation. Individual NSCs produce characteristic lineages of progeny cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merkle et al., 2007</xref>), which vary in number suggesting differences in division and growth rates during development. However, the mechanisms differentially regulating the growth and division of individual NSCs are currently unknown.</p><p>Many of the processes and factors regulating neurogenesis are conserved between mammals and insects, making <italic>Drosophila</italic> an excellent model system to study NSC regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). During <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis, NSCs, also known as neuroblasts (NBs), divide asymmetrically, budding-off a small progeny cell, the ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides into neurons that progress through differentiation. During larval neurogenesis, the NB divides on average once every 80 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homem et al., 2013</xref>) and regrows between divisions to replace its lost volume, maintaining the proliferative potential of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). However, average measurements of growth and division mask considerable heterogeneity between the behaviour of individual NBs in the brain over developmental time. Individual NBs produce unique lineages of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pereanu and Hartenstein, 2006</xref>), with characteristically different clone sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Individual NBs also have differing division frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hailstone et al., 2019</xref>) and terminate division at different times (NB decommissioning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). This individual control ensures that the appropriate number of each neuron type is produced in the correct location during the construction of the brain. Systemic signals such as insulin and ecdysone signalling drive NB growth and division, with a particularly strong influence at the transitions between developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syed et al., 2017</xref>). However, the reproducible heterogeneity between individual NBs implies the existence of an unknown local or cell-intrinsic signal, acting in addition to the systemic signals to determine the proliferation of each NB.</p><p>The temporal regulation of NB proliferation and progeny fate has been well studied in the embryo and larva, and many key factors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>). The developmental progression of larval NBs is characterised by the levels of two conserved RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), IGF2 mRNA-binding protein (Imp/IGF2BP2) and Syncrip (Syp/hnRNPQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Imp and Syp negatively regulate each other and are expressed in opposing temporal gradients through larval brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>): Imp level in the NB declines through larval development while Syp level correspondingly increases. Imp and Syp play numerous key roles in larval neurogenesis. The levels of Imp and Syp are known to determine the different types of neuron produced by the NBs over time, through post-transcriptional regulation of the transcription factor (TF) <italic>chinmo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). The loss of Syp results in an enlarged central brain, in part due to an increase in NB proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hailstone et al., 2019</xref>). In pupal NBs, declining Imp expression allows NB shrinkage and Syp promotes NB termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). Temporal regulation of the Imp/Syp gradients depends on the upstream temporal patterning system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syed et al., 2017</xref>). The timing and rates of change of these RBP levels differ substantially between classes of NB, and to a lesser degree between NBs of the same class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). However, it is unknown if the intrinsic levels of Imp and Syp in each NB play a role in controlling the growth and division rates of individual NBs during their main proliferative window in the larva.</p><p>Imp and Syp are RBPs and can modify the protein complement of a cell via post-transcriptional modulation of mRNA localisation, stability and translation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boylan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geng and Macdonald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDermott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDermott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medioni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munro et al., 2006</xref>). Cell growth and proliferation are classically thought to be regulated at the level of transcription by pro-proliferative TFs. Various signalling pathways converge to promote cell growth and proliferation through transcriptional upregulation of the conserved TF and proto-oncogene, Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delanoue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levens, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>). Myc interacts with a binding partner, Max, to exert widespread transcriptional effects, binding upwards of 2000 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orian et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Myc is best known for its role in promoting cell growth through increased ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grewal et al., 2005</xref>), and also accelerates progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in the developing wing, though this does not affect overall cell cycle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>). It is unclear whether the transcriptional activation of pro-proliferative TFs, such as Myc and its downstream targets, is overlaid by post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms executed by RBPs, such as Imp and Syp, which could increase the precision and flexibility of the system.</p><p>Here, we examine the role of the Imp/Syp temporal gradient in regulating NB size and division during larval neurogenesis. We show that the upregulation of Imp increases NB division and size, while Syp influences these processes indirectly via its negative regulation of Imp. We use a genome-wide approach to determine the mRNA targets bound by Imp in the brain and identify <italic>myc</italic> mRNA among the top 15 targets of Imp. Single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridisation (smFISH) shows that <italic>myc</italic> mRNA is stabilised by Imp, leading to increased Myc protein levels, NB growth and proliferation. We compare NB types with different Imp levels and find that low Imp levels result in unstable <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, which restrains NB growth and division. Finally, at an earlier time point, when Imp expression is heterogeneous between individual NBs, we find that higher Imp correlates with increased <italic>myc</italic> mRNA half-life. We propose a model in which Imp post-transcriptionally regulates <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability to fine-tune individual NB size and division rate in their appropriate developmental context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imp promotes type I NB growth and division</title><p>To investigate the roles of the opposing Imp and Syp gradients in the NB, we used RNAi knockdown to manipulate the level of these RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We studied the type I NBs, the most numerous NB type in the brain, which are also very convenient to analyse, as they have a simple division hierarchy with each asymmetric division producing a GMC that divides only once more to produce two neurons or glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). In the wandering L3 stage (wL3) brains all type I NBs express high levels of Syp and low of Imp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We depleted Syp or Imp from the NBs with <italic>Syp</italic> knockdown and <italic>Imp</italic> knockdown RNAi constructs using the GAL4-UAS system, driven by <italic>insc-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betschinger et al., 2006</xref>). In NBs Imp and Syp negatively regulate each other and therefore the <italic>Syp</italic> knockdown results in Imp upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). We distinguished between direct effects of Syp depletion and indirect effects due to upregulated Imp expression by analysing <italic>Imp Syp</italic> double knockdown mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). We also examined Imp overexpression brains, but the UAS overexpression construct only produces a very limited upregulation of Imp in the type I NB at the wL3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). Therefore we primarily use the <italic>Syp</italic> knockdown to upregulate Imp.</p><p>We first examined the roles that Imp and Syp play in influencing type I NB size. Our results show that higher Imp promotes larger size of type I NBs at wL3, and Syp acts indirectly through its negative regulation of Imp. Imp-depleted NBs are almost half the size of <italic>wild type</italic> NBs and NBs that overexpress Imp are 1.4-fold larger in midpoint area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A’</xref>, Materials and methods). Syp-depleted NBs are 1.5-fold larger than <italic>wild type</italic>. We tested whether this effect is direct or indirect by studying the size of NBs in the <italic>Imp Syp</italic> double knockdown. Our results show that Imp depletion suppresses the increase in NB size observed in <italic>Syp</italic> knockdown mutants, which indicates that Syp only plays an indirect role in type I NB size, through its repression of Imp.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Elevated Imp levels increase NB proliferation and size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phalloidin was used to stain F-actin, marking the perimeter of each type I NB in the central brain (the largest cells, identified with Deadpan (Dpn) immunofluorescence (IF)).

In an effort to identify strong candidate targets, we identified the transcripts bound by Imp in the brain. To achieve this aim we performed Imp RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIPseq) in larval brain lysates (see Materials and methods). We identified 318 mRNA targets that were significantly enriched in the Imp pulldown compared to input brain RNAseq (using the thresholds DESeq2.padj &lt; 0.01 and DESeq2.log2FoldChange &gt; 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Another Imp target is <italic>chinmo</italic> (target rank: 55), which is known to be post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp to determine the progeny fate of NBs in the mushroom body (MB), the centre for memory and learning. Chinmo is also regulated by Imp in type II NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Syed et al., 2017</xref>) and during NB self renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2016</xref>).

However, how division rates are individually controlled through development is poorly understood. Here, we show that the temporally regulated RBPs Syp and Imp regulate NB division rate and size. Imp directly promotes NB growth and division through stabilising the mRNA of one of its key targets, <italic>myc</italic>, while Syp acts indirectly by negatively regulating Imp. By stabilising <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, Imp increases Myc protein expression and drives NB growth and proliferation. Imp levels decline to low levels in type I NBs by the final wandering larval stage and we find that this results in low <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability and low Myc protein levels. We show that Imp heterogeneity between NBs in earlier larval development (at 72 hr ALH), correlates with <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual NBs. Therefore, we suggest a model in which post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability by Imp provides a cell-intrinsic mechanism to fine-tune the growth and division rate of individual NBs, superimposed on the known extrinsic drivers of these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Imp stabilises <italic>myc</italic> mRNA to promote NB growth and division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Myc drives growth and proliferation in NBs.

We found that Myc overexpression increases both type I NB size and division rate, which is a very interesting result since Myc is best known to drive cell growth through activation of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grewal et al., 2005</xref>). Myc also promotes a shortened G1 phase in the wing disc, but this does not increase division rate as the G2 phase is proportionately lengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>). In the NB, the increased division rate we observe with Myc overexpression could be the result of a direct effect of Myc driving cell cycle progression, which would be mechanistically different from the cells of the wing disc. Alternatively, division rate may be increased indirectly as a result of the larger cell size. Further experiments will be required to uncover the precise mechanism of Myc action in the NB.</p><p>Our discovery of Imp-dependent modulation of Myc levels adds another dimension of regulation allowing cell-intrinsic modulation of NB growth and division tailored to individual NBs. It has been shown that Brat, an RBP, translationally represses Myc in type II NB progeny cells (intermediate neural progenitors) to prevent formation of ectopic NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betschinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). Together these findings emphasise the importance of the complex network of RBPs that play crucial post-transcriptional roles to control growth and division in individual NBs and their progeny in brain development.</p><p>Our work also suggests a new potential mechanism by which NB growth and division is restrained toward the end of the stem cell lifespan, in preparation for the terminal division in the pupa. The intrinsic regulation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability by Imp could explain why NBs are insensitive to the general growth signalling pathways at their late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). Homem et al., show that activation or inhibition of signalling through insulin-like peptides or their effector FOXO, has no effect on NB shrinkage or termination. Our results demonstrate that in the late larval NBs, there is insufficient Imp to stabilise <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, so that upregulation of <italic>myc</italic> transcription would still lead to low levels of Myc protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulated Imp levels control <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual NBs and NB types</title><p>MB NBs are the longest lived NBs in the larval brain and their growth and division only finally slows at about 72 hr after pupal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>), 24 hr after the termination of the other type I NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). It was previously shown that NB decommissioning is initiated through a metabolic response to ecdysone signalling, via Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). Elevated Imp level inhibits Mediator in the MB NBs to extend their lifespan by preventing NB shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al. (2017a)</xref>, found that inhibition of the Mediator complex only partially explained the lack of cell shrinkage in the long-lived MB NBs, suggesting that other targets of Imp also play a role in MB NBs. Imp stabilisation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA might additionally promote NB growth to contribute to extending the MB NB proliferative lifespan. In contrast, Imp levels decline faster in the other type I NBs, which would restrain their growth and division in preparation for their earlier decommissioning.</p><p>We also examined the role of Imp earlier in larval development, at 72 hr ALH when Imp levels are higher and heterogeneous between individual NBs. Type I NBs at 72 hr ALH have higher <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability and increased cell size compared to type I NBs at wL3. Our measurements of multiple variables in single cells allowed us to examine the function of Imp expression heterogeneity between individual NBs. We found that Imp levels correlate with <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual NBs at 72 hr ALH, providing a cell intrinsic mechanism to modulate NB growth and division. However, Imp levels do not correlate with NB size, unlike at the later wL3 stage. In the early larva, Imp and Myc levels are rapidly changing so a snapshot measurement of NB size may not be a suitable proxy for cell growth at each time point. Resolving this issue will require more sophisticated methods for long-term imaging of live whole brains that allow direct measurement of the growth and division rates of each NB at the same time as the Imp and Myc levels.</p><p>We have identified a mechanism of cell-intrinsic regulation of individual NB division and growth, which we suggest plays a key role in ensuring the correct number of progeny is produced in each lineage to build the correct sub-regions and circuits in the brain. This intrinsic regulatory mechanism must be integrated with extrinsic growth signals in the brain to determine the growth and division of each stem cell throughout development. Systemic insulin and ecdysone signalling are known to promote the timing of developmental switches in NBs, at the exit from quiescence after larval hatching and the decommissioning of the NB in the pupa. In the final stages of larval development, brain growth is also driven locally to protect it from nutrient restriction, in a process called brain sparing, by which Jelly-Belly expressed by the glial niche bypasses the insulin signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). It is plausible that this local extrinsic regulation might also be specific to individual NBs, for example through controlled expression level of Jelly-Belly in each glial niche. Future experiments will determine the interplay between the intrinsic regulation of <italic>myc</italic> stability by Imp that we have shown here, and other extrinsic systemic and local regulators of NB growth and division.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Declining Imp may restrain proliferation in diverse stem cell populations and systems</title><p><italic>c-myc,</italic> the mammalian homologue of <italic>Drosophila myc</italic>, is best known for its role in cancers, and so its regulation has been studied extensively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conacci-Sorrell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farrell and Sears, 2014</xref>).

The mammalian homologue of Imp, IGF2BP1, binds to <italic>c-myc</italic> mRNA and regulates its stability. However, IGF2BP binds to <italic>c-myc</italic> mRNA in the coding sequence, whereas Imp binds to <italic>myc</italic> UTRs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

We have discovered an important new regulatory mechanism, that Imp acts through <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability to modulate cell growth and division appropriately in each stem cell and each stage of development. During development, lengthening of the G1 phase to extend the cell cycle length of NSCs is correlated with a switch from expansion to differentiation in the mouse ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahashi et al., 1995</xref>). It has been proposed that Myc is a critical link between cell cycle length and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Dalton, 2009</xref>). In parallel, Imp expression levels have been shown to occur in declining temporal gradients in diverse stem cells including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toledano et al., 2012</xref>) and, in vertebrates, mouse foetal NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>). These diverse studies support our proposal of a new general principal that Imp temporal gradients limit stem cell proliferative potential towards the end of their developmental lifespan, by reducing <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability and leading to low Myc protein level. Future experiments in a wide range of other organs and systems will now be required to test our model, and to examine the extent of Imp expression heterogeneity in other stem cell systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Syncrip (Syp)</td><td/><td>FBgn0038826</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp)</td><td/><td>FBgn0285926</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Myc</td><td/><td>FBgn0262656</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Mnt</td><td/><td>FBgn0023215</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>wild type</italic> <break/>OregonR</td><td>Bloomington</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Syp</italic> RNAi</td><td>VDRC</td><td>VDRC 33011</td><td><italic>;P(GD9477)v33011</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Imp</italic> RNAi line</td><td>Bloomington</td><td>BL 34977</td><td><italic>y(1) sc[*] v(1)</italic>; <italic>P{y[+t7.7] v[+t1.8]=TRiP.HMS01168}attP2</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Imp OE line <break/>UAS-Imp-RM-FLAG</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Myc OE line</td><td>FLY-ORF collection</td><td>F001801</td><td><italic>M{UAS-Myc.ORF.3xHA.GW}</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Myc</italic> RNAi</td><td>Bloomington</td><td>BL 54154</td><td><italic>y(1) v(1); P{y[+t7.7] v[+t1.8]=TRiP.HMC03189}attP40</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Imp::GFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toledano et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td><italic>Imp[CB04573]</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>insc-GAL4</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betschinger et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td>α-Syncrip (guinea pig, <break/>polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDermott et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td>1:2000 WB,1:500 IF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td>α-GFP (rat, monoclonal)</td><td>Chromotek</td><td>3H9 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10773374">AB_10773374</ext-link></td><td>1:1000 WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td>α-αTubulin (mouse, monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td/><td>1:500 WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td>α-Imp (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Gift from P.

For each replicate the number of brains analysed ranged from 1 to 5 depending on availability of larvae. These are biological replicates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G–H</xref>, the individual replicates are shown on all plots as individual points.

We used phalloidin staining to mark the NB cell boundary and the area at the widest z plane was manually measured using ImageJ. NBs undergoing mitosis were excluded. They were identified using Dpn staining, which is weak throughout the cell when the nuclear envelope has broken down during mitosis.

The phalloidin staining was used to create a mask with the FIJI plugin MorphoLibJ, using the morphological segmentation feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Legland et al., 2016</xref>). NBs undergoing mitosis (condensed chromatin in the DAPI channel) were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-1-5"><title>smFISH</title><p>After segmentation as above, transcripts outside the NB boundary were removed. FishQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>) was used in batch mode to count spots and calculate nascent transcripts using the integrated intensity calculation. In brief, an outline was produced for each NB, identifying the transcription focus (note that as <italic>myc</italic> is on the X chromosome, only male larvae were dissected so there was one transcription focus per NB). Transcription foci were easily identified as the largest spot in the nucleus, with relatively more signal from the more 5’ exon probe compared to the 3’ UTR probe. A single NB was analysed to set up the detection settings which were then applied in the batch mode of all NBs from each technical replicate. The filters were modified manually to optimise transcript detection, and then an average transcript was calculated from the entire batch and used to calculate the nascent transcript number.</p><p>We applied the method established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar Halpern and Itzkovitz (2016)</xref> to convert transcript counts to rates of transcription and mRNA decay. Simply, the nascent transcript number can be used to estimate the transcription rate in each cell, accounting for the position of the probe along the transcript, and an estimated rate of transcriptional elongation. The rate of elongation (v) was estimated at 1.5 kb per minute, based on a variety of methods in different <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, which gave measurements from 1.1 to 1.5 kb/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</xref>). A probe library weighting factor was calculated using the TransQuant software to account for the position of the probe set along the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar Halpern and Itzkovitz, 2016</xref>). For <italic>myc long</italic> smFISH probes, this factor was 0.15264. Assuming a steady state, where transcription equals mRNA degradation, the estimated transcription rate can then be used to calculate an estimate of mRNA half-life in each cell.</p><p>Transcription and decay rates were calculated using the equations below. Decay rates were then converted to half-lives.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Transcription rate (mRNA/hr) = ((nascent transcript number/weighting factor) x elongation rate)/gene length</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decay rate (per hour) = (chromosome fraction x transcription rate x number of chromosome copies)/transcripts in the cell</p></list-item><list-item><p>Half-life (mins) = (ln2/decay rate) x 60</p></list-item></list><p>The calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar Halpern and Itzkovitz, 2016</xref>) helps to unpick the differences in regulation of transcription or mRNA decay between different genotypes or cell types. However, the assumptions required for the method should be carefully considered in the interpretation of the results. The transcription rate calculation assumes a constant estimated transcription elongation rate without pauses or pulsing. The equations are based on a steady state but, while we excluded NBs undergoing mitosis, a dividing cell like the NB is unlikely to reach a true steady state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-1-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software).

This work demonstrates that one of the targets of Imp is the gene Myc, which thus explains why Imp needs to be down-regulated at the end of neuroblast lives in order to terminate them. Therefore, the temporal and spatial regulation of Myc controlled by Imp determines neuroblast growth and rate of division. The authors’ utilization of sophisticated mRNA detection allowed them to quantify mRNA in neuroblasts, and to understand how temporal patterning of neuroblasts regulates their proliferation. This will provide further support for the critical role of Imp (and Syp) in neuroblast division and the identification of further targets will likely also allow the authors to understand how these genes contribute to neural diversity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Imp/IGF2BP levels modulate individual neural stem cell growth and division through <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is an excellent manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS is built upon generation of thousands of neurons and glia by a small population of asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells, called neuroblasts (NBs). The division properties of NBs have to be tightly spatio-temporally controlled to ensure that they each generate the correct repertoire and number of progeny. It is known that extrinsic and intrinsic cues are operating to control NB divisions, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent work has shown that the mRNA binding protein Imp is a key promoter of NB division during development, and that is needs to be silenced by temporal patterning during larval stages to ensure the timely termination of NB divisions during metamorphosis. However, Imp is known to regulate a large number of mRNAs but its mode of action in NBs is not clear. In this manuscript, Samuels and colleagues investigate in more details the role of Imp in NBs during larval stages and perform RIP-seq to identify mRNA targets. One of their top candidates is Myc. Using antibody and smFISH, they demonstrate that Imp promotes Myc expression via the stabilization of an mRNA isoform with a long 3'UTR. They show that NBs with high levels of Imp correlate with high levels of Myc, larger size and faster divisions. On the ground of other genetic experiments, they conclude that the temporal and spatial regulation of Myc via Imp determines NB growth and division rate during development.</p><p>The manuscript is convincing, with beautiful in situs allowing mRNA quantifications in NBs, and the conclusions are well supported by the experimental data. This study provides an additional layer of understanding of how NB intrinsic temporal patterning regulates NB proliferative properties during development. However, I am less convinced about the conceptual advances that it is bringing.</p><p>Indeed, in mammals, Myc is a well-known target of Imp/IGF2BP proteins (Noubissi et al., 2006; Noubissi et al., 2010; Doyle et al., 1998 etc) and the molecular mechanisms by which Imp/IGF2BP proteins promote Myc mRNA stabilization have been investigated in great details (Lemm and Ross, 2002; Weidensdorfer et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2018 etc).</p><p>Moreover, Imp/IGF2BP genes are known to be expressed in early cortical progenitors in mice where they promote their proliferation during embryonic development (Nishino et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015), regulating temporal changes in stem cell properties, as it does in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs (Yang et al., 2017). And obviously Myc is famous for promoting cell growth and proliferation. Although the link between Imp/IGF2BPs and Myc had not been described in neural progenitors to my knowledge, this was kind of expected given the known regulatory interactions between these two genes in other tissues and cancers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors address by which molecular mechanism Imp and Syp regulate neuroblast growth and division restraining it or promoting it in different temporal windows. With this goal, the authors show that Imp/Syp levels are important regulators of neuroblast area and division rate. To understand how Imp regulates neuroblast size/division the authors perform RIPseq of Imp::GFP and find Myc RNA as a binding target of Imp in the brain. The authors also show that in the brain Imp binds myc longer isoform 3' UTR. The authors then want to analyze how Imp affects the stability of Myc mRNA. The authors show that at an earlier larval stage when Imp is more highly expressed, myc's half-life is increased, showing that during larval development there is a correlation between Imp levels and Myc half-life. Consistently they also show that in early larval stages/Imp-high neuroblasts are bigger than in wl3. Summing up the authors find evidence for a model where Imp binds and stabilizes Myc mRNA stabilizing it. Since Imp is temporally expressed, being high in earlier larval stages and low/absent in later larval stages, this could explain how this temporal gene regulates neuroblast size in different stages.</p><p>This work and final model are very interesting, however, there are several caveats in this work that need to be addressed. These caveats are mainly due to the inconsistencies of the genotypes used to increase or lower Imp levels. Although the authors have tools to directly increase Imp (UAS-Imp) or decrease Imp (Imp-RNAi) they mainly choose to analyse Syp-RNAi and <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi_<italic>Syp</italic> RNAi. Since, as the authors show and partially discuss, Syp seems to have additional functions other than repressing Imp, and therefore not all the conclusions drawn from these experiments can be taken. Bellow I point out figures/text sections where this occurs. Also, there are some characterizations missing regarding Imp and Myc levels in early vs. late larval stages. These are important and will greatly improve the work, since this will show that levels of Imp/Myc are indeed normally changing in different temporal windows and are therefore relevant in the wild-type developing brain.</p><p>Additionally, the authors make several claims, including in the Title of the manuscript that they found how growth and division of individual neuroblasts is regulated, however they in fact study how <italic>imp/syp</italic> regulate growth of type 1 neuroblasts as a group and make some comparisons to another group of neuroblasts, the mushroom body neuroblasts. The experiments showing Imp levels in individual neuroblasts, are well documented and very interesting, but they are not followed up, and in their current state they show no causality between individual levels of Imp and any phenotype. Therefore, all these &quot;individual nbs&quot; mechanistic claims should be removed, specially from the Title and Abstract.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1:</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1B – Upregulation of Imp in <italic>Syp</italic> RNAi not clear from image, also it is not quantified.

This is important for two reasons: (a) Imp is reported to be almost gone at 72hour larvae in type 1 neuroblasts and to be completely gone by W3IL (van den Ameele and Brand, 2019); (b) so that we can later assess if Myc levels at these two stages are indeed correlated with Imp levels. Without this comparison it is not possible to classify Imp and Myc levels as high or low.</p><p>Figure 3 and Figure 4</p><p>For the section where the authors explore the relationship of Imp/Myc, the authors do not always directly change Imp levels. In Figure 3 &quot;Imp regulates Myc protein expression…&quot; the authors never manipulate Imp directly (ImpOE or <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi), mainly showing how Myc is affected after changing the levels of Syp (<italic>Syp</italic> RNAi as a proxy for Imp overexpression). There are several issues with this approach, since, as discussed by the authors (Figure 4), <italic>Syp</italic> RNAi may cause other effects than on Imp. It would therefore be important to include in figures/results how directly changing Imp levels affects Myc.</p><p>Figure 3 – Show how Imp overexpression affects <italic>myc</italic> protein levels (e.g. as in graph in Figure 1A' where authors show that ImpOE causes an increase in nb area).</p><p>Figure 3 – Based on the results of Figure 4, where <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi_<italic>Syp</italic> RNAi does not cause a reduction in Myc Half-life and mature mRNA (i.e. <italic>myc</italic> long isoform stability) as is the case for <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi, but instead possibly causes a decrease in transcription, it would be useful to see <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi and ImpOE effect on <italic>myc</italic> protein levels.</p><p>Figure 4 – The effect of <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi_<italic>Syp</italic> RNAi on <italic>myc</italic>/transcription is not consistent with this double RNAi being the same as knocking down Imp.

The authors conclusion that the result of this double KD shows &quot;that Imp rather than Syp is the primary regulator of the number of <italic>myc<sup>long</sup></italic>...&quot; is therefore not supported by the data and needs to be toned down. For this reason, it would also be useful to have ImpOE.

The authors need to reformulate their conclusion and discuss these inconsistencies.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>In Figure 5F authors show Imp levels and <italic>myc</italic> half-life. The authors claim in several sections, including in Title and Abstract, that &quot;Imp/IGF2BP levels modulate individual neural stem cell growth…&quot; however the authors do not show this in individual type 1 nbs or show any causality or even correlation. Just by looking at 5F there seems to be no correlation between Imp levels and nb area. Comparison between type 1 central brain and MB is interesting, but these are different cell types, and as shown previously, regulated differently. Therefore these 2 cell types combined cannot be used to conclude what the authors claim. The authors need to: (a) remove individual cell claims, (b) perform a correlation analysis of myc half-life/IMP levels/nb size in only type 1 nbs, the focus of this work.</p><p>Figure 5H -Even when type 1 NBs are overexpressing Myc (Figure 3E) they do not reach the average number of progeny labeled as for MB (mycOE type1~4 progeny cells labeled in 4 hours; MB NBs ~6 progeny cells labeled in 4 hours). Therefore, it does not seem that Myc levels are the main cause of this difference. The authors need to rephrase their conclusions when comparing type1 and MB neuroblasts, since these two nb types seem to have many other differences.</p><p>Include in figure legend (check all legends) what is the exact stage analysed.</p><p>Figure 6</p><p>In Figure 6 the authors try to address how the differential expression of Imp/Syp throughout time affect myc levels and neuroblasts.

However, the authors do not show protein levels of Myc (Myc staining) in these 2 stages, this should be included.</p><p>The authors should also knock down Imp in 72hour ALH, the stage where Imp is high, and therefore normally playing a role, and see how this affects Myc protein levels.</p><p>Figure 6F – show NB size too in this graph – to see if indeed there is correlation between myc/imp and cell size at the individual nb level.</p><p>Figure 7 – The insulin signaling or brain sparing is not connected with the process that the authors are studying, i.e. normal temporal regulation of neuroblasts.

There is one experiment (5F) that characterizes myc half-life, Imp levels and NB area in single neuroblasts, but this experiment does not show if there is correlation among type 1 nbs nor does it show if a difference in levels among type 1 nbs is causal of differences in neuroblast size. For these reasons the Title does not fit with what is really shown in the manuscript, which is how mechanistically Imp levels modulate neuroblast (type 1) growth and division through myc mRNA stability. This needs to be changed.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The Abstract should also be adjusted to not highlight differences between individual neuroblasts.

Below is the extensive list in the three reviews. However, and as it the policy of eLife, we would like you to be able to resubmit within a two month period and therefore we have listed below the experiments that we deem essential to improve the paper that could be made in the required time frame. After discussing with the other reviewers, reviewer #3 took the time to list all required experiments and this was approved by the other reviewers. As for the remaining comments, they only require text modifications/discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for distilling the essential points we need to address and agree that these changes have improved the paper considerably. In our revision we have focused on addressing the distilled points, but we have also attempted to address all the other comments, as in our view they also improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments:</p><p>- Stain for myc (myc Ab) in WT at 72hour and wandering larval brains.</p></disp-quote><p>While we show Myc antibody staining in wandering larval brains in Figure 3A, we have been unable to reproducibly stain 72 hour larval brains with the Myc antibody. We have tried hard to carry out this experiment, both before and after receiving these review comments, by testing different fixing protocols (including methanol fixing and 1% or 4% formaldehyde) as well as different Myc antibody concentrations and pre-clearing the antibody. While some of our stainings indicate that Myc protein is quite highly expressed in 72 hour type I NBs, we are not comfortable to publish these data because the stainings are not reproducible and so can not be validly quantitated. Nevertheless, we do show in Figure 6 that NBs are larger at 72 hour compared to wL3 and that <italic>myc</italic> mRNA half-life is increased. Although we agree that the Myc staining would have been a nice addition, we do not think that it is essential to our argument that higher Imp at 72 hour results in increased <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability, which we measure directly. We have added a short statement to the Materials and methods section saying that the Myc antibody does not work in our hands in 72 hour larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- UAS-Imp and UAS-Imp RNAi x type 1 Nb Gal4 at wandering stage: Stain for Myc and quantify Myc levels (Myc Ab).</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very useful suggestion, thank you. The results have also helped us to address some of the additional specific comments raised by the reviewers. We have added measurements of Myc protein levels in the UAS-Imp and <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi lines to Figure 3C. The results show a small increase in Myc protein when Imp is overexpressed (OE). This effect is expected, as only a small Imp OE can be achieved with this construct (Figure 1 – —figure supplement 1D), as previously observed by Tzumin Lee’s lab (Liu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017). In the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi, we observe only a small, reduction in Myc protein. This result is also expected because Imp levels are already very low in the <italic>wild type</italic> at wL3. These findings support our interpretation that Imp stabilises <italic>myc</italic> mRNA to determine Myc protein levels in the type I NBs, which in turn determine their rate of division and growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- UAS-Imp RNAi x type 1 Nb Gal4 at 72hour stage: Stain for Myc.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed above, we have been unable to get reproducible specific Myc antibody staining at 72 hour ALH. However, we have knocked down Imp in type I NBs at 72 hour and instead measured NB size, showing that NBs are much smaller in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi, compared to the <italic>wild type</italic> at this stage (Figure 6F). Note that at the 72 hour Imp levels are high (compared with the very low third instar Imp levels described above, Figure 6A), explaining why the <italic>Imp</italic> RNA has large effect at the earlier stage. Again, these findings agree with our interpretation, namely that Imp promotes increased NB growth through stabilising <italic>myc</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4 – smFISH against Myc in UAS-Imp x nb Gal4 – This might take quite some time, but it would clarify the inconsistencies between the different genotypes. However, you might be able to argue your case if you feel that it is not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, overexpression of Imp from a UAS construct results in minimal upregulation of Imp protein in the NB, and we now show that using the Imp OE construct we only see a small increase in Myc protein (Figure 3C). In response to the above comment, we have stained UAS-Imp brains with smFISH against <italic>myc</italic> mRNA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), but we do not observe a substantial upregulation of <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, especially compared to the increase seen with <italic>Syp</italic> RNAi. We think that quantitations of <italic>myc</italic> half-life and transcription rate in the Imp OE genotype will be much less useful than our studies using the <italic>Syp</italic> knockdown, which produces a very large upregulation of Imp protein in the NB and a corresponding large upregulation of Myc protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data analysis:</p><p>- Correlation analysis of smFISH of type 1 NBs done separately from MB NBs. The same correlation analysis could be done for MBs.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on reviewer 3’s comment below, we think this comment is referring to Figure 5F in which we plot <italic>myc</italic> mRNA half-life verses Imp levels and NB size for all the NBs. These data are also plotted in bulk in Figure 5B-E, but we show the individual NBs in a single graph in 5F to illustrate more clearly the differences between NB types. Identifying the different cell types to clearly separate the type I NBs and MB NBs is a very good suggestion. We have addressed this by adjusting the graph in Figure 5F to mark the type I NBs with a diamond and MB NBs with a circle, in order to clearly emphasise the differences between the NB types.</p><p>The reviewer also asks us to show do separate correlation analysis in each of the two different classes of NBs. However, we think that doing so would not be very informative for type I NBs because the at wL3, Imp levels in <italic>wild type</italic> type I NBs are very low (at the detection threshold). Therefore, we don’t think it is informative to look for correlations between Imp level (always very low) and <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in type I NBs at the wL3 stage. However, we did correlation analysis for MB NBs at wL3 using the data shown in Figure 5F, which is potentially useful as the MB NBs express higher Imp levels and there is variability between individual MB NBs. Although we have only very limited cell numbers for this type of analysis, we find that Imp level significantly correlates with <italic>myc</italic> transcript number (r = 0.48, p = 0.015). There is also a positive correlation between Imp level and <italic>myc</italic> mRNA half-life but this is not statistically significant (r = 0.29, p = 0.18). We have not gathered additional data for more individual MB NBs in this experiment in order to add it to the paper, as it would be very time consuming and we don’t think it is essential for the conclusions of the paper, which primarily focuses on type I NBs. In any case, we do already show in the paper the correlation analysis for type I NBs at stage 72 hour (Figure 6G, Figure 6—figure supplement 1), when there is much larger variation in Imp levels between individual type I NBs. We feel the data showing correlations in Figure 6 is strong and is sufficient for us to make our conclusions on individual NBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6F – show NB size in this graph to see whether there is correlation between myc/imp and cell size at the individual NB level. You might have the data already.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: we do have all the data they are asking for, which is displayed in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 including all the correlation values and significance. We have measured 5 distinct variables, so we feel that it is better to represent them in a table showing a correlation matrix than to show plots of all the possible combinations. The reason we chose to show the one graph we did is that the correlation between Imp protein levels and <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual NBs is the key subject of this paper. Regarding the requested specific correlations between NB size and Imp/<italic>myc</italic>, we show in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, that <italic>myc</italic> transcript number does correlate with NB size, but Imp level does not correlate with NB size. We highlight this result in the corresponding Results section, and also discuss the reasons in the Discussion section. Cell size may be a poor proxy for cell growth at the early larval stage of 72hour ALH, when NB sizes are rapidly changing and we suggest in the Discussion section that long-term live imaging with Imp measurement could provide a better quantitation of cell growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- measure Myc levels and NB size from the Imp RNAi experiment:</p><p>UASImp RNAi x type 1 nbGal4 in 72hour ALH.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the above comment, we have measured NB size in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi at 72 hour ALH, and found that NBs are much smaller in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi, compared to the <italic>wild type</italic> at this stage (Figure 6F). This is a useful addition to the paper as it confirms that Imp drives NB growth at the earlier 72 hour stage, as well as at wL3 (Figure 1A, A’). As explained above, we were unable to produce Myc antibody staining at 72 hour ALH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The manuscript is convincing, with beautiful in situs allowing mRNA quantifications in NBs, and the conclusions are well supported by the experimental data.

And obviously Myc is famous for promoting cell growth and proliferation. Although the link between Imp/IGF2BPs and Myc had not been described in neural progenitors to my knowledge, this was kind of expected given the known regulatory interactions between these two genes in other tissues and cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that in mammals the relationship between Myc and Imp has been previously studied, our imaging approach provides a major conceptual advance. We measure <italic>myc</italic> regulation in single cells within the developing brain to uncover how Imp regulates Myc to regulate individual neural stem cell size and division rate.

However, at the end of the paper we measure Imp level, <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability and NB size in individual type I NBs at 72 hour ALH (Figure 6G and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). At this stage there is heterogeneous Imp expression between individual type I NBs and so this is the ideal system to test the effect of different Imp levels in individual NBs. We find a significant positive correlation between Imp levels and <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual type I NBs at 72 hour ALH.

However, we are measuring changes in only the NB where, as the reviewer observes, Imp is upregulated in the cytoplasm.

Nevertheless, we measured Myc protein expression in the Imp overexpression construct as suggested by the reviewer below, and we found a small increase in Myc protein levels in the NB.

We find a small increase in Myc protein in the UAS-Imp NBs, which corresponds to the minimal upregulation of Imp in the Imp overexpression constructs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). We also find a small decrease in Myc protein in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi NBs, which is again expected because Imp levels are already very low in <italic>wild type</italic> type I NBs at wL3, and therefore <italic>Imp</italic> knockdown would not have a large additional effect. These results support our model that Imp upregulates Myc protein, but the changes are small due to the small changes in Imp level with the OE and RNAi constructs at the wL3 stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 – The effect of Imp RNAi, Syp RNAi on myc/transcription is not consistent with this double RNAi being the same as knocking down Imp. It suggests that Syp RNAi has an effect independent of Imp. The authors’ conclusion that the result of this double KD shows &quot;that Imp rather than Syp is the primary regulator of the number of myc<sup>long</sup>.&quot; is therefore not supported by the data and needs to be toned down. For this reason, it would also be useful to have ImpOE. Add stage these analyses were done to the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed more extensively above, Imp overexpression with the UAS Imp construct only has a small effect on Imp protein level, compared to the much greater upregulation with the <italic>Syp</italic> RNAi. To address this comment, we have added <italic>myc</italic> smFISH in the Imp OE to Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, but we don’t think it is useful to do extensive quantitations with the Imp OE. We have also added details of the developmental stage to each figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4H – &quot;we find that Imp's main direct role is to promote myc<sup>long</sup> mRNA stability and this results in upregulation of Myc protein, which promotes NB growth and division&quot; however myc half-life is not reduced in Imp RNAi, nor in Imp RNAi_Syp RNAi, but NB size and division rate is reduced in both genotypes (Figure 1A'B'). The authors need to reformulate their conclusion and discuss these inconsistencies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is asking why we see a phenotype in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi, but no significant change in <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability compared to <italic>wild type</italic>. At the wL3 stage, Imp is very low in the <italic>wild type</italic> type I NBs, and therefore knocking down Imp would not be expected to have a very large effect. In the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi we observe a small but significant decrease in Myc protein (added to Figure 3C) as well as a small but not significant reduction in <italic>myc</italic> mRNA half-life to 0.6-fold of <italic>wild type myc</italic> half-life. This small reduction in Myc expression in the <italic>Imp</italic> RNAi NBs may be sufficient to explain the phenotype of smaller, slower dividing NBs. There may also be an additional effect of Imp-depletion throughout larval development i.e. reduced Imp level leading to less NB growth in early larval stages might be expected to result in smaller NBs at wL3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>In Figure 5F authors show Imp levels and myc half-life. The authors claim in several sections, including in Title and Abstract, that &quot;Imp/IGF2BP levels modulate individual neural stem cell growth…&quot; however the authors do not show this in individual type 1 nbs or show any causality or even correlation. Just by looking at 5F there seems to be no correlation between Imp levels and nb area. Comparison between type 1 central brain and MB is interesting, but these are different cell types, and as shown previously, regulated differently. Therefore these 2 cell types combined cannot be used to conclude what the authors claim. The authors need to (a) remove individual cell claims, (b) perform a correlation analysis of myc half-life/IMP levels/nb size in only type 1 nbs, the focus of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that in Figure 5 we do not carry out correlation analysis between individual type I NBs and mushroom body NBs at wL3. This point is addressed more fully above, but briefly, we do not think it would be useful to do correlation analysis on type I NBs at wL3 because Imp level is very low in all type I NBs at this stage. Instead, our conclusions on individual NBs are drawn from Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement, using measurements of individual type I NBs at 72 hour ALH. At 72 hour ALH, there is heterogeneous Imp expression, which allows us to examine the effect on different levels of Imp on <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability and NB behaviour.</p><p>We use Figure 5 to draw conclusions between the differences between type I NBs (low Imp) and mushroom body NBs (high Imp). To highlight this difference, we have adjusted the graph in Figure 5F to distinguish the NB types (type I NB with a diamond, MB NB with a circle) in order to clearly emphasise the differences between the NB types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5H -Even when type 1 NBs are overexpressing Myc (Figure 3E) they do not reach the average number of progeny labeled as for MB (mycOE type1~4 progeny cells labeled in 4 hours; MB NBs ~6 progeny cells labeled in 4 hours). Therefore, it does not seem that Myc levels are the main cause of this difference. The authors need to rephrase their conclusions when comparing type1 and MB neuroblasts, since these two nb types seem to have many other differences.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation, but we aren’t confident that our Myc OE is directly equivalent to the high Myc levels in MB NBs. Furthermore, the changing levels of Myc throughout larval development may have some continued effect at the wL3 stage. Nevertheless, to address this comment we have added to our discussion other differences between MB NBs and type I NBs in subsection “Regulated Imp levels control <italic>myc</italic> mRNA 447 stability in individual NBs and NB types&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Include in figure legend (check all legends) what is the exact stage analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6</p><p>In Figure 6 the authors try to address how the differential expression of Imp/Syp throughout time affect myc levels and neuroblasts. They find that at 72hour ALH, Imp::GFP levels are high in nbs and in differentiated cells, but at wandering L3 Imp::GFP levels are much reduced, and that this reduction correlates with a decrease in neuroblast area and myc half-life. However, the authors do not show protein levels of Myc (Myc staining) in these 2 stages, this should be included.</p><p>The authors should also knock down Imp in 72hour ALH, the stage where Imp is high, and therefore normally playing a role, and see how this affects Myc protein levels.</p></disp-quote><p>These suggestions are addressed thoroughly above, briefly we have tested different fixing protocols (methanol fixing and 1% or 4% formaldehyde) as well as different Myc antibody concentrations, but are unable to satisfactorily optimise the Myc antibody staining at 72 hour ALH to perform these experiments. Although this would be a useful addition, we don’t think the Myc antibody staining is essential to support our conclusion that Imp stabilises <italic>myc</italic> mRNA, which we measure directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6F – show NB size too in this graph – to see if indeed there is correlation between myc/imp and cell size at the individual nb level.</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion is discussed fully in the main response. Briefly, the correlation matrix for all five variables is found in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We have chosen not to add NB size into the Figure 6F (now Figure 6G) graph as we want to focus on the main conclusion that Imp stabilises <italic>myc</italic> mRNA in individual NBs. Referring to the specific correlation requested, we find that <italic>myc</italic> transcript number does correlate with NB size, but Imp level does not correlate with NB size. We highlight this fact in the corresponding Results section, and also discuss the reasons in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 – The insulin signaling or brain sparing is not connected with the process that the authors are studying, i.e. normal temporal regulation of neuroblasts. Remove from this figure as it is confusing. The &quot;individual intrinsic control&quot; is also not clear or supported by the data, remove.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, we have added a question mark to the systemic extrinsic signals in Figure 7A and added to the text of the figure legend, to clarify that although this is a plausible model, it has not been directly addressed in the type I NBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title</p><p>The authors are interested in understanding how Imp levels modulates individual neural stem cell growth, however the authors study in general type 1 neuroblasts and do not perform experiments to study how the growth of individual neuroblasts is regulated by Imp. There is one experiment (5F) that characterizes myc half-life, Imp levels and NB area in single neuroblasts, but this experiment does not show if there is correlation among type 1 nbs nor does it show if a difference in levels among type 1 nbs is causal of differences in neuroblast size. For these reasons the Title does not fit with what is really shown in the manuscript, which is how mechanistically Imp levels modulate neuroblast (type 1) growth and division through myc mRNA stability. This needs to be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not quite correct, we show experiments in both Figure 5 and Figure 6 measuring <italic>myc</italic> half-life, Imp levels and NB area in individual NBs. We make our conclusions on the role of differing levels of Imp in individual NBs from the data shown in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. At 72 hour ALH we observed heterogenous Imp expression in type I NBs, and we use this system to show that Imp level is positively correlated with <italic>myc</italic> mRNA stability in individual NBs. In Figure 5F, we make individual NB measurements but do not use these for correlation analysis because the levels of Imp in the type I NBs are always very low in each cell at wL3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
