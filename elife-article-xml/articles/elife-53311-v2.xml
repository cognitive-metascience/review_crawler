proteins form nonselective cation channels that play physiological roles in a wide variety of cells. Despite growing evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of TRPC6 inhibition in treating pathological cardiac and renal conditions, mechanistic understanding of TRPC6 function and modulation remains obscure. Here we report cryo-EM structures of TRPC6 in both antagonist-bound and agonist-bound states. The structures reveal two novel recognition sites for the small-molecule modulators corroborated by mutagenesis data. The antagonist binds to a cytoplasm-facing pocket formed by S1-S4 and the TRP helix, whereas the agonist wedges at the subunit interface between S6 and the pore helix. Conformational changes upon ligand binding illuminate a mechanistic rationale for understanding TRPC6 modulation. Furthermore, structural and mutagenesis analyses suggest several disease-related mutations enhance channel activity by disrupting interfacial interactions. Our results provide principles of drug action that may facilitate future design of small molecules to ameliorate TRPC6-mediated diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel drug-binding sites of TRPC6 could potentially facilitate future design of drugs to treat TRPC6-mediated diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian TRPC subfamily consists of seven transmembrane proteins (TRPC1-7) that have been proposed to form non-selective cation channels in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>).

However, development of potent and selective small-molecule antagonists of TRPC6 is hampered by limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of TRPC6 modulation. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of several TRPC channels elucidate their tetrameric assembly comprising a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azumaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sierra-Valdez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>).

Furthermore, since there is no TRPC structure with a known agonist, it is still elusive how TRPC channels are activated by DAG or other agonists.</p><p>In this study, we present two high-resolution cryo-EM structures of antagonist- and agonist-bound human TRPC6 in lipidic nanodiscs. Our structures identify two novel modulation sites in the transmembrane domain and reveal the binding modes of the small molecule antagonist and agonist, which were corroborated by functional data. Conformational changes between these two structures allow us to gain further insights into the mechanism of TRPC6 function and modulation. Overall, these findings provide a rational basis for small molecule drug design for the treatment of TRPC6-mediated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of N-terminally truncated TRPC6</title><p>An N-terminally truncated (Δ2–72) human TRPC6 was engineered because residues corresponding to 2–72 of TRPC6 are missing in TRPC3 despite high overall sequence similarity between TRPC3 and TRPC6. TRPC6 (Δ2–72) showed enhanced biochemical stability and could be activated by oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a soluble analog of the native lipid agonist DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

AM-1473, a small molecule antagonist with an IC50 of 0.22 ± 0.05 nM (n = 14) in our TRPC6 bioassay, is a structural analog of previously disclosed small molecule antagonist SAR-7334 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maier et al., 2015</xref>). AM-0883, a novel TRPC6 agonist with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 45.5 ± 10 nM (n = 19) was identified from a small molecule in vitro high throughput screening campaign at Amgen.

Based on the shape and chemical environment, it is very likely that the density within the pocket of S1-S4 observed in the final postprocessed map and two corresponding half-maps belongs to the antagonist AM-1473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f–h</xref>), which consists of an aminopiperidine, a benzonitrile, and an indane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, this pocket was empty in the structure of TRPC6 bound to another small molecule antagonist BTDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>) or the TRPC3 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), further supporting our assignment of the density to the antagonist. The antagonist engages in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with residues from S1-S4, the TRP helix and the membrane-reentrant loop following the TRP helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The primary amine moiety off the piperidine ring forms hydrogen-bond interactions with Glu509 on S2, and Asp530 on S3. The benzonitrile group is involved in a cation-π interaction with Arg758 on the reentrant loop as well as aromatic-stacking interactions with His446 on S1 and Tyr753 on the TRP helix. The indene double ring makes van der Waal contacts with Tyr612 on S4. Overall, the three ring groups in the antagonist knit the intracellular ends of S1-S4, the TRP helix and the reentrant loop together. Interestingly, the antagonist is 36-fold selective for TRPC6 over its closely-related homolog TRPC3 (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.0 ± 2.2 nM, n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Among the residues that interact with the antagonist, most are identical between TRPC3 and TRPC6, but Arg758 on TRPC6 is replaced by a lysine on TRPC3. We tested whether exchange this residue between TRPC6 and TRPC3 would have any effect on the antagonist potency and found that the antagonist is 5-fold less potent in TRPC6 R758K and 3.5-fold more potent in TRPC3 K689R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the lower antagonist potency in TRPC3 could be partly due to the less optimal position for the lysine to form the cation-π interaction with the benzonitrile group.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Binding of antagonist to TRPC6.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structure of the antagonist AM-1473.

Mutations that removed the negatively charged residues that interact with the primary amine, E509A and D530A, almost completely abolished the response of TRPC6 to the antagonist, consistent with the critical roles of the negatively charged side chains in ligand recognition and the positively charged primary amine in maintaining antagonist potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

Overall, these mutagenesis data are consistent with the atomic interactions visualized in the structure.</p><p>Interestingly, the S1-S4 pocket has been shown to play important roles in modulation of other TRP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In TRPV6, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate was found to occupy this site and inhibit the channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c–d</xref>). On the other hand, in TRPM8, icilin, a synthetic cooling agonist, could bind to this site and increase the channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3e–f</xref>). Since this pocket was empty in all other TRPC structures determined so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>), our structure of the antagonist-bound TRPC6 provides the first evidence that the S1-S4 pocket in TRPC channels could be a site for channel modulation. Notably, the crevice between the S2-S3 linker and the TRP helix connects the pocket to the cytoplasm and provides a possible access route for the antagonist.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lipid-binding sites</title><p>Besides the density for the antagonist, there are also several non-protein densities that most likely represent lipids copurified with TRPC6 or supplemented during purification. Similar to other TRP channels and voltage-gated ion channels, multiple outer leaflet lipids line the membrane-facing crevices between adjacent subunits, making contacts with helices S3-S6 as well as the pore helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,c</xref>). In the inner leaflet, one lipid is buried in a pocket formed by S1, S4 and the pre-S1 elbow, and its size and shape fit well with that of a cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). Another inner leaflet lipid is wedged between S4 and the S4-S5 linker and can be interpreted as a phosphatidylcholine lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). While one acyl chain of the phospholipid is unresolved due to the interference of an outer leaflet lipid, the other acyl chain occupies the cleft formed by S4 and S5 from adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Intriguingly, this cleft also contributes to the putative binding site of another small-molecule antagonist of TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Therefore, the intracellular cleft between S4 and S5 could be a site for channel modulation in TRPC6. Although it is not clear whether the inner leaflet phospholipid observed in our structure has an effect on channel activity, homologous lipid-binding sites in TRPV channels are critical for channel modulation. For example, the vanilloid-binding site located near S4 and S5 in TRPV1 accommodates a phosphatidylinositol lipid that could be displaced by vanilloid agonists or antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d–e</xref>).

Six mutations, including G109S, P112Q, N143S, Q889K, R895C, and E897K, are located at the interface between the ARD and the pole helix of the same subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, interface 1).

Gly640 on S6 of TRPC3, conserved among TRPCs and corresponding to Gly709 of TRPC6, has been proposed as a critical structural component for DAG recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lichtenegger et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations of this glycine in TRPC3 and TRPC6 dramatically reduced DAG sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strübing et al., 2003</xref>). On the pore helix, the conserved LFW motif (residues 678–680 in TRPC6) has been identified to be essential for channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strübing et al., 2003</xref>). Substitution of all three residues with alanine in TRPC5 and TRPC6 resulted in nonfunctional channels without altering plasma membrane expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strübing et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with the idea that the agonist-binding site is also important for DAG recognition, mutations around the site, including E672A, F675A, W680A, N702A, Y705A and V706A, maintained normal membrane surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>) but completely eliminated the response to OAG even at a 100 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Furthermore, Glu672 and Val706 appeared to be more critical for the binding of DAG than AM-0883, because channels with mutation E672A or V706A could still be activated by the agonist AM-0883 at reduced potency but not by DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The V710A mutation also reduced the maximal activation by OAG by &gt;80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Importantly, among six TRPC proteins found in human, only the closely-related subgroup of TRPC3, TRPC6 and TRPC7 are directly activated by DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hofmann et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, whereas several residues around the putative DAG-recognition site are conserved across TRPCs, Glu672, Asn702 and Tyr705 are only conserved among TRPC3, TRPC6 and TRPC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the AM-0883-binding site faces membrane lipids and is occupied by one of the outer leaflet lipids in the antagonist-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,c</xref>), and therefore constitutes a likely location for DAG-binding at the outer leaflet. The overall findings strongly suggest that the agonist-binding site identified here may overlap with the DAG-recognition site.</p><p>Analogous sites near the subunit interface between S6 and the pore helix have been previously identified to accommodate a small molecule agonist in TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmiege et al., 2017</xref>), and a small molecule antagonist in Ca<sub>v</sub>Ab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), corroborating the important role of this site in channel modulation. In addition, ligand binding at this site may also have an impact on lipid binding at the other side of the membrane, because in our agonist-bound structure, displacement of the outer leaflet lipid by the agonist appears to eliminate the steric hindrance against one of the acyl chains in the inner leaflet lipid, thereby allowing both acyl chains to be visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a,c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Ion permeation pathway</title><p>Compared to the WT protein, the double mutant V867T/L868T exhibited a 2-fold increase in maximum activity in the presence of the agonist AM-0883 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). However, similar to the antagonist-bound structure of TRPC6 (Δ2–72), the agonist-bound structure of TRPC6 (Δ2–72) V867T/L868T also possesses a closed ion channel pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, the mutations and the agonist were not sufficient to shift the gating equilibrium towards a stable open state. This is not surprising because the low open probability and the short open time (&lt;1 ms) of TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hofmann et al., 1999</xref>) suggest that the closed state is much more energetically stable compared to the open state.

In the ligand-free S1-S4 pocket of the agonist-bound state, the side chain of H446 adopts two alternative rotameric conformations, one of which occupies the position where the indene double ring of the antagonist would bind, and the side chain of R758 occupies the position where the benzonitrile group of the antagonist would bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Therefore, side chain movements of H446 and R758 are necessary to accommodate the antagonist. On the other hand, agonist-binding occurs without major structural changes in the side chains of the agonist-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Instead, the presence of the agonist seems to tilt the extracellular half of S6 away from the pore and pushes S6 toward the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Because S6 is tightly packed against S1-S4 of the adjacent subunit, the movement of S6 is accompanied by a concurrent tilting and downward movement of S1-S4 as well as the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,c</xref>). Among the transmembrane helices, S3 has the largest movement, with its extracellular end moving 4.4 Å, partly due to the remarkably long extension of S3 into the extracellular side. Viewing from the cytoplasmic side, agonist binding is accompanied by a counterclockwise rotation around the central ion pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), resulting in a movement of 2.4–3.3 Å at the intracellular end of S1-S4. While the structural changes from the antagonist-bound state to the agonist-bound state were not sufficient to stabilize an open channel pore, it is possible that agonist-bound channels may transition to the open conformation when further counterclockwise rotation of the S6 helical bundle fully unwinds the hydrophobic seal at the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes upon ligand binding.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Structural superposition of the transmembrane domain of antagonist-bound and agonist-bound TRPC6 viewed from parallel of the membrane (<bold>a</bold>) and intracellular side (<bold>b</bold>).

One of them is the structure of TRPC6 bound to another small molecule antagonist BTDM, and the other is the structure of TRPC3, which was prepared with OAG but no density of OAG was detected and the channel pore was closed. We found that the AM-1473-bound TRPC6 and the BTDM-bound TRPC6 assume a nearly identical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>, Cα-RMSD 0.588), with S1-S4 and the S4-S5 linker in the slightly up conformation, distinct from the slightly down conformation in agonist-bound structure. The structure of TRPC3, which shares ~75% sequence identity with TRPC6, is also very similar to the AM-1473-bound and BTDM-bound TRPC6 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>, Cα-RMSD 0.710), suggesting that both antagonists may allosterically inhibit the opening of the channel pore by stabilizing the apo or resting state, as observed in the action of antagonists on P2X<sub>3</sub> receptor channels and TRPM4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to test whether AM-1473 inhibits the channel by stabilizing the binding of the lipid near the S4-S5 linker, as this lipid and BTDM share part of their binding pockets and both seem to hinder the movement of the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>). Future studies on a fully open TRPC6 channel would help test this idea.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our structures reveal novel binding modes of small molecule modulators of TRPC6 that allow us to delineate intriguing similarities and differences between the ligand-binding pockets in TRPC6 and those found in TRPV and TRPM channels. First, the antagonist-binding site at the cytoplasm-facing pocket in the S1-S4 domain has been found to recognize natural cooling agonists and various synthetic compounds in TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diver et al., 2019</xref>) as well as a synthetic antagonist in TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, activity at the pore domain (S5-S6) of these channels could be allosterically modulated at the S1-S4 domain, most likely through the S4-S5 linker and the TRP helix. Second, the antagonist-binding site described here is distinct from the previously identified antagonist-binding site of TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2018</xref>), which is located at the intracellular membrane-facing cavity between S3-S4 and S5-S6 from adjacent subunits. Instead, this cavity is occupied by a phospholipid in both our structures and has been found to accommodate natural vanilloid agonists as well as competitive lipid or synthetic antagonists in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that occupancy by lipids or ligands at this site could also modulate channel activity. Finally, the agonist-binding site in TRPC6 is located at the extracellular membrane-facing cavity formed by S6 and the pore helix from adjacent subunits. We propose that this location is also where the native lipid agonist, DAG, acts on TRPC6. Therefore, TRPC6 is activated through a unique mechanism compared to TRPV and TRPM channels. Overall, our structures of TRPC6 bound to two different classes of modulators reveal hot spots in TRPC6 that future drugs could target and underline the emerging potential of cryo-EM in structural pharmacology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>TRPC6 cloning and expression</title><p>An N-terminally truncated human TRPC6 (residue 73–931) and its variant V867T/L868T were each cloned into a pORBMam vector with an N-terminal Strep tag.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study presents structures of TRPC6 channels in complex with an agonist and an antagonist developed by Amgen, solved by single-particle cryo-EM. The structures reveal two novel binding sites – one for the antagonist and the other for the agonist in the transmembrane domain. The authors also propose that the agonist binding site may overlap with the OAG binding site, the location of which has been a mystery for lipid-sensitive TRPC3/6/7 channels. This report is an important advance, because TRPC6-specific antagonists or agonist have been lacking, and knowledge of the binding sites could be further exploited for structure-based drug design.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis for pharmacological modulation of the TRPC6 channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In fact, we did try extensively to obtain such a structure but without any success. The main reason is that the apo-TRPC6 protein (wild type or N-terminally truncated) is very unstable and not suitable for cryo-EM analysis. While we could not surpass the technical challenges in obtaining the apo-TRPC6 structure at this point, we carried out additional structural analysis to address the concerns mentioned in the comment.</p><p>A) Assignment of ligand densities. First, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we compared the density around the antagonist-binding site between TRPC6-AM-1473 (3.1 Å) and TRPC6-AM-0883 (2.8 Å), TRPC6-BTDM (3.8 Å) or TRPC3 (4.3 Å). TRPC6-AM-1473 and TRPC6-AM-0883 protein samples were prepared with the same nanodisc condition in our lab, and TRPC6-BTDM and TRPC3 protein samples were prepared with very similar nanodisc condition from an external lab. The AM-1473 density only exists in the TRPC6-AM-1473 reconstruction. All the other reconstructions show an empty pocket around this region. Second, in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, we used the same above reconstructions to compare the density around the agonist-binding site. Again, we only found the AM-0883 density in the TRPC6-AM-0883 reconstruction. The density in the TRPC6-AM-1473 reconstruction looks quite different from that in the TRPC6-AM-0883 reconstruction and most likely belongs to phospholipids. There is no density for either AM-0883 or lipids in the TRPC6-BTDM and TRPC3 reconstructions, which have a relatively lower resolution. Third, in Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-H and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F-H, we included ligand densities from the postprocessed map and two corresponding half maps. The densities in all maps match very well with the unique size and shape of the small molecules. Overall, with the added structural analysis, we are confident that these densities belong to the small molecule modulators.</p><p>B) Understanding of the mechanism. We also added a structural comparison of our two structures and two other TRPC structures determined in a very similar nanodisc reconstitution. As discussed in our main text (Conclusion section), the comparison suggests that AM-1473 may help stabilize the apo/resting state. We believe the newly added structural analysis further expand the structural insights into the action of the small molecule modulators of TRPC6. We admit that at this point it is still challenging to fully understand how exactly these two molecules work partly due to the lack of a fully open TRPC6 structure. However, our structures lay a foundation for future research on a more activated state that would help better understand channel function and modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Interpreting changes in maximal whole-cell fluorescence level as changes in maximal channel activity is not justified as long as changes in channel surface expression are not determined.

We carried out new experiments testing the surface expression levels of WT and all mutant channels mentioned in comments 2.1 and 2.2. The results showed that WT and all mutant channels were expressed at similar levels on the membrane surface (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). These results suggest that the increased channel activity and lack of activity we observed with mutant channels are most likely due to perturbation of channel function instead of channel expression and further support our interpretation of the assay data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should clearly explain the rational for determining the structure of the TRPC6(2-72)T867T/L868T mutant and not of TRPC6(2-72) in the presence of the agonist. Did they try and did not see the ligand in the TRPC6(2-72) structure?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and have modified the text (subsection “Agonist-binding site”) accordingly. The main reason of working on the agonist-bound structure with the double mutant is that we found that the double mutant channel has much higher activity compared to the WT channel and therefore would be a better variant to investigate the more activated conformation. On hindsight, unfortunately, the double mutant did not shift the gating equilibrium enough for us to observe the fully open channel. We did not further determine the agonist-bound structure with TRPC6 D2-72 because based on the similar potency of the agonist (Figure 3D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F), we don’t expect there would be any significant difference in the binding mode between these two channel variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7 is confusing.

Also, are there any conformational changes in the intracellular domain?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment. We have changed the colors in this Figure as well as in Figure 6 so that there is more contrast among the structures and included the comparison with the apo structure of TRPC3 (ref. response to comment 1). We also included structural comparison of the intracellular domain (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), which did not show any significant conformational changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
