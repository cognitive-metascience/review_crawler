Similar data were acquired using acute pharmacological inhibition of the Eya2 phosphatase activity and the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 in wild-type axolotls. Together, our data indicate that highly-regenerative animals employ a robust DNA damage response pathway which involves regulation of H2AX phosphorylation via Eya2 to facilitate proper cell cycle progression upon injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axolotl</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>limb regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003212</institution-id><institution>Sara Elizabeth O'Brien Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousounis</surname><given-names>Konstantinos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY029361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sousounis</surname><given-names>Konstantinos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

Genotoxic stress can cause senescence and apoptosis in proliferating cells or carcinogenesis when oncogenes are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitale et al., 2017</xref>). Upon DNA damage, sensor proteins initiate a DDR that eventually guides DNA repair enzymes to resolve the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huen and Chen, 2008</xref>). The histone variant H2AX is considered a major DNA damage mediator protein because it is used as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions based on its amino acid modifications. H2AX phosphorylated at the 139 serine, commonly known as gamma-H2AX (Î³-H2AX), is widely used as a DNA damage marker because it is found aggregated near lesions shortly after they occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huen and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>). Acting in concert to ensure genomic stability, cell cycle checkpoints ordinarily prevent cells from progressing before resolving DNA damage. Cell cycle arrest through activation of DNA damage checkpoints via Chk1 and Chk2 is an important part of the DDR mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartek and Lukas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). DNA repair resolves the DDR and protein modifications are reversed so normal cellular function can be resumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, DDR does not always lead to DNA repair; molecular safeguards mediate critical decisions as to whether the amount of DNA damage is amendable, or whether apoptosis should be triggered instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). These molecular switches, such as p53, are known tumor suppressors and, when deregulated, apoptosis is circumvented, and carcinogenesis could occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lakin and Jackson, 1999</xref>). For instance, in vitro cultured human stem cells experience DNA damage and chromosomal rearrangements that change their cellular fate and render them carcinogenic and unsuitable for use in clinical applications in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitale et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, amphibians can faithfully regenerate body parts throughout life, often even when repeatedly challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryant et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sousounis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Replicative stress and reactive oxygen species generated during the process could challenge regeneration, at the cellular level by inhibiting cell cycle progression or at the functional level by losing the ability to form a proper structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sousounis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Haj Baddar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How do amphibians regulate genotoxic stress and DDR while ensuring tissue regeneration? Previous studies have shown that during early phases of regeneration, the activity of p53 is reduced to allow for progenitor cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yun et al., 2013</xref>), but it is later activated to enable differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villiard et al., 2007</xref>). Since p53 is a major regulator of DDR, amphibians might be de-sensitized to DNA damage allowing for rapid progression through the cell cycle checkpoints. Their massive genome could also facilitate this process; it has been previously shown that DNA damage is more likely to occur in areas that do not encompass coding regions and regulatory elements, like retrotransposons, which are significantly abundant in amphibian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poetsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowoshilow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elewa et al., 2017</xref>). A completely opposite (but not mutually exclusive) strategy would entail the initiation of a DDR together with the onset of the regeneration process to ensure rapid DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Studies that have repeatedly initiated the regeneration process, for example when newt lenses were removed and successfully regenerated 19 times over 18 years, support this hypothesis since the structure and function of the genome would remain intact over many rounds of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sousounis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sousounis et al., 2014a</xref>). In addition, high-throughput gene expression datasets acquired from regenerative tissues show up-regulation of DNA repair genes across multiple organs and animal species, indicating that a proper DDR might be an innate part of the regenerative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sousounis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barghouth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shiroor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedelbaeva et al., 2010</xref>). This mechanism could occur in conjunction with clearing senescent cells from regenerating tissues, which would allow only resilient proliferating progenitors to be present in the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yun et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address these two hypotheses in the context of axolotl limb regeneration. We first investigated the relationship between DDR and tissue regeneration. We found an elevated DDR following limb amputation, which was accompanied by reduced relative Î³-H2AX levels and baseline amounts of DNA damage. Then we asked whether DDR is necessary for limb regeneration. To answer this question, we genetically targeted a DDR- and H2AX-associated gene, <italic>eyes absent 2</italic> (<italic>eya2</italic>). Eya2 regulates H2AX phosphorylation status, mediates decisions regarding DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>), and has been shown to be up-regulated during regenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sousounis et al., 2014b</xref>). We generated Eya2 mutant axolotls and found that their regenerative capability was significantly reduced and their Î³-H2AX levels were significantly elevated, especially in cells that have entered the cell cycle. Interestingly, we did not detect accumulation of DNA damage, indicating that our model specifically de-regulated the DDR process. RNAseq analysis of <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tissues and pharmacological inhibition of Eya2âs phosphatase activity were also used to corroborate our findings. In addition, we uncovered parallel evidence that DDR is required for successful regeneration as inhibiting a separate component of this process, the proper control of the DNA damage checkpoints by Chk1 and Chk2, led to severe regenerative impairment. This study reveals that DDR is an innate part of the regeneration process and identifies Eya2 as a regulator of DDR and cell cycle progression during progenitor cell proliferation. How amphibians regulate DDR and allow for cellular proliferation while maintaining cell fate could reveal important clues for improving the use of human stem cells in regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Axolotl limb regeneration is associated with elevated DNA damage response and low genotoxic stress in progenitor cells</title><p>To identify the presence of a DNA damage response (DDR) following limb amputation, we analyzed transcriptomic profiles from previously published expression datasets acquired by RNAseq and microarrays that included a complete time course of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voss et al., 2015</xref>). We analyzed 190 genes associated with DDR and DNA repair from both datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We found expression of DDR-related genes to be mostly up-regulated during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Green). Genes also appeared up-regulated irrespective of their molecular role during DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). We validated the expression of 17 genes using qPCR and found that 11 (65%) of them were up-regulated during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We then focused on genes that have tentative functions in promoting DNA repair, as these genes may regulate DDR for proper cell cycle entry and regeneration (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The genes in this subcategory also appeared up-regulated during regeneration (+DDR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Overall, our transcriptomic and qPCR analysis of DNA repair/damage genes revealed that DDR was evident as early as the early-bud blastema (~5 dpa) and peaked at the late-bud blastema (~14 dpa). To associate this response with the levels of actual DNA damage, we performed alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and found that there are no differences between intact and 14Â dpa blastema cells, whereas cells treated with UV showed more DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). To corroborate these data, we focused on the DNA damage mediator histone H2AX. First, we analyzed the axolotl <italic>h2afx</italic> sequence using two strategies: phylogenetic tree construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). We found that axolotl H2AX has a conserved carboxyl tail containing the S139, also known as Î³-H2AX when phosphorylated, and Y142 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>, green box). We validated antibodies detecting these phosphorylation sites in vitro using AL1 axolotl fibroblast cells following UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1dâe</xref>). RNAseq and qPCR also revealed that <italic>h2afx</italic> expression was significantly up-regulated during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We then used western blot to determine the phosphorylation state of H2AX in axolotl tissues. Using samples acquired across different time points during limb regeneration, we found that the total amount of H2AX and pY142-H2AX were elevated compared to GAPDH starting at 5Â dpa, corroborating the presence of a DDR in the early- and late-bud blastema (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). To analyze this process in greater depth, we focused on blastema samples at 14Â dpa, the time that DDR was found to be the most elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We again found that the total amount of H2AX protein was increased during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), following the same trend as its mRNA levels (<italic>h2afx,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The total levels of Î³-H2AX protein were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>); however, the relative ratio of Î³-H2AX to total H2AX protein was decreased during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Overall, these data indicated that blastema cells may require more Î³-H2AX to rapidly correct replication errors during proliferation but kept a low Î³-H2AX/H2AX ratio to reduce potential genotoxic stress signals that could hinder cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we identified that the relative pY142-H2AX levels were increased at 14Â dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>), which suggested that H2AX regulation was important during regeneration and a potential target to study in association with DDR and genome integrity. Together, these results suggest that DDR is evident during early-bud blastema and peaks at late-bud blastema, thereby preventing accumulation of DNA damage during regeneration. This may enable high levels of cellular proliferation despite local environmental genotoxic stressors. To further test this hypothesis, we aimed to genetically ablate one of the DDR components and identify whether challenging this process would have an impact on the regenerative capacity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA damage response is elevated during limb regeneration and is associated with regulation of H2AX phosphorylation status.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Regulation of DNA damage response (DDR) genes in two high-throughput gene expression datasets.

These data indicated that the slower growth of the <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastema was due to impairment of the regenerative process itself. We then investigated whether the slower regeneration rate was associated with proliferation deficiencies in limb progenitors. To test this possibility, we performed an 18 hr pulse with the nucleotide analogue EdU and subsequent detection as well as an immunofluorescence assay with the mitotic marker phosphoS10-Histone H3 (pH3) on 5Â dpa blastema sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g and h</xref>). At this time point we had previously observed that <italic>eya2</italic> was widely expressed throughout the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). <italic>Eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastemas had reduced rates of cell cycle entry indicated by a decrease in EdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>) and decreased mitotic activity as evidenced by a decrease in pH3<sup>+</sup> blastema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). To identify whether the rate-limiting factor was S phase entry, which in turn limits the number of cells at the G2 and M phases, or whether there were roadblocks at later phases, we quantified double-positive EdU and pH3 cells. Interestingly, we found a reduced percentage of double EdU+/pH3+ cells in the <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastemas, which indicated that cell cycle progression was also stalled at the G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the proliferation deficits observed at the cellular level, we performed western blot analysis of proteins known for their role during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). We found that the amount of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was reduced in the 5Â dpa <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> blastemas whereas the G2/M-specific Cyclin B1 was increased (CCNB1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). Given that CDK2 is not degraded at any phase of the cell cycle, its reduced presence indicated that the cell cycle was slower without Eya2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vermeulen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, CDK2 has been shown to stall the cell cycle at the G1 phase when down-regulated which strengthen our EdU data showing G1/S arrest in Eya2 mutant blastemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neganova et al., 2011</xref>). Cyclin B1 protein levels normally increase during the G2 phase and decline following mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong and Ferrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gong et al., 2007</xref>).

Taken together, these data show that ablation of Eya2 transactivation and phosphatase domains has a regeneration phenotype associated with slower cell cycle progression at the two major checkpoint transitions, G1/S and G2/M.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls have increased levels of Î³-H2AX specifically associated with cycling blastema cells</title><p>G1/S and G2/M checkpoints are activated upon cellular stress including DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>); thus, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of H2AX as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We found that 5Â dpa blastemas from <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals had increased levels of relative Î³-H2AX compared to those from <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting that the activated cell cycle checkpoints may be associated with increased levels of genotoxic stress. In contrast, <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> blastemas showed increased levels of pY142-H2AX, an outcome that correlated with the reduced Eya2 activity in the heterozygous background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). Since pY142-H2AX is a direct target of the Eya2 phosphatase domain, the data also indicate that the induced mutations in the <italic>eya2</italic> locus do in fact generate dysfunctional Eya2 mutant protein. However, we did not detect significant changes at pY142-H2AX between <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). The discrepancy between <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> in the pY142-H2AX levels might be due to compensatory mechanisms that prevents persistently high levels of bi-phosphorylated H2AX, a known cause of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). This possibility is supported by TUNEL staining in which we could not detect blastema cells undergoing apoptosis in <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). We then focused on understanding why <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls have increased Î³-H2AX levels. To investigate this, we performed immunohistochemistry against Î³-H2AX on tissue sections and identified a robust stain at the skin and wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1aâ</xref>). Its high fluorescence intensity throughout the skin did not allow us to detect the characteristic nuclear Î³-H2AX foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). We then focused on blastema cells in which we were able to detect and quantify nuclear Î³-H2AX foci per area in EdU+ and EdU- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Our analysis revealed that EdU+ cells had more Î³-H2AX foci per nuclear area than EdU- cells, irrespective of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, Two-way ANOVA, Row factor p-value&lt;0.0001, F(1,30) = 62.39, DFÂ =Â 1). These data support our initial findings that during limb regeneration total Î³-H2AX levels were elevated to alleviate replication stress during blastema cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, our data revealed that EdU+ <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastema cells had significantly more Î³-H2AX foci per area compared to those of <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This indicated that when blastema cells without Eya2 activity enter S-phase, they acquire more hallmarks of genotoxic stress, which also corroborated our earlier data showing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). We further identified that the increased presence of Î³-H2AX foci was due to more cells having a high number of foci per area and fewer cells having low number of foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). We also found that EdU+ cells were bigger in size compared to EdU- cells across all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, two-way ANOVA, Row Factor p-value=0.004, F(1,30)=16.13, DFÂ =Â 1); however, differences in the number of Î³-H2AX foci per area of the nucleus within the EdU+ population were not due to variations in the cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1bâc</xref>). In addition, when foci from all blastema cells were taken into consideration, there was no difference across genotypes; thus, the effect was found to be specific to cycling blastema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). Since <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastema cells showed increased levels of the DNA damage marker Î³-H2AX they might have also accumulated DNA damage. To test this, we performed comet assays on blastema cells from all three genotypes and found that ablation of Eya2âs transactivation and phosphatase domains does not affect the amount of DNA damage; hence, this phenotype appears specific to how DDR is regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). Taken together, these data revealed that functionally ablating one of the components of DDR, Eya2, reduced regeneration rate, which was associated with a genotoxic stress-like phenotype including slower cell cycle dynamics and increased levels of Î³-H2AX in proliferating blastema cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Proliferating <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastema cells have increased Î³-H2AX levels.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blot for H2AX and its phosphorylation status in 5Â dpa blastema tissue.

The most over-represented terms were genes associated with metabolic processes and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, yellow and green nodes and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which previous studies have implicated as a sign of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paschen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Qian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindqvist et al., 2018</xref>). To test whether this was at least in part related to genotoxic stress, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with DDR and found that they were up-regulated in <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastemas versus <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

On the other hand, the most over-represented terms on the dataset with genes up-regulated in <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tissues were regulation of biological quality, a GO term that encapsulates genes related to driving cellular function to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1c</xref>, red nodes and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) which may be part of a mechanism that compensates for the loss of Eya2 to alleviate the elevated DDR and stress. To better understand this process, we data-mined the expression of genes associated with the <italic>eya</italic> gene family, H2AX regulators and DDR. We found the expression of <italic>eya2</italic> itself to be significantly up-regulated in the <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tissues, while the rest of the <italic>eya</italic> family remained unchanged, revealing a potential feedback loop specific to <italic>eya2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Genes known to regulate H2AX post-translational modifications were found down-regulated which indicated a potential negative feedback loop that could ameliorate the elevated Î³-H2AX levels and dampen its effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). To test whether the absence of Eya2âs transactivation and phosphatase domains might lead to elimination of certain cell population in the blastema, we data-mined the expression of genes previously found to be specifically enriched in different blastema cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leigh et al., 2018</xref>).

These data indicated that there was no loss of any particular cell type in the blastema in absence of Eya2 which further supported a broader role in DDR regulation and cell cycle progression for all limb progenitors. Lastly, we isolated genes known to promote G1/S and G2/M checkpoints and visualized their expression in volcano plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

Taken together, RNAseq analysis revealed down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression specifically involved at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints as well as H2AX deregulation which corroborated our previous molecular data showing reduced EdU/pH3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k</xref>) while H2AX phosphorylation was aberrantly regulated in <italic>eya2</italic> mutant blastema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

However, our RNAseq analysis revealed a potential compensatory mechanism which was ultimately reflected in the ability of <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls to successfully regenerate limbs, albeit at a slower pace. To investigate whether this compensation could be employed at the time of amputation in wild-type animals, we used a previously characterized pharmacological inhibitor of Eya2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krueger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krueger et al., 2013</xref>) and asked whether we could phenocopy the DDR defects we observed in our <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls. We first validated by protein structure analysis that axolotl Eya2 was similar to human Eya2 and displayed the three helices previously found to be important for MLS000544460-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krueger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

As expected, Eya2 inhibition significantly reduced blastema length compared to DMSO controls at 8Â dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>). This effect was accompanied by a decrease in EdU+ cells following an 18 hr pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>) and an increase in TUNEL+ apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and f</xref>) in the treated limbs. We have previously shown that Î³-H2AX foci accumulate in proliferating limb progenitor cells following amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h and i</xref>) and in combination with the Eya2 inactivation, where pY142 removal is inhibited, could explain an increase of bi-phosphorylated H2AX, a known trigger of apoptosis. To corroborate these data, we used western blot analysis of H2AX where we detected increased levels of pY142- while Î³-H2AX remained in the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1c and d</xref>). To determine whether increased levels of DNA damage were also present in MLS000544460-treated blastema cells, we performed alkaline comet assays. We found more DNA damage present in blastema cells that had Eya2 activity blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), indicating that Eya2 is required for proper DDR in this context. Overall, pharmacological inhibition of Eya2 independently confirmed its role as an important modulatory node for DDR during vertebrate regeneration. In addition, the different phenotypes observed between <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls and Eya2 inhibitor-treated axolotls during regeneration, especially the increase in apoptotic cells in the latter, revealed that there is functional compensation that could prevent apoptosis in cells subject to genotoxic stress.

However, whether DDR is necessary for successful regeneration or instead is a transcriptional artifact due to the functional annotation of certain genes that have additional roles remained unknown. The differential regulation of H2AX at the RNA, protein and protein modification levels following limb amputation provided evidence that DDR is active during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and eâk</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In fact, at the cellular level, progenitors that have entered the cell cycle displayed increased numbers of Î³-H2AX foci in their nucleus, indicative of genotoxic stress, but at the tissue level the relative amounts of Î³-H2AX were reduced due to increased levels of unphosphorylated H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This illustrates the balanced role of DDR during regeneration: efficient DNA repair to ensure integrity but allowing cell cycle progression. Stronger evidence that DDR is an integrated part of the regenerative process was uncovered when we genetically ablated both of the two expected functional domains of one of the DDRâs components, Eya2. Our molecular, biochemical and transcriptomic data indicate de-regulation of the DDR process with increased levels of Î³-H2AX and further up-regulation of other DDR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

When we inhibited the function of the serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk1 and Chk2 which regulate G1/S and G2/M transitions upon DNA damage, regeneration was inhibited. Interestingly, we found that cell cycle progression was severely impaired with reduction of EdU+ cells and diminishing of cell cycle regulators like CDK2 and Cyclin B1. These data indicated that proper DNA damage response is important for tissue regeneration. This hypothesis was further supported by the dynamic regulation of the DNA damage mediator protein H2AX, especially in progenitor cells that have entered the cell cycle. To further study the role of DDR during regeneration, we genetically ablated one of its components. We chose <italic>eya2</italic> as our target because (1) was found up-regulated during regeneration, and (2) is known to regulate DNA repair by dephosphorylating H2AX at the Y142 amino acid. We found that in the absence of Eya2, there is a robust up-regulation of Î³-H2AX levels at the tissue level and the number of nuclear Î³-H2AX foci at the cellular level. This indicated an increase in genotoxic stress which was also corroborated transcriptome-wide using RNAseq. Interestingly, the increase in Î³-H2AX levels was not associated with an increase of DNA damage accumulating in blastema cells indicating that the observed phenotype was due to deregulation of the DNA damage response by allowing persistent Î³-H2AX. We found that this molecular signature resulted in inhibition of the cell cycle progression which ultimately affected the regeneration rate. We further explored the role of Eya2 in regulating DDR and cell cycle progression by utilizing an Eya2 inhibitor. Our data indicate that Eya2 inhibition significantly impaired limb regeneration by de-regulation of H2AX phosphorylation status, decrease in cell cycle progression, higher levels of DNA damage and triggering of apoptosis in blastema cells. Together, our data indicate that Eya2 is a critical modulatory protein that mediates cell cycle progression by properly regulating DDR and its function is important for understanding how highly regenerative organisms like axolotls are able to efficiently regrow tissues without compromising their genomic integrity and cellular potency.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51217-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Eya2 is up-regulated in proliferating cells to properly control DDR</title><p>We found <italic>eya2</italic> to be up-regulated in tissues that undergo regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryant et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sousounis et al., 2014b</xref>) and be preferentially expressed in stem/progenitor cells in intact and regenerating limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, Eya2 is also considered a biomarker for certain cancers, indicating that many more types of proliferating cells may up-regulate <italic>eya2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wen et al., 2017</xref>). Based on its most documented function during DDR, Eya2 prevents apoptosis by dephosphorylating pY142-H2AX which subsequently promotes DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). This mechanism could be active during regeneration and cancer cell proliferation to prevent apoptosis. Our molecular and biochemical data, however, strongly suggest an additional role for Eya2: dampening the DDR in cells following DNA repair. This is especially evident since progenitor cells lacking functional Eya2 have persistent Î³-H2AX levels in combination with slower cell cycle dynamics without changes in DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tu et al., 2013</xref>). Current literature has not found a role in Eya2 to properly control the return of DDR to baseline and have therefore also not determined whether this is due to its association with H2AX. However, previous studies have identified additional tyrosine residues on H2AX that Eya2 could interact with, as well as crosstalk between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that the role of Eya2 in resolving the DDR might be based on Y142-H2AX dephosphorylation, which in turn affects S139 phosphorylation in an as-of-now uncharacterized manner or by targeting other tyrosine or threonine resides on H2AX or on other phospho-proteins associated with it. While elucidating this possible mechanism is outside the scope of this study and challenging with the paucity of axolotl antibodies, ongoing studies in mammalian stem cells may uncover it. It is interesting to speculate that cancer cells might utilize Eya2 to bypass proper genotoxic stress signaling, preventing DDR initiation and thereby promoting rapid cell cycle entry, in addition to its already documented role in cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wen et al., 2017</xref>). As Eya proteins have been shown to act as transcriptional co-activators in other systems, considering a possible co-activation role for Eya2 in axolotl limb regeneration will also be important and the subject of future study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jemc and Rebay, 2007</xref>). It is also possible that underdeveloped kidneys observed in the <italic>eya2</italic> mutants could lead to a physiological difference between these animals and wild type and that these differences could indirectly impact limb regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Genetic and functional compensation for the loss of Eya2 function</title><p>Axolotls with one <italic>eya2</italic> mutant allele showed increased amounts of pY142-H2AX levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This data indicate that the mutant Eya2 protein lacked its normal phosphatase function as predicted by our genotyping of the targeted <italic>eya2</italic> locus. In <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls, since both <italic>eya2</italic> alleles are mutated with the same indels as those from <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, we were expecting a further increase in pY142-H2AX levels and potentially apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). This, however, is not the case since <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> tissues have reduced levels of pY142-H2AX than the <italic>eya2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> siblings indicating a compensatory mechanism that allowed cells without a functional Eya2 to not undergo apoptosis and axolotls to eventually regenerate normal limbs at a slower pace. We speculate that this compensatory mechanism is acquired during early phases of animal development since without it <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> axolotls might be embryonic lethal as many dividing cells would trigger apoptosis. Other studies have also shown genetic compensation when genes are targeted with CRISPR/Cas9 in a mechanism that is based on mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>). During this process, there is up-regulation of related genes based on their sequence similarity to the targeted gene. Interestingly, in our CRISPR/Cas9-targeted <italic>eya2</italic> mutants, compensation does not occur with up-regulation of the <italic>eya2</italic> paralogue genes <italic>eya1</italic>, <italic>eya3</italic> and <italic>eya4</italic>. In fact, only <italic>eya2</italic> expression was found significantly up-regulated, strongly suggesting that its transcription is controlled by a feedback loop that senses lower than normal Eya2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Another possibility is that the sequence of <italic>eya2</italic> is not similar enough to its paralogues for the mRNA decay-based mechanism to recognize them. This might also further indicate that the functions of the different <italic>eya</italic> paralogue genes are compartmentalized and likely do not share similar cellular roles in regenerating axolotl limbs. This finding is also supported by the fact that only <italic>eya1</italic> is enriched in presumptive muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leigh et al., 2018</xref>). Our RNAseq analysis showed that cells might compensate for the loss of Eya2 activity at the functional level by altering the expression of genes associated with the cellular role of Eya2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5aâe</xref>). For example, <italic>eya2</italic> mutant axolotls up-regulate DDR genes during regeneration, which could restore the resolution of genotoxic stress signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, our model is explained by the combination of a genetic compensation through mRNA degradation and feedback loops which up-regulated <italic>eya2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and mRNA surveillance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1c</xref>) as well as functional compensation by up-regulation of DDR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) to facilitate the loss of Eya2 activity. It is interesting to speculate that since Eya2 has many roles during development including regulating DDR to allow cell cycle progression, cells that hard-wire or genetically imprint the mechanism by which functional compensation of Eya2 is achieved would survive better and increase their presence during embryogenesis. This compensatory mechanism is better revealed when we applied the Eya2 inhibitor following amputation. The acute disruption of the DDR, at a time where compensation cannot be readily achieved, blocked regeneration, and triggered apoptosis and DNA damage accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is indicative of the known role of Eya2, to remove Y142 phosphorylation and mediate DNA repair versus apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic and biological compensation due to CRISPR/Cas9-targeting is a recently-emerging concept seen in axolotls and other animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Junker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, this compensatory mechanism may have a pivotal role during embryogenesis, regeneration, and evolution. The ability to mask genotypic problems that result in phenotypically normal organisms bears the potential of favorable molecular and genetic mechanisms to build resiliency under stress conditions like those experienced upon injury and regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling and procedures</title><p>All experiments involving animals were performed according to IACUC protocol #2016N000369 at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital and IACUC protocol #19-02-346 at Harvard University.

Very little is known about DDR in highly regenerative organisms and thus the study addresses an outstanding and significant question. In particular, it is important to discover mechanisms that allow the axolotl and other salamanders to precisely regenerate under conditions that would be expected to engender DNA damage.</p><p>A strength of the manuscript is the integrative nature of the work, combining bioinformatic analyses with multiple experimental approaches including molecular, developmental, genetic, and RNA-seq. I am mostly satisfied with the results although it would have been better to look at additional post-amputation time points for the developmental studies. The take-home message in the Abstract is clearly written and focuses on the primary results of the study while the manuscript is quite lengthy and a bit convoluted. Some of the descriptive results are in places too confidently ascribed to mechanism, at least to this reviewer that admittedly has little background in DDR biology. Some of this revolves around a key finding, that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of eya2 leads to different DNA damage outcomes. The manuscript suggests that absence of DNA damage during regeneration in eya2 CRISPR morphants, but presence of a DNA damage with acute pharmacological treatment reveals a compensatory mechanism to mitigate genotoxic stress during development. This result is not mentioned explicitly in the Abstract and perhaps it should be toned back a bit in the Discussion so as not to cloud the central findings of the study. Again, little is known about DDR in highly regenerative organisms and the primary findings in this paper provide a conceptual foundation for future work in this area.</p><p>The paper can be improved beyond the typos and grammatical mistakes; the logic was difficult to follow at times. My further comments below are meant to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) It would be better to describe the timing of DDR in more exacting terms, and perhaps more precisely as DNA-Double strand repair given the focus on h2afx?</p><p>2) It seems likely that the DDR transcriptional response might be a bit more complicated than presented and additional information is needed to understand how genes were selected to establish that a DDR transcriptional response occurs during regeneration. Genes were mined from Stewart et al., 2013 although other datasets could have been used (e.g. Knapp et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2015). Is there general agreement among the datasets? And, it is not clear why time points before 3 DPA were not included in the analysis. It seems that before 3 DPA, the expression of some/many DDR genes decreases below baseline levels. Is this not important to note in describing the DDR transcriptional response, which seems to coincide with an increase in differentially expressed cell cycle genes at 3 DPA, as noted in previous studies. Dose this suggest integration of DDR and cell cycle transcriptional programs? It is difficult to know which genes were selected from Stewart et al., 2013 because there is no way to cross-reference genes in Supplementary file 1 to that study, and it is not clear if the gene expression estimates were obtained from GEO or the axolomics.org website, which seem to report different estimates and more than one transcript for some genes, including eya2. Is the h2afx transcript annotated correctly; maybe present the mRNA and protein sequence for this gene? Supplementary file 1 seems to be missing a gene name in the last row. The gene ontology term that was used to select genes is not a GO term. Is the correct GO term &quot;positive regulation of DNA repair&quot; and can more be written about the prioritization and elimination process for DDR genes; why for example is parp3 not included? It might provide a more powerful figure to show the overlay of all the expression profiles.</p><p>3) Can the Abstract state more exactly when the DDR response is activated? Activated upon injury is not very exact, nor is post-amputation, wording used later in the Results section. The qPCR result (but not RNA-seq results) suggest up-regulation of eya2 by 1 dpa, however phosphorylated and non-phosphoryated h2afx were examined at 14 dpa, and it is not clear what blastema stage was used for the comet assays. Throughout the manuscript, there is need to present results with exact temporal and/or regeneration stage specific information. Might the analyses that were performed missed more dynamic changes in the DDR response?</p><p>4) Introduction: Maybe state exactly here what phosphorylation of H2afx means in terms of regulating DNA repair? This is stated much later in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Introduction final paragraph: Typo should be &quot;maintaining cell fateâ¦.&quot;</p><p>6) Leucistic axolotls should be referred to as &quot;whiteâ, this is a distinct axolotl mutant/strain.</p><p>7) Results first paragraph: Supplementary file 1 is missing a gene name in last row? Why was the Stewart et al. study used for data mining over other studiesâ¦.are the results consistent across studies? There are hundreds of genes annotated to DDR processes, how were these selected?</p><p>8) Results first paragraph: Can it be stated more exactly when DDR was initiated post-amputation?</p><p>9) Subsection âEya2 is widely expressed in early-bud blastema and is associated with DNA repair and cell cycle during regenerationâ: Instead of stating that different time points were examined for the transcript/co-expression analysis, can the exact time points be stated instead?</p><p>10) Probably more correct to write that other genes presented expression profiles that were similar/correlated to eya2, instead of writing that the expression of other genes was correlated with eya2. Muscle genes are known to decrease in expression during regeneration (perhaps because muscle cells are being removed from the blastema site), which would be the inverse pattern to increasing eya2 during regeneration. This has been reported many times (e.g. Voss et al., 2015). I don't understand what mechanistic connection is trying to be made here?</p><p>11) Paragraph two of subsection âEya2 is widely expressed in early-bud blastema and is associated with DNA repair and cell cycle during regenerationâ: comma after compartmentalize.</p><p>12) Subsection âEya2 mutant axolotls have reduced rate of regeneration and slower cell cycle progressionâ: When exactly is the DDR initiated upon limb amputation? There is a temporal disconnect between the time of amputation and early bud stage.</p><p>13) Instead of writing &quot;indicating that the rate of regenerationâ¦..&quot; write suggesting, âthat the rate of regenerationâ¦.&quot; because smaller limbs might trace to a different mechanism.</p><p>14) â17% of eya+/- formed skeletonsââ¦.Presumably the other 83% would fully pattern their skeletons with more time allowed in the experiment?</p><p>15) How do gene expression data &quot;corroborate our previous molecular and histological data showing decreased cell cycle progression and elevated Î³-H2AX levels in blastema tissues lacking eya2 activity&quot;? It is not also clear how a rather abstract GO term implicates a mechanism for compensation for loss of Eya2?</p><p>16) How do RNA-seq data &quot;corroborated our previous data indicating slower cell cycle progression and DDR persistence while revealed compensatory mechanisms for the loss of Eya2 function&quot; or, &quot;show an obvious compensatory mechanism&quot;?</p><p>17) Final paragraph of subsection âPharmacological inhibition of Eya2 upon amputation impairs regeneration and confirms its role in DDR.â: Not clear what acquired developmentally means. Couldn't it always be operative during development and re-capitulated in salamanders during regeneration?</p><p>18) Subsection âDNA damage response is an integral process of tissue regenerationâ: Typo, instead of &quot;shown&quot;, write &quot;showed that&quot;.</p><p>19) At some point, should it not be stated that h2afx is a multifunctional protein, in fact it was first studied because it is a transcriptional coactivator?</p><p>20) Subsection âGenetic compensation for the loss of Eya2 functionâ: You write &quot;assumed during development&quot;, which to be consistent with earlier phrasing, should be &quot;acquired during development&quot;.</p><p>21) Materials and methods: see comment 19 pertaining to acquired developmentally.</p><p>22) Materials and methods: it would help understand regeneration rate to state the environmental temperature during experimentation.</p><p>23) Subsection âDNA Damage Response analysisâ: I think the GO term is &quot;Positive Regulationâ¦&quot; not &quot;Positive Relation..&quot;. What database was used as a reference for the GO analysisâ¦..human? Also, how many total genes are in the annotation?</p><p>24) Figure 1 legend. Please explain what &quot;relative&quot; means.</p><p>25) Figure 1 legend. Typo in this sentence and the conclusion should be toned down. The data are suggestive at best &quot;These data indicate that there Eya2 is associated with DNA repair and cell cycle during limb regeneration&quot;.</p><p>26) Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 legend: Probably should rephrase: &quot;Note that eya2 expression is associated with genes known to participate in cell cycle progression (blue) and DNA repair (red).&quot; What the result suggests is that the eya2 expression profile is correlated with expression profiles for genes that annotate to cell cycle and DNA repair GO terms.</p><p>27) Muscle genes are known to decrease in expression during regeneration, independent of eya2 expression during muscle development. This has been reported several times. Again, it is not clear what point is being made.</p><p>28) Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 legend: I don't see how an inclusive GO term implicates a compensatory mechanism. Regulation of Biological Quality could mean many different things. Here is the definition of this GO term: Any process that modulates a qualitative or quantitative trait of a biological quality. Hundreds of traits come to mind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sousounis et al. investigate the role of the DNA damage response (DDR) during limb regeneration in salamanders. They find the expression of genes associated with the DDR is elevated early on and throughout the process of regeneration. The authors functionally test the role of the DDR by disrupting a member of the eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins. Specifically, they generated eya2 mutant axolotls and used phosphorylation of the H2AX histone variant as a readout of the DDR activation. They also used chemical inhibition of eya2 and in some cases recapitulated the effects observed with the genetic manipulations. As presented, however, the work needs to be strengthened and may benefit by incorporating additional experiments to support the central claim the authors are making. Below, are some suggestions the authors may want to consider.</p><p>1) The focus on DDR during regeneration is commendable, but the analysis is perceived as a little premature. Eya2 may function as a transcriptional activator and as a protein phosphatase that regulates many pathways including repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The genotyping of the mutants suggests both the phosphatase and transactivating domains were removed, but the characterization of eya2 was only focused on DNA repair without considering other potential roles.</p><p>2) The work relies on the Î³-H2AX signal, but the immunostainings in Figure 2E-G are challenging to interpret. For example, in Figure 2E, Î³-H2AX appears restricted to the border of the tissue, perhaps labeling epithelial cells. This marginal signal appears to increase in <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup>,</italic> but there is not a satisfactory explanation about the spatial distribution and the way the signal looks. According to the authors, the DDR is elevated in proliferating cells, but the distribution of Î³-H2AX in the periphery probably implies that other cells also overexpress the signal? Also, the images presented in Figure 2G are consistent with Î³-H2AX foci, but the intensity is very low (compare to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). On the same figure, the EdU stain also looks dim, and it is troublesome to make any interpretations based on the overlapping images in Figure 2H-I. The staining protocol may need some optimization, and there should be some satisfactory explanation about the spatial distribution of the signal and the potential identity of cells with increased Î³-H2AX in the epithelia.</p><p>3) Intriguingly, <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>has a mild effect on regeneration compared with the effects of the inhibitor treatment. Also, how regeneration was analyzed is not consistent between the two treatments. For example, in Figure 1E, the authors quantified Zeugopod length over animal length, while in Figure 3H, the analysis was based on relative blastema length. Please clarify why the difference between these parameters. Perhaps standardizing the measurement of the blastema surface area in both cases would be more accurate.</p><p>4) The quantification of cell death in <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>is missing. The Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 shows some TUNEL/ Î³-H2AX staining, but it is difficult to discern what part is related to background and/or positive signal. Likewise, the amount of TUNEL + cells in the control group Figure 4I, K (below 1%) seems very low considering the DDR is activated, and regeneration requires cell death. This brings another issue related to the amount of DNA damage induced by the treatment with DMSO (Figure 4N). It seems DMSO-intact/blastema groups show a large number of cells with COMET score 3-4. If the Eya2 inhibitor is inducing DNA damage, this will account only for the slight increase of cells with COMET score four. Validating cell death with other approaches (e.g., caspase, FACS, etc.), and adding better contrast or some validation of the staining involving TUNEL may benefit the work.</p><p>5) The model presented in Figure 5 is not intuitive, and some of the statements lack support. For example, no data is supporting the presence of replication errors. The cell cycle arrest may need additional experiments, perhaps cell cycle with FACS or other methods. Using EdU and H3P staining to deduce cell cycle arrest is probably a good start, but additional experiments are needed to support this conclusion.</p><p>6) The authors may want to consider expanding their characterization of factors involved in the DDR and DNA repair. The DDR influences cell fate in the presence of DNA damage, so incorporating characterization of other molecules such as p53 may strengthen the case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>During regeneration and tissue repair, cells must balance the requirement for highly regulated, brisk proliferation with the requirement to avoid DNA damage or transformation that might occur downstream of replicative stress. Stem cells, in vivo, are thus expected to possess an enhanced ability to proliferate without acquiring DNA damage. Understanding how stem and progenitor cells avoid DNA damage despite rapid cell division, especially in the context of a highly regenerative organism, could improve approaches directed at deriving and utilizing stem cells for regenerative therapies.</p><p>It is within this knowledge gap that Sousounis and colleagues begin their studies. Using axolotls, the group created animals with mutations in eyes absent 2, a salamander gene homologous to a group of genes that encode dual-function proteins (transcriptional activator and phosphatase) with roles in morphogenesis, DNA damage repair, and proliferative control. Using these mutants, chemical inhibitors of Eya and other approaches directed at understanding DNA damage during vertebrate limb regeneration, the group presents data to support the idea that DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are important during regeneration. Sousounis, et al., ask an important question about the ways that organisms prevent DNA damage during regeneration, but the overall conclusions of the manuscript lack support in several key areas. Suggestions for required and recommended changes for the work follow. Major revisions and additional experiments would be required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major critiques:</p><p>1) Eyes absent homologs play roles in DNA repair, but also regulate morphogenesis of several tissues (e.g. eyes, kidneys, muscle, ears, heart) though protein-protein interactions with transcriptional regulators like Six and Dachsous family members. The fact that <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>does not cause increased DNA damage further complicates the authors' interpretation that DDR is the key function of Eya2. Thus, the claim that Eya2's function in axolotl limb regeneration is due to DNA damage response (and not general transcriptional dysregulation) is undersupported.</p><p>a) The authors should clarify whether axolotl Eya2 plays any roles in development. The authors say that limbs are normal in <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mutants, but provide only one image per genotype with no scale bars. Is the skeleton normal (e.g. zeugopod length) in uninjured limbs? The authors indicate that there is an intra-peritoneal edema in mutants, but do not discuss the etiology of this phenotype. Overall, a more comprehensive analysis of the knockout phenotype (before injury) is needed. If Eya2 plays roles in axolotl development or physiology, the authors should discuss whether other roles for eya2 might alter interpretation of their regeneration results. This might also determine whether a reader would conclude that the role of Eya2 is regeneration-specific.</p><p>b) The authors themselves show considerable transcriptional dysregulation after eye2 knockout (Figure 4), which further highlights other potential roles of Eya2 beyond the DDR. The markers used in Figure 4E do not seem comprehensive. Would it be worth looking at markers of muscle or neurons in the regenerating limb given other developmental roles for eya homologs?</p><p>c) The authors should also demonstrate that perturbation of other DNA damage repair mechanisms causes similar limb regeneration failure. This should be achievable by chemical inhibition of canonical DNA damage repair machinery (e.g. inhibitors of ATM, ATR, Chk1, or Chk2).</p><p>2) In several sections, the authors have quantified western blot images that are scanned from film that was developed after ECL. It is very challenging to quantify proteins accurately with this approach, due to issues around linearity of signal in both the ECL step and the development step. A great deal of caution should be exercised with these approaches and the conclusions drawn from them. If the authors wish to make quantitative statements about these western blots, more controls need to be completed to ensure that blots were in the linear range and that loading was consistent. Alternatively, another approach (e.g. fluorescent secondary antibodies rather than chemiluminescence) should be considered. Overloading or saturation looks especially likely in Figure 3A and Figure 4L which are key pieces of data for the authors' argument that Eya2 is important for DDR.</p><p>3) Validation of the H2AX antibody (and phosphospecific antibodies) seems important for the arguments put forward in this manuscript. It would be helpful to show that the authors see an increase in H2AX phosphorylation (with their antibodies and western blotting/immunostaining) after UV exposure in axolotls. This would validate the antibodies for use in this species and confirm that H2AX phosphorylation behaves as expected in axolotls. The authors should also demonstrate that the Î³-H2AX staining (Figure 3E, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A?) reveals nuclear localization, as would be expected for a histone. In some images, the staining looks quite clearly cytoplasmic, though the images are not very high magnification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Although this manuscript presents new knowledge with the first demonstration of a DNA damage response (DDR) during regeneration, I am not sure if this alone is enough to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I admit that having read the manuscript several times, I find it difficult to glean what is known and what is unknown about DDR and Eya2 in other systems. Thus, the readability and focus of the manuscript are not helping in its evaluation. From what I gather from other systems, DDR is a common feature of rapidly proliferating cells and can be a consequence of not only acute genotoxic insults but also regular replicative stress that accompanies a rapid S phase. This may be particularly true in axolotls, which must replicate over 30Gb of genome and yet can still accomplish a 48-72hour cell cycle during regeneration. If this is true, I do not find the results to highlight any regeneration-specific insights or elucidate a pressing question concerning how regeneration occurs. For me, there are two potential follow up questions that would address this.</p><p>The authors do not report any effect of Eya2 mutation on the development of the organism. First, is it slower than the development of the wildtype animal? Do the authors also observe the same H2AX foci observed during regeneration? If they could show that the DDR process they observe and Eya2's specific role is unique to regeneration and does not have any role in the rapid proliferation and development of the embryo, then I think this would be quite interesting and would potentially be a mechanism where regeneration and development diverge.</p><p>Secondly, the mechanism of Eya2 seems to be in the regulation of the DDR such that Eya2's phosphatase activity removes cell cycle checkpoints and indicates a successful resolution of the DNA damage. This seems to be a known role of Eya2 in other animal systems. Thus, although the authors observe phenotypes on cell cycle progression and regeneration, all DNA damage has been successfully repaired (as indicated by a normal comet assay). I think it would be more interesting to determine what happens when DNA damage cannot be repaired. Are there gross effects when progenitors accumulate unrepaired damage sites? Because regeneration can occur multiple times, does accumulated DNA damage impact subsequent regeneration events? This might be achieved through pharmacological inhibition of ATM which is the kinase that phosphorylates H2AX and marks DNA damage sites. Again, this would be unique to regeneration and be of interest to the regeneration field as well as the general stem cell field to look at the consequences of genotoxic stress on progenitor exhaustion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51217.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is difficult to follow in places and this made it difficult to understand the authors interpretations of crucial results.

The manuscript suggests that absence of DNA damage during regeneration in eya2 CRISPR morphants, but presence of a DNA damage with acute pharmacological treatment reveals a compensatory mechanism to mitigate genotoxic stress during development. This result is not mentioned explicitly in the Abstract and perhaps it should be toned back a bit in the Discussion so as not to cloud the central findings of the study. Again, little is known about DDR in highly regenerative organisms and the primary findings in this paper provide a conceptual foundation for future work in this area.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now toned down our interpretation of this data in the Results and Discussion. We have highlighted instances of compensation in axolotls and other models that have been targeted using CRISPR/Cas9. Since this compensatory mechanism appears to be common with other models. Since this is not the main point of the paper, we do not favor including mention of it in the Abstract, and nonetheless, given the word limit, there is not space.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper can be improved beyond the typos and grammatical mistakes; the logic was difficult to follow at times. My further comments below are meant to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) It would be better to describe the timing of DDR in more exacting terms, and perhaps more precisely as DNA-Double strand repair given the focus on h2afx?</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe that DDR is evident in early-bud blastema and peaks at late-bud blastema.

Genes were mined from Stewart et al., 2013 although other datasets could have been used (e.g. Knapp et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide data from Voss et al., 2015.

It seems that before 3 DPA, the expression of some/many DDR genes decreases below baseline levels. Is this not important to note in describing the DDR transcriptional response, which seems to coincide with an increase in differentially expressed cell cycle genes at 3 DPA, as noted in previous studies. Dose this suggest integration of DDR and cell cycle transcriptional programs?</p></disp-quote><p>Certainly, our data throughout the paper point toward the direction that DDR is elevated when cell cycle is active. We now provide expression data from all timepoints in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A. While there are some genes whose expression does decrease very early following amputation, the majority of them actually go up, and this relationship, combined with the rest of our data focusing on the later time points, makes us hesitant to draw too many conclusions from this observation. We agree that a future study could specifically investigate the possible coupling of the expression of genes to cell-cycle re-entry early in the regeneration process. Also, because there is probably less concordance between the behavior of individual cells in the very beginning of the process (for example, some will die while others will go on to proliferate), it is possible these early time points exhibit more variability in gene expression across the DDR</p><p>response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to know which genes were selected from Stewart et al., 2013 because there is no way to cross-reference genes in Supplementary file 1 to that study, and it is not clear if the gene expression estimates were obtained from GEO or the axolomics.org website, which seem to report different estimates and more than one transcript for some genes, including eya2.</p></disp-quote><p>The data were provided from the supplementary files from the original publication (Stewart et al., 2013), which includes a file that has a single expression value per gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the h2afx transcript annotated correctly; maybe present the mRNA and protein sequence for this gene?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that the sequence of h2afx that we focus on in this work was manually mined out of the published axolotl genome paper (see Materials and methods).

This has been reported many times (e.g. Voss et al., 2015). I don't understand what mechanistic connection is trying to be made here?</p></disp-quote><p>We made the recommended change.

They find the expression of genes associated with the DDR is elevated early on and throughout the process of regeneration. The authors functionally test the role of the DDR by disrupting a member of the eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins. Specifically, they generated eya2 mutant axolotls and used phosphorylation of the H2AX histone variant as a readout of the DDR activation. They also used chemical inhibition of eya2 and in some cases recapitulated the effects observed with the genetic manipulations. As presented, however, the work needs to be strengthened and may benefit by incorporating additional experiments to support the central claim the authors are making. Below, are some suggestions the authors may want to consider.</p><p>1) The focus on DDR during regeneration is commendable, but the analysis is perceived as a little premature. Eya2 may function as a transcriptional activator and as a protein phosphatase that regulates many pathways including repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The genotyping of the mutants suggests both the phosphatase and transactivating domains were removed, but the characterization of eya2 was only focused on DNA repair without considering other potential roles.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have done considerably more work to address the role of DDR during limb regeneration beyond just implicating Eya2. This work sums to one full figure (half of Figure 1 and half of Figure 6). For example, we now present analyses of the DDR itself during regeneration, before we zero in on Eya2. We also chose an independent inhibitor of the DDR, Chk1/2 inhibitor, and we tested its effects postamputation. We discovered that inhibition of Chk1/2 dramatically impairs axolotl limb regeneration.</p><p>In the original submission in the Introduction, we did mention that Eya2 has two separate identified functions in other systems: transcriptional co-activation and phosphatase activity. So far, we have collected evidence that Eya2 is important for a DDR in axolotl limb regeneration, so that is what we chose to pursue in this work. We have not ruled out any potential role for it as a possible transcriptional co-activator in this system/process. Indeed, that would be quite interesting to investigate, but we feel it is outside the scope of this current study, especially since new tools would need to be generated to test this discrete possibility. In the revised Conclusion, we have now speculated that it will be important in the future to also consider a possible transcriptional co-activation role for Eya2 during limb regeneration. We say, âAs Eya proteins have been shown to act as transcriptional co-activators in other systems, considering a possible co-activation role for Eya2 in axolotl limb regeneration will also be important and the subject of future study.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The work relies on the Î³-H2AX signal, but the immunostainings in Figure 2E-G are challenging to interpret. For example, in Figure 2E, Î³-H2AX appears restricted to the border of the tissue, perhaps labeling epithelial cells. This marginal signal appears to increase in eya2<sup>-/-</sup>, but there is not a satisfactory explanation about the spatial distribution and the way the signal looks. According to the authors, the DDR is elevated in proliferating cells, but the distribution of Î³-H2AX in the periphery probably implies that other cells also overexpress the signal? Also, the images presented in Figure 2G are consistent with Î³ -H2AX foci, but the intensity is very low (compare to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). On the same figure, the EdU stain also looks dim, and it is troublesome to make any interpretations based on the overlapping images in Figure 2H-I. The staining protocol may need some optimization, and there should be some satisfactory explanation about the spatial distribution of the signal and the potential identity of cells with increased Î³-H2AX in the epithelia.</p></disp-quote><p>We make this clearer and more distinct in the text. There is robust staining in the epithelium that covers all cell layers (see Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1). This staining pattern prohibited us from looking for Î³-H2AX in the nucleus of the epithelia, thus, excluding them from further analysis. We do think the staining in the cytoplasm of skin cells is likely legitimate, but we do not know why Î³-H2AX protein is localizing there. Note that we fixed the limb, embedded it, and cryosectioned it before subjecting it to immunohistochemistry.</p><p>For the staining in blastema cells: We have extensively optimized the protocol for Î³- H2AX in tissue sections and it still does suffer from background, which is often an issue in axolotl limb immunohistochemistry. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that g-H2AX immunohistochemistry has been presented for axolotl tissues. The antibody is usually used on cultured cells, where autofluoresence is usually less of an issue. Please note that in our supplementary figure, where we use the antibody on axolotl cells in culture, the staining is much cleaner.</p><p>Nonetheless, all the foci were quantified by blind (to the experimental design and genotype) researchers and it is consistent with the differences seen between EdU+ and EdU- cells (more Î³-H2AX in EdU+ irrespective of genotype). The images presented in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C are from in vitro cultured cells. There are instances of Î³-H2AX staining outside the nucleus but we could not correlate the spatial pattern to any function found in the literature. In addition, we do not know if it is due to antibody specificity issues even though the same phenomenon was obtained using two different antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Intriguingly, eya2<sup>-/-</sup> has a mild effect on regeneration compared with the effects of the inhibitor treatment. Also, how regeneration was analyzed is not consistent between the two treatments. For example, in Figure 1E, the authors quantified Zeugopod length over animal length, while in Figure 3H, the analysis was based on relative blastema length. Please clarify why the difference between these parameters. Perhaps standardizing the measurement of the blastema surface area in both cases would be more accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>For both <italic>eya2</italic> mutants and Eya2 inhibition (and now in Chk1/2 inhibition) we have measured blastema length (Figure 2B and Figure 6B). For <italic>eya2</italic> mutants we measured zeugopod length for 30 dpa regenerates because there is no blastema present. Zeugopod was chosen because fingers are usually curved in the autopod and amputation was performed in the stylopod. So zeugopod appears to be the most unaffected portion of the limb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The quantification of cell death in eya2<sup>-/-</sup> is missing. The Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 shows some TUNEL/ Î³-H2AX staining, but it is difficult to discern what part is related to background and/or positive signal. Likewise, the amount of TUNEL + cells in the control group Figure 4I, K (below 1%) seems very low considering the DDR is activated, and regeneration requires cell death. This brings another issue related to the amount of DNA damage induced by the treatment with DMSO (Figure 4N). It seems DMSO-intact/blastema groups show a large number of cells with COMET score 3-4. If the Eya2 inhibitor is inducing DNA damage, this will account only for the slight increase of cells with COMET score four. Validating cell death with other approaches (e.g., caspase, FACS, etc.), and adding better contrast or some validation of the staining involving TUNEL may benefit the work.</p></disp-quote><p>The timepoints selected for the DDR analysis were specifically chosen to avoid/limit the presence of apoptotic cells observed usually during very early phases of limb regeneration. Our TUNEL data are consistent to those from previous studies. Thus, we decided that additional effort dedicated to this proposed experiment would not be the best use of time since it would likely provide minimal additional explanatory power. There were no visible TUNEL+ cells in all blastemas quantified (even though there were positive cells in the non-blastema portion of the limbs). The comet assay has background signal which most likely account for the amount of comet score 3-4 seen in the figure. All samples/data presented in each figure were acquired at the same time to subject everything to the same amount of background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The model presented in Figure 5 is not intuitive, and some of the statements lack support. For example, no data is supporting the presence of replication errors. The cell cycle arrest may need additional experiments, perhaps cell cycle with FACS or other methods. Using EdU and H3P staining to deduce cell cycle arrest is probably a good start, but additional experiments are needed to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a re-worked figure (now Figure 7) that we believe represent better the work performed in the paper. We now present western blot data that support cell cycle arrest at G1/S and G2/M transitions in absence of Eya2 activity.</p><p>Additionally, we provide an additional experiment that independently intersects the cell cycle. We inhibited the Checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 with a Chk1/2 inhibitor, and we found that limbs treated with this inhibitor were dramatically impaired in their regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors may want to consider expanding their characterization of factors involved in the DDR and DNA repair. The DDR influences cell fate in the presence of DNA damage, so incorporating characterization of other molecules such as p53 may strengthen the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our DDR characterization by providing more high-throughput gene expression data and qPCR validation. We have also inhibited another component of the DDR process, the regulation of the cell cycle via DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1/2 and found that limb regeneration is impaired.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major critiques:</p><p>1) Eyes absent homologs play roles in DNA repair, but also regulate morphogenesis of several tissues (e.g. eyes, kidneys, muscle, ears, heart) though protein-protein interactions with transcriptional regulators like Six and Dachsous family members. The fact that eya2<sup>-/-</sup> does not cause increased DNA damage further complicates the authors' interpretation that DDR is the key function of Eya2. Thus, the claim that Eya2's function in axolotl limb regeneration is due to DNA damage response (and not general transcriptional dysregulation) is undersupported.</p><p>a) The authors should clarify whether axolotl Eya2 plays any roles in development. The authors say that limbs are normal in eya2<sup>-/-</sup> mutants, but provide only one image per genotype with no scale bars. Is the skeleton normal (e.g. zeugopod length) in uninjured limbs? The authors indicate that there is an intra-peritoneal edema in mutants, but do not discuss the etiology of this phenotype. Overall, a more comprehensive analysis of the knockout phenotype (before injury) is needed. If Eya2 plays roles in axolotl development or physiology, the authors should discuss whether other roles for eya2 might alter interpretation of their regeneration results. This might also determine whether a reader would conclude that the role of Eya2 is regeneration-specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a complete characterization of the <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mutants (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>It is possible that underdeveloped kidneys, as we observed in the <italic>eya2</italic> mutants, could lead to a physiological difference between these animals and wild type and that these differences could indirectly impact limb regeneration. We have not found any direct precedence for this possibility in the literature, but it remains a possibility. We have added this possibility in the Conclusions.</p><p>We also leave the door open for there being a potential role for a transcription coactivation activity for Eya2 in limb regeneration (see our response to an earlier reviewer as well as our mention of this in the Conclusions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors themselves show considerable transcriptional dysregulation after eye2 knockout (Figure 4), which further highlights other potential roles of Eya2 beyond the DDR.

We do not observe differences in axons or in muscle in the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors should also demonstrate that perturbation of other DNA damage repair mechanisms causes similar limb regeneration failure. This should be achievable by chemical inhibition of canonical DNA damage repair machinery (e.g. inhibitors of ATM, ATR, Chk1, or Chk2).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide data showing that by inhibiting Chk1/2, limb regeneration is severely impaired.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In several sections, the authors have quantified western blot images that are scanned from film that was developed after ECL. It is very challenging to quantify proteins accurately with this approach, due to issues around linearity of signal in both the ECL step and the development step. A great deal of caution should be exercised with these approaches and the conclusions drawn from them. If the authors wish to make quantitative statements about these western blots, more controls need to be completed to ensure that blots were in the linear range and that loading was consistent. Alternatively, another approach (e.g. fluorescent secondary antibodies rather than chemiluminescence) should be considered. Overloading or saturation looks especially likely in Figure 3A and Figure 4L which are key pieces of data for the authors' argument that Eya2 is important for DDR.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that quantifying western blot images can be problematic because it relies on all the proteins being within the linear range for concentration and exposure time. ECL was used because it provides better dynamic range than fluorescent methods (especially when we blotted for cell cycle regulators). Figure 3A (now Figure 4A) clearly shows that Î³-H2AX is elevated in <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>blastemas and if saturation exists, it would normalize the effect rather than elevate it in this case. Unfortunately, due to sample limitations, we were not able to redo these western blots and we opted to extract protein samples from the new batch of <italic>eya2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>animals obtained.</p><p>We did, however, try to satisfy the reviewerâs concern by using a capillary-based method for separating and quantifying protein (Protein Simple Wes system). After several trial runs, we determined that there is insufficient protein in the samples from these small blastemas for this method to be effective.</p><p>These data that appear on western blots have been corroborated with immunohistochemistry on tissue sections, and both types of analyses implicate Eya2 in DDR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Validation of the H2AX antibody (and phosphospecific antibodies) seems important for the arguments put forward in this manuscript. It would be helpful to show that the authors see an increase in H2AX phosphorylation (with their antibodies and western blotting/immunostaining) after UV exposure in axolotls. This would validate the antibodies for use in this species and confirm that H2AX phosphorylation behaves as expected in axolotls. The authors should also demonstrate that the Î³-H2AX staining (Figure 3E, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A?) reveals nuclear localization, as would be expected for a histone. In some images, the staining looks quite clearly cytoplasmic, though the images are not very high magnification.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide antibody validation in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Please see our previous explanation about the Î³-H2AX cytoplasmic staining in the skin. We think this staining is real and that the intensity differs between wild type and <italic>eya2</italic> mutants. We now present a high-magnification view of this data (Î³-H2AX in skin) in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1Aâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Although this manuscript presents new knowledge with the first demonstration of a DNA damage response (DDR) during regeneration, I am not sure if this alone is enough to justify publication in eLife. I admit that having read the manuscript several times, I find it difficult to glean what is known and what is unknown about DDR and Eya2 in other systems. Thus, the readability and focus of the manuscript are not helping in its evaluation. From what I gather from other systems, DDR is a common feature of rapidly proliferating cells and can be a consequence of not only acute genotoxic insults but also regular replicative stress that accompanies a rapid S phase. This may be particularly true in axolotls, which must replicate over 30Gb of genome and yet can still accomplish a 48-72hour cell cycle during regeneration. If this is true, I do not find the results to highlight any regeneration-specific insights or elucidate a pressing question concerning how regeneration occurs. For me, there are two potential follow up questions that would address this.</p><p>The authors do not report any effect of Eya2 mutation on the development of the organism. First, is it slower than the development of the wildtype animal? Do the authors also observe the same H2AX foci observed during regeneration? If they could show that the DDR process they observe and Eya2's specific role is unique to regeneration and does not have any role in the rapid proliferation and development of the embryo, then I think this would be quite interesting and would potentially be a mechanism where regeneration and development diverge.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a more comprehensive characterization of <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> developmental phenotype. From all aspects we have measured, including limb attributes, they are normal (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 2) except for that they have underdeveloped kidneys. We are unable to count Î³-H2AX foci on embryos at the moment mainly due to the limited number of mutant animals available and the nature of breeding scheme that yields a low number of <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (Crossing of two F0 mutant animals). We agree that this could be something interesting to investigate in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the mechanism of Eya2 seems to be in the regulation of the DDR such that Eya2's phosphatase activity removes cell cycle checkpoints and indicates a successful resolution of the DNA damage. This seems to be a known role of Eya2 in other animal systems. Thus, although the authors observe phenotypes on cell cycle progression and regeneration, all DNA damage has been successfully repaired (as indicated by a normal comet assay). I think it would be more interesting to determine what happens when DNA damage cannot be repaired. Are there gross effects when progenitors accumulate unrepaired damage sites? Because regeneration can occur multiple times, does accumulated DNA damage impact subsequent regeneration events? This might be achieved through pharmacological inhibition of ATM which is the kinase that phosphorylates H2AX and marks DNA damage sites. Again, this would be unique to regeneration and be of interest to the regeneration field as well as the general stem cell field to look at the consequences of genotoxic stress on progenitor exhaustion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises many interesting aspects of how DNA damage could affect</p><p>regeneration. However, our current study tries to dissect the DNA damage response</p><p>events occurring naturally during regeneration without challenging the process</p><p>externally (i.e., inducing DNA damage with UV or other means. It is known that gamma</p><p>irradiation blocks regenerationâfor example, Butler 1938). For instance, when we use an Eya2 inhibitor, DNA damage is observed, which is accompanied by apoptosis and slower regeneration rates. To strengthen the DNA damage response aspect in relation to tissue regeneration, we pharmacologically inhibited Chk1/2, which are kinases playing roles in mediating the G1/S and G2/M transitions. We found that limb regeneration is severely impaired with Chk1/2 inhibition. Interestingly, G1/S and G2/M transitions were also found to be impaired in our <italic>eya2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> blastemas.</p><p>In terms of DNA damage in progenitor cells: our study indicates that blastema cells repair their DNA during regeneration and that cells entering the cell cycle have increased levels of Î³-H2AX. There are no data supporting that DNA damage is accumulated during regeneration or how is this altered in subsequent regeneration events. These studies, while they would be quite interesting, are beyond the scope of our current study. Our goal here was test whether DNA damage response is important for regeneration, and, to accomplish that, we challenged the process by removing one of its components and analyzed the effects after a single regenerative episode. We feel that at 7 figures, 11 supplementary figures, and additional supplementary data files, embarking on this question within this work is not feasible. However, we look forward to it being addressed in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
