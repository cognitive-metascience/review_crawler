which single nucleotide polymorphism has recently been associated with obesity in humans. In this report, we provide converging evidence indicating that a splice variant isoform of the <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA is expressed and translated by some POMC and GABAergic-neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). We have demonstrated that the ARC ACBD7 isoform was produced and processed into a bioactive peptide referred to as nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN) in response to catabolic signals. We have characterized NDN as a potent anorexigenic signal acting through an uncharacterized endozepine G protein-coupled receptor and subsequently via the melanocortin system. Our results suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons participate in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic control exerted on food intake and energy expenditure by the leptin-melanocortin pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11742.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11742.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11742.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity is an increasingly common problem worldwide. To treat it effectively, we must understand how the body controls how much food a person consumes and how much energy they expend. The hypothalamus is one region of the brain that plays a critical role in regulating this energy balance. Some of the neurons in the hypothalamus can change their activity when they detect satiety hormones including the leptin, which is produced by fat cells and suppresses appetite. However, it is not clear exactly how the neurons respond to leptin and other energy-related signals.</p><p>Recent studies have linked the gene that encodes a protein called ACBD7 with obesity, and showed that it is one of the genes that is overexpressed in neurons that are sensitive to leptin. Now, Lanfray et al. have discovered a population of neurons that produce a new variant of the protein in the hypothalamus of mice. When this protein variant matures, it can be cut down to form a small protein-like molecule called NDN. Further experiments showed that leptin stimulates the production of both the new ABCD7 variant and NDN.</p><p>Lanfray et al. then injected mice that had been denied food for a several hours with NDN. The injected mice ate less than untreated mice, and burn more energy.</p><p>NDN appears to form part of the signaling pathway through which leptin signals to the hypothalamus to control appetite. In the future, creating mice in which the activity of the gene that encodes ACBD7 can be easily disrupted could help to reveal more about how the hypothalamus helps to control energy balance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11742.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11742.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>arcuate nucleus</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>leptin signaling</kwd><kwd>melanocortin system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Program in Obesity/Healthy Body Weight Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caron</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007476</institution-id><institution>Canadian Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caron</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foundation of the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Obesity axis fund 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating Grant MOP-142361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating Grant MOP-119436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2014-06721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Acyl-CoA binding domain-containing 7 (<italic>Acbd7</italic>) gene is expressed in the hypothalamus, encodes a peptide that suppresses appetite, increases metabolic rate and interacts with the leptin-melanocortin system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The understanding of the complex brain controls of food intake and energy expenditure is essential to unravel the causes of excess fat deposition and to envision effective strategies to prevent or reverse obesity. The control of food intake and energy expenditure, hence the regulation of energy balance, is assured by interconnected neurons of various brain regions, which include the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richard, 2015</xref>). Among all the hypothalamic nuclei, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which hosts proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) / neuropeptide (NPY) - producing neurons, has emerged as a prominent structure in the control of both food intake and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krashes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayer and Belsham, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>). POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons are major constituents of the melanocortin system, which is recognized to genuinely govern energy balance regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Jonghe et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellacott and Cone, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). POMC neurons release α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which induces hypophagic and thermogenic effects, mainly through the stimulation of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone, 2006</xref>). AgRP has been described as an inverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chai et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haskell-Luevano and Monck, 2001</xref>) or biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buch et al., 2009</xref>) agonist of this receptor. In this context, the understanding of the mechanisms whereby the melanocortin regulate energy homeostasis is critical to unravel the “physiopathology” of obesity.</p><p>Evidence has accumulated in recent years, which suggests that endozepines (EZs) could play a role in the regulation of energy balance. EZs are described as glial endogenous peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tonon et al., 1990</xref>), which are derived from the diazepam-binding inhibitor/Acyl-CoA binding protein (<italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mogensen et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrero et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corda et al., 1984</xref>), and which include DBI/ACBP itself, the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). EZs were initially characterized for their ability to displace benzodiazepines from their binding sites (i.e. the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>-R) and the translocator protein (TSPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrero et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Slobodyansky et al., 1989</xref>). Recently, ODN emerged as endogenous modulator of the brain melanocortin signalling pathway and as a potential actor in the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanfray et al., 2013</xref>), by acting via an uncharacterized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">do Rego et al., 2007</xref>). Further supporting the role of <italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic> products in energy balance, a study conducted in humans by Comuzzie and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comuzzie et al., 2012</xref>), indicates that <italic>DBI/ACBP</italic> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with obesity, supporting the relevance of the DBI/ACBP production in energy homeostasis. Interestingly, Comuzzie and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comuzzie et al., 2012</xref>) also identified a SNP in a well-conserved paralog gene of the <italic>DBI/ACBP</italic>, referred as Acyl-CoA binding domain containing 7 (<italic>ACBD7</italic>), as associated to obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comuzzie et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ACBD7</italic> could be involved in energy homeostasis through encoding products related to EZs.</p><p>The present study aimed at investigating the role of <italic>Acbd7</italic> in energy homeostasis in mice. We hypothesised a role for <italic>Acbd7</italic> and its encoded products in the control of energy intake and energy expenditure through modulating the networks genuinely involved in energy homeostasis, including the leptin-melanocortin circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA sequence and hypothalamic expression of ACBD7</title><p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis indicates that the <italic>Acbd7</italic> gene is a well-conserved paralog gene of the <italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>), that could also lead to the production of bioactive fragments in several vertebrate species, including human and rodent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b,c</xref>).

Significant hybridization signal was observed in the ARC and PVH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). No labelling was observed when the <italic>Acbd7</italic> cDNA specific sense riboprobe was used (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the <italic>Acbd7</italic> riboprobe.</p><p>We also demonstrated that hypothalamic cells could translate the <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA into ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and to process it into a 19-amino-acid fragment (ACBD7<sub>89 (34-52)</sub>) that we named nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN). Western blot experiments, using immuno-purified ACBD7 specific antibody, revealed the presence in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of a single band of 10 kDa, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), confirming that ACBD7 was endogenously produced in the MBH. In order to establish the ability of hypothalamic cells to process ACBD7<sub>89</sub> into NDN, we performed multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) investigations. This protocol performed on mice MBH extracts, using synthetic NDN as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), indicated that endogenous NDN was found in the hypothalamic lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), thus confirming that the ACBD7<sub>89</sub> isoform is produced but also processed in the mouse brain.</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis performed using the ACBD7-specific antibody revealed that ACBD7 labelling was not observed without colchicine or 3-methyladenin (3-MA) pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Double immunostaining performed on brain sections of colchicine-treated mice revealed that ACBD7 was not stained in glial cells (GFAP) in the MBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>). We also observed that ACBD7 was stained in some ARC POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i,j</xref>) and some vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m,n</xref>) in 3-MA-treated mice, indicating that ACBD7 is predominantly produced by neurons in the MBH. However, investigation performed on colchicine-treated mice revealed no apparent ACBD7 staining in NPY neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k,l</xref>).</p><p>Since ACBD7<sub>89</sub> appeared produced and processed by neurons of the ARC, whose involvement in energy homeostasis has been acknowledged, we investigated whether the whole body energy variations could affect the <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA levels as well as the production of ACBD7 and its maturation into NDN. We observed that 18 hr of fasting was sufficient to reduce <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA levels in the ARC of control mice by about 50%, whereas refeeding (2h) restored <italic>Acbd7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>). Notably, no effect of fasting or even refeeding challenge was observed on Acbd7 mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1p</xref>). Additionally, western blot analysis performed on MBH extract using fasted mice as controls, indicated that refeeding (6h) increased the protein levels of ACBD7 by about 3 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1q,r</xref>), suggesting that both <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA and ACBD7 protein levels in the ARC correlated with the body energy status. Thereafter, we assessed by MRM-MS the impact of refeeding challenge on the maturation of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> into NDN, within the MBH. Consistently with our previous results, the MBH levels of NDN increased 2 fold after 2 hr of refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1s</xref>), suggesting that production of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and its processing into NDN was influenced by the energy status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of NDN on food intake and energy expenditure</title><p>To address the impact of ACBD7 maturation products on feeding behaviour, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of graded doses of NDN on food intake and compared it with that of the ACBD7<sub>88</sub>-derived peptide ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub>. We also tested the effect of the C-terminal octapeptide of NDN, i.e. the NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> (ACBD7<sub>89 (45-52)</sub>). The injections were done in fasted mice. We observed that all injected compounds led to anorexigenic effects that were seen as early as 30 min after injection. However, dose/response experiments indicate that the optimal concentrations to cause hypophagia differed for each peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Indeed, a potent inhibition of food intake was observed in mice administrated with 10 ng (5.1 10<sup>–12</sup> mol) of NDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), while this effect was only achieved when 100 ng (5.3 10<sup>–11</sup> mol) of the ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> fragment were icv-injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Consistently, NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub>, the common C-terminal octapeptide of ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> and NDN was efficient for doses as low as 5 ng (5.6 10<sup>–12</sup> mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that the biological activity of the ACBD7-derived peptides is ensured by this well-conserved fragment. Furthermore, we observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> was not present 24 hr after the icv injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, comparison of the efficiency of each peptide, 3 hr after injection, revealed that NDN as well as NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> are both 10 times more potent than ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub>, in reducing food intake by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We also monitored the energy expenditure after acute NDN (10 ng) icv injection in fasted mice. NDN increased the energy expenditure in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>), while increasing the O<sub>2</sub> consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), without affecting the respiratory quotient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>) or the physical activity pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>), over 6 hr following the icv injection. Consistently with those results, experiments performed on fasted mice also revealed that acute icv injection of NDN (10 ng) led to significant increase in the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (<italic>Ucp1</italic>) mRNA level in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), 4 hr after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>), thus suggesting that NDN might stimulate thermogenesis in mice.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11742.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of NDN on food intake and energy expenditure.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) Effects of icv injection of graded doses of NDN (<bold>a</bold>), ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> (<bold>b</bold>), and NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> C-terminal fragment (<bold>c</bold>) on cumulative food intake in 18 hr-fasted mice.

Converging evidence indicating that the MC4R is the prominent melanocortin receptor in the hypothalamic regulation of whole body energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler and Cone, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seeley et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellacott and Cone, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richard, 2015</xref>), led us to evaluate the potential involvement of the MC4R signalling pathway in the effect of NDN. We observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by the icv injection of NDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>) was blocked by the injection of the MC4R-specific antagonist (HS024—100 ng). Consistently, our investigations also revealed that the icv injection of NDN failed to induce anorexigenic effects in MC4R knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), further confirming the involvement of the melanocortin system and more specifically the MC4R as a relay in the anorexigenic effect of NDN. Additionally, investigation performed using mice hypothalamic explants revealed that NDN increases the release of the POMC-derived peptide, α-MSH, by 50% times after 45 min of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). We also investigated the impact of intra-MBH injection of NDN on food intake. We observed that NDN injection in the MBH led to a significant reduction in food intake for the first 5 hr following the central administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>), suggesting that the anorexigenic effect of NDN is relayed by the activation of POMC neurons.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11742.023</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The melanocortin system relayes the anorexigenic effects of NDN.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>i</bold>) <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analysis of <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA levels in the mediobasal hypothalamic sections.

In that regard, we investigated whether NDN could contribute to the hypothalamic leptin signalling. We examined ACBD7 and NDN levels in the hypothalamus of fasted mice icv-injected with leptin (2 µg) using both Western blot and MS-MRM. We observed that the hypothalamic level of ACBD7 was increased more than 3 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>) while levels of NDN were increased by around 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) only 2 hr after the icv injection, suggesting that both ACBD7 and NDN levels are dynamically regulated by the leptin in the ARC. We observed that the anorexigenic effect induced by the icv injection of leptin was partially blunted by the co-injection of the LV-1075 (1000 ng; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), while it was totally abolished by the co-injection of HS024 (100 ng; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) alone or with LV-1075 (1000 ng; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

This study also reveals that a splice variant of the <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to catabolic signals. This splice variant encoded a protein referred as ACBD7<sub>89</sub> which is processed into a bioactive 19-amino-acid fragment, that we called NDN (i.e. ACBD7<sub>89 (34-52)</sub>). Furthermore, our experiments performed in mice indicate that NDN constitutes a anorexigenic peptide, seemingly acting through an uncharacterized EZ GPCR receptor and subsequently through a pathway involving the MC4R signalling. Finally, this work underlines the potential involvement of the ARC ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons, in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway as well as in the endogenous control of energy homeostasis.</p><p>At the time this study was initiated, the only information regarding the expression of <italic>Acbd7</italic> in the mouse brain consisted in microarray data provides by the Brainstars database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brainstars.org/probeset/1430107_at?hide=1">http://brainstars.org/probeset/1430107_at?hide=1</ext-link>). Here we confirm that <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA is found in selective regions in the mouse CNS. Those regions include the accumbens nucleus (Acb), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), supraoptic nucleus (SON), PVN and ARC, which represent structures known to be involved in various behavioural and physiological regulation processes, including energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richard, 2015</xref>). The distribution of <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA contrasts with that of <italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic> mRNA, which is widely distributed in the rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tonon et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouet-Smih et al., 1992</xref>). Our results also reveal that the unexpected splice variant isoform of <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA (i.e. <italic>Acbd7</italic>-002), which produces a 89 amino acid-containing protein (ACBD7<sub>89</sub>), is expressed in the mouse brain. Interestingly, the additional glycine in the resulting ACBD7<sub>89</sub> protein sequence, is also present in the rat ACBD7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_001119551.1">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_001119551.1</ext-link>), suggesting that this amino acid is relevant for the biological functions of NDN in rodents.</p><p>Our western blot experiments indicate that ACBD7 is produced in the mouse CNS. Furthermore, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses suggest that, as for the DBI/ACBP, ACBD7<sub>89</sub> is likely to be cleaved by tryptic digestion into shorter fragments such as NDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrero et al., 1984</xref>). MRM-MS experiments further indicated that endogenous NDN was found in mouse MBH lysates, confirming that hypothalamic cells are capable of processing ACBD7<sub>89</sub> isoform into shorter fragments. This result further underlines that maturation processes of ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and DBI/ACBP, which lead to the production of NDN and ODN, respectively, have been well conserved during the evolution, suggesting that both maturation products have essential physiological functions. Nonetheless, our investigation does not allow for excluding the endogenous production of the ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> fragment in the mouse CNS. Finally, given the structure homology between ACBD7 and DBI/ACBP, and specifically the conservation of the Lys<sup>18</sup> in the ACBD7 sequence, one can argue that brain cells could have the ability to produce several TTN-like compounds consisting of ACBD7<sub>88 (18-51)</sub> and ACBD7<sub>89 (18-52)</sub>. Likewise, considering the marked selective pressure that have occurred on those two paralog genes, future investigations will be important in assessing the ability of ACBD7 to act as an acyl-CoA carrier, as is for DBI/ACBP.</p><p>Previous investigations have also characterized <italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic>, as exclusively produced by glial cells in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tong et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tonon et al., 1990</xref>). However no information regarding the nature of <italic>Acbd7</italic>-expressing cells was available prior to our investigation. Using a double immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach, we showed that ACBD7 appeared to be exclusively produced by neuronal cells of the MBH. This result indicates that, in addition to glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tonon et al., 1990</xref>), neurons are also able to produce ODN-like compounds. Our study, which mainly focused on the ARC, further indicated that ACBD7 is produced by some POMC neurons, as well as by some GABAergic neurons. Our investigation also revealed that ACBD7 is not produced by NPY/AgRP/GABAergic neurons. Altogether these results suggest that ACBD7 is produced by some POMC neurons and GABAergic neurons distinct from the NPY/GABAergic neurons.</p><p>Interestingly, a previous study conducted on astrocytes reported that the release of the DBI-derived fragment ODN, which does not contain signal peptide, involved an autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loomis et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, 3-MA, a potent inhibitor of the autophagosome formation was shown to inhibit degradation of DBI/ACBP leading to its accumulation. In our study, we did not observe immunolabeling of ACBD7 without prior treatment with either colchicine or 3-MA. These results suggest that similar to DBI/ACBP, ACBD7 is likely processed into NDN and secreted in vivo by an autophagosome-based unconventional secretory pathway.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Acbd7</italic> (and the production of its NDN fragment) in the ARC provides a neuroanatomical support for a role of this gene in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance. Further supporting this role are our data, which show that <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA levels, as well as the production of ACBD7 and NDN, correlate with the energy homeostasis status in the ARC.</p><p>To further substantiate the role of <italic>Acdb7</italic> in energy homeostasis, we assessed the effects NDN on food intake and energy expenditure and demonstrated the anorectic and thermogenic effects of this peptide. Moreover, our investigation reveals that NDN is more potent than ACBD7<sub>88 (34-51)</sub> in reducing food intake, which suggests that the additional glycine of the ACBD7<sub>89</sub> sequence contributes to the biological activity of the ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-derived peptides. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the anorexigenic effect of NDN appears to be stronger than that of ODN in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Mateos-Verchere et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">do Rego et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, our investigations also reveal, as it has already been described for ODN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Mateos-Verchere et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">do Rego et al., 2007</xref>, ), that the C-terminal octapeptide of NDN, also acts as potent anorexigenic peptide. Furthermore, the anorexigenic effect of NDN<sub>(12-19)</sub> was not observed 24 hr after icv injection, suggesting that the half-life of NDN-related peptides is short in vivo. In addition, we also observed that dose response investigations performed with either NDN or its related peptides resulted in a U-shaped dose response curve, suggesting that high concentration of NDN can non-specifically stimulate hypothalamic orexigenic pathways. Additionally, NDN induced an increase in energy expenditure in fasted mice, further supporting the role of this peptide in energy homeostasis.</p><p>Pharmacological experiments performed in mice have demonstrated that the anorexigenic effect of ODN is relayed by the activation of a GPCR, still uncharacterized distinct from the classical benzodiazepine/EZ receptors (i.e. the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R and the TSPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">do Rego et al., 2007</xref>). The present results indicate that the anorexigenic effect of NDN is relayed by neither the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R nor the TSPO, suggesting that even though NDN could bind classical EZ receptor, the anorexigenic effect of this ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-derived peptide seems not to be relayed by those receptors. In contrast, our investigation also revealed that the anorexigenic effect of NDN was blunted by the co-injection of the antagonist of the EZ GPCR, suggesting that similarly to ODN, NDN is also capable to act via the EZ GPCR to induce its effect. Further investigations will be necessary to fully decipher the identity of the uncharacterized EZ GPCR and to assess the ability of ACBD7-derived peptides to bind the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R and the TSPO.</p><p>From the potential neuroanatomical association of ACBD7 with POMC neurons in ARC, we were interested in further studying the link between ACBD7 and the melanocortin system. Using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis, we demonstrate that the icv injection of NDN increases the ARC levels of <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA without affecting <italic>Agrp</italic> or <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA levels, which suggests that ARC ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons may directly activate POMC neurons. Additionally, using acute pharmacological blockade of the MC4R signalling pathway as well as the MC4R knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the anorexigenic effects of NDN were relayed via the melanocortin system. Furthermore, experiments performed on mice hypothalamic explants revealed that NDN was able to increase the secretion of α-MSH, suggesting that NDN is able to activate POMC neurons in the ARC. In addition, we demonstrated that intra-MBH injections of NDN induce strong anorexigenic effects. Altogether, these results strongly support that ARC ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic regulation of food intake and energy expenditure by acting on POMC neurons through releasing NDN. However, the full mechanisms whereby NDN modulates the melanocortin system tone have yet to be fully deciphered. The involvement of the melanocortin system in the action of NDN recapitulates that seen with ODN. Previous investigations performed in rodents have indeed revealed the ability of ODN to increase <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Compere et al., 2003</xref>) and the potential involvement of the MC4R receptor in the anorexigenic effect of the ODN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanfray et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because of the acknowledged role of the leptin - melanocortin association in energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goncalves et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill et al., 2010</xref>) and the involvement of the MC4R in the effects of NDN, we hypothesized that <italic>Acdb7</italic> neurons could be part of the leptin-melanocortin integrated pathway. In that respect, it is noteworthy that recent data indicated that leptin effects on the melanocortin system could be relayed through an uncharacterized class of ARC GABAergic cells diverging from POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balthasar et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van de Wall et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vong et al., 2011</xref>). Our results indicate that the icv injection of leptin led to an increase in the hypothalamic levels of both ACBD7 and NDN, supporting a connection between leptin and <italic>Acdb7</italic> neurons. In that context, we sought to determine the involvement of the endogenous NDN production as part of the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Investigations performed on <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed mice showed that the anorexigenic effect induced by an icv injection of leptin was partially blunted by the co-injection of the LV-1075, indicating that the hypothalamic activation of the EZ GPCR is part of the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the anorexigenic effect of icv injection of leptin is totally abolished by the co-injection of HS024, confirming that the melanocortin signalling pathway constitutes a major relay in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balthasar et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, no additional effects were seen when LV-1075 and HS024 were co-injected, suggesting that NDN relayed the anorexigenic effect of leptin mainly through activating POMC neurons. Although, this result does not establish a direct link between NDN and leptin signalling, it nonetheless provides further evidence for such a link i.e. LV-1075 also blocked NDN anorectic action. It is noteworthy that the hypothalamic <italic>Dbi/Acbp</italic> mRNA level is unaffected by central injection of leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Compere et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that glial EZs (such as ODN) are not involved in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Moreover, our observations and speculations are in line with a recent report from the translating ribosome affinity purification analysis of hypothalamic LepR positive neurons, indicating that the <italic>Acbd7</italic> mRNA level is enriched by more than four times in hypothalamic neurons expressing the <italic>Lepr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>From the potential involvement of endogenous NDN production in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway, we were interested in further assessing the physiological involvement of endogenous NDN signalling pathway, as well as the impact of long-term exposure to NDN, on the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that NDN induced a significant reduction in body weight, which could be observed after two days of treatment, while it induced a transient inhibition of food intake that could only be seen on the second day of treatment, suggesting the involvement of compensatory mechanisms as previously shown in rodents for several anorexigenic neuropeptides including the α-MSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>) and the ODN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Mateos-Verchere et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, we observed that chronic pharmacological disruption of the EZ GPCR signalling induced a potent increase in both food intake and body weight, suggesting that the endogenous endozepines signalling pathway could be a part of the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Although, these results do not establish a direct link between endogenous production of NDN and the hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis, they nonetheless provide further evidence for the involvement endozepines in this process. Additionally, it is noteworthy that single nucleotide polymorphism in both the DBI/ACBP and ACBD7 are linked with morbid obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comuzzie et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that these two genes are complementary involved in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies ACBD7<sub>89</sub> and its maturation product NDN as potential hypothalamic controllers of energy intake and energy expenditure. Our research further indicates that NDN acts as a significant anorexigenic signal through the mediation of an uncharacterized EZs GPCR and via the melanocortin signalling pathway. This work and that from others also provides converging evidence suggesting that MBH ACBD7<sub>89</sub>-producing neurons are part of the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin system as well as a major actor in the hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>Adult male C57BL/6 mice weighting 25–30 g, and MC4R knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balthasar et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>) weighting 45–50 g, were housed under constant temperature (22°C) in a 12/12h light/dark cycle with free access to standard rodent chow (Teklab lab animal diet, Montreal, Canada) and drinking water.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Involvement of ACBD7 in the control of food intake and energy expenditure in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Palmiter, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have provided compelling evidence that a novel peptide derived from the <italic>Acbd7</italic> gene has potent inhibitory effects on food intake. The peptide appears to be produced in the novel class of neurons in the arcuate nucleus and acts on POMC neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three reviewers find the results describing the effects of this novel peptide on food intake as provocative and suitable for publication after attending to the following major issues that were raised.</p><p>1) The authors should provide good evidence that exogenous NDN peptide can dramatically affect food intake; however, more compelling evidence that NDN peptide is necessary for regulation of food intake is necessary.</p><p>2) More data related to the duration of NDN effects on food intake and the consequences of repeated injections on body weight are requested.</p><p>3) The authors should examine the possibility that ACBD7 is co-expressed in other (non-POMC, non-AgRP) populations of ARC neurons that have been described in recent literature.</p><p>4) Although, the GPCR through which NDN acts is unknown, electrophysiological experiments showing a direct action on of NDN on POMC neurons would provide important mechanistic information; authors should include such experiments if possible. The authors should also do their best to respond to the other comments raised by the reviewers that will improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors of this paper show that the <italic>Acbd7</italic> gene is differentially spliced in the hypothalamus to give rise to a 19-amino acid peptide (NDN) instead of the typical 18 amino acid peptide (ODN). The precursor protein is made by POMC neurons but not by AGRP/NPY neurons; its expression is reduced by fasting and induced by feeding. The peptide, results in pronounced anorexia when injected into the brain (icv) that depends on melanocortin signaling. Blockade of either the receptor for NDN or the melanocortin MC4 receptor blocks the anorectic effect of NDN. The results clearly establish the anorectic effect of NDN and begin to establish the neurons involved; however, there are several issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>1) The data establish that NDN is sufficient to reduce food intake; however, it is equally important to know whether it is necessary. The only experiment that addresses that issue is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, in which the authors show that the EZ GPCR antagonist (LV-1075) blunts the anorexic effect of leptin. The problem with this experiment is that leptin affects many different neuronal populations; thus, it is hard to draw firm conclusions about pathways. Comparing the effectiveness of LV-1075 with the MC4R antagonist (HS024) and the combination of the two would help establish the contribution of the melanocortin pathway to the anorexic effect. Another approach would be to see if LV-1075 would block a 5HT2c agonist-induced anorexia.</p><p>2) The paper presents several sets of dose-response histograms with various peptides. Many of the dose-response relationships appear to be &quot;U&quot; shaped – i.e. higher doses give less anorexia than middle doses. A comment on this phenomenon would be useful.</p><p>3) Also, because the peptides are of different molecular weights, it would be useful to show at least the descending portions of the dose-response curves in one graph and express the data in terms of picomoles peptide injected rather than micrograms. That way, the relative potency of the various peptides will become more obvious.</p><p>4) <italic>Acbd7</italic> protein does not appear to have a signal peptide; thus, it is worth discussing how the NDN is secreted from the cells that make it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Lanfray et al., the authors describe the identification of novel peptide product that has potential influences on food intake and energy homeostasis in mice. Specifically, they identify a nonadeca peptide (NDN) that is produced out of the ACBD7 gene product, which is regulated in its mRNA and protein expression depending on energy status. in vivo injection studies of the NDN reduces appetite and increases energy expenditure and suggesting this is mediated via interaction with the melanocortin and leptin system.</p><p>This is a comprehensive and well-designed study which identifies a potential new player in the complex regulatory circuitries that control energy homeostasis. However, it falls a bit short on providing detailed mechanistic insights.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>One interesting aspect of this new protein is the expression pattern which seems to be different from the classical players POMC and NPY/AGRP specifically in the Arc where there seems to be little or no overlap. It would be nice to see some attempts to more closely identifying these novel type of neurons e.g. are they GABAergic? Any other neuropeptide markers that are colocalised in these neurons, etc.?</p><p>While the inhibitory effect on food intake is sticking, it is only shown for the duration of 5 hours. How long does the effect last? Are they back to normal after 24 hours?</p><p>What are the chronic effects?</p><p>Is the mRNA expression of ACBD7 only altered in the ARC in response to food depravation/refeeding or are other nuclei (e.g. PVN) also affected?</p><p>Has IHC being performed on brain slices without colchicine injection e.g. can the peptide be seen in fibres and does this give any information to which other areas these 'novel' neurons projecting too?</p><p>While I am not demanding to perform this experiments ultimate proof of the functionality as a novel regulator of energy homeostasis will have to include some chronic models e.g. transgenics/KO's.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their current contribution Lanfray et al. investigate the role of ACBD7 on energy homeostasis and feeding. They reveal transcriptional and translation control of ACBD7 in the hypothalamus dependening on feeding state, with a pronounced upregulation upon refeeding. ACBD7 appears to be primarily expressed in the ARC and PVN. They also demonstrate, that ACBD7 is cleaved to a NDN peptide, and that also NDN increases upon refeeding. Functionally, icv injection of NDN suppresses refeeding, increases energy expenditure and BAT UCP1-expression. The anorexigenic effect of icv applied NDN relies on a yet uncharacterized GPCR, but not on GABA-R-signaling. Finally, the anorexigenic effect of NDN is abrogated upon application of an MC4R-antagonist and leptin increases ACBD7-expression.</p><p>Overall, the experiments appear well performed and support the conclusions drawn by the authors. The findings are novel and interesting. However, a few parts of the study present interesting findings, which are correlative, but not fully causally linked. Important questions, which should be addressed include.</p><p>1) What is the exact quantitative proportion of POMC-cells expressing ACBD7?</p><p>2) Does NDN directly excite POMC-neurons. This should be addressed through investigating the effect of NDN on firing properties of identified POMC-neurons.</p><p>3) Given that ACBD7 appears to be regulated by leptin, it should be addressed to which extend NDN-action contributes to leptin's anorexigenic action, thus linking both aspects of the study. Here, the effect of blocking the NDN-activated GPCR on leptin's ability to suppress feeding and to evoke neuroactivation in the PVN (via c_Fos staining) should be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11742.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>Three reviewers find the results describing the effects of this novel peptide on food intake as provocative and suitable for publication after attending to the following major issues that were raised.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors should provide good evidence that exogenous NDN peptide can dramatically affect food intake; however, more compelling evidence that NDN peptide is necessary for regulation of food intake is necessary.</italic> </p><p>In order to further demonstrate the role of NDN on energy balance we have added data demonstrating that repeated icv injections of NDN reduce body weight gain (see response to point # 2, below). Additionally, we carried out new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and Figure 5—figure supplement 5) to examine the impact of repeated injections of LV-1075, an antagonist of the uncharacterized endozepine metabotropic receptor, also an apparent receptor of NDN.

Moreover, we have added new data, which show that repeated icv injections NDN over 5 days led to a consistent reduction in body weight while transiently reducing food intake. These results have been added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and have also been discussed (Discussion).</p><p><italic>3) The authors should examine the possibility that ACBD7 is co-expressed in other (non-POMC, non-AgRP) populations of ARC neurons that have been described in recent literature.</italic> </p><p>To address this major point, we have performed additional immunohistochemistry experiments, which reveal that ACBD7 is colocalized with the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in the ARC. This result indicates that ACBD7 is produced by both GABAergic and POMC neurons in the ARC. We have added these findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and elaborated upon our findings in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) Although, the GPCR through which NDN acts is unknown, electrophysiological experiments showing a direct action on of NDN on POMC neurons would provide important mechanistic information; authors should include such experiments if possible.

We have added a comment in Discussion, which suggests a potential involvement of an unconventional secretory pathway in the release of NDN, as it has been proposed for the DBI/ACBP-derived peptide ODN.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: In the manuscript by Lanfray et al., the authors describe the identification of novel peptide product that has potential influences on food intake and energy homeostasis in mice. Specifically, they identify a nonadeca peptide (NDN) that is produced out of the ACBD7 gene product, which is regulated in its mRNA and protein expression depending on energy status.</italic> in vivo <italic>injection studies of the NDN reduces appetite and increases energy expenditure and suggesting this is mediated via interaction with the melanocortin and leptin system. This is a comprehensive and well-designed study which identifies a potential new player in the complex regulatory circuitries that control energy homeostasis. However, it falls a bit short on providing detailed mechanistic insights. Comments: One interesting aspect of this new protein is the expression pattern which seems to be different from the classical players POMC and NPY/AGRP specifically in the Arc where there seems to be little or no overlap. It would be nice to see some attempts to more closely identifying these novel type of neurons e.g. are they GABAergic? Any other neuropeptide markers that are colocalised in these neurons, etc.?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this concern to our attention. We performed additional immunohistochemistry experiments, which reveal that ACBD7 is partially colocalized with the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in the ARC. We have added these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and have also added a comment in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>While the inhibitory effect on food intake is sticking, it is only shown for the duration of 5 hours.

Reviewer #3: In their current contribution Lanfray et al. investigate the role of ACBD7 on energy homeostasis and feeding. They reveal transcriptional and translation control of ACBD7 in the hypothalamus dependening on feeding state, with a pronounced upregulation upon refeeding. ACBD7 appears to be primarily expressed in the ARC and PVN. They also demonstrate, that ACBD7 is cleaved to a NDN peptide, and that also NDN increases upon refeeding. Functionally, icv injection of NDN suppresses refeeding, increases energy expenditure and BAT UCP1-expression. The anorexigenic effect of icv applied NDN relies on a yet uncharacterized GPCR, but not on GABA-R-signaling. Finally, the anorexigenic effect of NDN is abrogated upon application of an MC4R-antagonist and leptin increases ACBD7-expression. Overall, the experiments appear well performed and support the conclusions drawn by the authors. The findings are novel and interesting. However, a few parts of the study present interesting findings, which are correlative, but not fully causally linked. Important questions, which should be addressed include. 1) What is the exact quantitative proportion of POMC-cells expressing ACBD7?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this information will be relevant. However, our immunohistological analyses is limited in terms of the specific quantification of ACBD7-labelled cells. We therefore prefer not to include an approximate value of these cells in our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Does NDN directly excite POMC-neurons. This should be addressed through investigating the effect of NDN on firing properties of identified POMC-neurons.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot perform electrophysiological experiments. Please see our comments in response to the point number 4 of the essential revision above.</p><p> <italic>3) Given that ACBD7 appears to be regulated by leptin, it should be addressed to which extend NDN-action contributes to leptin's anorexigenic action, thus linking both aspects of the study. Here, the effect of blocking the NDN-activated GPCR on leptin's ability to suppress feeding and to evoke neuroactivation in the PVN (via c_Fos staining) should be addressed.</italic></p><p>Indeed, we have already performed experiments looking to establish the potential involvement of NDN in the anorexigenic effects induced by leptin. These results were originally present in the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. Additionally, we have performed new experiments comparing the effectiveness of LV-1075 and HS024 in blocking the anorexigenic effect of a central injection of leptin.
