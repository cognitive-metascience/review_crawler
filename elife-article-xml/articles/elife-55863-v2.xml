of social isolation on behaviour and brain function. As in humans and other social species, early social deprivation reduced social preference in juvenile zebrafish. Whole-brain functional maps of anti-social isolated (lonely) fish were distinct from anti-social (loner) fish found in the normal population. These isolation-induced activity changes revealed profound disruption of neural activity in brain areas linked to social behaviour, social cue processing, and anxiety/stress. Several of the affected regions are modulated by serotonin, and we found that social preference in isolated fish could be rescued by acutely reducing serotonin levels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Socialising is good for people’s mental health and wellbeing. The connections and relationships that we form can make us more resilient and healthier. Researchers also know that prolonged periods of social isolation, and feeling lonely, can be detrimental to our health, especially in early childhood. The paradox is that loneliness often results in an even lower desire for social contact, leading to further isolation. But not everyone craves social contact. Some people prefer to be alone and feel more comfortable avoiding social interaction.</p><p>Zebrafish display the same social preferences. This, along with their transparent brains, makes them a useful model to study the links between social behaviour and brain activity. Like humans, zebrafish are social animals, with most fish taking a strong liking to social interactions by the time they are a few weeks old. A small number of ‘loner’ fish, however, prefer to avoid interacting with their siblings or tank mates. And so, if loneliness quells the desire for more social contact, the question becomes, does isolation turn otherwise social fish into loners?</p><p>Here, Tunbak et al. use zebrafish to study how social isolation changes brain activity and behaviour. Social fish were isolated from others in the tank for a few days. These so-called ‘lonely fish’ were then allowed back in contact with the other fish. This revealed that, after isolation, previously social fish did avoid interacting with others.</p><p>With this experimental set-up, Tunbak et al. also compared the brains of lonely and loner fish. When fish that prefer social interaction were deprived of social contact, they had increased activity in areas of the brain related to stress and anxiety. These lonely fish became anxious and very sensitive to stimuli; and their brain activity suggested that social interaction became overwhelming rather than rewarding. Positively, the lonely fish quickly recovered their normal, social behaviour when given a drug that reduces anxiety.</p><p>This work provides a glimpse into how human behaviour could be affected by lengthy periods in isolation. These results suggest that humans could feel anxious upon returning to normal life after spending a long time alone. Moreover, the findings show the impact that social interaction and isolation can have on the young, developing brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social behaviour</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>Buspirone</kwd><kwd>isolation</kwd><kwd>preoptic area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202465/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dreosti</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090843/F/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kampff</surname><given-names>Adam Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social isolation increases anti-social behaviour by altering activity in brain areas related to anxiety, stress, and reward.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social preference behaviour, the drive for individuals to identify and approach members of their own species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rogers-Carter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Winslow, 2003</xref>), is a fundamental component of all social behaviour. We previously found that most zebrafish develop a strong social preference by 2–3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dreosti et al., 2015</xref>), yet we also found a small number (~10%) of ‘loner’ fish that were averse to social cues. A similar diversity of individual social preferences has been found in many species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sloan Wilson et al., 1994</xref>). Loneliness, undesired isolation from social interaction, has been linked to a reduction in social preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engeszer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shams et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore asked whether the socially-averse <italic>loner</italic> fish found in the normal population would show a similar behavioural phenotype and neuronal activity to socially-averse <italic>lonely</italic> fish raised in isolation. To answer this question, we compared the behavioural and functional responses of isolated fish to controls during viewing of conspecifics. This comparison found that isolation induces patterns of brain activity that are not present in the normal population. We then asked if we could rescue the aversive behaviour of isolated fish. Since some of the highly activated areas in isolated fish are serotoninergic, we used Buspirone, a 5HT1A receptor agonist. These findings will have important implications for how we understand and treat the impact of social isolation.</p><p>Prolonged periods of social isolation are particularly detrimental to humans during early development. However, even brief periods of social isolation have been shown to impact mental and physical health. We therefore tested two models of social isolation, Full (fish raised completely without social interaction) and Partial (fish isolated for 48 hr prior to behavioural testing). Each experiment comprised two sessions, 15 min of acclimation to the chamber followed by 15 min of exposure to two size matched sibling fish that were not isolated. To quantify social preference, we calculated a visual preference index (VPI) that compares the amount of time fish spend in the chamber nearest the conspecifics versus the opposite chamber where they are visually isolated from social cues (see Materials and methods). Full social isolation (Fi) caused a significant decrease in social preference relative to normally raised sibling controls (C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left and middle panel: C vs Fi, p=8.3e<sup>−8</sup>, Mann-Whitney). Specifically, there was an increase in the number of individuals that had a large negative VPI. We therefore decided to divide the fish into three sociality groups: a) anti-social (-S) fish with VPIs below −0.5; b) pro-social (+S) fish with VPIs above +0.5; c) non-social fish with −0.5 &lt; VPI &lt; +0.5. Fish that underwent Partial isolation (Pi), exhibited an intermediate, yet highly significant, change in social preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel: C vs Pi, p=2.5e<sup>−8</sup>, Mann-Whitney).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation alters social preference behavior and swimming activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histograms of all the VPIs during the social cue period across different conditions: controls (C, left), full isolation (Fi, middle), and partial isolation (Pi, right).

We then divided fish into groups based on their social preference. Interestingly, anti-social fully and partially isolated fish showed very similar movement activity compared to anti-social controls during the acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> left: C (-S) vs Fi (-S), p=0.17 Mann-Whitney; C (-S) vs Pi (-S) p=0.23 Mann-Whitney) and during the social viewing session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> left: C (-S) vs Fi (-S), p=0.48 Mann-Whitney; C (-S) vs Pi (-S) p=0.10 Mann-Whitney). The pro-social isolated fish, which also exhibited a reduction in activity relative to controls during the acclimation session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> right: C (-S) vs Fi (-S), p=8.0e<sup>−5</sup> Mann-Whitney; C (-S) vs Pi (-S) p=1.0e<sup>−7</sup> Mann-Whitney), instead showed similar activity relative to controls during social viewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> right: C (-S) vs Fi (-S), p=0.02 Mann-Whitney; C (-S) vs Pi (-S) p=0.14 Mann-Whitney). In addition, we noticed that all isolated fish behaved qualitatively differently, exhibiting prolonged periods of quiescence (freezing) even when observing conspecifics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Freezing is a hallmark of anxiety-like behaviour observed in many species, and reported in zebrafish exposed to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giacomini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shams et al., 2018</xref>), including periods of social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shams et al., 2017</xref>). In order to quantify freezing behaviour, we measured the percentage of time spent in continuous periods (&gt;3 s) without motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). We found that both fully and partially isolated fish exhibited significantly more freezing than controls during the acclimation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> left: C vs Fi, p=3.4e<sup>−16</sup> Mann-Whitney; C vs Pi, p=2.8e<sup>−5</sup> Mann-Whitney), and that this increase relative to controls persisted for fully isolated fish during social viewing, but was reduced in partially isolated fish, perhaps representing some recovery during the 15 min of social interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> left: C vs Fi, p=6.3e<sup>−13</sup> Mann-Whitney; C vs Pi, p=0.03 Mann-Whitney). When we compared freezing behaviour of groups with similar social preference, we found, as expected, that anti-social fish exhibited increased freezing during social viewing regardless of rearing condition. However, pro-social fully isolated fish also showed increased freezing during social viewing, suggesting that they were not engaged in typical social interaction, but rather remained immobile on the side with the conspecifics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> right).</p><p>The behavioural similarities between anti-social isolated (<italic>lonely</italic>) and anti-social control (<italic>loner</italic>) fish led us to hypothesize that isolation might simply predispose fish to the same anti-social state found in the normal population. If this is the case, neural activity of anti-social isolated and anti-social control fish should be similar when presented with social cues. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole-brain two-photon imaging of <italic>c-fos</italic> expression, an immediate early gene whose expression is associated with increased neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera and Robertson, 1996</xref>), in juvenile brains following testing in the social preference assay. Dissected brains were imaged with the dorsal surface down (bottom-up) to achieve clear views of the ventral brain structures that have been previously implicated in the social brain network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, also see Materials and methods). Volumes of 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 700 µm, with a voxel size of 1 × 1×3 µm, were acquired from 135 zebrafish brains across all experimental groups and registered to a reference brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marquart et al., 2017</xref>). These <italic>c-fos</italic> whole-brain functional maps were first normalised to a background intensity level (see Materials and methods) and then used to compare the neural activity patterns of different test groups. We compared the average activity map for each rearing/sociality condition with the average map acquired from similarly raised sibling fish that were placed in the behavioural assay for 30 min without any social cues (nsc, no social-cue). The resulting normalised difference stacks (e.g. (+S - nsc)/nsc) allowed us to identify changes in neural activity associated with exposure to a visual social cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional maps of the social brain in normal and isolated fish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the custom-built two-photon microscope used for acquiring whole-brain volumes of dorsal-down mounted fish brains (top panel).

We focused on areas that have been reported as social brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>) and show differences between our experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: C (+S and -S)). The caudal hypothalamus was differentially activated in pro- vs. anti-social control fish. A dorsal sub-region was significantly activated in pro-social controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: dHc - C (+S) vs C (nsc), p=0.007, Mann-Whitney), whereas it was inhibited, along with the adjacent ventral sub-region, in anti-social controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: vHc - C (-S) vs C (nsc), p=0.003, Mann-Whitney). The caudal hypothalamus is known to express high levels of serotonin and dopamine, as well as glutamate and histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaslin and Panula, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, a segregation into distinct dorsal and ventral areas of the caudal hypothalamus has already been shown for some of these markers, such as tyrosine hydroxylase 1 and 2, (Th1 and Th2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>) and we confirmed these previous results with immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> left), as well as for the dopamine and serotonin transporters, DAT and slc6a4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lillesaar, 2011</xref>). Changes in serotonin and dopamine levels have been widely documented in response to social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbina et al., 2012</xref>), viewing social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saif et al., 2013</xref>), and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shams et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shams et al., 2015</xref>). While the serotoninergic system has been linked to stress and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Backström and Winberg, 2017</xref>), the dopamine circuitry has been shown to regulate the reward system underlying social behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teles et al., 2013</xref>). Since the caudal hypothalamus expresses both of these neurotransmitters, and our data demonstrate a pattern of activation/inhibition that is distinct for pro- and anti-social fish, then this area could be crucial in regulating social preference.</p><p>The second social brain area we investigated was the preoptic area. Our data showed a similar activation pattern for anti-social and pro-social fish characterised by a small increase in the dorsal preoptic area (dPa) and a small decrease in the ventral preoptic area (vPa). However, only anti-social control fish showed a significant change in the ventral area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: C (-S) vs C (nsc), vPa p=0.003, Mann-Whitney). The activation of the preoptic area during social behaviour is consistent with previous literature in a number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>). This area has been shown to express several neuropeptides involved in social behaviour such as arginine/vasotocin and oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrichs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herget and Ryu, 2015</xref>). It was recently shown that oxytocin does not seem to be responsible for social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>) as mutants for oxytocin receptors shows no alteration in social preference, but rather reduced social recognition. Furthermore, injections of oxytocin do not have any effect on shoaling and interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Langen et al., 2015</xref>). The neuropeptide vasotocin, instead, has been shown to have a specific effect on reducing social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Langen et al., 2015</xref>) and not shoaling behaviour. This neuropeptide has also been shown to be involved in aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Teles et al., 2016</xref>) and stress by stimulating cortisol release.</p><p>We then compared the brain activity maps of anti- and pro-social control fish with fully and partially isolated fish. As described previously, anti-social control (<italic>loner</italic>) fish showed a behavioural phenotype very similar to anti-social isolated (<italic>lonely</italic>) fish. Therefore, we investigated whether their brain activity maps were also similar following the presentation of a social cue. Contrary to our hypothesis, <italic>c-fos</italic> functional maps of anti-social fully isolated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: Fi (-S)) revealed a completely different activity profile than their anti-social sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: C (-S)). The ventral sub-region of the caudal hypothalamus (vHc) of Fi (-S) fish was not inactivated, while the preoptic area was strongly activated in both the dorsal (dPa) and the ventral (vPa) regions, but significantly only in the dorsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: Fi (-S) vs Fi (nsc), p=0.006 dPa; p=0.07 vPa, Mann-Whitney). Furthermore, the pro-social fully isolated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: Fi (+S)), who exhibited an increase of freezes and reduced motility compared to control fish when viewing conspecifics, showed a similar activation to pro-social controls in the caudal hypothalamus, but increased activity in the dorsal preoptic area. Interestingly, the preoptic area was activated differently in pro-social and anti-social isolated fish, with only the dorsal preoptic area strongly activated in the pro-social group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: Fi (+S) vs Fi, p=0.04 vPa, p=0.002 dPa, Man-Whitney). These data suggest that long social isolation causes abnormal neural responses during viewing of social cues.</p><p>Furthermore, anti- and pro-social fish exposed to a brief isolation for only 48 hr prior to testing, showed similar functional activity changes to fully isolated fish, albeit less strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: Pi (-S) vs Pi (nsc), p=0.18 dHc; p=0.28 vHc; p=0.04 vPa; p=0.04 dPa, Mann-Whitney; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>: Pi (+S) vs Pi (nsc), p=0.17 dHc; p=0.05 vHc; p=0.007 vPa; p=0.006 dPa). Together with the behavioural data, this finding supports the idea that short term isolation is enough to induce brain activity changes similar to those observed following complete isolation, and strikingly different than those observed in anti-social controls.</p><p>We were next interested in understanding why social isolation promotes social aversion instead of increasing the drive for social interaction. An important clue was found in the pattern of brain activity changes that were unique to isolated fish. When we directly compared the normalised <italic>c-fos</italic> functional brain maps of isolated and control fish that were not exposed to social cues during the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we found a significant increase in two interesting areas; one associated with visual processing, the optic tectum, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McDowell et al., 2004</xref>]), and one involved in stress responses, the posterior tuberal nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Changes in baseline brain activity following isolation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of two areas that show strong c-fos activation in fully isolated fish independent of social stimuli (optic tectum and posterior tuberal nucleus (PTN)).

However, in fully isolated fish, there was already increased neuronal activity in the optic tectum in the absence of social cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top: Fi (nsc) vs C (nsc), p=0.0004, Mann-Whitney), suggesting that isolation increases visual sensitivity, as previously reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cacioppo et al., 2015</xref>). This increased sensitivity of fully isolated fish not presented with social cues was weaker in partially isolated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top: Pi (nsc) vs C (nsc), p=0.03, Mann-Whitney). However, a much larger increase in tectal activity was observed when pro-social partially isolated fish viewed conspecifics, revealing that some visual sensitization had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top: Pi (+S) vs C (+S), p=0.0002, Mann-Whitney). In addition, increased tectal activity was also present in both fully and partially isolated anti-social fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top: Fi (-S) vs C (-S), p=0.048; Pi (-S) vs C (-S), p=0.005, Mann-Whitney), even though these fish largely avoided the chamber with visual access to conspecifics.</p><p>We also observed isolation-related activity increases in the posterior tuberal nucleus, an area associated with stress responses in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>).

However, when prolonged, this heightened sensitivity results in an increase of stress and anxiety levels during social viewing that leads to an aversion for social stimuli.</p><p>To test our hypothesis that reducing anxiety could reverse the anti-social behaviour observed in isolated zebrafish, we acutely treated control and partially isolated fish with Buspirone, an agonist of the auto-inhibitory 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor. The choice of isolation duration was motivated by the intermediate behavioural and functional phenotype of partial isolation relative to normal-rearing and full isolation, which would allow us to more easily detect both positive and negative impacts of treatment on sociality. The choice of Buspirone was supported by the changes in activity observed in the caudal hypothalamus of isolated fish, and by the fact that the caudal hypothalamus and the preoptic area strongly express Htr1ab receptors, one of the two orthologues of the 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Norton et al., 2008</xref>). Buspirone has been shown to reduce anxiety in humans, mice, and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bencan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patel and Hillard, 2006</xref>). While it is not fully understood how Buspirone reduces anxiety, it has been shown to enhance social interaction of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">File and Seth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gould et al., 2011</xref>), sociability of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barba-Escobedo and Gould, 2012</xref>), and reduce social phobia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schneier et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Vliet et al., 1997</xref>).

We found that the isolated fish treated with Buspirone, while initially anti-social, would rapidly recover normal social preference behaviour within the first 5 min of exposure to social cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: C vs Pi (Buspirone), p=0.016, first minute; p=0.37, fourth minute, Mann-Whitney). In contrast, the VPIs of untreated isolated fish remained significantly lower than controls throughout the entire session. We next compared the time course of movement activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and found that it generally increased quickly throughout the first 5 min of the social viewing session. Notably, the activity of isolated fish treated with Buspirone was already at the level of controls from the start of the social viewing session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: C vs Pi (Buspirone), p=0.31, first minute, Mann-Whitney), which suggests that the recovery of normal movement activity, possibly as a result of reduced anxiety, precedes the recovery of normal social preference. Therefore, Buspirone’s impact on the rate of recovery of social preference indicates that it may do so by reducing anxiety, perhaps at the level of the preoptic and/or caudal hypothalamic area, allowing circuit plasticity to down-regulate the hypersensitivity to social stimuli acquired during the isolation period.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that <italic>lonely</italic> fish, which have been isolated from social cues and show anti-social behaviour, have a completely different functional response to social stimuli than <italic>loner</italic> fish, anti-social fish found in the normal population. In addition, the functional changes caused by social deprivation are consistent with an increase in anxiety resulting from hyper-sensitization to social stimuli, similar to the effects of isolation on humans. We could reverse isolation’s effects in zebrafish with an existing anxiolytic drug that acts on the monoaminergic system. Zebrafish will thus provide a powerful new tool for studying the impact of loneliness (isolation) on brain function and exploring different strategies for reducing, or even reversing, its harm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti- digoxigenin-POD, sheep, polyclonal Fab fragments</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich, Rouche</td><td>Roche, Cat# 11207733910, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514500">AB_514500</ext-link></td><td>1:3000</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>cFos _F</td><td>This paper</td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">CCGATACACTGCAAGCTGAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>cFos_R</td><td>This paper</td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ATTGCAGGGCTATGGAAGTG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Proteinase K</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# P6556-10MG</td><td>2 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay</td><td>TSA Plus Cyanine three system</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich, Perkin Elmer</td><td>Cat# NEL74401KT</td><td>Dilution 1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Buspirone hydrochloride</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# B7148-1G</td><td>30 uM and 50 uM</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Anaconda, Spyder</td><td>Anaconda (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</ext-link>)</td><td>Spyder, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017585">SCR_017585</ext-link></td><td>Version 4.0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>ANTs- Advanced Normalisation Tools</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004757">SCR_004757</ext-link></td><td>Version 2.1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>DAPI staining</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# <break/>D9564-10MG</td><td>1 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Slc6a4b RNA probe</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Norton et al., 2008</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>DAT RNA probe</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippi et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Th1 RNA Probe</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippi et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Th2 RNA probe</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippi et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>AB strain zebrafish maintenance and breeding was performed at 28.5C with a 14 hr:10 hr light-dark cycle.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>I agree with you that in these times of widespread isolation, the questions addressed in this report, and the distinction between a self chosen loner mode and an extrinsically forced loneliness are ever so relevant.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Whole brain mapping reveals abnormal activity in socially isolated zebrafish&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Peggy Mason as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The most important point is that we would like for you to test whether the hypothalamic neurons are serotonergic using a method of your choice. As we discussed this manuscript just a week or two ago, we felt that the most important point was that we wanted you to test whether the hypothalamic neurons are serotonergic using a method of your choice. I continued with the explicit statement that &quot;Acceptance will not be contingent on a specific answer – yes they are as you suspect or no they aren't. Either finding is fine. Obviously those two possibilities will require very different interpretations and discussions. It may also be that you choose to submit your manuscript, as is and without these added experiments, to a different journal. Or to resubmit with these experiments to <italic>eLife</italic>. Any of these courses of action are fine.&quot;</p><p>However, the world has changed since our editorial discussions took place. I am assuming that you, along with the bulk of scientists, do not have access to their research laboratories. I do not want to hold up your publication indefinitely as the world navigates the pandemic. I therefore offer you the option of proceeding with purely textual changes and explicitly withdraw the requirement of additional experiments. Of course, should you have those experiments in hand, we welcome their inclusion in the revised manuscript that we look forward to receiving.</p><p>A number of other points that stand out from the many suggestions that you will find below.</p><p>1) Introduction tightened up to foreshadow the key takeaway message as suggested by reviewer 4.</p><p>2) A clear indication of what the N counts, as reviewer 2 asks for. Also please explicate the full method of behavioural assay and analysis rather than referring to another paper.</p><p>3) It appears that immobility is used as a metric for &quot;anxiety.&quot; If so, this should be quantified and immobility should take the place of anxiety in the results. Moreover. immobility can also signal fear- or depression-like affect. Thus, the rhetoric of the discussion should be toned down to recognize this ambiguity. It is noteworthy in this regard that buspirone has atypical antidepressant as well as anxiolytic effects.</p><p>4) Please explain why Busp was tested on partially isolated rather than total isolates.</p><p>One final point, there was disagreement among the reviewers regarding the use of the terms lonely and loner. I am going to take editor's prerogative and call this one on the side of keeping those terms and even extending their use. But to the dissenters' point, please add some justification and caveats to your use of these terms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting and compelling study showing that the lack of a preference for being near other fish that is typical is not present after social isolation. But the exciting piece is that the cfos activation is different in control raised animals that avoid other fish and in isolated fish that show the same avoidance. The authors suggest use the terms lonely and loner for isolated and control fish that fail to prefer other fish.</p><p>My only major concern is that the &quot;anxiety&quot; behavior is talked about but not shown or quantified. Figure 1D is referenced but it is not obvious to me how that figure of location shows me the amount of freezing. The solid black areas could be freezing or repetitive swimming in the same area – I can't tell which. And I would be happier if they called it freezing if that is in fact how they measured it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper utilizes zebrafish in order to study the effects of chronic social isolation on neural responses. The authors note that within a normal zebrafish population, there exists some variability in the social preference of the animals, such that while most animals display a strong tendency to shoal with a visually presented conspecific, there is a certain percentage that will not display this behavior (or display it to a very limited extent), a behavior that is reminiscent of what is observed in chronically isolated animals, which also tend to avoid social interaction. The authors then attempt to compare the neural response in particular the optic tectum and regions of the ventral midbrain (Preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, Posterior tuberal nucleus, and caudal hypothalamus) to visually presented social stimuli, and draw a distinction between these responses in chronically isolated fish, acutely isolated fish, and the response of a &quot;normal&quot; socially avoidant fish. They show that the neural responses in these brain areas differ as a function of isolation, and thereby conclude that the social avoidance behavior triggered by developmental isolation is not similar to the social avoidance found naturally within the population. Lastly, they rescue the anti-social phenotype by utilizing the anxiolytic drug Buspirone, both in partially isolated and non isolated fish, thus putatively showing that anti-social behavior is related to stress.</p><p>1) General comment: The authors report highly significant p-values for their findings (on the order of ^-8), this is to be expected given the reported group sizes. Are these group sizes actually from one experimental repeat (e.g n = 380 for non-isolated fish), or have they pooled together several repeats? If so then it would be more appropriate to analyze the repeated experiments by some other method (e.g. a 2-way-ANOVA or Generalized Linear Model with factors: &quot;experiment number&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;), rather than pool them and utilize a single test for all of the data.</p><p>2) Third paragraph: &quot;we found that fish raised in isolation were significantly less active than their normally raised siblings during the acclimation session (Figure 1B: C vs Fi, p=9.0e-6; C vs Pi, p=2.8e-9 Mann-Whitney). However, when divided into groups with similar social preferences, pro-social isolated fish were nearly as active as pro-social controls (Figure 1C right: C (+S) vs Fi (+S), p=0.02 Mann-Whitney; C (+S) vs Pi (+S) p=0.14 Mann-Whitney&quot;</p><p>These statements are confusing/misleading. The authors did not compare the activity levels of pro-social, non-social, and anti-social fish in the same paradigm as they did in the first sentence (namely, the acclimation phase). They measure it during the social exposure phase (Figure 1C, legend), thus they actually show a differential response to the social cue in terms of overall motility, but not a change in baseline activity as a function of sociality levels per se. I agree that it would have been interesting to compare, post-hoc, the baseline activity levels of the pro\non\anti-social fish (i.e. classify the fish based on their score in the social assay, and find their baseline activity during acclimation, and compare between the groups), but this is not the data presented herein , and the phrasing ought to be changed to reflect that, or the correct comparison presented in the figure.</p><p>3).&quot;…which were both not exposed to social cues during the assay (Figure 3A), we found a significant increase in areas associated with visual processing the optic tectum, (McDowell et al., 2004) and stress responses the posterior tuberal nucleus, PTN&quot;</p><p>As far as I can tell, the authors did not attempt to assess the identity of the PTN activated neurons and therefore this statement may be a bit strong. For example, the PTN is also the major area of fish dopaminergic neurons associated with reward as well GABA-ergic neurons.</p><p>4) Paragraph four-six: What was the data normalized to in these experiments. In the preceding experiment (Figure 2) where the authors look at the response of the social areas, they compare the socially exposed to fish to socially nonexposed fish, but this cannot be the case here as the socially unexposed fish are part of the analysis (and their activity levels do not sum up to 1 on the normalized activity graph).</p><p>5) &quot;…and social phobia in humans (Schneier et al., 1993; van Vliet et al., 1997)&quot; should read: &quot;reduces social phobia&quot;, not enhances.</p><p>6) &quot;Buspirone's impact on the rate of recovery of social preference suggests it may be reducing anxiety by regulating circuit plasticity, perhaps by promoting down-regulation of the hypersensitivity acquired during the isolation period&quot;</p><p>The authors previously quantified anxiety-like behaviors via measures of mobility (% time spent moving). Therefore, it would be appropriate to include a measure of time spent moving per minute in order to strengthen this claim. As it stands, this claim is an interesting hypothesis, but not quite shown by the data.</p><p>7) Three comments on the Buspirone rescue experiment:</p><p>a) Why did the authors only perform this experiment on partially isolated fish, and not fully isolated ones? Given the differences in behavior and brain activity between these two models it is not at all clear that the neural mechanism which drives their anti-social behavior is the same, and therefore full isolates may not be amenable to treatment by Buspirone. This would be an interesting and relevant addition to the paper.</p><p>b) Buspirone rescued anti-social behavior in Control (non-isolated) fish, and also in partially isolated fish. The authors main point in the paper is that the neural mechanisms which drive anti-social behavior following isolation are caused by increased anxiety, and are distinct from those that drive it in the general population. However, since Buspirone rescued anti-social behavior also in controls, does this not mean that anti-social controls and anti-social partially isolated animals share some neural phenotype?</p><p>c) If possible, it would be instructive to perform neural activity imaging on Buspirone treated animals, and in particular, show reduced activity in the optic tectum and PTN, as the authors claim that hyperactivity in these regions is anxiogenic and drives the anti-social behavior of isolates. Thus, if the authors hypothesis is correct, it would be expected that Buspirone treatment, which rescues the behavior, would also reduce activity in these areas.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study identifies brains areas that control social behavioural responses towards conspecifics in socially isolated and normally reared zebrafish.

In general, I like the paper a lot; it represents a significant effort by the authors and suggests that despite behavioral similarities, all isolation is not the same.

We have now added a more general overview of the study’s goals and outcomes, introduced the concept of “lonely” and “loner”, and explained why we decided to use both partial and full isolation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A clear indication of what the N counts, as reviewer 2 asks for. Also please explicate the full method of behavioural assay and analysis rather than referring to another paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We now include N counts for every experiment reported, either in the figure directly or in the corresponding legend. As suggested, we have modified the Materials and methods section to include a complete explanation of the behavioural assay and analysis as opposed to referring to previous work. As requested by reviewer 2, we have also specified that each fish has been tested only once, i.e. 380 individual control fish were tested in the social assay, and therefore all the experiments are single trials and it is appropriate to use the Mann-Whitney statistical test as opposed to ANOVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It appears that immobility is used as a metric for &quot;anxiety.&quot; If so, this should be quantified and immobility should take the place of anxiety in the results. Moreover. immobility can also signal fear- or depression-like affect. Thus, the rhetoric of the discussion should be toned down to recognize this ambiguity. It is noteworthy in this regard that buspirone has atypical antidepressant as well as anxiolytic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for highlighting this ambiguity. We agree that the measure we used in the paper, percentage of time moving, could underlie other behavioural phenotypes apart from anxiety, such as depression or fear, and we have modified our Discussion accordingly. We have also now included a supplementary Figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D) where we quantify the percentage of time spent freezing during acclimation and social cue exposure. This parameter reports the percentage of time that fish remain motionless for 3 seconds and longer. The data show that fully and partially isolated fish show a significant increase in “freezes” during acclimation and social cue exposure, although fully isolated fish show a larger increase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D, left). Furthermore, when we look at the anti-social fish during social cue exposure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D right, blue dots), each experimental group (controls, fully isolated, and partially isolated), has a similar percentage of time freezing, supporting our claim that freezing is a hallmark of anti-social behaviour for both “loner” and “lonely” fish.</p><p>Finally, it is true that Buspirone has also been used as an atypical antidepressant, however, only as adjunctive treatment in patients with generalized anxiety disorders and depression. This is very interesting. We believe that there is still much to learn about the action of Buspirone and the interaction between anxiety and depression, and we feel that zebrafish will provide an excellent model for further study. We have therefore improved our discussion of Buspirone throughout the manuscript, both to motivate its use in our experiments and to suggest future directions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please explain why Busp was tested on partially isolated rather than total isolates.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point needs to be better explained in the paper, thank you for highlighting this. There are several reasons why we opted for partially versus fully isolated fish to perform the drug experiments. First of all, partial isolation of only 48 hours instead of 3 weeks already induces a profound behavioural change in social preference behaviour (Figure 1A) similar to full isolation. Secondly, the functional activity observed in the presence (Figure 2B) or not (Figure 3A-B) of social cues is very similar between fully and partially isolated fish. However, in both behaviour and neural activity, the impact of partial isolation is less severe than full isolation. We therefore decided that partial isolation represented an “intermediate” phenotype that would allow us to detect both positive and negative impacts on sociality for a given treatment. This has now been explained in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One final point, there was disagreement among the reviewers regarding the use of the terms lonely and loner. I am going to take editor's prerogative and call this one on the side of keeping those terms and even extending their use. But to the dissenters' point, please add some justification and caveats to your use of these terms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this decision. We also believe that the terms are compelling and we did include them in the title of our first submission. Therefore, we have reintroduced the terms in the title, explained and justified there use in the Introduction, and used them throughout the manuscript where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a very interesting and compelling study showing that the lack of a preference for being near other fish that is typical is not present after social isolation. But the exciting piece is that the cfos activation is different in control raised animals that avoid other fish and in isolated fish that show the same avoidance. The authors suggest use the terms lonely and loner for isolated and control fish that fail to prefer other fish.</p><p>My only major concern is that the &quot;anxiety&quot; behavior is talked about but not shown or quantified. Figure 1D is referenced but it is not obvious to me how that figure of location shows me the amount of freezing. The solid black areas could be freezing or repetitive swimming in the same area – I can't tell which. And I would be happier if they called it freezing if that is in fact how they measured it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the qualitative presentation of “freezing” behaviour in Figure 1D and the supplemental video were insufficient to demonstrate that anti-social fish exhibit anxiety-like behaviour. Therefore, we have now quantified the percentage of time spent freezing during acclimation and social cue period and included this analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D. The data show that both fully and partially isolated fish have a significant increase in freezes during the acclimation period, suggesting a heightened level of general anxiety. This increased freezing persists during social cue exposure, but is largest in fully isolated fish. We believe this additional analysis greatly supports our claim that isolation increases anxiety-like freezing behaviour. Thank you very much for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper utilizes zebrafish in order to study the effects of chronic social isolation on neural responses. The authors note that within a normal zebrafish population, there exists some variability in the social preference of the animals, such that while most animals display a strong tendency to shoal with a visually presented conspecific, there is a certain percentage that will not display this behavior (or display it to a very limited extent), a behavior that is reminiscent of what is observed in chronically isolated animals, which also tend to avoid social interaction. The authors then attempt to compare the neural response in particular the optic tectum and regions of the ventral midbrain (Preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, Posterior tuberal nucleus, and caudal hypothalamus) to visually presented social stimuli, and draw a distinction between these responses in chronically isolated fish, acutely isolated fish, and the response of a &quot;normal&quot; socially avoidant fish. They show that the neural responses in these brain areas differ as a function of isolation, and thereby conclude that the social avoidance behavior triggered by developmental isolation is not similar to the social avoidance found naturally within the population. Lastly, they rescue the anti-social phenotype by utilizing the anxiolytic drug Buspirone, both in partially isolated and non isolated fish, thus putatively showing that anti-social behavior is related to stress.</p><p>1) General comment: The authors report highly significant p-values for their findings (on the order of ^-8), this is to be expected given the reported group sizes. Are these group sizes actually from one experimental repeat (e.g n = 380 for non-isolated fish), or have they pooled together several repeats? If so then it would be more appropriate to analyze the repeated experiments by some other method (e.g. a 2-way-ANOVA or Generalized Linear Model with factors: &quot;experiment number&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;), rather than pool them and utilize a single test for all of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The experiments are all single experimental repeats (i.e. 380 individual non-isolated fish were tested once in the social preference assay). We have now described this more clearly in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Third paragraph: &quot;we found that fish raised in isolation were significantly less active than their normally raised siblings during the acclimation session (Figure 1B: C vs Fi, p=9.0e-6; C vs Pi, p=2.8e-9 Mann-Whitney). However, when divided into groups with similar social preferences, pro-social isolated fish were nearly as active as pro-social controls (Figure 1C right: C (+S) vs Fi (+S), p=0.02 Mann-Whitney; C (+S) vs Pi (+S) p=0.14 Mann-Whitney&quot;</p><p>These statements are confusing/misleading. The authors did not compare the activity levels of pro-social, non-social, and anti-social fish in the same paradigm as they did in the first sentence (namely, the acclimation phase). They measure it during the social exposure phase (Figure 1C, legend), thus they actually show a differential response to the social cue in terms of overall motility, but not a change in baseline activity as a function of sociality levels per se. I agree that it would have been interesting to compare, post-hoc, the baseline activity levels of the pro\non\anti-social fish (i.e. classify the fish based on their score in the social assay, and find their baseline activity during acclimation, and compare between the groups), but this is not the data presented herein , and the phrasing ought to be changed to reflect that, or the correct comparison presented in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really good point. Thank you for highlighting our confusing presentation and description. We have now changed Figure 1C and replaced the swarm plots of anti-social and pro-social fish during the social exposure with the ones during the acclimation period (that were classified based on their subsequent performance in the social cue period). The new data support our argument that the baseline (i.e. without social cues) mobility of anti-social control, fully, and partially isolated fish is very similar during the acclimation period. This reduced mobility persists during the social cue phase, as we originally reported in the main figure. We have moved the swarm plots of mobility during the social cue period to the Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;…which were both not exposed to social cues during the assay (Figure 3A), we found a significant increase in areas associated with visual processing the optic tectum, (McDowell et al., 2004) and stress responses the posterior tuberal nucleus, PTN&quot;</p><p>As far as I can tell, the authors did not attempt to assess the identity of the PTN activated neurons and therefore this statement may be a bit strong. For example, the PTN is also the major area of fish dopaminergic neurons associated with reward as well GABA-ergic neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helping us to clarify this point. We have recently begun to perform <italic>in situs</italic> for dopaminergic, serotoninergic and acetylcholine markers in juvenile fish. These preliminary data show that the area activated is the PTN, however, the dopaminergic neurons are not the ones that we see activated. These dopaminergic neurons seem to surround the activated area shown in Figure 3A bottom. We do not know yet, what type of markers these neurons express. PTN neurons have been shown to express GABA (gad) and can also coexpress (vglut2) in addition to dopamine (Th1). We are planning to continue the characterization of the PTN neurons as soon as possible, but for now, we have improved our discussion of the PTN and other identified areas, throughout the manuscript to reflect these possible alternate roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Paragraph four-six: What was the data normalized to in these experiments. In the preceding experiment (Figure 2) where the authors look at the response of the social areas, they compare the socially exposed to fish to socially nonexposed fish, but this cannot be the case here as the socially unexposed fish are part of the analysis (and their activity levels do not sum up to 1 on the normalized activity graph).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this confusion. All individual brain maps were first processed using an intensity histogram normalization, as described in the Materials and methods. As you point out, in Figure 2 we present the data as “difference images” to highlight relative changes in response to social cue exposure. In Figure 3, however, we compare between groups (i.e. controls vs. isolation) and identify <italic>c-fos</italic> activity changes that occur regardless of social cue presentation, and therefore we report the absolute (histogram normalized) <italic>c-fos</italic> expression in different regions. We have now emphasized the difference in presentation for Figure 2 and 3 in the manuscript text to highlight this for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;…and social phobia in humans (Schneier et al., 1993; van Vliet et al., 1997)&quot; should read: &quot;reduces social phobia&quot;, not enhances.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for finding this error. We have changed the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;Buspirone's impact on the rate of recovery of social preference suggests it may be reducing anxiety by regulating circuit plasticity, perhaps by promoting down-regulation of the hypersensitivity acquired during the isolation period&quot;</p><p>The authors previously quantified anxiety-like behaviors via measures of mobility (% time spent moving). Therefore, it would be appropriate to include a measure of time spent moving per minute in order to strengthen this claim. As it stands, this claim is an interesting hypothesis, but not quite shown by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this important analysis. We have now quantified the percentage of time moving in one minute bins for each treatment group presented in Figure 4 A-B and included a new panel in Figure 4 (Figure 4C). The results show that Buspirone treatment increases the mobility of partially isolated fish, which reach control levels within the first minute of the social assay. Therefore, these new data, together with the VPI results (Figure 4B), supports the argument that Buspirone reduces anxiety/increases mobility and that this happens prior to a recovery of social preference. Very interesting and a great addition to the study. Thanks again for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Three comments on the Buspirone rescue experiment:</p><p>a) Why did the authors only perform this experiment on partially isolated fish, and not fully isolated ones? Given the differences in behavior and brain activity between these two models it is not at all clear that the neural mechanism which drives their anti-social behavior is the same, and therefore full isolates may not be amenable to treatment by Buspirone. This would be an interesting and relevant addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for allowing us to clarify this decision. In addition to the reply to the Editor’s comment above, we would like to say that we are (or we were prior to lockdown) currently pursuing experiments testing Buspirone treatment on fully-isolated fish. However, given that we have a limited number of isolation tanks, and that these tanks are entirely used by one fish for the full three week period of isolation, then these full isolation experiments are much lower throughput. Therefore, given that brief periods of isolation are likely much more common than complete lack of social interaction from birth, we decided to start with partial isolation fish to test possible treatments/rescues. However, we agree, that full (or at least longer) isolation tests need to follow for any identified treatment candidates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Buspirone rescued anti-social behavior in Control (non-isolated) fish, and also in partially isolated fish. The authors main point in the paper is that the neural mechanisms which drive anti-social behavior following isolation are caused by increased anxiety, and are distinct from those that drive it in the general population. However, since Buspirone rescued anti-social behavior also in controls, does this not mean that anti-social controls and anti-social partially isolated animals share some neural phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this potential confusion. It is not clear that Buspirone has altered the social preference of anti-social control fish, as we still see ~10% anti-social control fish following drug treatment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A left panel), similar to the proportion found in an untreated control population. However, given that anti-social fish are rare in normally-raised populations, we do not have enough data to conclude that Buspirone is <italic>only</italic> effective at reducing anxiety in isolated fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) If possible, it would be instructive to perform neural activity imaging on Buspirone treated animals, and in particular, show reduced activity in the optic tectum and PTN, as the authors claim that hyperactivity in these regions is anxiogenic and drives the antisocial behavior of isolates. Thus, if the authors hypothesis is correct, it would be expected that Buspirone treatment, which rescues the behavior, would also reduce activity in these areas.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that these are interesting experiments that could shed light on the mechanism of action of Buspirone. We have indeed kept and fixed all the Buspirone treated fish so that we can explore their functional activity by using <italic>c-fosin situs</italic>, however, this will be part of a future study where explore the impact of Buspirone treatment in more detail. Thank you for all the suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study identifies brains areas that control social behavioural responses towards conspecifics in socially isolated and normally reared zebrafish.
