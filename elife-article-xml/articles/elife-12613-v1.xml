A recent epidemic in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) caused up to 80% of global VL and over 30,000 deaths per year. Resistance against antimonial drugs has probably been a contributing factor in the persistence of this epidemic. Here we use whole genome sequences from 204 clinical isolates to track the evolution and epidemiology of <italic>L. donovani</italic> from the ISC. We identify independent radiations that have emerged since a bottleneck coincident with 1960s DDT spraying campaigns. A genetically distinct population frequently resistant to antimonials has a two base-pair insertion in the aquaglyceroporin gene LdAQP1 that prevents the transport of trivalent antimonials. We find evidence of genetic exchange between ISC populations, and show that the mutation in LdAQP1 has spread by recombination. Our results reveal the complexity of <italic>L. donovani</italic> evolution in the ISC in response to drug treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12613.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12613.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12613.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> causes a disease called visceral leishmaniasis that affects many of the world's poorest people. Around half a million new cases develop every year, but health authorities lack safe and effective drugs to treat them. Up to 80% of these cases occur in the Indian subcontinent, where devastating epidemics have occurred in the last decades.</p><p>One reason these epidemics continue to occur is that the parasites develop genetic mutations allowing them to adapt to and resist the drugs used to kill them. As there are few existing drugs that can kill <italic>L. donovani</italic>, it is crucial to understand how drug resistance emerges and spreads among parasite populations.</p><p>Imamura, Downing, Van den Broeck et al. have now investigated the history of visceral leishmaniasis epidemics by characterising the complete genetic sequence – or genome – of 204 <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasite samples. This revealed that the majority of parasites in the Indian subcontinent first appeared in the nineteenth century, matching the first historical records of visceral leishmaniasis epidemics.</p><p>The genomes show that most of the parasites are genetically similar and can be clustered into several closely related groups. These groups first appeared in the 1960s following the end of a regional campaign to eradicate malaria. The most common parasite group is particularly resistant to drugs called antimonials, which were the main treatment for leishmaniasis until recently. These parasites have a small genetic change that scrambles most of a protein known to be involved in the uptake of antimonials.</p><p>Parasites may also be able to develop resistance to drugs through additional mechanisms that allow them to produce many copies of the same gene. These mechanisms could allow the parasites to rapidly adapt to new drugs or changes in the populations it infects. The work of Imamura et al. looks only at parasites isolated from patients then grown in the laboratory, so further research is now needed to explore how variable the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome is in both of the parasite’s hosts: humans and sandflies.</p><p>Imamura et al.’s study reveals how <italic>L. donovani</italic> has spread throughout the Indian subcontinent in fine detail. The genome data can be used to create simple molecular tools that could form an &quot;early warning system&quot; to track the success of disease control programs and to determine how well the current drugs are working.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12613.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12613.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasites of the <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> species complex cause visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most severe presentation of leishmaniasis that is usually fatal if untreated. There are probably between 200,000 and 300,000 VL cases annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvar et al., 2012</xref>), leading to as many as 50,000 deaths per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">den Boer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lozano et al., 2012</xref>). VL is widespread in both the New and Old Worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pigott et al., 2014</xref>), but as much as 80% of the global VL burden occurs in the Indian sub-continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvar et al., 2012</xref>). Recent intensified control efforts have led to a notable decline in cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>) but the problem is not yet eliminated. VL is a key neglected tropical disease, affecting the poorest regions of the world and the poorest communities within these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boelaert et al., 2009</xref>). VL was first reported in the Indian sub-continent (ISC) in the 1820s, but initially confused with malaria until the discovery of <italic>L. donovani</italic> in 1903 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson, 1983</xref>). Although VL was nearly eliminated from the ISC in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thakur, 2007</xref>) by antimalarial spraying campaigns with DDT, it re-emerged in 1977 and has caused several subsequent major epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dye and Wolpert, 1988</xref>). Widespread chemotherapy for VL in the region has been ongoing since the 1820s, initially with quinine and other drugs, followed by extensive use of the trivalent antimonial Sb<sup>III</sup> (1915) and compounds of the less toxic pentavalent Sb<sup>V</sup> (1922) such as sodium stibogluconate (SSG), and since 2005 with miltefosine (MIL) that is freely supplied through a government-subsidized control program. The parasite developed resistance to both Sb<sup>III</sup> and Sb<sup>V</sup>, and after ten years of clinical use there has been a notable decline in MIL efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rijal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sundar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites can re-shape their genome rapidly in vitro in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leprohon et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting structural variation is an important feature by which they can rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and drug pressure. However, there is little data on the diversity of clinical <italic>Leishmania</italic> populations or how they evolve during treatment. While an extensive literature has made use of molecular methods to study the population genetics of <italic>Leishmania</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mauricio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schonian et al., 2008</xref>), existing genetic markers have relatively poor resolution, and in particular <italic>L. donovani</italic> within the ISC show very little genetic differentiation based on these approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Downing et al., 2012</xref>).

Phylogenetic and clustering methods identify six congruent monophyletic groups (ISC2-7). Three other groups (ISC8-10) and 21 ungrouped isolates had more complex and less certain evolutionary histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, table f</xref>). Most of the ISC groups are present throughout our sampling window (2002–2011), and many are present in both India and Nepal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Within the core population, the Indo-Nepalese population itself appeared around 1900 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), almost certainly in India (0.89 posterior probability), matching the dates of the first reported outbreaks in Bihar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson, 1983</xref>), more precisely in Purnea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Most subsequent diversification is more recent, with many groups (ISC2 &amp; ISC4-6) radiating from the 1960s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), coinciding with the end of the DDT spraying campaign. The estimated rate of migration from India to Nepal in the Core 191 group was significantly greater than that from Nepal to India, suggesting that India acts as a source population seeding the Nepalese epidemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A lack of linkage disequilibrium decay between SNP pairs with genomic distance in the core population (r<sup>2</sup>~0.33 at 5–1,400 kb) reflects a lack of detectable recombination within the six main genetic groups (ISC2-7) across the entire genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, table j</xref>). While the low number of SNPs varying within the core population limits our power to detect recombination, we find compelling evidence of hybridisation among eight of the samples not assigned to any of the ISC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). The identity of these isolates as hybrids and our assignment of other isolates to groups is supported by allele-frequency based methods (f-statistics), which should be robust to gene flow between groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, tables e,f</xref>) and population structure analysis based on haplotype sharing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2, tables k–n</xref>). The four-allele test also confirms that recombination is largely restricted to these hybrids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, table o</xref>). These isolates appear to result from multiple independent recent hybridizations between distinct ancestors of either ISC5 and ISC6, ISC5 and ISC7, or ISC6 and ISC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We detect extensive variation in the structure of these <italic>L. donovani</italic> genomes. Local copy-number variants (CNVs) cover ~11% of the genome. These include sporadic gene duplication, dynamic tandem gene array sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and long sub-telomeric amplifications/deletions, the latter generally spanning whole transcription units. While structural variation in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is often considered a transient adaptation, particularly to culture conditions in vitro, we find striking conservation of many CNVs across all core population groups here. Two multigenic intra-chromosomal duplicated regions (MAPK1 and H-locus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>) are present in variable numbers in all core population isolates but are absent in ISC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conserved heterozygous SNPs in both of these structural variants confirm that these regions have duplicated once and been maintained throughout the evolution of this population. All known genes on these duplicated regions are associated with virulence (MAPK1, ASS, sAcP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakhal-Naouar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wiese, 1998</xref>) or drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brotherton et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that extensive structural variation allows these parasites to alter local copy number in response to changing environments: both aneuploidy and CNV regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leprohon et al., 2009</xref>). Most isolates are aneuploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), even excluding the generally tetrasomic chromosome 31, and almost all chromosomes show some variation in somy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Aneuploidy (r<sup>2</sup>=0.15, p=2.7x10<sup>-118</sup>), CNVs (r<sup>2</sup>=0.26, p=7.5x10<sup>-218</sup>) and indels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.30, p=2.1x10<sup>-254</sup>) are significantly correlated with SNP variation in the core isolates, suggesting that these variants have appeared gradually during the evolution of the population in the field. Most strikingly, we find two cases of recent epidemic expansions associated with major changes in aneuploidy and heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Variation in somy can thus lead to changes in heterozygosity, which could allow selection to eradicate recessive deleterious mutations in the absence of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roze and Michod, 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12613.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural variations in ISC <italic>L. donovani</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stacked barplots per chromosome showing the proportion of ISC strains that are monosomic, disomic, trisomic, tretrasomic or pentasomic for the respective chromosome.

One variant – a two-bp insertion introducing a frameshift and premature stop codon in the aquaglyceroporin-1 gene (LdBPK_310030, AQP1) – is homozygous in all 52 ISC5 isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and heterozygous in six hybrids between ISC5 and either ISC6 or ISC7. ISC5 isolates also share other genomic features – such as higher copy number of both the H-locus and MAPK1 amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>). The H-locus includes MRPA, a gene involved in the efflux of Sb<sup>III</sup> and associated with drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leprohon et al., 2009</xref>). Other lines of evidence strongly link AQP1 with antimony resistance. While recent antimonial drugs such as SSG are compounds of pentavalent antimony (Sb<sup>V</sup>), Sb<sup>V</sup> is thought to act mostly as a pro-drug, being reduced to Sb<sup>III</sup> in both the macrophage phagolysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frézard et al., 2001</xref>) and in the parasite itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Decuypere et al., 2012</xref>).

The ISC5 lineage emerged following the end of the DDT campaigns but then proliferated quickly in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>), when antimonial dosage had to be doubled because of its declining efficacy. The persistence of this lineage beyond the era of Sb treatment perhaps reflects the increased fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vanaerschot et al., 2013</xref>) of Sb-resistant parasites. These observations tally with a stronger signature of purifying selection on the ISC5 lineage, measured as a lower rate of derived allele accumulation compared to other ISC populations, which may be a consequence of higher historical exposure to drug stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, table s</xref>). Sb resistance is also present in other genetic groups, with 4 out of 15 ISC4 lines tested in vitro being Sb<sup>V</sup>-R, indicating resistance has emerged independently and recently multiple times in ISC <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and that other genetic variants responsible for Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance must be present in this population. Indeed, other Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance mechanisms are known in this population: previous work has shown that two resistant strains from ISC4 (BPK087 and BPK190) show significantly decreased transcription of an AQP1 locus encoding a wildtype protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decuypere et al., 2005</xref>), and BHU764 combines a different indel mutation in AQP1 and reduced expression of MRPA, an efflux transporter of Sb<sup>III</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011</xref>). The failure of any single resistance locus to sweep through this population may reflect the low level of gene flow and the presence of a large reservoir of untreated asymptomatic cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostyn et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that genomic data can retrospectively unravel the evolution and epidemiology of this parasite population, and gain new insight into possible mechanisms of drug resistance against a background of extensive variation in genome structure.

A few strains (7) showed AI values around 3 and were considered as showing intermediate resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genome sequencing</title><p>DNA isolation, sample preparation, DNA quantification and DNA library preparation were done as outlined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>). 100 bp paired-end sequence reads were generated (median coverage 44 per sample) with the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform according to standard protocols.

COCALL applied five different variant detection approaches and combines evidence from them to calculate the support for each genotype. For complete details on the algorithm testing and development, see Appendix 1. In short, this approach avoids bias associated with systematic errors unique to each individual SNP caller by examining their consistency and identifying discordant mutations symptomatic of false positives. The five callers used were FreeBayes v0.9.5, GATK 2.0–38, Samtools Pileup v0.1.16 and Mpileup v0.1.18 based on the DNA read mapping by Smalt, and Cortex v1.0.5.13 based on its own <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and mapping. In a large population of genetically homogenous strains, superior inference power was achieved by examining the population-wide genotype at each candidate SNP site (i.e. population-based COCALL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Candidate SNPs with genotype qualities of 40+ across all five callers were retained. SNPs with population normalized read depth ≤0.5 or ≥1.75 or with multiple derived alleles across the five callers were excluded. Candidate SNPs in soft-masked regions were accepted where the number of callers ≥3.5; those in non-masked regions were kept where the number of callers ≥2.5.

Somy levels were estimated as the median normalized chromosomal read depths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>). Local copy number variants (CNVs) were detected where the local read depth was significantly different from the median depth of approximately 60 samples from ICS4, ISC6 and ISC8 whose depth profile is similar to that of BPK282/0cl4, and were measured with respect to the haploid depth to exclude somy variability. Two CNVs in particular, the MAPK1 and H-locus, were further investigated as they show functions potentially relevant to parasite adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>). A quantitative PCR assay in a subset of 46 samples was performed to confirm the copy number variation of the MAPK1 and H-locus amplicons. The nature of the amplification (extra- or intra-chromosomal) was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and southern blot hybridization comparing two strains that showed differential amplification of these loci (ISC6 strain BPK282/0cl4: amplification; and ISC1 strain BPK026/0cl5: no amplification). To exclude the possibility that the amplicons are a culturing artefact, PCRs using primers that enabled amplification of circular episomes or tandem duplications was also attempted directly on five bone marrow samples from VL patients. Indels were detected using a consensus calling method based on the concordance of results across four tools: Cortex, Freebayes, GATK and Samtools Mpileup.

Haplotypes were inferred with a general recombination rate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Stephens, 2003</xref>) with ten runs, each with a burn-in of 100 steps, 100 iterations and a single MC thinning step and recombination rate estimated for each chromosome. Convergence was examined for each chromosome: recombination estimates were consistent, though there was more variation between phasing runs for chromosome 16 in the core population and consequently inferred haplotypes are less certain for that chromosome. There was no correlation between the mean chromosome copy number and mean recombination rate or PHASE probability values for inferred haplotypes (r<sup>2</sup>=0.011). While variation in somy is not explicitly accounted for in the phasing process, the rapid flux in the somy levels of aneuploid chromosomes may mean this variation has no effect on haplotype inference. Of 3,567 heterozygous sites, 3,076 (86%) had a PHASE probability of exactly 100% and 437 had PHASE probabilities &lt; 0.95: these lower-confidence haplotypes were masked. Haplotypes for BHU1087/0 were inferred along with the core population. The phased core population SNP set had 2,401 SNPs: 17 singletons were masked. The smaller sample size meant that phasing within ISC1 was less successful: phase was successfully inferred for 2,308 sites using the same (0.95) confidence score threshold: 524 were not phased and were excluded from further analysis. No correlation between phasing confidence score and trisomy or tetrasomy was apparent.</p><p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was inferred as the correlation in genotypes (r<sup>2</sup> values) between SNP pairs using Bcftools v0.1.17 screened with Samtools Mpileup given SNP mapping qualities &gt;30 and base qualities &gt;25. These pairwise r<sup>2</sup> values were used to examine genome-wide LD patterns and LD decay with distance. Recombination was confirmed using the four-gamete test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hudson and Kaplan, 1985</xref>). Mean chromosomal estimates of LD in the core population did not correlate with somy level if the tetrasomic chromosome 31 was excluded (r<sup>2</sup>=0.001) but did if chromosome 31 was included (r<sup>2</sup>=0.167). Somy had little impact on the variance of LD per chromosome (r<sup>2</sup>=0.017 with chr31, r<sup>2</sup>=0.000 without chr31). Variance in somy level across chromosomes had no association with either the mean or variance of LD per chromosome.

Variants were called for these two samples using the approaches outlined above. For two additional <italic>L. donovani</italic> isolates from Sri Lanka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), we mapped Illumina GAII reads using Smalt v5.7 as above and called candidate SNPs at non-masked regions using Samtools Pileup v0.1.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>), followed by screening steps as above. Two genomes were excluded in the final analyses because sequence reads were of insufficient quality (for MHOM/IN/10/BHU1087/0) or because of a suspected mixed infection (for MHOM/IN/10/BHU790/0). BHU790/0 is distantly related to the core population (most likely ISC3) and appears to be a mixed infection rather than a hybrid because its average read allele frequency of heterozygous SNPs approximates 0.17, whereas most detected hybrids had mean read allele frequencies of 0.4–0.5. Remaining data were used to construct phylogenies using the 211,536 sites containing verified SNPs in the entire sample set (ISC1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 and ungrouped, LV9, JPCM5, BPK512/0cl9). JPCM5, LV9, the two Sri Lankan isolates and one sample from our collection (BPK512/0cl9) represented genetically distinct lineages, distinct to both the ISC1 (n=12) and core populations (n=191). Seven SNPs in the core population and ten in ISC1 had multiple derived alleles compared to reference genome sample BPK282/0cl4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2, table t</xref>).

Given a number of genetically distinct clusters (K), samples were probabilistically assigned to a population independent of a mutation model with a prior of 1/K based on the correlation in genotypes of each sample with estimated population allele frequencies. 1≤K≤15 was examined with admixture and incomplete membership allowed to reduce overfitting. We used 10<sup>5</sup> burn-in steps before a run of 2x10<sup>6</sup> steps with three independent runs per K to confirm chain convergence. The most likely number of clusters was based on the second-order rate of change of the likelihood function (ΔK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evanno et al., 2005</xref>). At K=4 the groups were composed of ISC2/3/9/10, ISC4, ISC5 and ISC6/7/8. Inter-population differentiation was lower for ISC2/3/9/10 (F<sub>ST</sub>=0.36) compared to the others (0.85&lt;F<sub>ST</sub>&lt;0.98).

For molecular clock analyses, hybrid isolates not assigned to any of the ISC groups were removed from the dataset, as were the Bangladeshi outgroups for most analyses. Dates for each were fixed to the month of isolation, with sampling dates for those for which only isolation year data was available estimated during the MCMC but given a uniform prior on sampling ages within that year. Broadly consistent date estimates were obtained under three different models: with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and a TVM substitution model and a Bayesian skyride model for population sizes, under the same model but with a strict clock model and finally under a GTR substitution model, with a simple constant population size coalescent model for data including the outgroups. Migration rate estimates were obtained by including a simple continuous-time Markov model of a discrete trait representing the country (Nepal/India) of isolation, so that ancestral states and rates of change in geographical location were estimated along the phylogeny. All analyses were made with a minimum of 8 independent MCMC runs, for 200 million update generations per run. Convergence was assessed by inspection in Tracer v1.6, confirming that at least 5 of the 8 runs had converged to the same stationary distribution of parameters and that this had the highest likelihood. In most analyses, seven or eight chains all converged to the same posterior distribution, but the Bayesian skyride analyses converged more slowly. ESS estimates for almost all parameters across runs was over 500, except for some skyride population size parameters. The first 20 million generations of each MCMC run were removed before combining all converged runs for inference. Historical population sizes were estimated both with the Bayesian skyride model and by transforming lineage-through-time data for all trees in the posterior probability distribution from the strict clock model above using the package Ape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>) v3.1–4 in R version 3.12. To compare population sizes between the drug resistant clade and others, we split ISC5 from other data and removed coalescent events between the ISC groups (the oldest six) to make these comparable with the ISC5 coalescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Population genomic identification of admixture using allele frequency correlations</title><p>f-statistics describe the correlation in allele frequencies between populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reich et al., 2009</xref>). The simplest (f<sub>2</sub>) is simply the sum-of-squares difference in allele frequency between two populations averaged across loci, and so captures the amount of divergence, or branch length between two populations. Two more complex statistics, f<sub>3</sub> and f<sub>4</sub> are calculated as differences between f<sub>2</sub> statistics between groups of 3 and 4 related populations. f<sub>3</sub>(C;A,B) has the property that, for a population C derived from populations A and B, it is expected to be positive if A,B and C are related by a simple history of divergence and genetic drift, but negative if admixture from A or B has contributed to the genetic composition of population C, while being robust to the details of the relationship between the three populations. In contrast, the value of f<sub>4</sub>(A,B,C,D) does depend on the evolutionary history of populations A, B, C and D and so can be used to test a proposed relationship: if the four populations are related as ((A,B),(C,D)) the f<sub>4</sub> statistic is expected to be zero; for ((A,C),(B,D)) it is expected to be positive and for ((A,D),(B,C)), negative. Finally, if the evolutionary history of three ancestral populations is known, the ratio of two f<sub>4</sub> ratios is an estimate of the relative contribution of two potential parental populations to a fourth admixed population, given an outgroup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Population genomic identification of admixture using haplotype sharing</title><p>Whereas groups ISC2/3/4/5/6/7 seemed clearly defined phylogenetically and by Structure, ISC8/9/10 were not and no simple relatedness among the 21 ungrouped samples was detected. Consequently, we used inferred haplotypes to test whether these represented genetically discrete populations, or whether some of those samples were mixtures of ISC3/4/5/6/7 generated by hybridisation between these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawson et al., 2012</xref>). Chromopainter v0.0.2 and FineStructure v0.0.2 inferred ancestral patterns of haplotype similarity among samples without a prior assumption of a given number of populations or of independence between mutations.</p><p>Co-ancestry matrices for the core population were computed using Chromopainter v0.0.2 as the number of segments potentially donated to or received from individual samples, using the phased haplotypes. Recombination rates between pairs of SNPs inferred by PHASE were used for each of 36 unlinked chromosomes. Groups of SNPs on a single chromosome were expected to be exchanged as blocks of different sizes, so a higher number and longer lengths of shared blocks indicate recent common ancestry. The most likely ancestral sample or population was assigned according to its similarity to corresponding segments in a set of donor isolates. Two main datasets were generated by ChromoPainter: a co-ancestry matrix where all 191 could donate to all 191 as recipients (191x191), and another where six representative samples were used as the only donors (191x6: BD09 for ISC2, BPK067/0cl2 for ISC3, BPK087/0cl11 for ISC4, BPK275/0cl18 for ISC5, BPK282/0cl4 for ISC6, BHU200/0 for ISC7). The expected number of chunks was minimised for the six representative samples, with k=80 segments and an effective number of chunks c=0.02. Reducing the number of representative strains to represent distinct groups identified by Structure with smaller K parameters resulted in smaller k and larger c values, suggesting that using six representative samples was the optimal number for discrimination within the core population. Though ISC7 was a subset of ISC6, ISC7 had a large number of fixed SNPs sufficient to differentiate it from ISC6 with Structure, so it was included. For the 191x191 comparison, k=79 segments was expected and the effective number of chunks was lower (c=0.00054) because the total diversity of the donor set per SNP had decreased.</p><p>These 191x191 and 191x6 co-ancestry matrices represented the most probable number of segments copied from each donor to each recipient, and also the relative probability of ancestry across the set of donors for each SNP for each sample. The number of donors per recipient was set to 100. 20 expectation-maximisation algorithm iterations was sufficient to maximise the recombination-scaling coefficient (N<sub>e</sub>) and copying probabilities with 10&lt;k&lt;1000 iterations across different number of donor samples assuming a minimum recombination rate of 10<sup>-15</sup> Morgans/bp. For the 191x191 matrix, the N<sub>e</sub>=523.3 and the mutation rate (µ) was 0.000181. For the 191x6 matrix, the N<sub>e</sub>=1015.1 and µ=0.000628: N<sub>e</sub> and µ were higher because there were more mutations per sample.</p><p>The 191x191 matrix was clustered for 10<sup>6</sup> MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) steps with a burn-in of 10,000 and a skip of 100 steps using FineStructure v0.02 to obtain aggregated expected segment sharing between samples and populations with 100 trees examined per merge step. This distinguished complex ancestral patterns of segment sharing for the strains which Structure could not fully assign to single populations.</p><p>To verify FineStructure and Structure results, the correlation in the SNP allele frequencies across samples was examined in the core population for six principal components with p&lt;10<sup>-7</sup> using PCA implemented by smartPCA in Eigensoft v4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Price et al., 2006</xref>).

This was repeated for the 2353 variable sites in the core population (ISC3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 and ungrouped samples, n=183) excluding the 8 samples from Bangladesh (ISC2). This partitioned ISC5 (PC1, 7.4%), then ISC4 (6.8%), third ISC3 (5.6%), and fourth BPK035/0cl1-BPK043/0cl2 (4.8%). Eigenstrat and FineStructure PCA results were effectively the same but with some different axis labels – PC1 in the former was PC3 in the latter. FineStructure 191x191 ancestry patterns partitioned ISC4 vs ISC6 over PC1 (16.8% of variation), and ISC5 vs ISC6 over PC2 (15.5%).

Links between genetic diversity (SNP, indel, CNV and somy) and in vitro Sb<sup>V</sup>-resistance were assessed using the Fisher Exact test (FET), Mann Whitney U-tests (MWU) and odds ratios (ORs), implemented on 103 CNVs and 17 indels (in 14 genes) as well as 2,392 phased SNPs genotypes. SNPs were assigned to the 5’ and 3’ UTR if they were within 1 kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). To counter bias associated with the small sample size, FET and MWU were used initially. For the FET, variants were defined as discrete variables: SNPs as 0, 1 or 2 non-reference alleles, and small indels as the diploid number of inserted or deleted basepairs. For the MWU, mutations were considered as a continuous variable such that the somy state was the haploid chromosome state, and CNVs were the haploid copy number times the somy state. The null hypothesis was that there were no significant genetic differences between Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S strains (subject to p&lt;0.01).

Stronger purifying selection should purge deleterious derived alleles more quickly, detected as an excess of nonsynonymous changes relative to synonymous ones, as previously observed for ISC isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>). This signature should be most apparent for derived alleles, which should accumulate at a net rate dependent on the historical effective population sizes and selective coefficients.

The associated ratio R2 denoted the relative rate of homozygous derived allele accumulation between populations. R and R2 should approximate 1 assuming no difference in the strength of selection, and primarily depend on the derived allele frequency per population, so the main confounder was variance in historical effective population sizes among ISC populations. To calculate confidence intervals for these R values that take into account correlation between neighbouring sites, we used a Weighted Block Jackknife by splitting the SNPs according to chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busing et al., 1999</xref>) to counter the extensive linkage disequilibrium between SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>): discrete chromosomal blocks may still be linked.

The 'ISC1-191 lineage' refers to fixed homozygous SNPs between all of the core population and all of ISC1. The 'ISC2-183 lineage' refers to fixed homozygous SNPs between ISC2 (Bangladesh) and ISC3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 and ungrouped isolates (India or Nepal). (<bold>b</bold>) Number of SNPs unique to each population or lineage. SNPs were determined as unique where their intraspecific frequency was &gt;0.95 and &lt;0.05 in all other samples (excluding ungrouped samples). The number of samples did not reflect the number of SNPs or haplotypes: haplotype diversity was &gt;0.99 for all groups except ISC7 (0.34). (<bold>c</bold>) Genes ordered by ID with two or more SNPs and π/kb&gt;1. The non-synonymous variant V185M in a NADH-flavin oxidoreductase/NADH oxidase gene (LdBPK_120730) was present here in the ISC1/2/3 as well as previously being observed in Kenyan <italic>L. donovani</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Downing et al., 2012</xref>). 956 genes had at least one SNP, of which 566 had SNPs that were not singletons. Only 63 genes contain ≥2 SNPs and 12 genes contain ≥3 SNPs. (<bold>d</bold>) Mean numbers of SNP differences within and between groups. Rows and columns denote comparisons: within populations, the mean number of SNPs between strain pairs (π) is shown; and between populations, the mean number of SNPs between samples from each population is given. Within the core population, there was an excess of singletons (Tajima’s D=-2.2, p&lt;0.01, Fu and Li's D=-0.78, Fu and Li’s F=-1.87: the values were the same with either JPCM5 or LV9 as the outgroup). 62.6% of SNPs occurred in one sample only and the correlation of the number of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs per sample was small (r<sup>2</sup>=0.005). 291 distinct haplotypes out of a maximum possible of 382 were resolved in the phased SNPs, with a resulting haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.994. Nepalese samples were on average more diverse compared to the Indian ones (π=84.3 per Mb vs 66.5, Hd=0.996 vs 0.982). ISC6 was restricted to Nepal (π=12.2 per Mb). (<bold>e</bold>) Branch distances between groups using the 2 population (f2) statistic. The scaled correlation in allele frequencies were computed for each reference group (top row) and groups (first column). ISC9 and ISC10 were examined together as one group. The distribution of allele sharing across ISC3/4/5/6 in subsets of trios was compared to that for ISC2 using F-statistics. The relative pairwise correlation in allele frequencies between populations using the f2 test indicated ISC2 as the most consistently divergent population and also highlighted distinctive allele frequencies in the recently emerged Indian ISC7 group. In contrast, groups with possible admixture (ISC9 and ISC10) had much shorter branch lengths. (<bold>f</bold>) f4 ratios for candidate admixed populations for mixture from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7.Each ratio was computed as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>4</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mtext>(A,outgroup;B,X)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>4</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mtext>(A,outgroup;B,ISC5)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> with A and B as either ISC6 or ISC7. Populations X were the 6 samples identified as possible mixtures of the ancestors of ISC5 and ISC6/7: BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, and BHU572cl3. The gene flow from ISC5 was the f4 ratio and that from B (ISC6 or ISC7) was 1-f4. As expected, if ISC6 and 7 grouped together relative to other groups (f4&gt;0). f4 statistics were considered to support a particular relationship between four individual isolates if 0.05&lt;f4&lt;0.05. ISC2 clustered with ISC3 much more frequently (66.7%) than any other (ISC4, ISC5, ISC6 all 22.2% each). ISC3 had drift patterns more similar to ISC4 (44.4%) than ISC6 (22.2%) or ISC5 (0%). ISC4 had greater correlation with ISC5 (44.4%) than ISC6 (22.2%). ISC5 and ISC6 had more similar drift in 66.7% of tests. These values are consistent with the relationship (ISC2,(ISC3,(ISC4,(ISC5,ISC6))))) shown by the phylogenetic analysis. Admixture levels were measured for the six ISC5-ISC6/7 hybrids as a single population using f4 ratios with ISC2, ISC3 and ISC4 as outgroups. The six hybrids were BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2 and BHU572cl3. The fraction of ancestry attributed to ISC5 was 54–56% and to ISC6 was 44–46% for ISC5-ISC6 mixing, and the alternative ISC5-ISC7 mixture had ISC5 at 59–61% and ISC7 at 39–41%. (<bold>g</bold>) Diagnostic SNPs for ISC7. 20 mutations were unique to ISC7 compared to the other genetically homogeneous populations (ISC2/3/4/6/7/8/9/10) with a ISC7 frequency &gt;0.98 and a non-ISC7 frequency &lt;0.02. Six were nonsynonymous. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in ISC7. SNPs were assigned to the 5’ and 3’ UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). ISC7 was a recent radiation restricted to India (π=1.8 per Mb). (<bold>h</bold>) Diagnostic SNPs for ISC5. 32 mutations were unique to ISC5 compared to the other genetically homogeneous populations (ISC2/3/4/6/7/8/9/10), with ISC5 frequency &gt;0.95 and a non-ISC5 frequency &lt;0.05. Eight changes were nonsynonymous. *Nine were previously associated with antimonial resistance, including four samples from this ISC5 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>): six of these would change the amino acid sequence. SNPs were assigned to the 5’ and 3’ UTR if they are within 1 Kb of the start or end of the gene (respectively). (<bold>i</bold>) Diagnostic SNPs for disomic clade within ISC5. 16 diagnostic SNPs unique to a subset of the ISC5 associated with an expansion of disomic strains from polysomic ancestors (BHU1216/0, BHU239/0, BHU271/0, BHU267/0, BHU800/1, BBU269/0, and BHU273/0). Each SNP had a read-depth allele frequency &gt;0.978 within this group and a frequency &lt;0.04 in the other strains not in this group. These SNPs coincided with a distinct chromosome copy number pattern in this group. Ref is the reference genome BPK282/0cl4 allele and Var is the observed derived one. (<bold>j</bold>) Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and SNP density across chromosomes in the core population. LD was computed as the r<sup>2</sup> values between SNP pairs. SD is the standard deviation. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous (het) mutations per chromosome across all 191 samples is shown. LD was markedly higher for chromosome 31, and lower for 1, 6, 7, 8 and 10. The number of recombinant pairs was largest on chr31 (469), which had the highest somy level and was the most SNP-dense chromosome. (<bold>k</bold>) A genomic map of SNPs in the core population whose ancestry could be assigned to a population. Using the 191x6 ChromoPainter model, the 610 ancestry-informative SNPs were examined to highlight those with probabilities of being donated given ISC group was &gt;0.4: ISC2 (gold), ISC3 (grey), ISC4 (red), ISC5 (green), ISC6 (blue) and ISC7 (light blue). The representative samples used for the 191x6 ChromoPainter model were BD09 (ISC2), NEP123/6 (ISC3), BPK087/0cl1 (ISC4), BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5), BPK282/0cl4 (ISC6) and BHU200/0 (ISC7). SNPs with probabilities &lt;0.4 are uncoloured. For chr32 and chr35, most recombinant pairs could be attributed to the eight ungrouped hybrid isolates. (<bold>l</bold>) Number and heterozygosity of ancestry-informative SNPs per isolate. The number of homozygous (hom) and heterozygous (het) SNPs distinguishing each core sample (191 total) from six representative samples from each genetically distinct ISC population: ISC2 (BD09), ISC3 (NEP123/6), ISC4 (BPK087/0cl1), ISC5 (BPK275/0cl18), ISC6 (BPK282/0cl4) and ISC7 (BHU200/0). There were 610 informative SNPs with an ancestry probability threshold &gt;0.4. The relative ratio of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs denoted the genetic relatedness of the strains. Samples possessing recent common ancestry with the representative strains had few homozygous SNPs but the same rate of heterozygous SNPs compared to other representative samples. Similarly, samples possessing recent common ancestry with multiple representative samples had fewer homozygous SNPs and no change in the heterozygous SNPs. This was apparent for highlighted ungrouped samples BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5/6/7: green and blue); and BHU744/0, BHU774/0 (ISC6/7: blue). In many groups haplotype segments were shared across isolates widely separated in sampling date. For example, in ISC3, 35 haplotype segments were shared between NEP123/6 (2004), BPK507/0 (December 2009), BPK515/0, BPK518/0 and BPK519/0 (all February 2010); 53 haplotype segments were shared between BPK157/0cl5 (October 2002) and BPK602/0 (February 2011) (both ISC9); 44 between BPK280/0 (August 2003) and BPK615/0 (March 2011; both ungrouped); 31 between BHU274/0 (ungrouped, August 2007) with BHU1199/0 (ISC9, November 2010). (<bold>m</bold>) Distribution of copying probabilities of SNPs in two representative isolates. Expected copying probabilities from Chromopainter assigning ancestry to SNPs from BHU581/0 (Ungrouped, left) and BPK275/0cl18 (ISC5, right) using probabilities derived from a model assigning SNP ancestry to representative samples from ISC2/3/4/5/6/7. Each column shows the percentage of SNPs assigned to each percentage probability of being donated from each population (eg ISC2) for a particular sample (eg BHU581/0). If many SNPs had high probabilities of being donated from a particular population, this implied that sample shared a recent ancestor with that population. BHU581/0 was a putative ISC5/6/7 hybrid, and had 9.4% of its SNPs with ancestry from ISC6 or ISC7, 7.2% from ISC7, and 10.9% from ISC5. In contrast, BPK275/0cl18 was the representative sample for ISC5, and 44.3% of its SNPs had confident ancestry from ISC5. No SNPs from any comparison were assigned probabilities between 50–95%, hence these rows are omitted from the table. These ancestry patterns indicated that BPK035/0cl1-BPK043/0cl2, BHU1011/0-BHU770/0cl1, BPK280/0-BPK615/0 and BPK158/0cl9 represented ISC4-related isolates but not mixtures. BHU774/0 and BHU744/0, showed evidence of both ISC6- and ISC7-derived segments. The six ungrouped samples (BHU274/0, BHU815/0, BHU764/0cl1, BHU574cl4, BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2) were sampled between February 2007 and February 2010 and had high numbers of heterozygous SNPs. High heterozygosity could be symptomatic of genetically distinct parents in a hybrid. For example, if BHU572cl3 and BHU581cl2 (both May 2009) were mixes of ISC5 (BHU573/0, May 2009) and ISC7 (BHU200/0, July 2006) then only 16 out of 280 genotypes (BHU572cl3) and 15 out of 278 genotypes (BHU581cl2) would be unexplained. This was evaluated for different haplotype sharing options and matched the timing of samples (BHU572cl3, BHU574cl4 and BHU581cl2 in relation to BHU573/0; BHU815/0 in relation to BHU816/0). SNPs assigned to populations with a high probability in the 191x6 model provided a framework for predicting strain membership as well as admixture. Comparing the relative difference in distributions of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs between candidate parents within the sample set was sufficient to identify shared ancestry where related lineages were sampled, and visible in the aligned genotypes of the six strains with segments of both ISC5 and ISC6 ancestry. (<bold>n</bold>) Percentage of haplotype segment copies shared within and between groups. Recipients are shown as columns and donors as rows. Groups with complex ancestries received more segments than they donated: ISC8 from ISC5, ISC6 and ISC7; ISC3, ISC9 and ISC10 from ISC5. These 'recipient' groups were also associated with long external branch lengths in phylogenies. The expected probability per SNP in each population for the 191x191 co-ancestry analysis indicated that strains assigned to populations by Structure were assigned the same one with FineStructure (ISC2/3/4/5/6/7): ISC2 (copying probability &gt;99%), ISC3 (&gt;97%), ISC4 (&gt;98%), ISC5 (&gt;99%), ISC6 (&gt;90%) and ISC7 (&gt;97%). Genetically heterogeneous groups showed a higher rate of segments were received than donated from specific populations: ISC8 from ISC5 (11.3% vs 1.7%), ISC6 (16.6% vs 4.7%) and ISC7 (16.5% vs 6.2%). ISC9 (10.0% vs 0.8%) and ISC10 also received more from ISC5 (11.1% vs 2.5%). ISC5 also donated more to ISC3 (11.0% v 1.9%) suggesting possible ancestral genetic exchange, which may be associated with the long branch lengths leading to ISC3. (<bold>o</bold>) Four-gamete test for recombination. Four gamete tests showed evidence of recombination in the core population and ISC1. 2043 from 117,055 (1.75%) SNP pairs had a recombination signature in the core population. For the subset of 2,015 SNPs with no missing data R=0.7/Mb. The 8 hybrids were BHU815/0, BHU764A1, BHU274/0, BHU574cl4, BHU581cl2, BHU572cl3 (all ISC5+ISC6/7), BHU744/0 and BHU774/0 (both ISC6/7 only). Recombination was evident at 25% of SNPs in ISC1 (184,827 out of 739,581 SNP pairs) based on the four gamete test. This signature varied over 13-fold from chr31 (54.2% of pairs) to chr23 (4%). (<bold>p</bold>) SNP and indel association with Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance. Fisher exact tests evaluated the association of Sb<sup>V</sup>-resistance with SNPs (coded as the number of derived mutations: 0, 1 or 2) and indels (coded as the diploid number of inserted or deleted (-) basepairs). (<bold>q</bold>) SNP association with in-vitro SSG phenotype. SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes for which the absolute difference in SSG-R and SSG-S allele frequency was &gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4 and Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli corrected t-test p value &lt;0.005. SNPs are ordered by chromosome and position. The SSG phenotypes were assessed as ln(EC50) values for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. To avoid arbitrarily categorising the sample in vitro Sb<sup>V</sup> phenotypes as R and S using a given threshold EC50 value, we compared the log-scaled EC50 values of each allele pair at the 57 SNPs identified using t-tests (p&lt;0.005): the Sb<sup>V</sup>-R alleles had log-scaled EC50 values of 1.13–1.84 compared to S ones of 0.01–0.50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consequently, the 57 SNPs together have power to differentiate Sb<sup>V</sup>-R and Sb<sup>V</sup>-S phenotypes. (<bold>r</bold>) SNP association with clinical outcome from SSG treatment. SNPs with derived alleles in multiple ISC groups with 6+ non-reference genotypes for which the absolute difference in SSG-cure and SSG-failure allele frequency was &gt;0.1 with the OR (odds ratio) &gt;4. The SNPs are ordered by chromosome and position. The SSG phenotypes were assessed for the derived (D) and reference (R) alleles. We examined lines for which the patient was treated with SSG and was either cured (n=21) or treatment failed (n=14: death, relapse, no response to treatment) to test a null hypothesis that SSG outcome and SNPs were unlinked. An alternative hypothesis was that SSG-cure patients could be infected with Sb<sup>V</sup>-S parasites, and SSG-fail with Sb<sup>V</sup>-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). 32 SNPs were associated with SSG cure (OR&gt;4), including 11 nonsynonymous SNPs, but none at a significant level due to the small sample size. (<bold>s</bold>) Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations. Relative strength of purifying selection between ISC populations (columns 1 and 2) as ascertained as the relative rate of accumulation of derived alleles computed as R for all (top), nonsynonymous (middle) and synonymous (bottom) sites. We tested for differential selective pressures among the ISC groups where observed values of R statistics deviated by at least four standard errors (SE) from the expected value of 1 (Do et al 2015). The genome-wide values are shown along with the weighted block jackknife confidence intervals (lower, median, upper). Derived alleles were more frequent in ISC4 than ISC5, suggesting stronger purifying selection in ISC5. Comparing ISC2 (Bangladesh) to ISC3-7 (Nepal/India), we found a genome-wide (RG) excess of derived alleles had accumulated in the latter (RG=0.74, 6.15*SE). This was not directly attributable to selection because the difference was present in both nonsynonymous (RN=0.59, 4.42*SE) or synonymous sites (RS=0.66, 10.82*SE). ISC3/4/5/6 shared genetic ancestors dating to approximately the same origin, so a comparison of their rates should indicate variation in the relative accrual of derived alleles. Despite possessing the largest sample size (n=52) of all ISC populations, ISC5 gained significantly fewer derived alleles genome-wide compared to ISC3 (RG=0.75, 11.39*SE), ISC4 (RG=0.65, 7.37*SE) and to a lesser extent, ISC6 (RG=0.82, 3.38*SE). This trend was present in both nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs but not significant for most comparisons (an exception was comparing synonymous changes in ISC5 vs ISC4 (RS=0.37, 7.80*SE). Similarly, the rate of accumulation of homozygous derived SNPs (R2 values) was higher in ISC4 relative to ISC5 (R2G=0.90, 3.87*SE). Antimonial in vitro resistance was highest in ISC5 (ln[EC50]=1.38 ± 1.45) and lowest in ISC4 (0.13 ± 1.12). Consequently, the relative difference in the rate of accumulation of derived alleles in ISC5 that was predominantly isolated in India may reflect different exposure to drug selection compared to ISC4 (mainly from Nepal). Further work is required to quantify this in relation to variable antimonial resistance levels among samples in each population. ISC7 was a genetic subgroup of ISC6 that may be a recent radiation or have undergone a substantial population bottleneck. No genome-wide difference was evident in terms of selction, but fewer derived synonymous SNPs were found in ISC6 (RS=2.18, 4.44*SE), suggestive stronger hitchhiking of alleles in ISC7.

The main premise was that no SNP caller was <italic>a priori</italic> superior, and that errors among calling tools tended to differ across sites, whereas true variants showed a concordant signal. This approach avoided systematic errors unique to each individual SNP caller by examining their consistency and identifying discordant mutations symptomatic of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weisenfeld et al., 2014</xref>). These disparities among callers arise from their differing strategies for tackling repetitive regions, ambiguous read mapping probabilities and alignments, low complexity regions, tandem repeats, inversions, translocations and regions in which genuine repeats are collapsed in the reference assembly. By combining this with population-level information to scale the prior probability of a mutation existing at a known SNP site, COCALL is optimised for variant discovery in a largely unknown population. This integrated variant discovery scheme inferred sample genotypes both dependently and independently of other samples, which may mitigate bias in rare variant discovery: dependent approaches miss true SNPs and independent ones include many false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2014</xref>). COCALL was particularly effective when samples were genetically homogenous and the sequence quality and read depth among samples was uniform, as in this study. When these conditions were not met, COCALL was less effective, and population-based methods implemented in GATK, Freebayes or Samtools Mpileup performed better because these methods identified base variations based on aggregated depth across the population, and were less affected by lower quality sequence runs. Computational time for running COCALL may become prohibitively long for samples with high genetic diversity.</p><p>This scheme applied five different mutation detection approaches and computed the support for each base variation. COCALL interpreted the results of FreeBayes v0.9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>), GATK 2.0-38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>), Samtools Pileup v0.1.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and Samtools Mpileup v0.1.18 based on reads mapped with Smalt v5.7, and also Cortex v1.0.5.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iqbal et al., 2012</xref>) based on its own assembly and mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s24" sec-type="appendix"><title>2 Attributes of SNP callers used by COCALL</title><p>1) Cortex was used as a de novo assembly haplotype-based SNP caller and offered an independent assessment of SNPs because it did not rely on read alignment and mapping by Smalt. For SNP calling, we merged SNPs with scores ≥2.5 identified on the current reference with de Bruijn graphs with k-mers of 31 and 63 bases; the latter were structurally more accurate at a cost of nucleotide level accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iqbal et al., 2012</xref>). This approach detected fewer SNPs overall than other methods, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weisenfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Cortex depended on de novo assemblies, so its accuracy was lower for repetitive regions and collapsed repeats. Cortex did not provide strand bias information, so the strand bias of Cortex SNPs was calculated from based on corresponding strand information from Pileup.</p><p>2) Freebayes applied a Bayesian strategy for SNP calling and was used to discover potential SNPs with SNP scores ≥50 using default parameters for strand bias and read depth. Unlike other SNP callers, it detected variation based on the local haplotype across the read length, and so was superior for variant calling at regions with short repeats. It required disomic chromosomes: but for this study this limitation did not affect SNP calling because no strict additional parameters for SNP calling were applied to allow it identify rare variants.</p><p>3) GATK provided two SNP calling methods: one for individual samples, and one based on a population of related samples (GATK population caller). A SNP score threshold &gt;50 was used for both. For our sample set, GATK had comparatively lower power to find SNPs at duplicated loci, and the base quality recalibration (BQR) scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>) was not applicable due to the low number of known SNPs for training and the low total number of high-frequency candidate SNPs.</p><p>4) Samtools Mpileup was applied with a SNP score ≥20, and called fewer SNPs near indels compared to GATK and Freebayes. It assumed disomy, inferred SNPs across a population of samples, and ultimately had a lower false positive rate.</p><p>5) Samtools Pileup had a lower SNP detection power at regions with low read coverage, at gaps, and near indels. However, Pileup was more accurate at high-coverage regions with lower mapping quality and produced fewer false positives. Here, it was used for candidate SNPs with a base quality &gt;20 and &gt;10% of reads supporting a SNP being on both the forward and reverse strands to reduce strand bias which was calculated based on pileup read depth. 11.5% of all candidate SNPs had significant strand bias such that the proportion of either forward or reverse reads was &gt;90%, and 4% had reads only for forward or for reverse strands.</p></sec><sec id="s25" sec-type="appendix"><title>3 Screening and consensus SNP calling in populations</title><p>Candidate SNPs with mapping qualities of ≥40 across all five callers were retained: approximately 52% of candidate SNPs were excluded due to low base, SNP or mapping quality values. SNPs at sites with normalised read depth ≤0.5 or depth ≥1.75 or with multiple derived alleles across the five callers were excluded. 1.75 was used as the upper read depth limit instead of 2.0, which is often usedas a criterion for duplication, because SNP callers estimated read depth based on base and mapping quality, so even true duplicated regions tended to have depth &lt;2.0. In addition, SNPs present in clusters of more than three per seven bp window were removed as likely to be associated with tandem repeats, small indels and other sequence artefacts. The modal read depth coverage for each candidate SNP site across the core population was 49-fold, and the minimum modal read depth in any of the core population was 14-fold: 1,986,930 genotypes were computed in total.</p><p>A panel of 90 sequencing libraries from each of three well-characterised isolates (BPK282, BPK275 and BPK087) representing three major groups from our core population that were generated as part of this study were used to calibrate the SNP calling across the population. The metric of the mean number of callers per candidate SNP site was determined for the entire set of 300 libraries. Candidate SNP sites in lower complexity regions were accepted when the mean number of callers ≥3.5; those in non-masked regions were kept where the mean number of callers ≥2.5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl1">Table A1.1</xref>); those in hard-masked regions were omitted. These criteria resulted in a SNP set supported by a mean of 4.5 callers per SNP. An additional screening condition on the sum of the individual SNP caller score (&gt;380) was applied to some lower quality runs (for isolates BHU569A1, BHU572A1, BHU574A1, BHU575A1, BHU581A1, BHU592A1, BHU741A1, BHU764A1, BHU770A1, BHU777A1, BHU782A1, BHU814A1, BPK031A1, BPK091A1, BPK157A1, BPK164A1, BPK406A1 and BPK512A1).<table-wrap id="A1-tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12613.019</object-id><label>Table A1.1.</label><caption><p>Number of putative SNPs detected by different numbers of SNP calling tools.

We calculated Ti/Tv ratios for variants in the core population of 191 (plus one additional closely related sample, BHU1087/0). We find that SNP calls supported by multiple callers had higher Ti/Tv ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl6">Table A1.6</xref>), with the highest ratio for SNPs called by all five callers (2.74). Ti/Tv ratios consistently differed between singletons, doubletons and non-rare variants regardless of SNP caller: for SNPs called by all five methods, non-rare variants had higher rates (Ti/Tv=7267/1914=3.80) than doubletons (558/298=1.87) or singletons (1316/1124=1.17), as expected if singleton variants are more likely to be false positives. Ti/Tv ratios of non-rare SNPs were much higher than singleton SNPs across SNP sets called by Cortex-Mpileup (3.61 vs 0.91), Cortex-Pileup (3.08 vs 0.79), Cortex-GATK (2.26 vs 0.53), and Cortex-Freebayes (1.51 vs 0.40). While non-protozoan inter-species comparisons find a Ti/Tv ratio of 2.0–2.1 for genome-wide datasets and 3.0–3.3 for coding SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebersberger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freudenberg-Hua et al., 2003</xref>), we find higher Ti/Tv ratios at non-coding regions than coding regions, irrespective of SNP caller(s) used. Moreover, this effect was higher for high-confidence SNPs such as those called by all five callers and those present in multiple isolates. For example, for SNPs called by all five calling tools, all variants: coding Ti/Tv=4154/1736=2.39 vs non-coding 4987/1600=3.12; non-rare SNPs: coding 3285/1033=3.18 vs non-coding 3982/881=4.52; singleton SNPs: coding 617/565=1.09 vs non-coding 699/559=1.15.<table-wrap id="A1-tbl6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12613.024</object-id><label>Table A1.6.</label><caption><p>The transition (Ti) and transversion (Tv) mutation rates and Ti/Tv ratio across five SNP callers (Cortex, Freebayes, GATK, Samtools Mpileup, Samtools Pileup).

For CNV detection, we also considered CNV length along with depth because long heterozygous deletions or duplications were observed that could be reliably identified at lower depth than shorter variants. Therefore we used three different depth thresholds: for CNVs of 2 to 5 kb, the threshold was five times the standard deviation of the chromosomal depth; for CNVs of 5 to 20 kb, the threshold was three times this value; for CNVs of &gt;20 kb, the threshold was 1.5 times this value.</p><p>Adjacent CNV pairs in individual samples were combined when two nearby CNVs were located within 1/3 of the length of the longer of the two CNVs, because two independent adjacent CNVs would be a less parsimonious pattern. When a CNV pairwise distance was calculated, common boundaries of a given CNV among the samples were assigned to include every start and end of the CNV of each strain, and then the depth was calculated for each CNV range. Boundaries of CNVs were manually checked and CNVs overlapping large gaps were excluded. Candidate CNVs in the first 300 bp and last 5 Kb of all chromosomes were excluded.

To count allele frequency of indels at AQP1 more precisely, we used Smalt v7.1 that can map reads around indels more accurately by locating indels at the same base position for both forward and reverse strands.

The correlation coefficients of SNPs with indels and CNVs with SNPs were consistently large in all sample sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A2-tbl2">Table A2.2</xref>).<table-wrap id="A2-tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12613.026</object-id><label>Table A2.2.</label><caption><p>Pearson’s correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) between SNP, CNV, indels and somy diversity.

In the present study, each read was mapped to its most similar region in the reference, and where reads could be mapped with equal mapping scores to multiple locations, one position was selected randomly to quantify read depth, in contrast to the previous study in which read depth was under-estimated by only using uniquely-mapped reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>). A threshold of 1.5 times the haploid depth was used to identify duplicated genes (a more conservative threshold of 2.0 did not change results materially). This threshold of 1.5 was effective for Illumina Hiseq data, where fluctuations in read depth were smaller than those previously seen using the Illumina Genome Analyser II. To illustrate this, the normalised standard deviation (standard deviation divided by average chromosome depth) of 17 strains sequenced by Genome Analyser II in was 0.32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downing et al., 2011</xref>), and in the current analysis, using Illumina Hiseq 2000 data, this was 0.19. We were therefore able to quantify more subtle depth variation than previous analyses. To normalise for differences in chromosome lengths, the number of duplicated genes was expressed per unit chromosome with a length set to that of chromosome 1. Results from between-species analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>) have previously suggested a link between somy variation and copy number variation.

It brings comprehensively together various threads of the studies on the genetic diversity of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> isolates, genetic evolution, clinical response to drugs and drug susceptibility and resistance. The merit of this work is both the in depth analysis and in the unique strain collection that was subjected to sequencing</p><p>The authors have elegantly shown the power of genomic epidemiology. They have also linked their analysis to antimonial resistance, a phenotype that is widespread in part of India and hence the findings are of considerable importance for our knowledge of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the India Nepal focus. While much of the underlying sequence data has been described elsewhere (Downing et al., 2011, 2012), the sophisticated analyses presented here on the genetic diversity and evolution is of great importance to understand the biology of these understand the biology of these parasites.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a need for update on the VL situation in India and Nepal, which is no longer an epidemic, rather a picture of declining numbers of patients (see Abstract and Introduction).</p><p>2) Abstract: there is little evidence that Sb resistance has driven the epidemic, as opposed to historic known cycles of diseases, when later (Results, sixth paragraph etc.) it is stated that there is no statistical association between SNPs distribution and drug resistance.</p><p>3) Discussion, last paragraph: the statement that this data provides basis for prospective study on emerging drug resistance and surveillance is not justified by the data or results presented.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Sample phenotyping”/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>: it is clear from the paper that this definition of resistance and susceptible is based upon that used in previous publications by the group. However, the use of a single concentration value, in this case the EC50 value, is not valid to define any difference between 2 populations. In the case of only a 3-fold difference, which could be within bounds of experimental variation, this even less valid.</p><p>5) As acknowledged by the authors, many resistant isolates (outside ISC5 group) do not have mutations in AQP1 and some sensitive isolates of the ISC5 group (but also one of the ungrouped category) also have SNPs in AQP1. Thus the correlation between AQP1 and susceptibility is not perfect, even if its stands as a strong candidate. Ideally this hypothesis would get a lot of support if the authors could either introduce a WT version of AQP1 in strain with SNPs (with CRISPR/CAS this would be possible) or possibly less technically challenging introduce a WT and mutated episomal version of AQP1 in a sensitive and resistant isolates and look at the phenotype.</p><p>6) As far as I know AQP1 is a transporter of SbIII (not SbV). SbV is used for treating <italic>Leishmania</italic>. While they are potential explanations, this needs to be explained.</p><p>7) How is this study comparing to their 2011 Genome Research paper? In other words have they missed at the time the AQP1 SNPs or all their resistant isolates have a different resistance mechanism?</p><p>8) In the sixth paragraph of the Results section they indicate that all 52 ISC5 strains has a SNP in AQP1. It is unfortunate that they do not have the data on susceptibility for a majority of these strains (this would have helped in linking SNPs and phenotype).</p><p>9) I believe that the authors should not discount the role of the increase in copy number of the H locus as a determinant of resistance to SbV.

The data shown in the Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) is not supporting an increase in copy number of 20-30. One would even expect a change in size of the chromosome if they were that many intrachromosomal amplification. A control probe would be helpful.

However, the current formulation has clearly misled at least one reader, and we have reformulated this to now read:</p><p>”The data we present here provide baseline information on the diversity of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> in the ISC that will contribute to future studies of drug resistance and epidemiology of this population. Our results show the promise of genomic surveillance for other <italic>Leishmania</italic> populations, where patient symptoms, the parasites involved and the main treatment modalities all differ from those in the ISC (Sundar &amp; Chakravarty, 2015).”</p><p>We hope this is more specific and accurate, and at least reasonably uncontroversial as now written.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Sample phenotyping”/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref></italic>: <italic>it is clear from the paper that this definition of resistance and susceptible is based upon that used in previous publications by the group. However, the use of a single concentration value, in this case the EC50 value, is not valid to define any difference between 2 populations. In the case of only a 3-fold difference, which could be within bounds of experimental variation, this even less valid.</italic> </p><p>We agree that EC50 values alone are not sufficient to define resistance and susceptibility. To make this clearer, we have added an additional column to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> showing the Activitiy Indices (AI) we used to define SSG susceptibility. These AI are a normalized way to express in vitro drug susceptibility, based on the EC50 value of that strain divided by the EC50 of a reference sensitive strain used in each assay (see Rijal et al., 2007, Microbes Infect 9: 529-35), and do not vary continuously between tested isolates, but are rather bimodal, with most strains showing an AI ≤1 (thus with an EC50 similar or lower than that of a reference sensitive strain) or ≥6 (thus with an EC50 6 times higher than the one of the reference sensitive strain). A few (7) strains show intermediate values (all around 3 or 4), many of which are explained as being the hybrids between R and S strains described in the paper. These AI values thus allow us to classify most isolates into ‘resistant’ and ‘sensitive’ classes.</p><p>This should have been explained more fully in the manuscript. We have amended the table and added to the text as follows:</p><p>“The classification into resistance and susceptible strains was determined by calculating the activity index (AI), i.e. the ratio of the EC50 of the strain in question versus the EC50 of the susceptible reference strain. AI values clustered strongly, with most strains showing an AI ≤1 (25; classified as SSG-sensitive) or ≥6 (18; classified as SSG- resistant). A few strains (7) showed AI values around 3 and were considered as showing intermediate resistance.”</p><p><italic>5) As acknowledged by the authors, many resistant isolates (outside ISC5 group) do not have mutations in AQP1 and some sensitive isolates of the ISC5 group (but also one of the ungrouped category) also have SNPs in AQP1. Thus the correlation between AQP1 and susceptibility is not perfect, even if its stands as a strong candidate. Ideally this hypothesis would get a lot of support if the authors could either introduce a WT version of AQP1 in strain with SNPs (with CRISPR/CAS this would be possible) or possibly less technically challenging introduce a WT and mutated episomal version of AQP1 in a sensitive and resistant isolates and look at the phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We agree, of course, that this experimental confirmation would be ideal but we feel that this is beyond the scope of the population genetic analysis we have performed here and represents a substantial additional body of work, and – as the reviewer acknowledges – that the AQP1 deletion is a strong candidate without this validation. We argue that the originality of our study in the context of drug resistance is to show that a frameshift in this known SSG-R associated locus is fixed in a major subgroup of the ISC <italic>L. donovani</italic> population, and heterozygous in some hybrids with intermediate drug resistance phenotypes.</p><p>While the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been employed for <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, only two laboratories have, to our knowledge, published successful results with this technique in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Many other groups are no doubt attempting to establish this approach, but we note that this is still some years from being a routine tool in this genus: for example, none of the groups contributing to this paper have experience with these tools in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. These approaches are likely to be made more challenging by the tetrasomy of chromosome 31 that carries the AQP1 locus. While episomal expression of different AQP1 alleles is likely to be more tractable, this approach is less likely to be completely definitive, and similar experiments have been performed by other labs:</p><p>Plourde et al., 2015, MBP: “The AQP1-null mutant was resistant to antimonyl tartrate (SbIII) and arsenite (AsIII) due to a decrease import of these metalloids.”</p><p>Monte-Neto et al., 2015, PLOS-NTD: “All mutants also displayed a reduced accumulation of antimony mainly due to genomic alterations at the level of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 31 harboring the gene coding for the aquaglyceroporin 1”.</p><p>Mandal et al., 2010, JAC: “Transfection of the AQP1 gene in a sodium antimony gluconate-resistant field isolate conferred susceptibility to the resistant isolate<italic>”.</italic></p><p>We already mention some of this work, but now include a reference to the Plourde et al. paper to further emphasise this evidence, adding the sentence:</p><p>“Recently, an AQP1 knockout line of <italic>Leishmania</italic> major was shown to be resistant to Sb<sup>III</sup> due to reduced uptake (Plourde et al. 2015).”</p><p>It is true that some resistant isolates do not show the indel in AQP1, and we are careful not to claim that this mutation is responsible for all resistance to antimonial drugs in this population. For example, a previous study on parasites we assign to the ISC4 group (with a wild-type AQP1 locus) has shown that these have decreased transcription of AQP1 (BPK087 and BPK190; Decuypere et al., 2005, AAC 49: 4616-21), and one isolate (BHU764, which is not in any of the main groups) has a different indel mutation in AQP1, and shows low mRNA expression of this locus, but also shows high expression of MRPA, an efflux transporter of SbIII (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011. Int J Parasitol. 41:1311-21). We have added a sentence to emphasise this point, which we already make in the paper (Results, sixth paragraph):</p><p>”Indeed, other Sb<sup>V</sup> resistance mechanisms are known in this population: previous work has shown that two resistant strains from ISC4 (BPK087 and BPK190) show significantly decreased transcription of an AQP1 locus encoding a wildtype protein sequence (Decuypere et al., 2005), and BHU764 combines a different indel mutation in AQP1 and reduced expression of MRPA, an efflux transporter of Sb<sup>III</sup> (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011).”</p><p><italic>6) As far as I know AQP1 is a transporter of SbIII (not SbV). SbV is used for treating Leishmania. While they are potential explanations, this needs to be explained.</italic> </p><p>We agree, and this should have been explained for the reader. We have now added a sentence explaining the link between SbV and SbIII in the sixth paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>“While recent antimonial drugs such as SSG are compounds of pentavalent antimony (Sb<sup>V</sup>), Sb<sup>V</sup> is thought to act mostly as a pro-drug, being reduced to SbIII in both the macrophage phagolysosome (Frézard et al., 2001) and in the parasite itself (Denton et al., 2004; Decuypere et al., 2012).”</p><p>We also noticed in this context that we don’t define SSG in the manuscript, and have added a few words to address this oversight:</p><p>“[…] initially with quinine, then with the trivalent antimonial Sb<sup>III</sup> (1915) and compounds of the less toxic pentavalent Sb<sup>V</sup> (1922) such as sodium stibogluconate (SSG)”</p><p> <italic>7) How is this study comparing to their 2011 Genome Research paper? In other words have they missed at the time the AQP1 SNPs or all their resistant isolates have a different resistance mechanism?</italic></p><p>We think there are a number of reasons why the AQP1 two-base indel was not detected at the time we wrote the 2011 Genome Research paper. Sequence data from 5 ISC5 isolates (all resistant) were available at that time, and these were sequenced using a different technology – using Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAII) technology rather than the HiSeq platform available now. These platforms differ in read length (76-base reads rather than 100-base reads) and differ in both the polymerase error rate and sequencing throughput, reflected in lower read coverage available for these isolates in 2011. In addition, the variant detection algorithms developed at that time (pre-2011) were focused on accurate SNP-calling, and we used an off-the-shelf approach implemented in the samtools package for identifying indels that are now thought to be prone to generating ambiguous putative indels as the now standard approach of locally re-aligning reads near indel positions was not established at that time. Our new study directly addresses this limitation by applying an independent de novo assembler (Cortex) to improve indel detection and verification by local read re-alignment. In addition, it applies a superior read-mapping approach with Smalt that has a much reduced error rate compared to the 2011 implementation with Ssaha2. We also augmented the Cortex-based approach with indel calling for individual libraries with Samtools Mpileup, for populations with GATK, and using a distinct alignment algorithm with FreeBayes. The combination of many more ISC5 samples and better sequencing and analysis technology has allowed us to detect this very small indel.</p><p><italic>8) In the sixth paragraph of the Results section they indicate that all 52 ISC5 strains has a SNP in AQP1. It is unfortunate that they do not have the data on susceptibility for a majority of these strains (this would have helped in linking SNPs and phenotype).</italic> </p><p>In vitro susceptibility tests are time-consuming in <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> and particularly difficult to apply on clinical isolates as the in vitro growth behaviour of isolates differs. High quality and standardized phenotyping of 50 isolates represents a very significant effort by several laboratories involved in this paper. We note that the number of parasites we phenotype is enough to establish that the distribution of resistance is non-random across population groups in our data. For example, out of ISC5, we tested 11 lines and 9 of them were highly resistant to antimonials (82%); the other group in which we tested the susceptibility in a large set of isolates was ISC4, where we tested 15 isolates and only found 4 resistant (26%); this difference is statistically significant (p=0.0154, Fisher’s exact test two-tailed). As we now note in the paper (Edits in response to #5 above) 2 of the resistant isolates found in ISC4 show decreased AQP1 expression with a wild-type amino acid sequence.</p><p><italic>9) I believe that the authors should not discount the role of the increase in copy number of the H locus as a determinant of resistance to SbV. The H locus contains MRPA one of the main antimony resistance genes. This should be discussed in more details and can it help in explaining some of the outliers?</italic> </p><p>We agree this deserved more emphasis, and have added a sentence to reflect this and cite the appropriate evidence:</p><p>“The H-locus includes MRPA, a gene involved in the efflux of Sb<sup>III</sup> and associated with drug resistance (Leprohon et al., 2009).”</p><p>We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and MRPA gene copy number does not appear to explain cases of antimonial resistance outside ISC5. This is in contrast to AQP1, where we see changes in resistant isolates in other groups. We also note that the homozygous frameshift in AQP1 will clearly render this locus non-functional, while the effect of changes in gene dosage are harder to predict. We feel that to really assess the impact of MRPA dosage we would need to investigate both copy number and gene expression in the same samples, preferentially directly in the amastigote stage.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> they indicate 20-30 copy number of MAPK1 gene and indicate that this is intrachromosomal amplification. The data shown in the Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) is not supporting an increase in copy number of 20-30. One would even expect a change in size of the chromosome if they were that many intrachromosomal amplification. A control probe would be helpful. A minor point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (they discuss about episome, rather than intrachromosomal amplification).</p><p>This experiment was not intended to quantify the amplicon, but merely to determine whether the amplification is extra- or intra-chromosomal. If the amplicon was extra-chromosomal, on an episome, we would expect to see a second, much lower band hybridizing with the MPK1 probe, as in panel D of the same figure. We agree that this kind of Southern blot experiment (without controls) is not quantitative, but we are not concerned that these results are in contradiction to our estimated increase in copy number. The MPK1 locus is approximately 15 kb, so the 15 repeats per haploid genome we estimate in BPK282 (around 15) would correspond to around 225 kb, only 8% the length of the 2.7 Mb chromosome 36. In the gels shown in panels A and B, this large chromosome migrates to the so-called compression zone of OFAGE gels where the largest chromosomes co-migrate and where it would be impossible to observe even fairly substantial differences in chromosome size. We think copy number is estimated both far more precisely and more accurately by looking at the depth of ilumina reads mapping to this feature than by looking at either the intensity of hybridization or lengths of molecules migrating on a gel.</p><p>We have corrected the figure legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and thank the reviewer for noticing this error.</p></body></sub-article></article>
