heterochromatin. SUV39H recognizes trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) via its chromodomain (CD), and enriched H3K9me3 allows SUV39H to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. Here we show that Suv39h1’s CD (Suv39h1-CD) binds nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Suv39h1-CD had higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bind nucleic acids was independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Suv39h1 mutational studies indicated that both the nucleic acid–binding and H3K9me–binding activities of Suv39h1-CD were crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. These results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating SUV39H’s target specificity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25317.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25317.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25317.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, animals and fungi store much of their DNA tightly packed with proteins in a form named heterochromatin. This arrangement helps to inactivate genes that are not needed in specific cells or at specific times, and provides a way to protect the genetic material from damage. Heterochromatin tends to form when an enzyme called a lysine methyltransferase chemically modifies some of the proteins associated with the DNA, which are known as histones. This enzyme modifies only some of the histones to get the process started, while a second protein then binds to the modified histones and causes more of the DNA to become packaged up as heterochromatin.</p><p>In 2012, researchers reported that the version of the lysine methyltransferase enzyme from yeast binds to RNA molecules via a portion known as its chromodomain. Moreover, the enzyme needed to bind to RNA to help heterochromatin to form. A similar mechanism also occurs in fruit flies, another organism that is commonly studied in the laboratory. However, it was not clear if it happened in mammals like mice and humans.</p><p>Now, Shirai, Kawaguchi et al. – who include many of the researchers involved in the 2012 study – report that the corresponding enzyme from mice can also bind to RNA molecules via its chromodomain. Further experiments showed that this activity was closely linked with the enzyme’s ability to target the correct histones and efficiently form heterochromatin. The first experiments were conducted using purified enzymes in the laboratory, while follow-up experiments looked at the enzyme’s activity within mouse cells.</p><p>Other studies have previously reported that mutant mice lacking the lysine methyltransferase enzyme have defective heterochromatin, tend to die young and have genetic instabilities that are associated with an increased risk of tumors and male infertility. The new findings of Shirai, Kawaguchi et al. reveal that the mechanism behind the establishment of heterochromatin has mostly likely been conserved over a billion years of evolution, which is when yeast and mammals last shared a common ancestor. By revealing more about how mammalian cells can protect their DNA, these new findings could also mark an important step toward understanding and preventing birth defects that are caused when an embryo’s genetic material becomes damaged.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25317.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25317.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Suv39h1</kwd><kwd>chromodomain</kwd><kwd>HP1</kwd><kwd>pericentromere</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>H3K9 methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12743018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yoshifumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>07022019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Yoshifumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25116005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23114005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakayama</surname><given-names>Jun-ichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26291072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakayama</surname><given-names>Jun-ichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinkai</surname><given-names>Yoichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Suv39h1 chromodomain possesses nucleic acid-binding activity and this activity is coupled with its H3K9 methylation recognition in assembling heterochromatin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterochromatin, a highly condensed chromatin structure, can be divided into two classes: invariably constitutive heterochromatin (CH), and developmentally controlled facultative heterochromatin. CH generally consists of repetitive DNA and is transcriptionally silent, and its higher-order chromatin structure can spread, causing the heritable inactivation of genes adjacent to the CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grewal and Elgin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grewal and Moazed, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richards and Elgin, 2002</xref>). The establishment of CH is tightly correlated with changes in posttranslational histone-tail modifications. The trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which is a hallmark of CH, creates specific binding sites for H3K9me3 reader molecules such as HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lachner and Jenuwein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>), and these epigenetic states are maintained throughout replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margueron and Reinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>). CH is critical for functional chromosomal domains such as the pericentromere, and epigenetic pericentromere layers are important for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and for genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allshire et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). SUV39H (1 and 2), an H3K9me3 methyltransferase in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rea et al., 2000</xref>), targets CH domains and intact transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>). H3K9me3 in the pericentric regions is mainly catalyzed by SUV39H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peters et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, in <italic>Suv39h1/2</italic> double-knockout (<italic>Suv39h</italic> dn) cells, the H3K9me3 levels over the pericentromere are severely diminished and HP1 proteins do not accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The nature of CH and its epigenetic machineries are well conserved in various species, including fission yeast and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>). In fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<italic>S. pombe</italic>), the RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent pathway is essential for pericentric heterochromatin formation and maintenance, and the process of pericentric transcription is coupled with the targeting of the SUV39H homologue Clr4 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel and Martienssen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goto and Nakayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moazed, 2009</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, a similar small-RNA-mediated process promotes transcriptional silencing by H3K9me3 and by HP1A, an HP1-family protein in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel and Martienssen, 2013</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the RNAi-dependent pathway (or another RNA-based mechanism) is involved in the process of establishing and maintaining heterochromatin in mammals, such as in creating target specificities for SUV39H and SUV39H-mediated H3K9me3 formation.</p><p>Suv39h-family proteins have two functionally distinct domains, the N-terminal chromodomain (CD) and the C-terminal SET domain. The CD functions as a binding module that targets H3K9me3 marks, and the SET domain is responsible for SUV39H’s enzymatic activity. Since the N-terminal CD of Clr4 is required for the efficient spread and stable inheritance of H3K9me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), it has been suggested that Suv39/Clr4 uses a direct read-write mechanism to maintain the H3K9me3 marks on CH. However, this mechanism alone is not sufficient for converting H3K9me3-free, naïve chromosomal regions to silent heterochromatin.</p><p>Here we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids, and that this binding is crucial for Suv39h1’s function. Suv39h-CD prefers to bind ssRNA rather than dsDNA, and Suv39h-CD’s nucleic acid binding is independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Mutational analyses revealed that both the nucleic acid- and H3K9me3-binding activities of Suv39h1 are important for its induction of heterochromatin assembly. We also showed that Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> in a manner dependent on its nucleic acid-binding activity and that knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentric heterochromatin. Our data suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to the targeting and retention of Suv39h1 at specific chromosomal regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids</title><p>We recently reported that Chp1, a CD protein functioning in the RNAi pathway in fission yeast, binds nucleic acid via its CD, and that this activity is required for heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>). Experiments in the same study revealed that Clr4, the fission yeast homologue of SUV39H, also binds nucleic acid via its CD, although the importance of Clr4-CD’s nucleic acid binding in heterochromatin assembly remains elusive. Here, to investigate whether Suv39h1 also binds nucleic acids, we produced a GST-fusion protein containing Suv39h1-CD (residues 39–105) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, GST-Suv39h1-CD) and conducted electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed, single-stranded 130-nt major satellite RNA (ssRNA) as a probe. GST-fusion proteins containing fission yeast Chp1-CD (GST-Chp1-CD) or GST alone were used as controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, GST-Suv39h1-CD bound ssRNA robustly and far more efficiently than did GST-Chp1-CD, although how these CDs activities contribute to the overall RNA-binding efficiency of full-length proteins remains elusive. Clr4-CD’s binding of nucleic acids was detected only when K9-methylated H3 peptide was added to the EMSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>); thus, although evolutionarily conserved roles need to be considered, nature of Suv39h1-CD’s binding of nucleic acid appeared to be distinct from that of Clr4-CD.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25317.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of full-length Suv39h1, GST-fused Suv39h1-CD (39–105), and <italic>S. pombe</italic> Chp1-CD (20–75).

Therefore, we investigated whether Suv39h1-CD has a higher binding affinity for DNA-RNA hybrid strands or dsRNA than for ssRNA.

Although a Suv39h1-CD mutant with Y67A (Suv39h1-CD-Y67A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) retained residual binding activity for unmodified or K9-methylated H3 peptide, it lost its preference for di- and tri-methylated H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Y67A). An EMSA demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD-Y67A bound ssRNA with an affinity almost the same as that of wild-type Suv39h1-CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), indicating that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding was distinct from its H3K9me3 recognition. To confirm this possibility, we added H3K9me3 peptide to the EMSA; this addition enhanced Chp1-CD’s RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>), but did not affect Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These results suggested that Suv39h1-CD’s ability to bind RNA is an intrinsic property that is distinct from its ability to recognize H3K9me3. Although addition of unmodified H3 peptide appeared to have a negative effect on the RNA-binding activity for both Chp1-CD and Suv39h1-CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it was presumably due to an electrostatic interaction between the unmodified H3 peptide and RNA probe.</p><p>We also investigated whether Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid binding influences its recognition of methylated H3K9, even though its RNA binding was not affected by adding H3K9me3 peptide. We performed peptide pull-down assays in the presence or absence of major satellite ssRNA or dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The presence of these nucleic acids slightly repressed rather than enhanced the overall amount of co-pulled-down Suv39h1-CD, suggesting that Suv39h-CD’s recognition of methylated H3K9 is also independent of its nucleic acid binding. This slight reduction in Suv39h1-CD’s H3K9me3 binding was probably due to an electrostatic interaction between the H3 peptide and the ssRNA/dsDNA probe. Furthermore, we confirmed that Suv39h1-CD’s recognition of methylated H3K9 was not affected by the nucleic acid-binding defective mutation, 4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Basic residues in Suv39h1-CD’s C-terminal α-helix are involved in binding RNA</title><p>To understand the biological implications of Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding, we next investigated the residues required for binding RNA.

The Suv39h1-Y67A-4A double mutant had an additive effect, and H3K9me3 foci+ cells were further decreased on day 6 (71.9 ± 1.9%). We further examined H3K9me3 status on pericentromere (major satellite repeat regions) by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. H3K9me3 level at major satellite regions was severely diminished in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs and recovered by FLAG-tagged Suv39h1-WT expression on day 6 after transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Suv39h1 mutants (Suv39h1-Y67A, −4A and -Y67A-4A) also increased H3K9me3 levels, but Suv39h1-Y67A-4A had a minimal effect. An <italic>in vitro</italic> HMTase assay showed that all of the Suv39h1 mutants had histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity for free H3, comparable to Suv39h1-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cell proliferation analysis demonstrated that the number of cell divisions during the first 3 days after viral infection were not much different among the <italic>Suv39h1</italic> dn iMEFs infected with an empty or expression vector for Suv39h1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that the different rescue efficiencies for H3K9me3 resulted from altered enzymatic activity or by cell cycle delay.</p><p>In the case of pericentric HP1β accumulation, Suv39h1-WT expression induced &gt;80% of cells to become HP1β foci-positive (HP1β foci+) on day 6 (83.0 ± 4.9%), but the phenotype was rescued only poorly by the Suv39h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; 63.0 ± 3.7%, 44.3 ± 19.8%, and 33.2 ± 9.4% for Suv39h1-Y67A, −4A, and -Y67A-4A on day 6, respectively). Dual immunostaining of the <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs on day 6 further demonstrated that compared to iMEFs rescued with Suv39h1-WT, iMEFs rescued with the Suv39h1 mutants contained larger cell populations that were negative for both H3K9me3 and HP1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom left of each panel) or were positive for only H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, top left of each panel), suggesting that SUV39H-mediated heterochromatin assembly was less efficient in those mutant cells.</p><p>To examine whether introduced Suv39h1 actually restored the repressive heterochromatin structure, we analyzed the expression levels of major satellite RNA. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>), major satellite repeats were derepressed in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs (~10 times higher than that of WT iMEFs) and introduction of Suv39h1-WT suppressed this up-regulation of major satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Mutant Suv39h1 with Y67A, 4A, or Y67A-4A also decreased major satellite repeat transcripts, but their repression levels were milder than that of Suv39h1-WT. Furthermore, among these mutants, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A’s effect was the weakest. These results are well consistent with the restored levels of H3K9me3 and HP1β.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid–binding activity integrates and cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish/maintain Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin such as H3K9me3 formation, HP1 accumulation, and transcriptionally repressive status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Suv39h1’s N-terminal region also contributes to Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation</title><p>Despite having impaired binding of both RNA and methylated H3K9, the Suv39h1 mutant Y67A-4A was able to assemble CH on pericentric regions, although less efficiently and completely than wild-type Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data indicate that the Y67A-4A mutant retains other critical factors or functions that promote Suv39h1’s association with CH sufficiently for Y67A-4A to induce pericentric heterochromatin assembly. As to which factor or function is involved in this process, HP1 or an HP1-associated function is a reasonable candidate, since Suv39h1’s N terminus interacts with HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto and Sonoda, 2003</xref>). Indeed, we recently found that the induction of pericentric H3K9me3 is extremely poor in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs complemented with an N-terminal deletion (<italic>Δ</italic>1–41) mutant of Suv39h1 (<italic>Δ</italic>N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A,C,D</xref>) expressed at an endogenous level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muramatsu et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Although <italic>Δ</italic>N does not bind HP1, it was recently reported that the N-terminal region of Suv39h1 (1-41) also possesses chromatin-binding activity independent of its HP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we validated the role of this chromatin-binding activity in Suv39h1-mediated H3K9me3 formation. We used the Suv39h1-R24,K27A mutant, which is reported to be defective for chromatin binding but to still interact with HP1 in pericentric H3K9me3 formation in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B–D</xref>).

In experiments with <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or 4A Suv39h1, we immunoprecipitated cellular RNAs associated with the wild-type or mutant Suv39h1 and assessed the levels of the major satellite repeats by dot-blot hybridization, which allowed us to evaluate the levels of repetitive DNA without amplification. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the signal for the major satellite repeats was clearly detected in precipitates from iMEFs expressing wild-type Suv39h1 but was severely diminished in precipitates from iMEFs expressing mutant Suv39h1-4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), even though similar amounts of FLAG-Suv39h1-WT or −4A were immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Suv39h1-WT stably bound major satellite RNAs, and this interaction was impaired for Suv39h1-4A. The interaction was also lost for Suv39h1-Y67A mutant, suggesting that H3K9me3 recognition by Suv39h1-CD is also required for the Suv39h1’s stable interaction with the major satellite RNAs. Intriguingly, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A interacted partially with the major satellite RNAs. This result does not seemingly fit with our model that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA- and H3K9me3-binding activities cooperatively function in Suv39h1’s chromatin targeting. However, we also found that Suv39h1-Y67A-4A loosely bound chromatin (see below). Considering this observation, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A may interact cellular RNAs without stable binding to chromatin.</p><p>To determine whether the interaction between Suv39h1 and major satellite RNA occurs in the nucleus, we conducted chromatin fractionation assays. Cells were harvested and separated into soluble (Sup) and insoluble, chromatin-enriched (Ppt) fractions, and endogenous Suv39h1’s chromatin association was evaluated by immunoblotting. We found that most of Suv39h1 was present in the chromatin-enriched fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Even more interestingly, a relatively higher level of Suv39h1-Y67A-4A was detected in the soluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these results confirmed that Suv39h1 interacts with major satellite RNA within the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, and that both RNA- and H3K9me3-binding activities contribute to Suv39h1’s chromatin association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Both the nucleic acid and methylated H3K9 recognition/binding activities of Suv39h1-CD impact Suv39h1 dynamics in pericentromeric regions</title><p>Our rescue experiments of <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs clearly indicated that Suv39h1-CD’s H3K9me3- and RNA-binding functions are both critical for establishing H3K9me3 marks in pericentric regions without preexisting H3K9me3 marks. On the other hand, we were still able to induce pericentric H3K9me3 and HP1 accumulation in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs complemented with 4A, Y67A, or Y67A-4A Suv39h1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), albeit less efficiently than in iMEFs expressing wild-type Suv39h1. Thus, Suv39h1-CD’s function might be dispensable for maintaining H3K9me3 marks once established. However, Suv39h1-4A’s association with major satellite RNA was severely impaired in cells with rescued H3K9me3 and HP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that defective RNA binding may affect Suv39h1 dynamics in the pericentromere, where major satellite repeat elements are transcribed. Consistent with this possibility, a single K87A amino acid substitution in SUV39H1 (included in mut1 and 4A in our study) was reported to enhance the SUV39H1 exchange rate in CH regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch-Presegué et al., 2011</xref>), although the biological implication of this observation remains unclear. It is quite possible that Suv39h1 dynamics in the pericentromere were also affected in the mutant with defective H3K9me3 binding.</p><p>To test the possibility that Suv39h1’s RNA- and H3K9me3-binding contribute to its dynamics on CH, we measured these dynamics in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs with stable expression of GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, GFP-Suv39h1-WT localized to the nucleus and formed foci on Hoechst-dense pericentric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). GFP-Suv39h1-4A, -Y67A, and -Y67A-4A also formed foci on Hoechst-dense regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, semi-quantitative analysis to measure their heterochromatin enrichment (represented as the intensity ratio of euchromatin over heterochromatin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) revealed that GFP-Suv39h1-Y67A-4A fluorescence was significantly increased in euchromatin compared to the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that Suv39h1-Y67A-4A’s affinity to heterochromatic regions was decreased. GFP-Suv39h1-Y67A was also slightly less enriched on heterochromatin, and Y67A and 4A appeared to have an additive effect. We next assayed these molecules’ binding time to heterochromatin by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). As clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, GFP-Suv39h1-4A and -Y67A exchanged more rapidly than Suv39h1-WT (GFP-Suv39h1-4A and -Y67A had recovery half-times of ~6 s, versus ~20 s for Suv39h1-WT), and their mobile fraction was increased (88–89% for GFP-Suv39h1-4A and -Y67A, versus ~73% for GFP-Suv39h1-WT). GFP-Suv39h1-Y67A-4A was much more dynamic, with an ~3 s recovery half-time and ~91% mobile fraction. GFP-Suv39h1-mut1 and -mut3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) also exchanged more rapidly than GFP-Suv39h1-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

In this study, we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD not only recognizes H3K9me3, but also binds RNA and DNA (with a higher affinity to ssRNA than to dsDNA), indicating that RNA may also be crucial for Suv39h1 recruitment/function. Indeed, our current data suggest that these two activities contribute to Suv39h1-mediated CH assembly, including the accumulation of H3K9me3 and HP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the retention of Suv39h1 itself on the pericentric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of Suv39h1’s N-terminal region contributed to the Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muramatsu et al., 2016</xref>]).

Since pericentric regions consist of major satellite repeats, it is possible that nascent transcripts derived from such regions possess specialized properties that are recognized by Suv39h1. Although SUV39H1 is reported to preferentially bind TERRA transcripts derived from telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Porro et al., 2014</xref>), our study demonstrates that Suv39h1-CD also efficiently binds <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA and does not show any particular sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that Suv39h1 targets specific chromosomal regions by recognizing a specific RNA sequence or structure. However, it is possible that transcripts derived from repetitive chromosomal regions are not efficiently processed, leading to their stable association with transcribed regions. Pericentric transcripts with this kind of feature might become a target of Suv39h1. Since another independent work now demonstrates that the N-terminal basic domain of mouse Suv39h2 also shows RNA binding activity and this activity is crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of Suv39h2 to heterochromatin.

Knockdown of major satellite repeat transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) further supports the notion that RNA (major satellite RNA) binding of Suv39h1 contributes to its stability on chromatin.</p><p>While we showed that Suv39h1-CD binds H3K9me3 peptide, its binding affinity is weaker than those of the CDs of HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs and Khorasanizadeh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>]). Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity might increase its affinity for H3K9me3-rich pericentric regions; alternatively, RNA binding might modulate Suv39h1-CD’s enzymatic activity. A recent report showed that Suv39h1’s CD inhibits its methyltransferase activity, and the CD’s binding of H3K9me3 is suggested to allosterically regulate Suv39h1’s enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). It is not clear how Suv39h1’s methyltransferase activity is controlled by the CD; however, it is possible that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding is also coupled with its allosteric regulation. Physical interaction between the CD and SET domains appeared to affect the CD’s RNA-binding activity: we demonstrated that full-length Suv39h1 bound RNA with a relatively higher affinity compared with Suv39h1-CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>). Considering the CD’s role in targeting Suv39h1 to H3K9me3-free chromatin regions, Suv39h1’s physical association with other factors such as chromatin-unbound non-coding RNAs or HP1 proteins may modulate the CD’s C-terminal α-helix to bind RNAs.</p><p>In general, the assembly of higher-order chromatin structure has two steps, establishment and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sadaie et al., 2004</xref>). H3K9me3 marks on CH have to be maintained during DNA replication, and given that Suv39h1 possesses a CD that recognizes H3K9me3, a direct read-write mechanism involving Suv39h1 is proposed to maintain H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>). However, this mechanism does not fully explain the restoration of H3K9me3 in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs. Thus, Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity appears to contribute to its ability to target pericentric regions without preexisting H3K9me3 and to establish H3K9me3 marks; this function is consistent with the role of nucleic acid binding in Chp1 and Clr4 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, HP1 can also bind RNA and methylated H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muchardt et al., 2002</xref>). HP1’s ability to bind RNA is SUMO-dependent, and an HP1-Ubc9 fusion molecule with enhanced sumoylation on the HP1 part can be targeted to the pericentric regions, even in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maison et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, HP1 can recruit mutant Suv39h1 to pericentric regions via binding between sumoylated HP1 and chromatin-bound major satellite RNA. Once Suv39h1-Y67A-4A is targeted to pericentric regions and deposits H3K9me3, HP1 further increases its affinity for pericentric regions, and this positive feedback loop between HP1 and Suv39h1-Y67A-4A may be sufficient for this mutant Suv39h1 to mediate pericentric heterochromatin assembly. The <italic>Δ</italic>N phenotype supports this possibility.</p><p>In this study we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity is required for its targeting to and assembly of heterochromatin, highlighting the functional role of pericentromeric transcripts in introducing H3K9me3 marks. Recent studies using fission yeast demonstrated that H3K9me3 can be maintained during DNA replication as a self-perpetuating epigenetic mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the maintenance of H3K9me3 requires intact Clr4-CD. Epe1, a protein containing a jmjC-domain, counteracts this process by directly removing the H3K9me3 mark. Such counteracting enzymatic activities appear to be important for preventing the inappropriate inactivation of euchromatic genes by stochastically introduced H3K9me3 marks. Although it is not clear whether similar counteracting demethylase activities play a role in maintaining genome integrity in mammalian cells, pericentromeric transcripts may modulate such counteracting enzymatic activity to directly regulate chromatin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs)</title><p>EMSAs were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2012</xref>) using a PCR-amplified major satellite sequence as a dsDNA probe.

FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant Suv39h1 was incubated in 1x Collin’s buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 5 mM DTT) with Histone H3 (0.5 μg) and 14C-labeled SAM (0.01 μCi, Perkin Elmer) for 15 min at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on a 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, and the dry gel was exposed to an imaging plate (Fujifilm) for 1 day. Autoradiography was detected using a BAS-5000 Image Analyzer (Fujifilm).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank T Jenuwein for providing the <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs.

The authors demonstrate that the chromo domain of Suv39h1 binds to single stranded RNA (ssRNA), has higher affinity for ssRNA than dsDNA, generate mutations in the chromo domain that abolish RNA binding without affecting the association of the chromo domain with H3K9me3 peptides, show that Suv39h1 associates with major satellite RNA in vivo, and that RNA binding appears to affect the stable association of Suv39h1 with heterochromatic foci. The experiments in the paper are well executed and support the main conclusion regarding the effect of RNA binding on the stable association of at least Suv39h1-EGFP (which is somewhat overexpressed) with heterochromatin. Non-specific affinity for RNA (or DNA) may potentially play a role in heterochromatin stability. However, the functional significance of the observed non-specific RNA binding (effects on silencing) is not established and additional work is required to rule out alternative explanations prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present some data on the effect of the RNA binding mutations on the levels of H3K9me3 and HP1 β at heterochromatic foci. Here the effect is weak, 2-fold or less reduction in intensity in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). They should also test whether RNA binding is required for silencing of major satellite repeats and/or other transposons by introducing wild type versus mutant Suv39h1 into Suv39h1/h2 DKO MEFs. For H3K9me3 levels, rather than the crude assay involving intensity of staining at heterochromatic foci, the authors should perform ChIP.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Considering MSR's are produced in both sense and antisense orientations (Bulut-Karslioglu et al. 2012), binding affinity to double stranded (ds) MSR RNAs also should be tested.</p><p>3) Subsection “Suv39h1-CD's nucleic acid binding and methylated H3K9 recognition/binding are both crucial for Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly”/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Is there any growth defect in Suv39 dn with mutant Suv39h1? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggest that Suv39h1 mutants display a slower kinetics in reestablishing H3K9me at day 3. One possibility, which needs to be ruled out, is that the overall process (which is cell cycle regulated – high MSR expression in G1/S phase) proceeds at the same pace between wild type and mutant cell lines, but because mutant cells have slower doubling times, the mutant cells have not undergone the same number of doubling times thus appear to show fewer H3K9me foci. Normalization by doubling time will rule out this possibility and provide strong evidence that the mutants' reestablishment kinetics is slower than wt.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>: Why does addition of unmodified H3 result in loss of Chp1 binding to ssRNAs?

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that Suv39h1 interaction with MSR RNAs is reduced in 4A mutant, but it is unclear whether RNA binding and H3K9me binding make additive contribution to this interaction. For example, it is also possible that Suv39h1 localizes to MSRs via H3K9me3 recognition first, followed by binding to MSR RNAs. The following experiments will help address this issue:</p><p>A) What happens to RIP of Y67A and Y67A-4A? A prediction of the proposed model is that combining RNA- and H3K9me binding mutations in the same protein should reduce the ability of Suv39h1 to interact with MSR RNAs more than either of the single mutants. For better quantification, it is suggested to consider performing qRT-PCR reactions and normalize all RIP signals to input RNA.</p><p>B) These RIP experiments could be performed from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions to ask whether Suv39h1 interaction with RNA occurs in nucleus and requires H3K9me3 (in case of Y67A).</p><p>6) Subsection “Full-length Suv39h1 exhibits diminished nucleic-acid binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>”/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>: RNA binding affinity of full-length protein may be similar to Suv39h1 CD.

The accumulation of this large band correlates with the disappearance of ssRNA substrate (lanes, 6 and 7 from the left) which may suggest a similar binding kinetics for the full-length protein and CD alone. This putative larger product may enter the gel by running them longer using lower voltage. This may reveal that the full-length and CD regions alone have similar binding kinetics to ssRNA substrates.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>. Why does mut1, which shows no significant defect in binding to MSR ssRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), display rapid mobility comparable to mut3 (and other ssRNA-binding) mutants? This appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that loss of ssRNA binding results in lower residency of Suv39h1 with heterochromatin.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows no clear reduction in Suv39h1 interaction with chromatin until both the H3K9me3 and RNA binding interactions are disrupted.

This is not apparent from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Even with both regions mutated, significant H3K9me3 is retained at the heterochromatin.

Since Suv39h is mostly dispensable for silencing of retrotransposons in iMEFs (Bulut-Karslioglu et al., Mol Cell, 2014), we focused on major satellite repeats (MSRs). We compared MSR expression levels in wild-type (WT) and <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs that were infected with an empty or expression vector for Suv39h1 (WT and mutants) on day 14. As reported previously (Bulut-Karslioglu et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2012), MSRs were derepressed in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs (~10 times higher than that of WT iMEFs) and introduction of WT Suv39h1 suppressed the up-regulation of MSR expression. Mutant Suv39h1 proteins (i.e., Y67A, 4A, and Y67A-4A) also decreased MSR expression, but their effects were milder than that of WT, which is consistent with their phenotypes of pericentric accumulation of H3K9me3 and HP1β. Furthermore, among these mutants, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A exhibited the weakest effect, which is also consistent with the H3K9me3/HP1β IF staining and GFP-Suv39h1 FRAP results.</p><p>We included this data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> and described this result in the text (subsection “Both Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid binding and methylated H3K9 recognition/binding contribute to Suv39h1’s retention on pericentric heterochromatin”, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>For H3K9me3 levels, rather than the crude assay involving intensity of staining at heterochromatic foci, the authors should perform ChIP.</italic></p><p>We performed H3K9me3 ChIP-qPCR analysis on MSRs in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs infected with an empty or expression vector for FLAG-tagged Suv39h1 (WT and mutants).

This result supports an idea that MSR dsRNA can also be a target of Suv39h1, although it is unlikely that dsRNA is a preferential target over ssRNA. We have described this in our revised manuscript (subsection “Suv39h1-CD can bind nucleic acids”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “Suv39h1-CD's nucleic acid binding and methylated H3K9 recognition/binding are both crucial for Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly”/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Is there any growth defect in Suv39 dn with mutant Suv39h1? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggest that Suv39h1 mutants display a slower kinetics in reestablishing H3K9me at day 3.

Mol Cell, 2012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), loss of Chp1-CD binding to ssRNAs in the presence of unmodified H3 was likely due to an electrostatic interaction between unmodified H3 and the RNA probe that inhibited the ability of Chp1-CD to bind the probe. Such an effect was described in the previous study (Ishida et al. Mol Cell, 2012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While Suv39h1-CD weakly bound to unmodified H3 peptide (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), this negative effect was also likely due to an electrostatic interaction between unmodified H3 and the RNA probe, and the negative effect of H3 peptides appears to be alleviated in the case of K9me3 peptide since Suv39h1-CD binds to the H3 peptide. We now carefully explain the negative effect in our revised manuscript (subsection “Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding and methylated H3K9 recognition/binding are independent of each other”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid binding is required for its interaction with major satellite RNAs in vivo”/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors develop great tools with which they can distinguish between CD's ability to bind to H3K9me versus ssRNA.

We have confirmed that Suv39h1-WT stably bound MSR ssRNAs and that this interaction was impaired for Suv39h1-4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that this interaction was also lost for Suv39h1-Y67A mutant, suggesting that H3K9me3 recognition by Suv39h1-CD also required for the Suv39h1’s stable interaction with MSR RNAs. Intriguingly, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A interacted partially with MSR RNAs. This result does not seemingly fit with our model that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA- and H3K9me3-binding activities cooperatively function in Suv39h1’s chromatin targeting. However, we also found that Suv39h1-Y67A-4A loosely bound chromatin (see below). Considering this observation, Suv39h1-Y67A-4A may interact cellular RNAs without stable binding to chromatin. We have included these new results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and discussed possible interpretation in the revised manuscript (subsection “Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid binding is required for its interaction with major satellite RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>B) These RIP experiments could be performed from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions to ask whether Suv39h1 interaction with RNA occurs in nucleus and requires H3K9me3 (in case of Y67A).</italic></p><p>In the RIP experiments, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde before harvest and we have no experience to fractionate cells after fixation. To address whether Suv39h1 interaction with RNA occurs in nucleus, we conducted chromatin fractionation assay without fixation and examined Suv39h1’s chromatin association. We found that Suv39h1 was predominantly detected in the chromatin-enriched precipitated fractions and only negligibly in the soluble fractions containing cytoplasmic proteins (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). While Suv39h1 mutants (4A and Y67A) failed to bind MSR RNAs in the RIP experiments, most of these mutants were also detected in the chromatin-enriched precipitated fractions. These results support an idea that Suv39h1 interaction with RNA occurs in nucleus and also suggest that mutant Suv39h1 somehow retained chromatin association without stable binding with MSR RNAs. Interestingly, a relatively higher level of Suv39h1-Y67A-4A was detected in the soluble fractions. Suv39h1-Y67A-4A’s weakened interaction with MSR RNAs and trimethylated H3K9 might be linked with its impaired localization. We have described these results in the revised manuscript (subsection “Suv39h1-CD’s nucleic acid binding is required for its interaction with major satellite RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Subsection “Full-length Suv39h1 exhibits diminished nucleic-acid binding activity in vitro”/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>: RNA binding affinity of full-length protein may be similar to Suv39h1 CD. The authors are encouraged to re-examine their in vitro binding assay results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref> and L reveal the formation of a large band, which fails to enter the gel. The accumulation of this large band correlates with the disappearance of ssRNA substrate (lanes, 6 and 7 from the left) which may suggest a similar binding kinetics for the full-length protein and CD alone. This putative larger product may enter the gel by running them longer using lower voltage. This may reveal that the full-length and CD regions alone have similar binding kinetics to ssRNA substrates.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. One of the obstacles that hampered our EMSAs using full-length Suv39h1 proteins was their low solubility: most of recombinant Suv39h1 proteins went into insoluble fractions, and we had to use a harsh condition to obtain sufficient amount of full-length Suv39h1. We speculate that this procedure might compromise the function of full length Suv39h1 and affect the EMSA experiments. We noticed, however, that the solubility of full-length Suv39h1 was dramatically improved when it was expressed with a maltose binding protein (MBP). Using this system, we have prepared MBP alone, MBP-fused Suv39h1-CD, and full-length Suv39h1 WT and mutant (4A) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and conducted EMSAs. We found that MBP-fused full-length Suv39h1 bound ssRNA with a higher affinity compared with MBP-Suv39h1-CD, and 4A mutation reduced the binding affinity of full-length Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>). These results suggest that full-length Suv39h1 can bind to ssRNA and also imply that Suv39h1’s domains other than CD also contribute to its ssRNA binding. Considering partial effects of Suv39h1 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), it is possible that ssRNA-binding activity associated with Suv39h1’s domains other than CD participates in its chromatin targeting. While this would be important for considering the Suv39h1’s chromatin targeting mechanism, we feel that this is currently beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, we have added a comment on this issue in our revised manuscript (subsection “Full-length Suv39h1 exhibits diminished nucleic-acid binding activity<italic>in vitro</italic>”).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>. Why does mut1, which shows no significant defect in binding to MSR ssRNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), display rapid mobility comparable to mut3 (and other ssRNA-binding) mutants? This appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that loss of ssRNA binding results in lower residency of Suv39h1 with heterochromatin.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Yes, the mut1’s behavior in the FRAP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) seems to be inconsistent with its RNA-binding ability in the EMSA(new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, although mut1 could induce band shift, the titration EMSAs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and 2H</xref>) clearly shows the difference between WT and mut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, compare red and green lines). Therefore, as stated in the text “In EMSAs, a Suv39h1-CD mutant (mut1) with N-terminal distal amino acid substitutions bound RNA more weakly than wild-type Suv39h1-CD”, we consider that mut1 is weakened for RNA binding, and this weakened RNA-binding ability led to the increased Suv39h1’s mobility in the FRAP analysis. However, we could not fully explain why mut1 and other RNA binding defective Suv39h1 mutants showed similar FRAP profiles despite their differences in RNA binding activity. Impacts of mut1 on full-length Suv39h1’s RNA binding might be enhanced in <italic>in vivo</italic> context. Alternatively, impacts on mut1 on Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding might be compensated by <italic>in vitro</italic> condition such as GST’s dimerization property. In either case, we believe our <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding data still maintains our hypothesis.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows no clear reduction in Suv39h1 interaction with chromatin until both the H3K9me3 and RNA binding interactions are disrupted. However, the figure legend states that each interaction is crucial for targeting Suv39h1. Also, the text says that signal was increased in the euchromatin for the single mutants. This is not apparent from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Even with both regions mutated, significant H3K9me3 is retained at the heterochromatin. These overinterpretations need to be toned down.</italic></p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> title as follows:</p><p>Original: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

GFP-Suv39h1-Y67A was also slightly less enriched on heterochromatin, and Y67A and 4A appeared to have an additive effect.”</p><p><italic>9) Showing that RNaseH / A treatment has a similar effect to the Suv39h1 nucleic acid binding mutation in the FRAP analyses would make the results more convincing that the RNA is a key contributor to Suv39h1 stability on chromatin.</italic></p><p>We have tried RNaseH/A treatments by permeabilized cells, but it has been difficult to interpret the results.

Introduction of MSR-specific LNA-DNA gapmers significantly decreased MSR transcripts in <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn iMEFs and enhanced the mobility of GFP-Suv39h1 on pericentric heterochromatin. This data further supports that MSR RNA contributes to Suv39h1 stability on pericentric regions.</p><p>We added this data as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and described the result in the new section “Major satellite RNAs contribute to retention of Suv39h1 on heterochromatin”.</p><p>In this RNA KD experiment, we also included nuclear non-coding RNA, Neat1 specific LNA-DNA gapmers as a negative control.
