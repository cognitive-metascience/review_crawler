SMs are essential for fusion in vivo, but the basis of this requirement is enigmatic. We now report that, in addition to their established roles as fusion accelerators, SM proteins Sly1 and Vps33 directly shield SNARE complexes from Sec17- and Sec18-mediated disassembly. In vivo, wild-type Sly1 and Vps33 function are required to withstand overproduction of Sec17. In vitro, Sly1 and Vps33 impede SNARE complex disassembly by Sec18 and ATP. Unexpectedly, Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of Sly1 and Vps33 onto cognate SNARE complexes. A large thermodynamic barrier limits SM binding, implying that significant conformational rearrangements are involved. In a working model, Sec17 and SMs accelerate fusion mediated by cognate SNARE complexes and protect them from NSF-mediated disassembly, while mis-assembled or non-cognate SNARE complexes are eliminated through kinetic proofreading by Sec18.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02272.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02272.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02272.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Eukaryotic organisms, from single-celled yeast to humans, divide their cells into membrane-bound compartments (organelles) of distinct function. To move from one compartment to another, or to enter or exit a cell, large molecules like proteins are packaged into small membrane sacs called vesicles.</p><p>To release its cargo, the membrane of a vesicle must fuse with the membrane of the correct destination compartment. The SNARE family of proteins plays a key role in this fusion process. As the membranes of a vesicle and target compartment come close, SNARE proteins located on each membrane form a SNARE complex that tethers the vesicle in place and causes the two membranes fuse. SNARE proteins do not act alone in this process: the SM family of proteins also plays an essential role in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. However, it is still not clear exactly why the SM proteins are needed.</p><p>Lobingier et al. used the yeast model organism and biochemical studies with purified proteins to show that SM proteins help SNARE complexes form at the right time by regulating the delicate balance between SNARE complex formation and disassembly. This is achieved through the interplay of SM proteins and two other proteins (Sec17 and Sec18). Sec17 is known to load Sec18 onto SNARE complexes to break them apart. Lobingier et al. showed that Sec17 can also load SM proteins on SNARE complexes. This hinders Sec18 action, and so helps to keep the SNARE complexes intact. Because each SM protein tested only binds to the SNARE complex that should function at the membrane where the SM protein resides, these findings suggest SM proteins perform quality control at potential sites of membrane fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02272.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02272.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>docking</kwd><kwd>HOPS</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM077349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Alexey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-10-026-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Alexey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM07270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lobingier</surname><given-names>Braden T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins shield SNARE complexes from NSF/Sec18-mediated disassembly through cooperative binding interactions with SNARE complexes and the universal co-chaperone α-SNAP/Sec17.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane fusion, the final stage of intracellular vesicular traffic, is tightly regulated so that cargos are delivered to destination compartments in an accurate and timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Glick, 2004</xref>).

The in vivo SM requirement is so general and so stringent that SMs are now considered, along with SNAREs, to be components of the core fusion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the in vivo SM requirement are opaque.</p><p>Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of SMs in fusion. A major reason for the proliferation of models is that different SMs have divergent SNARE binding modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). However, accruing evidence suggests that SMs share a core ability to bind cognate ternary or quaternary SNARE bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Togneri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kramer and Ungermann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>). These observations prompted the conjecture that the central, evolutionarily conserved function of SM proteins involves their direct association with assembling pre-fusion <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). Indeed, Sec1 and Munc18-1 accelerate SNARE-mediated liposome fusion by several-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>). This acceleration is contingent on initial reaction conditions, and recent experiments show that Munc18-1 stimulates liposome fusion more efficiently in concert with the specialist exocytosis cofactors Munc13 and synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Vps33, Vps45, and Sly1 accelerate liposome fusion, but with nearly absolute requirements for additional factors including Rab proteins and tethering factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hickey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>). It remains unclear how SM proteins accelerate SNARE-mediated fusion, and it is unknown whether the kinetic stimulation observed in vitro is sufficient to explain absolute requirements for SMs in vivo.</p><p>In a different and not mutually exclusive role, SM proteins might interact with SNARE recycling factors. In vitro, Sec18 and Sec17 can disassemble pre-fusion <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes and can prevent the fusion of intact yeast lysosomal vacuoles or liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ungermann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rohde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stroupe et al., 2009</xref>). Premature SNARE disassembly was impeded by the Vps-C tethering complex HOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). This protective activity of HOPS was hypothesized to reside within its SM subunit Vps33, which is necessary and sufficient for HOPS binding to the vacuole SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>). Similarly, Munc18-1, acting in concert with Munc13 and synaptotagmin, facilitated SNARE-mediated liposome fusion in the presence of otherwise inhibitory concentrations of NSF and α-SNAP (Sec18 and Sec17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of NSF and α-SNAP, Munc18 and Munc13 had little or no effect on the extent of SNARE-mediated liposome fusion when compared to fusion driven solely by SNAREs and synaptotagmin. These findings led to proposals that SMs protect pre-fusion SNARE complexes from premature disassembly while exposing post-fusion complexes and mis-assembled or non-cognate pre-fusion complexes to disassembly by Sec18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Starai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). However, central predictions of these models are still untested. Direct protection of a SNARE complex by an SM has not been experimentally demonstrated, and it is unknown whether SM proteins functionally interact (or compete) with the disassembly machinery in living cells.</p><p>Using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as an experimental platform, we tested the hypothesis that SMs functionally interact not only with SNAREs, but also with Sec17 and Sec18. Through a combination of genetic manipulations in vivo, and in vitro assays of SNARE complex assembly and disassembly, we establish that SM proteins directly impair Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly. In the course of these studies we discovered that Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of at least two different SM proteins onto cognate SNARE complexes. Moreover, an extraordinarily steep temperature dependence limits SM loading onto SNARE complexes, implying that SM-SNARE complex formation entails significant conformational transitions. The thermal dependence of SM loading may partially explain why SNARE–Sec17–SM complexes eluded detection in previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wild-type SM proteins are required to resist Sec17 and Sec18 overproduction</title><p>In vitro reconstitution experiments led to models in which SM proteins, in conjunction with additional SNARE cofactors, functionally oppose Sec17 and Sec18 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stroupe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, Sec17 or Sec17 and Sec18 overproduction strongly exacerbate defects in endolysosomal function, even when Vps33 function is only partially impaired. To test for synthetic trafficking defects we employed LUCID, a quantitative assay of traffic from the Golgi to the late endosome. LUCID uses a chimeric reporter, the cargo protein Sna3 fused to firefly luciferase (fLuc). Sna3-fLuc accumulates when endolysosomal traffic or cargo sorting into multivesicular bodies is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nickerson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paulsel et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase is co-expressed to control for expression and nonspecific protein turnover. Sec17 overproduction in <italic>vps33</italic><sup>car</sup> cells, but not in wild-type cells, significantly impaired Sna3-fLuc sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Thus, Sec17 stimulates Sly1–SNARE complex association, but Sec17 does not efficiently bind Sly1 or Sed5 in the absence of an assembled SNARE complex. Sly1 bound to the Sec17–SNARE complex saturably and with moderate affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; K<sub>D(obs)</sub> = 1.0 ± 0.1 µM). We emphasize that this binding was measured under conditions where Sly1–Sed5 N-peptide binding cannot occur, as the Sed5 construct lacks the N-peptide and H<sub>abc</sub> domains. In the absence of Sec17, little or no Sly1 bound the SNARE bundle at concentrations up to 15 µM. Under saturation conditions the SNARE complex, Sec17, and Sly1 assembled in apparent 1:3:1 stoichiometry, consistent with the results for Vps33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5D and 6D</xref>).</p><p>As with Vps33, Sly1 binding was promoted by SNARE-bound Sec17 rather than Sec17 in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The Sec17 concentration required to saturate Golgi SNARE complex was about four-fold greater than for vacuole SNARE complex (compare the Sec17 curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5B and 6B</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Golgi SNARE complex pre-bound to Sec17 and then washed retained less Sec17, and commensurately less Sly1, versus pulldowns in which Sec17 was in excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3). No increase in Sly1 binding to Golgi SNARE complexes was observed when BSA was added instead of Sec17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 4). Sly1, like Vps33, binds SNARE–Sec17 complexes through a cooperative mechanism. GST-tagged Sly1 was immobilized and assayed for binding of soluble SNARE complex, Sec17, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). SNARE complex was retained by GST-Sly1 only in the presence of Sec17, and Sec17 was retained most efficiently on GST-Sly1 when SNARE complexes were present. There may be some affinity between GST-Sly1 and Sec17 in the absence of SNARE complex under these conditions. However, Sec17 did not detectably interact with Sly1 when Sly1 was tethered to the GST-Sed5 N-peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). We conclude that Sec17 promotes Sly1 and Vps33 loading onto SNARE complexes through a cooperative mechanism.

There was little Sly1 dissociation at 4°C and slightly more at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that elevated temperature promotes productive SM–SNARE association rather than stabilizing extant SM–SNARE complexes. At 90% saturating levels, Sly1 bound the Sec17–SNARE complex with a half-time of ∼20 min. Under similar conditions, Sly1 binding to the Sed5 N-peptide and Sec17 binding to Golgi SNARE complexes were both complete within 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). When Sly1 was loaded onto SNARE–Sec17 complexes at 24° instead of 30°C, the time required to reach steady-state binding increased from 1 to 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These observations indicate that the temperature dependence of SM binding is due to rate-limiting steps in SM–SNARE association rather than dissociation. A possible interpretation is that Vps33 and Sly1 slowly interconvert between ground states unable to bind SNARE complexes and activated, binding-competent, states. SNARE-bound Sec17—and perhaps other docking factors—would then elicit or stabilize activated SM conformations to accelerate SM loading onto cognate SNARE complexes. Because pre-incubation of Sly1 at 30°C did not accelerate subsequent Sly1 binding to Sec17-SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), we suggest that elevated temperature increases the frequency of interconversion between the putative ground and binding-active conformations, rather than by stabilizing an activated conformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Crosstalk between SNARE assembly and disassembly factors</title><p>Pioneering biochemical and genetic studies led to the idea that parallel N-to-C zippering of SNARE complexes <italic>in trans</italic> pulls membranes together to initiate fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nichols et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>).

In these systems the SM, in combination with other factors including HOPS, Munc13, and synaptotagmin, facilitates efficient fusion in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18, suggesting that SMs have a minimum of two fusion-promoting functions. First, SMs promote the assembly of <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complexes or make them more fusogenic once assembled. Second, SMs protect <italic>trans</italic> complexes from premature disassembly by Sec18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, reaction iv). Because multiple cofactors were present in previous studies, it was unclear whether SNARE complex protection from disassembly was attributable directly to SMs, or a property emergent from multiple proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Starai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Our experiments now show that SMs functionally interact with the SNARE disassembly machinery in vivo, and affirm that SMs from at least two of the four subfamilies are sufficient to decrease rates of Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly in vitro. Contrary to expectations, however, Vps33 and Sly1 did not compete with Sec17 for SNARE complex binding. Instead, SNARE-bound Sec17 accelerated SM loading, resulting in the efficient formation of SM–Sec17–SNARE co-complexes with 1:3:1 stoichiometry. Sec17 is therefore a multifunctional SNARE complex adapter, capable of recruiting not only the disassembly ATPase Sec18 but also compartment-specific SMs that oppose Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SMs, Sec17, and the kinetics of SNARE complex persistence and activity</title><p>Our results and other converging lines of experimentation suggest a working model in which Sec17 binding to pre-fusion complexes leads to alternative fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). When an SM recognizes and binds a Sec17–SNARE complex (reaction iv), it promotes fusion in at least three ways. First, the bound SM directly impedes SNARE disassembly by Sec18. Second, the SM augments the SNARE complex's fusogenic activity. Third, by accelerating fusion, the SM shortens the pre-fusion complex's lifetime, thereby shortening its temporal exposure to disassembly by Sec18 (kinetic partitioning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardy and Randall, 1991</xref>). In this view of fusion, SMs function as true enzymes: they bind and stabilize on-pathway intermediates, protect these intermediates from side reactions, and accelerate the conversion of intermediates to end products. Crucially, this model predicts the annihilation of pathway-specific fusion when SMs are deleted from living cells—a result that holds across many different organisms and fusion pathways. When SM function is compromised, pre-fusion SNARE complexes should be less fusogenic, persist for longer times, and be more exposed to premature disassembly by Sec17 and Sec18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, reaction v).</p><p>A further implication of our working model is that SNAREs, Sec17, SMs, and Sec18 have precisely the features required to implement a kinetic proofreading system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hopfield, 1974</xref>). Kinetic proofreading entails a sequence of independent, driven discrimination events. For SNARE-mediated fusion in vivo, there would be a minimum of two discrimination events. First, the nucleation of the <italic>trans-</italic>SNARE complex (an intermediate analogous to a Michaelis complex) has significant but not absolute intrinsic selectivity, derived mainly from packing interactions at the core of the SNARE bundle. Second, on-pathway SNARE bundles are positively selected by SM proteins. Sec17 detects the general shape and charge distribution of assembled SNARE bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marz et al., 2003</xref>), while SMs identify pathway-specific SNARE configurations, protecting them from Sec18 and augmenting their forward fusogenic activity. Error products—off-pathway, incorrectly assembled, or damaged SNARE complexes—would not be efficiently bound by SMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, reaction v). These complexes would fuse more slowly or not at all, and would be fully exposed to Sec17 and Sec18-mediated disassembly.</p><p>Although SNAREs selectively drive fusion when complexed with cognate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McNew et al., 2000</xref>), individual SNAREs readily enter into non-cognate, off-pathway, antiparallel or mis-registered complexes with substantial thermal stability and commensurately low off-rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>). Moreover, certain R-SNAREs (Nyv1, Snc2, Sec22) drive fusion with non-cognate Q-SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McNew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>). Compartment-specific tethers confer additional selectivity by accelerating the forward rate of cognate SNARE pairing, but this may not be sufficient. Normal cellular transactions are replete with opportunities to assemble erroneous SNARE complexes that could drive inappropriate fusion or trigger unregulated and irreversible organelle aggregation. For example, mammalian endosomes progressively associate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until 98% of late endosomes and lysosomes are adjacent to ER, generally within 30 nm or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2013</xref>).

The requirement for physiological (warm) temperatures in our in vitro assays may explain in part why SM–Sec17–SNARE interactions were not previously detected. In vivo, the relevant transitions may occur in a concerted manner; alternatively, they may involve ratchet-like sequential SM association with a series of SNARE assembly intermediates, with each sub-step traversing a smaller energy barrier. The central cavities of SMs are proposed binding sites for SNARE helical bundles and vary in the sizes of their openings, implying conformational flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bracher and Weissenhorn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-On et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations provide new empirical support for models in which SM proteins and perhaps SNAREs must undergo substantial conformational transitions to productively associate. The nature of these transitions, and the specific biochemical events that allow SM binding and on-pathway fusion to occur over physiologically relevant time scales, remain to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>SNAREs and SM open reading frames were cloned into bacterial expresssion vectors using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers found your work interesting and recommended publication after appropriate revision. In particular, simultaneous binding of Sec17 and an SM protein to a SNARE complex is unprecedented and unexpected. By altering our fundamental understanding of how the key components of the membrane fusion machinery interact, this discovery seems likely to have a major impact on future work in the field.</p><p>There were several technical concerns and questions for clarification. Of these, there is one all reviewers would like you to address:</p><p>The findings from Carpp et al. (JCB 2006) that a point mutation in Vps45 can shift the equilibrium binding between a Tlg2 SNARE-binding mode to a SNARE complex-binding mode is consistent with the idea presented here that increasing the temperature increases the probability that the SM protein can shift into a SNARE complex-binding mode. Hence, the increased rate of binding at higher temperatures. Perhaps pre-heating the SM protein alone first would increase the rate of binding when subsequently added to Sec17-SNARE complexes (or SNARE complexes alone), this could indicate that the conformational change is restricted to the SM protein only. Other issues to address – note that we do not consider it as essential to carry out additional experiments to address them – they are for your consideration and/or editorial changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>1) While the evidence for SM-Sec17-SNARE complexes seems overwhelming, I was not entirely convinced that assembly of this 'ternary' complex is “highly cooperative” Establishing cooperativity would seem to require additional evidence or, if I am missing something, at least a more careful marshalling of the existing evidence.</p><p>2) I can see why the authors favor the model that the SM protein binds to a composite surface that includes both Sec17 and the SNARE bundle. Nonetheless, I don't think that an alternative model can really be ruled out in which the SM protein recognizes a distinct configuration of Sec17 molecules achieved only when they are bound to the 'cognate' SNARE complex.</p><p>3) In relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it's important to mention that syntaxin 5 lacks the N-terminal peptide.

This should be discussed; is it possible that Sec1 is sufficiently different from Sly1 and Vps33?</p><p>2) Along those lines, a more “universal” picture would be gained by demonstrating that other SM proteins also show these conserved features. Vps45 and Sec1 could be tested, to complete the yeast family, and/or Munc18-1 or Munc18c. This may be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>3) It is not clear, given the SNAP-SNARE complex binding data and model from Marz et al. (JBC 2003), and a variety of SM mutants with disrupted binding to SNARE complexes, how to build a model for the SM and 3 copies of Sec17 binding to SNARE complexes at the same time. There does not seem to be enough room available.</p><p>4) “...but Sec17 does not bind either Sly1 or Sed5 in the absence of the assembled SNARE complex.” This is misleading, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> actually shows that Sec17 can bind Sly1, IF Sly1 is not bound to full-length Sed5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, not 6C). This is a curious finding that might indicate that binding of the N-peptide of Sed5 may affect the conformation of Sly1 (as suggested in Furgason et al (PNAS 2009) for Vps45-Tlg2 binding. In the cell, the syntaxin-family SNAREs will have their N-terminal domains and N-peptides, how does this affect the proposed model?</p><p>5) Use of the word “universal”, especially “universal co-chaperone” and “universal disassembly engine”. Although many of us would appreciate the membrane trafficking centric view of biology, this terminology, it is quite confusing due to many other co-chaperones and disassembly machine for other non-membrane trafficking biological processes.</p><p>6) The Q10 thermal coefficient needs to be better defined, referenced and the calculations described in M&amp;M</p><p>7) In the figures, the axis need to be consistently clear whether the protein being tested is full-length Sec5 or the SNARE domain only (the labels change from panel to panel).</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>, it is curious that the SM stays bound to the SNARE complexes after disassembly by Sec18/Sec17, while Sec17 is removed. It is not clear how this fits into the overall picture of SM-Sec17 function proposed here.</p><p>9) Not necessary to provide the genotype for commercially available E. coli strains.</p><p>10) The plasmid information in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref> is rather limited and the relevant information is not obvious from the Materials and methods</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#3:</italic></p><p>1) The problem is that conclusions are drawn about pre-fusion complexes but all biochemical experiments are carried out with fully assembled SNARE complexes that represent the post-fusion state. To me it is unclear why SM proteins should block disassembly of a “cis” SNARE complex such as the one immobilized on the beads - biologically this does not make much sense. It needs to be explained how the SM proteins (or NSF) differentiate between prefusion and postfusion complexes (apparently the authors are aware of the problem – see question mark on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, pathway IV). Thus the cartoon does not represent the findings correctly as all experiments were done with SNARE complexes shown on the far right in the cartoon (after fusion). Answering this question would require different approaches and is probably not straightforward.</p><p>2) I have some concerns about the fact that all experiments are carried out on beads under equilibrium conditions, i.e., using long incubation times, with the Q-a SNARE being immobilized. For instance, it is unclear to me why such long preincubation is required for the SM-proteins to exert their inhibitory effect on Sec18p-driven disassembly – as far as I remember previous work binding is fast. Similarly, I consider it as problematic to carry out re-assembly kinetics in such a manner – the bands are barely visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and only become convincing after adding an approx. 6fold excess of soluble SNAREs, and kinetic resolution is poor. Furthermore, it is conceivable that binding of SM-proteins to a preassembled complex including SNAREs and alpha-SNAP may nonspecifically prevent access of the bulky Sec18p protein (that may not be able anymore to enter the pores of the resin) rather than blocking access to the SNARE complex. For these reasons I suggest to carry out at least one or two control experiments in solution or with the Qa-SNARE being incorporated into the membrane of liposomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02272.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The findings from Carpp et al.

We performed the suggested experiment (now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>). The results show that pre-incubation of Sly1 at 30° C versus lower temperatures has no effect on the subsequent efficiency of Sly1 binding to the SNARE-Sec17 complex. This indicates that elevated temperature does not induce a time-stable binding competence to Sly1 or the other proteins in the system, and is consistent with the interpretation that binding requires Sly1 or perhaps another molecule in the system to equilibrate between two states: a sparsely-occupied (higher-energy), binding-competent state, and a densely-occupied (lower-energy), binding incompetent state. Elevated temperature would increase the rate of inter-conversion between these states, elevating the rate of productive complex formation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) While the evidence for SM-Sec17-SNARE complexes seems overwhelming, I was not entirely convinced that assembly of this 'ternary' complex is “highly cooperative” Establishing cooperativity would seem to require additional evidence or, if I am missing something, at least a more careful marshalling of the existing evidence</italic>.</p><p>The relevant distinction may be semantic, but that does not mean it is unimportant. There are multiple types of cooperativity, among which one may delineate at least two classical cases (Ptashne, 2007). The first case is positive conformational cooperativity (allostery), exemplified by the affinity increase that occurs as molecules of O2 sequentially bind hemoglobin. The second case is simpler and more general: the combined effect of multiple binding sites (avidity). It is exemplified by binding of monomeric phage λ repressor to its individual DNA operator half-site, versus the considerably stronger binding of λ repressor to its native palindromic operator, resulting from a low-affinity dimerization interface on the repressor protein. This type of cooperativity can in principle occur solely through rigid body interactions, or it can be coupled to conformational dynamics. Although we do not yet have a deep mechanistic understanding of how SM-Sec17-SNARE assembly occurs, the present experiments strongly support this more general kind of cooperative assembly. We removed the word “highly” to more precisely convey what can, and cannot yet, be said about the mechanisms that drive this assembly reaction.</p><p><italic>2) I can see why the authors favor the model that the SM protein binds to a composite surface that includes both Sec17 and the SNARE bundle. Nonetheless, I don't think that an alternative model can really be ruled out in which the SM protein recognizes a distinct configuration of Sec17 molecules achieved only when they are bound to the 'cognate' SNARE complex</italic>.</p><p>For an SM to exhibit selectivity for its cognate SNARE-Sec17 complex without direct SM-SNARE contacts, Sec17 would need to bind each SNARE complex in a distinct conformation, and these conformational differences would then need to be transmitted to, and recognized by, the SM. This is far from the simplest explanation of our results but it cannot at present be excluded. We note that Vps33 has the intrinsic ability to recognize cognate versus non-cognate SNARE complexes. That is, Sec17-dependent and Sec17-independent binding of Vps33 to SNARE complex are of different affinities, but exhibit comparable selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, compare Vps33 binding in lanes 2 and 2´; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobingier and Merz (2012)</xref>.

We emphasize that in the SNARE disassembly assays, comparable results were obtained with SNARE complexes built on the Sed5 SNARE domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or with complexes built on the full Sed5 cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) “The Sec17 concentration required to saturate Golgi SNARE complex was about four-fold greater than for vacuole SNARE complex.” Are these data not shown</italic>?</p><p>The divergent Sec17 affinity for different SNARE complexes was initially noted in binding optimization studies that are not shown. However, the difference is evident in experiments that are shown, as now noted in Results. Compare the amount of Sec17 required to saturate vacuole SNARE complex (5 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) vs. Golgi SNARE complex (20 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Indeed, like Togneri et al. for Sec1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng and Gallwitz (2002)</xref>, reported that Sly1 does not prevent NSF-mediated SNARE disassembly. However, in these studies only endpoints and not intermediate stages of disassembly were examined. In the present experiments disassembly also ran to completion, but in the presence of bound Vps33 or Sly, we observed kinetic delays (vs. absolute blockades of disassembly) at intermediate time points.</p><p><italic>2) Along those lines, a more “universal” picture would be gained by demonstrating that other SM proteins also show these conserved features. Vps45 and Sec1 could be tested, to complete the yeast family, and/or Munc18-1 or Munc18c. This may be beyond the scope of this manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Agreed. We see the comparative analysis of Vps33 and Sly1 as a strength of the present experiments, and anticipate that the results will spur additional experimentation from other scientists working on SM proteins.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear, given the SNAP-SNARE complex binding data and model from Marz et al. (JBC 2003), and a variety of SM mutants with disrupted binding to SNARE complexes, how to build a model for the SM and 3 copies of Sec17 binding to SNARE complexes at the same time. There does not seem to be enough room available</italic>.</p><p>This is a major question, particularly at the synapse where Munc-13, Munc-18, synaptotagmin, complexin, and perhaps other factors all appear to engage the pre-fusion trans-SNARE complex. At present, the most plausible model for how an SM might engage the tetrahelical SNARE bundle is derived from the crystal structure of Munc-18/nSec1 bound to the closed form of syntaxin, which folds into a tetrahelical bundle that might be a structurally analogous to the SNARE complex (Misura et al., 2000).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02272-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>If this structural analogy is broadly correct, well over half of the SNARE bundle circumference, and most of the bundle’s surface area, should be exposed for Sec17/α-SNAP binding. In a recent single-particle EM study of 20S SNARE- α-SNAP-NSF complexes (Chang et al., 2012), C3 (threefold rotational) symmetry was imposed for SNARE-bound Sec17, resulting in a C4:C3 SNARE–α-SNAP pseudosymmetry mismatch. To the best of our knowledge there is no experimental basis for this imposition of C3 symmetry. In an alternative model, Hanson’s group proposed that three adjacent Sec17/α-SNAP molecules wrap around one side of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marz et al., 2003</xref>) – an arrangement that could readily accommodate three Sec17/α-SNAP molecules and one SM per SNARE bundle, as observed in our experiments.</p><p><italic>4) “...but Sec17 does not bind either Sly1 or Sed5 in the absence of the assembled SNARE complex.” This is misleading, because</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F</italic></xref> <italic>actually shows that Sec17 can bind Sly1, IF Sly1 is not bound to full-length Sed5 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>, not 6C). This is a curious finding that might indicate that binding of the N-peptide of Sed5 may affect the conformation of Sly1 (as suggested in Furgason et al (PNAS 2009) for Vps45-Tlg2 binding. In the cell, the syntaxin-family SNAREs will have their N-terminal domains and N-peptides, how does this</italic> <italic>affect the proposed model?</italic></p><p>There are a few issues to discuss here. First, the interaction between the Sly1 and the N-peptide of Sed5 is not required for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peng and Gallwitz, 2004</xref>). Vps33 does not have an N-peptide binding pocket and does not interact with the N-peptide of Vam3. Moreover, Vam3 does not enter into a closed conformation and the N-terminal domains of Vam3 are nonessential for Vam3 function (Dulubova et al., 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; Wang et al., 2001; Laage and Ungermann, 2001). Similarly, yeast Sec1 does not interact with Qa-SNARE N-peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Togneri et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, interactions between SM proteins and Qa-SNARE N-peptides are not universal and, where they do occur, they are not consistently important for SM function. If there is indeed a general function of SM proteins in SNARE-mediated fusion, that function cannot generally depend on Qa-SNARE N-peptide interactions. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Sed5 N-peptide binding to Sly1 initiates a conformational change that regulates Sly1 assembly dynamics, as suggested for Vps45 and for mammalian Sly1 (Furgason et al., 2009; Arac et al., 2005).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> may indeed indicate some affinity between Sly1 and Sec17. However, the main conclusion of this experiment is that Sly1 does not readily bind the SNARE core bundle unless Sec17 is present. Because this experiment was analyzed by immunoblot, we caution that additional control experiments would be required before we could definitively conclude that the Sec17 signal observed in the absence of SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, lane 2) is specific binding rather than background. This is particularly so given the result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (lanes 7 and 8), where Sec17 binding to Sed5-tethered Sly1 is not detected. We have modified the relevant passage in the Results to clarify the nature of this uncertainty.</p><p><italic>5) Use of the word “universal”, especially “universal co-chaperone” and “universal disassembly engine”. Although many of us would appreciate the membrane trafficking centric view of biology, this terminology, it is quite confusing due to many other co-chaperones and disassembly machine for other non-membrane trafficking biological processes</italic>.</p><p>We've deleted the word “universal,” and taken some care to specify that Sec17 and Sec18 are general SNARE disassembly factors rather than universal protein chaperones.</p><p><italic>6) The Q10 thermal coefficient needs to be better defined, referenced and the calculations described in M&amp;M</italic></p><p>Estimation of Q10 is now described in the Methods, and a reference to classical applications is cited (Hille, 1991, p. 51 ff).</p><p><italic>7) In the figures, the axis need to be consistently clear whether the protein being tested is full-length Sec5 or the SNARE domain only (the labels</italic> <italic>change from panel to panel)</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>8) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3B and 3C</italic></xref><italic>, it is curious that the SM stays bound to the SNARE complexes after disassembly by Sec18/Sec17, while Sec17 is removed. It is not clear how this fits into the overall picture of SM-Sec17 function proposed here</italic>.</p><p>We agree. Additional in vitro and in vivo experimentation will be needed to evaluate the significance of this observation.</p><p><italic>9) Not necessary to provide the genotype for commercially available E. coli strains</italic>.</p><p>OK.</p><p><italic>10) The plasmid information in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table II</italic></xref> <italic>is rather limited and the relevant information is not obvious from the Materials and methods</italic></p><p>We have more clearly described how the plasmids were constructed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The problem is that conclusions are drawn about pre-fusion complexes but all biochemical experiments are carried out with fully assembled SNARE complexes that represent the post-fusion state. To me it is unclear why SM proteins should block disassembly of a “cis” SNARE complex such as the one immobilized on the beads – biologically this does not make much sense. It needs to be explained how the SM proteins (or NSF) differentiate between prefusion and postfusion complexes (apparently the authors are aware of the problem – see question mark on the right in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9B</italic></xref><italic>, pathway IV). Thus the cartoon does not represent the findings correctly as all experiments were done with SNARE complexes shown on the far right in the cartoon (after fusion). Answering this question would require different approaches and is probably not straightforward</italic>.</p><p>There are two critical differences between pre-fusion trans-SNARE complexes and post-fusion cis-SNARE complexes: first, differences in the conformations of the C-terminal (juxtamembrane) segments of the proteins; and second, differences in the topology and topography of the membranes within which the SNAREs are anchored. With only cytoplasmic domains (but not transmembrane segments and the associated membranes), it is inappropriate to identify the complexes studied here as either cis or trans.</p><p>In previous work we demonstrated that authentic kinetically stable trans-SNARE complexes assembled through the native docking pathway can be trapped on intact vacuolar lysosomes. These trans-complexes are zipped to packing layer +3 or +4; we and others have presented strong evidence that Sec17 can functionally and physically interact with these trapped trans-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, single-molecule laser tweezers experiments with neuronal SNARE complexes are fully consistent with the interpretation that pre-fusion complexes zipper to layer +3 or +4 (Gao et al., 2012). Thus, ∼70% of the SNARE bundle can be fully folded in the pre-fusion trans-complex.</p><p>The SM binding footprint on the SNARE bundle has not been mapped in detail for any SM. Consequently, it is still unclear whether Sec17, SMs, or both operating in concert, can discriminate in functionally meaningful ways between cis- and trans-SNARE complexes. However, we emphasize that functional experimentation with liposomes initially prompted the hypothesis that SM proteins protect trans-SNARE complexes from premature disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; Mima and Wickner, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Our preferred working model focuses on SM and Sec17 association with pre- versus post-fusion complexes, because that interpretation is most consistent not only with the present in vivo and biochemical experiments, but with functional studies published by other laboratories. If our working model inspires experiments that cause it to be supplanted by a better model, it will have served its purpose.</p><p><italic>2) I have some concerns about the fact that all experiments are carried out on beads under equilibrium conditions, i.e., using long incubation times, with the Q-a SNARE being immobilized. For instance, it is unclear to me why such long preincubation is required for the SM-proteins to exert their inhibitory effect on Sec18p-driven disassembly – as far as I remember previous work binding is fast</italic>.</p><p>To our knowledge, no one has previously reported Sly1 binding directly to the SNARE core bundle. In previous work, SNARE complexes were assembled on the full cytoplasmic domain of Sed5 – including the Sed5 N-peptide, which Sly1 binds with low-nM affinity. Because the on-rate for this high-affinity binding interaction is fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>), the slower on-rate of Sly1 binding to the SNARE core bundle would have been obscured by the high-affinity Sly1-N-peptide interaction in previously published experiments. The slow on-rate of Sly1 (and of Vps33) binding to SNARE core bundles could reflect a requirement for another protein or a small molecule that accelerates binding, or it could reflect the initial recruitment of the SM to a SNARE assembly intermediate. These issues were raised at length in the original Discussion. In the current submission, the text has been modified for greater clarity.</p><p><italic>Similarly, I consider it as problematic to carry out re-assembly kinetics in such a manner – the bands are barely visible (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>) and only become convincing after adding an approx. 6fold excess of soluble SNAREs, and kinetic resolution is poor</italic>.</p><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are controls, and are set up specifically not to show assembly end-points, but rather to ascertain whether the increased abundance of SNARE complexes following disassembly in the presence of Vps33 or Sly1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) reflect increases in re-assembly. The experiment was run under the conditions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> specifically to control for that possibility. We reiterate that experiments showing that Sly1 and Vps33 do not stimulate SNARE assembly in solution have also been reported by other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosodo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng and Gallwitz, 2002</xref>).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, it is conceivable that binding of SM-proteins to a preassembled complex including SNAREs and alpha-SNAP may nonspecifically prevent access of the bulky Sec18p protein (that may not be able anymore to enter the pores of the resin) rather than blocking access to the SNARE complex. For these reasons I suggest to carry out at least one or two control experiments in solution or with the Qa-SNARE being incorporated into the membrane of liposomes</italic>.</p><p>The relatively low density of SNARE complex on the affinity resin, and the complete disassembly we observe, suggests that steric occlusion is not a major issue. Moreover, the multiple-turnover rate we observe for Sec18-mediated disassembly of Golgi SNARE complexes (1.35±0.01 complexes • Sec18 hexamer-1 • min-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>) are identical to the rate observed in solution for NSF-mediated disassembly of neuronal complexes under similar ionic conditions (∼1 complex • Sec18 hexamer-1 • min-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cipriano et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the rate of disassembly in our assays is linear over the time intervals assayed, further indicating that there is not a less-accessible subpopulation of complexes buried within the affinity matrix.</p></body></sub-article></article>
