To characterize this process, we conducted CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screens using a cell-based assay in which mitosis is consistently disturbed by centrosome loss. We identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53, evoking p21-dependent cell cycle arrest in response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects causing prolonged mitosis. Intriguingly, 53BP1 mediates p53 activation independently of its DNA repair activity, but requiring its interacting protein USP28 that can directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro and ectopically stabilize p53 in vivo. Moreover, 53BP1 can transduce prolonged mitosis to cell cycle arrest independently of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), suggesting that while SAC protects mitotic accuracy by slowing down mitosis, 53BP1 and USP28 function in parallel to select against disturbed or delayed mitosis, promoting mitotic efficiency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16270.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16270.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>stress signalling</kwd><kwd>cell cycle arrest</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009859</institution-id><institution>Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Tuhin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsou</surname><given-names>Meng-Fu Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-14-153-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsou</surname><given-names>Meng-Fu Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tumor Protein p53 Binding Protein 1 and Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 28 engage p53 to promote mitotic efficiency.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitosis is a critical cell cycle phase during which duplicated chromosomes are correctly separated into two identical units on the spindle, restoring genome integrity after cell division. Various mechanisms exist to ensure proper mitosis with high accuracy. During mitotic entry at the G2/M border, cells can abort the process and return to G2 in response to damages or stresses via the antephase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rieder and Cole, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsusaka and Pines, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rudner and Murray, 1996</xref>). After committing to mitotic entry, the accuracy of chromosome segregation is further protected by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which functions to delay anaphase onset until all chromosomes or kinetochores are properly attached to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rieder and Cole, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>). A wide range of cellular stresses are known to directly or indirectly disturb spindle assembly or chromosome segregation, including centrosome/kinetochore/microtubule dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vitre and Cleveland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>), DNA damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mikhailov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carlson, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smits et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hut et al., 2003</xref>), heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maldonado-Codina et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vidair et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zajac et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Erenpreisa et al., 2000</xref>), hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nystul et al., 2003</xref>), and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurata, 2000</xref>), many of which activate SAC to slow down mitosis so that extra time is available for error correction. When mitotic stresses persist and errors are not fixed, cells can die via apoptosis during the prolonged arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topham, 2013</xref>). In cases where cells go through mitosis in a normal time frame but divide in the presence of errors, cell cycle arrest can still be induced after mitotic exit. For example, a missegregating chromosome in anaphase is able to induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in the next G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hinchcliffe et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been reported that missegregating chromosomes can be damaged by the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and thereby activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response in the following G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>). In instances where missegregating chromosomes form micronuclei, they induce an ATR-dependent DNA damage response when the chromosomes undergo defective DNA replication that results in chromosome fragmentation and rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crasta et al., 2012</xref>). Missegregating chromosomes have also been shown to increase formation of protein aggregates in cells and induce a proteotoxic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oromendia et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, some mitotic errors are known to cause cytokinesis failure, which in turn triggers p53 activation via the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganem et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to aforementioned damages, p53-dependent cell death or senescence has long been known as a stress response in cells going through division with a prolonged M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanni and Jacks, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</xref>). Depending on how long mitosis is disturbed or stalled, the trigger for p53 activation seems to vary, and in some cases, is perhaps a combination of many signals. A severe mitotic delay caused by prolonged treatments of spindle poisons can induce secondary damages such as telomere fusions, DNA damages, or leaky apoptosis, all of which contribute to p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colin et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, however, even a mild stress in mitosis, such as centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mikule et al., 2007</xref>) or transient treatments of spindle poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</xref>), which does not induce gross chromosome missegregation defects, cytokinesis errors, or other known secondary damages, can still efficiently trigger a widespread p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Thus, regardless of what the actual trigger is in each case, it is clear that cells are sensitive to mitotic disturbance or delay, and that unfit cells undergoing erroneous or prolonged mitosis are selected against through various stress response mechanisms. To explore these selection processes in detail, here we used theÂ centrosome loss as a model for mitotic stress, and performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify essential molecules acting upstream or downstream of p53 in the pathway. We have surprisingly identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53 to mediate the stress response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects that cause prolonged mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cell-based assay for centrosome loss-induced mitotic stress</title><p>Using diploid, non-transformed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, we constructed a stable <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cell line in which the endogenous PLK4, a kinase specifically required for centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>), was replaced with an analog-sensitive mutant (PLK4<sup>as</sup>) that could be chemically inactivated by the ATP analog 3MBPP1 (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim, 2016</xref>). Upon PLK4 inactivation, cells were gradually depleted of centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and started to divide more slowly with mitotic duration increasing to ~100 min instead of ~30 min observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within a few days, all acentrosomal cells stopped proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and were arrested in G1 with high levels of nuclear p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong, 2015</xref>). Removal of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), however, alleviated both the growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and nuclear accumulation of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but not mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), allowing acentrosomal cells to continue proliferating in the presence of mitotic stress at rates not significantly different from control or unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Eight independent screens were performed using a pooled lentivirus sgRNA library covering &gt;95% of human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>), with each gene targeted by at least 6 different sgRNAs. sgRNAs carried or enriched by survivors were analyzed by deep sequencing to reveal the targeted genes, and 27 candidate genes were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). sgRNAs for 5 genes were most highly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), including the previously known p53 and p21, and three novel genes, 53BP1, USP28, and TRIM37 that have not been linked to centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest. Moreover, for these 5 genes, at least 3 out of the 6 sgRNAs were repeatedly enriched in independent screens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that they are unlikely false positive hits. 53BP1 is a known key player in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panier and Boulton, 2014</xref>), but was first characterized as a binding partner of p53, albeit with unclear functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thukral et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwabuchi et al., 1994</xref>). USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme known to interact with 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), but it puzzlingly has minor or no role in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knobel et al., 2014</xref>), raising an interesting possibility that perhaps 53BP1 and USP28 have a specific role in centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest. Apart from 53BP1, no other sgRNAs targeting major DNA damage response (DDR) components such as ATM, MDC1, RNF8 or BRCA1 were enriched in our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), even though they could be repeatedly detected in the baseline reads in all independent screens.

To test whether 53BP1 and USP28 act downstream or upstream of p53 in the pathway, we examined p53 accumulation in cells. Upon centrosome removal, nuclear p53 was detected in nearly all <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cells arrested in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). The same result was seen for acentrosomal <italic>p21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) albeit actively proliferating, consistent with p21 acting downstream of p53 to execute G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stewart et al., 1999</xref>).

Similarly, western blot analyses revealed that the total p53 levels in <italic>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells were kept low during acentrosomal cell division in the presence of mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that 53BP1 and USP28 function upstream of p53 to initiate cell cycle arrest in response to centrosome loss. Note that the elevation in p53 protein levels during centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest was likely due to a post-transcription event, as we observed no increase in p53 mRNA levels during the arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Eg5 inhibitor and MG132 induce mitotic delay through distinct mechanisms, with the former a spindle poison disrupting spindle bipolarity, and the latter blocking cyclin B destruction without affecting spindle assembly. To this end, cells were synchronized at G2-M transition by CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306, after which they were released into mitosis in the presence of Eg5 inhibitor or MG132. Mitotic cells were then shaken off at defined time points, washed of the drugs and cultured for 24âhr in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

This led us to hypothesize that 53BP1 mediates the G1 arrest independently of its DDR role. Inspection of 53BP1 sequence revealed that apart from the multiple domains and motifs that are critical for DDR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panier and Boulton, 2014)</xref>, the C-terminal tandem BRCT domain is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ward et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the tandem BRCT domain is known to interact with p53 and USP28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwabuchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knobel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Derbyshire et al., 2002</xref>). We hence speculated that the tandem BRCT domain is required for the G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss. To test this, we stably expressed exogenous wild type 53BP1 or 53BP1 BRCT-deletion mutant (53BP1<sup>ÎBRCT</sup>) in <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), inactivated PLK4 to induce centrosome loss, and assessed whether the G1 arrest could be rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). While ~90% of the cells expressing wild-type 53BP1 arrested in G1 upon centrosome removal, reintroduction of the 53BP1<sup>ÎBRCT</sup> mutant failed to do so, allowing acentrosomal cells to proliferate in the presence of mitotic stress/delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).

Capitalizing on this inhibitory mechanism, we asked whether reintroduction of a phosphomimetic mutant of 53BP1 (53BP1<sup>TESE</sup>) could rescue the G1 arrest of <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells dividing in the absence of theÂ centrosome. We found that despite lacking DDR function as indicated by its delocalization from DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), the 53BP1<sup>TESE</sup> mutant could robustly rescue G1 arrest in response to mitotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), indicating that the DDR function of 53BP1 is not required for the G1 arrest. To further determine if the mitotis-specific phosphorylation of 53BP1, which inactivates its DDR function, is required for 53BP1 to mediate G1 arrest, we expressed the constitutively active, phosphonull form of 53BP1 (53BP1<sup>TASA</sup>) in <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Intriguingly, 53BP1<sup>TASA</sup> efficiently rescued the arrest in G1 upon centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Together, our results indicate that 53BP1 can efficiently mediate the centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest regardless of whether it is active for DDR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>USP28 mediates centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest through its deubiquitinase activity, and acts downstream of 53BP1 to stabilize p53</title><p>USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme carrying two conserved catalytic domains â UCH-1 (Cys box) and UCH-2 (His box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test whether USP28 mediates centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest through its enzymatic activity, we mutated the catalytic cysteine (C171) and histidine (H600) to alanine and examined the consequence on the G1 arrest. We found that unlike wild-type USP28, expression of the catalytic-inactive USP28 (USP28<sup>CI</sup>) in <italic>PLK4as; USP28<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>) failed to rescue the G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss, phenocopying the loss of USP28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), indicating that the catalytic activity of USP28 is essential for the G1 arrest. Moreover, purified USP28 was found to directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), raising potentially a direct role of USP28 in stabilizing p53 in vivo. Consistently, overexpression of the wild type USP28 but not USP28<sup>CI</sup> in normal, unstressed cells caused ectopic nuclear p53 accumulation and cell cycle arrest uniformly across the entire population (100%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; not shown). The nuclear p53 accumulation caused by overexpression of wild type USP28 was not due to a specific increase in p53 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), further supporting our observation that USP28 deubiquitinates p53 for protein stabilization. To determine the relationship between 53BP1 and USP28, we examined whether the ectopic stabilization of p53 by USP28 depends on 53BP1, and vice versa. We found that upon USP28 overexpression, p53 was robustly stabilized even <italic>in 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating that USP28 does not act upstream of 53BP1 to control p53 level.

Thus, consistent with the known interaction of 53BP1 with USP28, we show that while 53BP1 has no deubiquitinase activity, it can function upstream of USP28 to stabilize p53.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16270.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>USP28 is catalytically required for p53 stabilization during centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organization of the conserved catalytic domains in USP28.

In normal cells, 53BP1, but not USP28, was found to localize to kinetochores during early mitosis when spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) was on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left, bright BubR1 signal), and delocalize at anaphase when SAC was off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left, weak BubR1), a pattern resembling that of SAC components as documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jullien et al., 2002</xref>). We next examined if 53BP1 behaves like SAC components during mitotic stress. Upon centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> right) or Eg5 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), cells were delayed in prometaphase during which SAC was on, as indicated by bright BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) or Mad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) at kinetochores. Strikingly, under the same conditions, 53BP1 was often seen to be absent from the kinetochore, suggesting that 53BP1 is not a typical SAC component. To test whether 53BP1 disassociates from kinetochore in a time-dependent manner, cells were synchronized at G2/M, released into stressed mitosis with activated SAC, and examined for kinetochore 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Intriguingly, in cells stressed with centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> left) or Eg5 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> right), 53BP1 gradually disassociated from kinetochores, starting from ~30 min after mitotic entry, whereas the SAC components BubR1 or Mad2 were consistently detected at kinetochores during the lengthened prometaphase. These results suggest that the kinetochore localization of 53BP1 is time-sensitive, rather than dependent on SAC. To further examine the relationship between kinetochore 53BP1 and SAC, we asked whether reactivation of SAC after it was turned off could relocalize 53BP1 to mitotic kinetochores. We inactivated SAC by arresting cells in metaphase with MG132 treatment, as indicated by the weak BubR1 or the absence of Mad2 signals at the kinetochores, and then reactivated SAC with a transient pulse of nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that reactivation of SAC efficiently targeted both BubR1 and Mad2 back to the kinetochore, but had no effect on 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), further demonstrating that unlike SAC, the disassociation of 53BP1 from kinetochore is irreversible, a distinct property that can potentially be used to mark the duration of mitotic stress independent of SAC.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16270.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SAC activation is not essential for mitotic stress-induced G1 arrest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 53BP1 normally disassociates from the kinetochores during anaphase, but can do so prematurely in prometaphase upon mitotic stress/delay.

The contrary nature of the two processes suggests that 53BP1/USP28 and SAC may act independent of each other. Indeed, SAC-dependent mitotic delay caused by centrosome loss or Eg5 inhibition can still occur normally in <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup>, 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup>, USP28<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>p21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref> right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; not shown). Similarly, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could arrest cells at metaphase without activating SAC, as indicated by the weak BubR1 or lack of Mad2 signals at the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but efficiently trigger G1 arrest as shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, bottom panels), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</xref>). To further test if a transient SAC activation during early prometaphase is required for the G1 arrest, we repeated the MG132-induced mitotic delay assay in the presence or absence of MPS1 activity, a kinase essential for SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maciejowski et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Using <italic>MPS1<sup>as</sup></italic> cells, we found that inactivation of MPS1, which disabled SAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), caused all cells to rapidly progress through mitosis in 12 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maciejowski et al., 2010</xref>) (not shown), and became fully arrested in the following G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, top panel, 0âhr), likely due to erroneous chromosome segregation or cell division which resulted from the drastically shortened mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maciejowski et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we found that such MPS1 deficiency-induced G1 arrest could be reversed by a short treatment of MG132 in mitosis for 0.5âhr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, top panel), allowing cells sufficient time to assemble spindles for cell division. Intriguingly, however, longer MG132 treatments of 2âhr or more, which allowed cells more than enough time for spindle assembly, uniformly arrested cells in G1 after mitosis, regardless of whether MPS1 activity was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, top panel). Consistently, removal of 53BP1 rescued the G1 arrest induced by the prolonged MG132 treatment in the absence of MPS1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, bottom panel). These results together suggest that a prolonged mitotic stress can activate G1 arrest without ever activating SAC. Thus, 53BP1/USP28 and SAC are two in-parallel mitotic programs, with SAC protecting the accuracy of mitosis (at the expense of speed), and 53BP1/USP28 selecting against stressed/delayed mitosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitosis is a crucial phase of the cell cycle in which cellular elements are divided between two daughter cells. While the accuracy of chromosome segregation is guarded by SAC, we found that a separate program involving 53BP1 and USP28 is required to monitor mitotic progression independent of SAC. We showed that 53BP1 and USP28 are required to trigger p53/p21- dependent cell cycle arrest, evoking an irreversible stress response that selects against unfit cells with disturbed mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, 53BP1 is a well-characterized DDR component whose activity in DNA repair is disabled specifically during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, we found that the involvement of 53BP1 in G1 arrest induced by disturbed mitosis is independent of its role in DNA repair, but requires its known binding partners p53 and USP28, unraveling the functional significance of these previously puzzling interactions. Thus, 53BP1 is more than a DNA damage-responding molecule. Moreover, we showed that the kinetochore association of 53BP1 during mitosis is time-sensitive, providing a possible route through which the duration of mitotic stress can be measured or responded to, directly or indirectly, in the form of chemical reactions. It remains to be seen if delocalization of 53BP1 from kinetochores directly activates the G1 arrest induced by mitotic stress. Note that while centrosome loss frequently lengthens the duration of mitotic progression, previous studies showed that G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss can occur without a significant mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong, 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that both centrosome loss and mitotic delay (induced by Eg5 inhibitor or MG132) cause a common underlying damage that activates the G1 arrest. The underlying damage is yet to be identified. Alternatively, two distinct errors may be generated by centrosome loss and prolonged mitosis, and the G1 arrest induced by both errors are mediated by 53BP1 and USP28.</p><p>The accuracy of mitosis is guarded by SAC at the expense of speed. That is, when mitosis is disturbed, SAC is activated to stall the process, allowing more time for mitosis to proceed correctly. In this sense, cells should not be 'penalized' for spending extra time in mitosis, when accuracy can evidently benefit from it. This idea, however, is inconsistent with the observation that even a mild delay in mitosis (~90âmin) can uniformly trigger p53 dependent cell cycle arrest. One possibility is that mitosis is a delicate environment where non-specific cellular damages are prone to be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colin et al., 2015</xref>), and that p53 activation may act as a 'preemptive strike' to eliminate cells potentially damaged by spending too much time in mitosis. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that slow mitosis may serve as an indication for cells that are unfit for proliferation (i.e. overstressed, aged, or carrying unresolved damages) but somehow slip into mitosis, and thus need to be removed from the population. In this case, mitosis mayÂ be used as a fitness test for cycling cells, providing a selection where only cells able to exercise mitosis efficiently are allowed to proliferate again. It will be very interesting to see how cells properly manage this tug-of-war between accuracy and speed to maximize mitotic efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), and what will happen if the balance breaks off. Our results here will likely facilitate future studies on subjects related to mitotic efficiency, stress response, cell fitness, and antimitotic drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>RPE1 cells were cultured in DME/F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

For rescue experiments, clonal <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>-KI; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>-KI; USP28<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>cell lines stably carrying various constructs expressing 53BP1<sup>WT</sup>, 53BP1<sup>ÎBRCT</sup>, 53BP1<sup>TESE</sup>, 53BP1<sup>TASA</sup>, USP28<sup>WT</sup> or USP28<sup>CI</sup> from the tetracycline-inducible promoter were made through in vivo gene delivery using the lentiviral vector pLVX-Tight-Puro vector (Clonetech). 53BP1<sup>WT</sup>, 53BP1<sup>ÎBRCT</sup>, 53BP1<sup>TESE</sup> and 53BP1<sup>TASA</sup> cDNA constructs were kind gifts from Daniel Durocher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>), and were used for subcloning into pLVX-Tight-Puro vector. Wild type USP28 construct (pDZ50, Addgene plasmid #41948) was a gift from Stephen Elledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), and was used for subcloning into pLVX-Tight-Puro vector. USP28<sup>CI</sup> was created with site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tetracycline-inducible <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cell line generation</title><p>Both <italic>PLK4</italic> loci in RPE1 cells were modified through homologous recombination using adeno-associated virus vectors as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsou et al., 2009</xref>). A region covering exon 3 and 4 of <italic>PLK4</italic> loci, which contains the catalytic site of the kinase domain, was flanked with LoxP (or floxed). After generating the <italic>PLK4<sup>flox/neoflox</sup></italic> clones, we utilized the lentiviral pLVX-Tight-Puro vector system (Clonetech) to transduce a tetracycline inducible, analog sensitive construct of PLK4 (PLK4<sup>as</sup>). These <italic>PLK4<sup>flox/neoflox</sup>; tet-PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cells were then infected with anÂ adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase to delete the endogenous <italic>PLK4</italic>, plated in 96 well plates, and cultured in media containing 5Â ng/ml of doxycycline. Clonal <italic>PLK4<sup>-/-</sup>; tet-PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cell lines that exhibited the normal number of centrosomes were selected and maintained under 5Â ng/ml of doxycycline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screen</title><p>The human Genome-scale CRISPR Knock-Out (GeCKO) v2.0 pooled libraries generated by Zhang Lab were acquired from Addgene (#1000000049, 2 vector system - lentiCas9-Blast and lentiGuide-Puro)Â (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.addgene.org/crispr/libraries/geckov2/">http://www.addgene.org/crispr/libraries/geckov2/</ext-link>)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Amplification of the libraries was performed as recommended using MegaX DH10B T1 Electrocomp Cells (Invitrogen). Lentivirus library was produced using calcium-phosphate transfection in HEK293T cells. For each CRISPR screen, five 10 cm plates were seeded with the tetracycline-inducible <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> cells (<italic>PLK4<sup>-/-</sup>; tet-PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic>) expressing Cas9 at 1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> cells/plate. Cells were transduced with the lentivirus library the next day at 500 Î¼l/plate for 5âhr. The five 10 cm plates with the transduced cells were split into thirty 15 cm plates the day after. Three days later, to induce centrosome loss, doxycycline was removed to turn off PLK4<sup>as</sup> expression and 3MBPP1 was added to inactivate any basal level PLK4<sup>as</sup> activity. Cells were cultured and propagated for an additional four weeks before genomic DNA was extracted for deep sequencing to identify enriched sgRNAs. Cells were also harvested two days after PLK4 inactivation to monitor baseline sgRNA distribution. Eight independent CRISPR screens were performed to facilitate discrimination between true and false positive hits. Because off-target effects and passenger mutations can cause spuriously high reads for some sgRNAs in each experiment, a single high count for one sgRNA against a gene in one experiment should not be regarded as a true hit. For a gene to be scored as a âpositiveâ hit, at least two of its six sgRNAs needed to be repeatedly enriched (greater than 1000 HiSeq reads) in independent screens, with the HiSeq reads at least three times higher than the average of the baseline read.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>CRISPR-mediated gene targeting</title><p>RNA-guided targeting of <italic>p53, 53BP1, USP28</italic>, and <italic>p21</italic> in human cells was achieved through coexpression of the Cas9 protein with gRNAs using reagents prepared by the Church group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mali, 2013</xref>), which are available from Addgene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.addgene.org/crispr/church/">http://www.addgene.org/crispr/church/</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Pines (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors have investigated the response of cells to mitotic stress. They treat an RPE1 <italic>Plk4<sup>as</sup></italic> cell line with analogue inhibitor to deplete centrosomes and find that cells arrest in G1 with high p53 and p21 levels. This arrest is p53 dependent as previously described (e.g. Holland, Oegema), and in a very nicely done CRISPR screen the authors identify 27 clones that by-pass p53 to keep proliferating. Of these genes the authors follow up 53BP1 and USP28 in this study. They show that both proteins are required for p53 to accumulate in cells, and for cells to arrest in G1 cells after a delay in mitosis. They further show that 53BP1 lacking its C-terminal BRCT domains cannot arrest, whereas a 53BP1 T1609E/S1618E phosphomimetic mutant can impose a G1 arrest but is unable to carry out the M-phase DDR. USP28 requires its DUB catalytic activity for the G1 arrest, and this correlates with the ability to stabilize p53. Over-expressing USP28 can stabilize p53 in the absence of 53BP1, but 53BP1 needs USP28. These data are clear and nicely support the authors' conclusions that 53BP1 and USP28 act upstream of p53 to stabilize it in response to 'mitotic stress'.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major problem with the paper is how it is currently written. The Abstract and Introduction are very limited and oversimplified, especially in conceptual terms, as such, following the narrative through the rest of the manuscript is incredibly difficult and the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> will be very confused if this is not addressed with a major re-write. In particular, the authors invoke the term 'Mitotic Stress Response' and in doing so they conflate a series of very separate phenomena. There are multiple mechanisms that operate before, during and after mitosis in response to various &quot;stresses&quot;. In chronological order these are the &quot;antephase&quot; checkpoint (e.g. Rieder, Pines); the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, which delays anaphase until all kinetochores are stably attached to spindle microtubules, and many &quot;stresses&quot; that delay mitosis do so by activating the SAC; apoptosis that can occur in mitosis if the &quot;stress&quot; that is activating the SAC cannot be corrected (Taylor, Malumbres); finally the post-mitotic response, which may reflect one or more molecular pathways depending on the nature of the stress, and can induce either apoptosis or a cell cycle block. After mitosis, if a cell missegregates a chromosome, a chromosome trapped in the cleavage furrow can activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response in the next G1 (e.g. Medema). If a missegregating chromosome ends up in a micronucleus, this can induce a ATR-dependent DNA damage response when the cell goes into the next S phase (e.g. Pellman). Missegregation of a whole chromosome can induce a proteotoxic response in turn influencing cell cycle progression (e.g. Amon, Compton). Mitotic errors that cause cytokinesis failure can also result in p53 activation via the Hippo pathway (e.g. Pellman).</p><p>In addition, to all these pathways, if a cell simply spends too long in mitosis, this will influence the subsequent G1 (pioneering studies by Greenfield Sluder) and the authors suggest that this mechanism is at play here. But they do not directly show that cells arrest because of the time that they spend in mitosis and that this is by-passed when 53BP1 or USP28 is mutated. Note also that studies from both the Holland and Oegema labs conclude that arrest after centriole loss is not a result of prolonged mitosis. The authors should rewrite their manuscript to clarify the phenomenon they are studying and put it into proper context.</p><p>2) The nature of the stress signal detected is unclear. The authors suggest that 53BP1 may be acting as a mitotic timer based on immunofluorescence experiments in which they assay 53BP1 localization to kinetochores. This localization is not directly related to the attachment state of the kinetochores but what regulates the localization is not clear. The problem is that the experiments are based on release from a long block with RO-3306, which could perturb centromere behavior and kinetochore assembly, and the assay is based on a qualitative assessment of strong versus weak signals. Moreover, the choice of cell line for these experiments is not ideal; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, localization of 53BP1 is done in p53-deficient cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, one graph is done with wild type while the other is done with mutant. Note that there is no direct evidence to link 53BP1 de-localization from the kinetochore to p53 activation in the next G1 phase. To support their contention that 53BP1 acts as a timer the authors will need to assay its localization by time-lapse microscopy. Alternatively, the authors should tone down their conclusions and mention the caveats to these experiments.</p><p>3) p53 mRNA levels need to be measured to control for the steady state protein levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> to strengthen the conclusion that USP28 is directly regulating p53 ubiquitylation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;53BP1 and USP28 mediate p53 dependent cell cycle arrest in response to centrosome loss and prolonged mitosis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have now rewritten the manuscript to describe the events we are studying as centrosome loss- or prolonged mitosis-induced G1 arrest.</p><p>We have also included words in the Discussion about the relationship between centrosome loss, mitotic delay, and cell cycle arrest: âNote that while centrosome loss frequently lengthens the duration of mitotic progression, previous studies showed that G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss can occur without a significant mitotic delay [Labrus et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2015]. It is therefore possible that both centrosome loss and mitotic delay (induced by Eg5 inhibitor or MG132) cause a common underlying damage that activates the G1 arrest. The underlying damage is yet to be identified. Alternatively, two distinct errors may be generated by centrosome loss and prolonged mitosis, and the G1 arrest induced by both errors are mediated by 53BP1 and USP28.â</p><p><italic>2) The nature of the stress signal detected is unclear. The authors suggest that 53BP1 may be acting as a mitotic timer based on immunofluorescence experiments in which they assay 53BP1 localization to kinetochores. This localization is not directly related to the attachment state of the kinetochores but what regulates the localization is not clear. The problem is that the experiments are based on release from a long block with RO-3306, which could perturb centromere behavior and kinetochore assembly, and the assay is based on a qualitative assessment of strong versus weak signals. Moreover, the choice of cell line for these experiments is not ideal; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, localization of 53BP1 is done in p53-deficient cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, one graph is done with wild type while the other is done with mutant. Note that there is no direct evidence to link 53BP1 de-localization from the kinetochore to p53 activation in the next G1 phase. To support their contention that 53BP1 acts as a timer the authors will need to assay its localization by time-lapse microscopy. Alternatively, the authors should tone down their conclusions and mention the caveats to these experiments.</italic></p><p>We agree with reviewersâ concern about the lack of direct evidence in our conclusion that 53BP1 delocalization from kinetochores leads to p53 activation in G1. The statement of kinetochore 53BP1 as the âmitotic timerâ has been removed from the Abstract. We leave this intriguing observation for discussion.</p><p><italic>3) p53 mRNA levels need to be measured to control for the steady state protein levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> to strengthen the conclusion that USP28 is directly regulating p53 ubiquitylation.</italic></p><p>We have examined p53 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F (2E</xref> in the original submission) and 4E. We observe no increase in p53 mRNA levels during centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest (<italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup></italic> + 3MBPP1), despite a marked elevation in p53 protein levels. This indicates that the accumulation of p53 protein is not due to upregulation of p53 gene transcription. Also of note is the general increase (1.4 to 2.5 fold) in p53 mRNA levels in <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; USP28<sup>-/-</sup></italic>cells. This, however, does not culminate in an increase in p53 protein levels in the cells, suggesting that p53 protein levels are not tightly correlated with its gene transcription activity.</p><p>For experiment in 4E, we observe a modest increase (1.29 fold) in p53 mRNA levels in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>WT</sup> (100 ng/ml doxycycline induction). A similar increase (1.25 fold) in p53 mRNA levels is also seen in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>CI</sup>. Yet, p53 nuclear accumulation is only detected in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>WT</sup>. This indicates that the increase in p53 mRNA levels is not the reason for the nuclear p53 stabilization seen in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>WT</sup>. Taken together, our qRT-PCR data support the conclusion that USP28 deubiquitinates p53 for protein stabilization. The results have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (panel G) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (panel F).
