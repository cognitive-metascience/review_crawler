cell surface receptors, but it is unclear whether modulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters can modify biological outcomes. We have engineered IL-6 variants with different affinities to gp130 to investigate how cytokine receptor binding dwell-times influence functional selectivity. Engineered IL-6 variants showed a range of signaling amplitudes and induced biased signaling, with changes in receptor binding dwell-times affecting more profoundly STAT1 than STAT3 phosphorylation. We show that this differential signaling arises from defective translocation of ligand-gp130 complexes to the endosomal compartment and competitive STAT1/STAT3 binding to phospho-tyrosines in gp130, and results in unique patterns of STAT3 binding to chromatin. This leads to a graded gene expression response and differences in ex vivo differentiation of Th17, Th1 and Treg cells. These results provide a molecular understanding of signaling biased by cytokine receptors, and demonstrate that manipulation of signaling thresholds is a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokine signaling</kwd><kwd>cytokine engineering</kwd><kwd>bias signaling</kwd><kwd>endosomal traffic</kwd><kwd>functional pleiotropy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Fabregas</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Fyfe</surname><given-names>Paul K</given-names></name><name><surname>Moraga</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>454-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilmes</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id><italic>K22</italic>HL125593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kazemian</surname><given-names>Majid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 202323/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pohler</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Moraga</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 202323/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pohler</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Moraga</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Contrat de Plan Etat Région Hauts de France and Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>Suman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 944, P8/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piehler</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering cytokines to exhibit different receptor binding dwell times is a useful strategy to decouple their functional pleiotropy and reduce their toxicity in the clinic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokines modulate the immune response by activating a common JAK/STAT signaling pathway upon cell surface receptor dimerization/oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stroud and Wells, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wells et al., 1993</xref>). A conundrum in the field pertains to how biological specificity is achieved in the cytokine system by using such reduced number of signaling intermediaries, that is four JAKs and seven STATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindler et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, there are numerous examples in the literature where cytokines activating the same STATs in CD4 T cells, for example IL-6 and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grotzinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walter, 2004</xref>), produce opposite responses, that is pro-inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory responses respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunter and Jones, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, a number of studies in multiple cytokine systems have shown that cytokine signaling is not an ‘all or none’ phenomenon and can be modulated by alterations of cytokine-receptor binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in cytokine-receptor binding kinetics and strength were shown to play a crucial role in defining type I and type III interferons biological potencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendoza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pestka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piehler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramaniam et al., 1995</xref>). A mutation in erythropoietin (Epo) found in humans, which reduces its binding affinity for its receptor (EpoR), was shown to bias signaling output by EpoR and caused severe anemia in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Biased EpoR signaling was also achieved using surrogate Epo ligands that altered the receptor binding topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moraga et al., 2015b</xref>). Cross-reactive cytokine-receptor systems, where shared receptors engage multiple cytokines and elicit differential responses is another example where receptor binding properties influence signaling and activity, for example the IL-4/IL-13 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LaPorte et al., 2008</xref>), IL-2/IL-15 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ring et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rochman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waldmann, 2006</xref>) and the IL-6 family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Viruses often encode for cytokine-like proteins that bind cytokine receptors with altered binding properties, providing them with means to fine-tune the immune response to their own advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulanger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walter, 2004</xref>). All these examples strongly argue in favour of cytokine-receptor binding parameters contributing to regulate signaling, however a model providing molecular bases for signaling biased by cytokine receptor is missing.</p><p>Biased signaling is not a unique feature of the cytokine family. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which contain seven-transmembrane domains, are the classical system where biased signaling was first described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootten et al., 2018</xref>). In this system, different ligands binding a common receptor can trigger differential signaling programs by instructing specific allosteric changes in the transmembrane α-helices of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wootten et al., 2018</xref>). However, this mechanism is more difficult to imagine for cytokine receptors where the transmembrane (TM) region contributes less significantly to signaling. Cytokine receptor chimeras where their TM has been swapped by that of other receptors still trigger signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). How can cytokine receptors trigger biased signaling responses then? A common feature to all cytokine systems is that upon ligand stimulation cytokine-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular compartments, where they are often degraded, contributing to switching off the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claudinon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">German et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keeler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shah et al., 2006</xref>). However, a complex positive regulatory role of endocytosis in cytokine signaling has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cendrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fallon and Lauffenburger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marchetti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sarkar et al., 2002</xref>). Several studies recently suggested a novel role for the endosomal compartment in stabilizing cytokine receptor dimers by enhancing local receptor concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandhi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraga et al., 2015a</xref>), thus contributing to signaling fitness even at low complex stabilities. In agreement with this model, mutations on cytokine receptors that alter their intracellular traffic can result in activation of novel or deregulated signaling programs causing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, activated JAK/STAT proteins have been described in endosomes after interferon stimulation, suggesting that signaling continues upon receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payelle-Brogard and Pellegrini, 2010</xref>). How changes in cytokine-receptor complex half-life and endosomal trafficking fine-tunes cytokine signaling and biological responses requires further investigation.</p><p>Here, using model cell lines and primary human CD4 T cells, we systematically explored how modulation of cytokine-receptor complex stability impacts signaling identity and biological responses, using IL-6 as a model system. IL-6 is a highly pleiotropic cytokine, which critically contributes to mounting the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grotzinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunter and Jones, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naka et al., 2002</xref>). IL-6 stimulation drives differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louten et al., 2009</xref>), and inhibits the differentiation of Th1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diehl and Rincón, 2002</xref>) and T regulatory (reg) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korn et al., 2008</xref>). Deregulation of IL-6 levels and activities is often found in human diseases, making IL-6 a very attractive therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunter and Jones, 2015</xref>). IL-6 exerts its immuno-modulatory activities by engaging a hexameric complex comprised of two molecules of IL-6Rα, two molecules of gp130 and two molecules of IL-6, leading to the downstream activation of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Using the yeast-surface display engineering platform, we isolated a series of IL-6 variants binding gp130 with different affinities, ranging from wild-type binding affinity to more than 2000-fold enhanced binding. Quantitative signaling and imaging studies revealed that reduction in cytokine-receptor complex stability resulted in differential cytokine-receptor complex dynamics, which ultimately led to activation of biased signaling programs. Low affinity IL-6 variants failed to translocate to intracellular compartments and induce gp130 degradation, triggering STAT3 biased responses. Indeed, inhibition of gp130 intracellular translocation by chemical or genetic blockage of clathrin-mediated trafficking, reduced STAT1 activation levels, without affecting STAT3 activation. Through a series of molecular and cellular assays we demonstrated that STAT1 requires a higher number of phospho-Tyr available in gp130 to reach maximal activation, explaining its enhanced sensitivity to changes in cytokine-receptor dwell-times. The biased signaling programs engaged by the IL-6 variants did not have a linear effect on STAT3 transcriptional activities. Reduced STAT3 activation levels by the low affinity IL-6 variants resulted in graded STAT3 binding to chromatin and gene expression, with some genes exhibiting a high degree of sensitivity to STAT3 activation levels, and other genes being equally induced by all three IL-6 variants. Moreover, IL-6 immuno-modulatory activities exhibited different sensitivity thresholds to changes on STAT activation levels, with Th17 differentiation being induced by all three variants, and inhibition of Treg and Th1 differentiation only robustly promoted by the high affinity variant. Our results provide a molecular model using spatio-temporal dynamics of cytokine-receptor complexes and competitive binding of STATs proteins for phosphorylated tyrosine residues, to explain how cells integrate cytokine signaling signatures into specific biological responses through the establishment of different gene induction thresholds. At the more practical level, our results highlight that manipulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters via protein engineering is a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy, a major source of unwanted side effects and toxicity in cytokine-based therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering IL-6 variants with different binding affinities for gp130</title><p>IL-6 triggers signaling by assembling a hexameric complex probably in a three steps process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>): IL-6 first binds to the IL-6Rα receptor subunit with nanomolar affinity via its site-1 binding interface. In the second step, the IL-6/IL-6Rα complex recruits one molecule of gp130 via IL-6 site-2 binding interface to form a hetero-trimeric complex. Finally, two of these hetero-trimeric complexes dimerize via the IL-6 site-3 binding sites to form a signalling-active hexameric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, top panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, IL-6Rα further contributes to stabilize site-2 and site-3 interaction of IL-6 by directly interacting with gp130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In an inflammatory environment, IL-6Rα is shed from the plasma membrane via proteases of the ADAM family, and binds IL-6 with high affinity to form a soluble stable complex. This complex triggers potent signaling by recruiting two molecules of gp130 via site-2 and site-3 IL-6 binding interfaces therefore contributing to enhance the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). This inflammatory complex can be mimicked by a linker-connected single-chain variant of soluble IL-6Rα and IL-6, called hyper-IL-6 (HyIL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 1997</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of IL-6 variants binding gp130 with different affinities.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of IL-6 receptor assembly kinetics elicited by IL-6 wildtype (top panel), HyIL-6 (middle panel) and IL-6 mutants molecules (bottom panel).

To address this question, we have used yeast surface display to engineer a series of IL-6 variants binding gp130 with different affinities, therefore providing different degrees of IL-6Rα dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> bottom panel). As described above, IL-6 interacts with gp130 on two sites, named site-2, which uses helixes A and C on IL-6, and site-3 which uses part of the AB-loop and helix D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). We focused on the site-2 binding interface because this interface seems to be the main driver of gp130-IL6 interaction in the absence of IL-6Rα. Using the existing crystal structure of the IL-6 hexameric complex, we identified 14 amino acids on IL-6 forming the site-2 binding interface, which we randomized using a ‘NDT’ degenerate codon encoding amino acids: G,V,L,I,C,S,R,H,D,N,F,Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The resulting library contained more than 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> unique variants.</p><p>The library was selected for gp130 binders through five rounds of selection in which the gp130 concentration was gradually decreased from 1 μM to 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>). Nine clones were selected based on their on-yeast binding titrations and their sequences were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). From this initial library, IL-6 variants exhibiting a wide range of binding affinities for gp130 were isolated, ranging from wild type (wt) affinity (A1) to 200-fold better binding (F3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In order to isolate IL-6 variants binding with even higher affinity to gp130, we performed a second library, where we further engineered the F3 mutant, by carrying out a soft randomization of the amino acids forming the gp130 site-2 binding interface. After five additional rounds of selection we isolated three new variants (Mut1, Mut3 and Mut7) that bound gp130 with an apparent on-yeast binding K<sub>D</sub> of 2 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). To perform surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, we recombinantly expressed all these mutants and purified them to homogeneity. These studies confirm the same trend observed in the on-yeast binding titration experiments, with values ranging from 648 nM (A1) to 6.2 nM (C7) and 379 pM (Mut3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c-d</xref>). While we could not detect binding of gp130 to A1 and IL-6 wt in the on-yeast binding titration studies, we determined accurate K<sub>D</sub> binding constants in the SPR studies. It is important to emphasize that our engineered IL-6 variants still exhibit wt binding affinity for gp130 via their site-3 interfaces. Thus, although they bind gp130 in the absence of IL-6Rα, the overall half-life of the tetrameric surface complex formed by these variants is defined by their combined site-2/site-3 binding interaction. HyIL-6, via additional site-2/site-3 stabilization resulting from IL-6Rα/gp130 contacts, forms an even longer-lived complex than any of the engineered IL-6 variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IL-6 variants induce differential STAT3/STAT1 activation ratios</title><p>IL-6 binding to gp130 triggers the phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 effector proteins via JAK1, which largely determine cellular responses. We therefore studied the different STAT1 and STAT3 activation signatures elicited by the A1, C7 and Mut3 IL-6 variants. For that, we used HeLa cells, which express very low levels of IL-6Rα subunit and therefore allow us to study the contribution of gp130 binding to signaling output by the IL-6 variants. As control we used IL-6 wt, which requires IL-6Rα expression to activate signaling, and Hyper IL-6 (HyIL-6), which binds gp130 with high affinity and potently triggers signaling in cells lacking IL-6Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 1997</xref>). The three engineered variants exhibited different degrees of IL-6Rα dependency based on their gp130 binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a-b</xref>). As expected, while IL-6 wt stimulation led to a poor signaling response in HeLa cells, HyIL-6 stimulation produced a robust STAT1 and STAT3 activation in dose-response studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). Interestingly, different engineered IL-6 variants drove differential phosphorylation amplitudes in STAT1 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). These differences in signaling amplitudes could not be rescued by further increases in ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>), nor were the result of altered signaling kinetics induced by the IL-6 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that STAT1 phosphorylation was profoundly more affected than STAT3 by changes in gp130 binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>). While Mut3 activated STAT1 and STAT3 to the same extent than HyIL-6, the C7 variant induced 70% of the STAT3 phosphorylation levels but only 25% of the STAT1 phosphorylation levels induced by HyIL-6. Similarly, the A1 variant induced 50% of the STAT3 phosphorylation levels as compared to HyIL-6, but failed to induce STAT1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>). This biased STAT3 activation by the IL-6 variants resulted in altered STAT3/STAT1 activation ratios, with IL-6 variants binding with lower affinity to gp130 exhibiting a disproportionally high activation of STAT3 versus STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Determination of signaling signatures activated by IL-6 variants.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) HeLa cells were stimulated with the indicated doses of IL-6 ligands for 15 min and levels of STAT1 (<bold>a</bold>) and STAT3 (<bold>b</bold>) were analyzed by phospho-flow cytometry.

However, the molecular basis that allow fine-tuning of gp130 signaling outputs in response to changes in ligand-receptor complex half-life remains unclear. To gain molecular insight into this question, we probed the assembly of gp130 dimers at the single molecule level using dual-colour total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In these experiments, we transfected genome-engineered RPE1 cells lacking endogenous gp130 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>) with gp130 N-terminally tagged with a meGFP, which was rendered non-fluorescent by the Y67F mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This tag (mXFP) is recognized by dye-conjugated anti-GFP nanobodies (NB), allowing quantitative fluorescence labeling of gp130 at the cell surface of live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Well-balanced dual-colour labeling was achieved using equal concentrations of nanobodies either conjugated to RHO11 or DY647, allowing us to probe diffusion and interaction of individual receptor molecules in the plasma membrane of live cells as recently shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al.

In absence of ligand stimulation, no significant gp130 dimer levels were observed. After cytokine stimulation, strong gp130 dimerization was found for HyIL-6 and Mut3, in agreement with the model of ligand-induced cytokine receptor assembly.

Based on this, we speculated that complexes formed by these variants were too short-lived and escaped detection by single molecule tracking. It is accepted that cytokine-receptor complex rapidly traffic to intracellular compartments, where they can be degraded or recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonnord et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, it has been proposed that endosomes could act as signaling hubs, helping to sustain low-affinity cytokine-receptor dimers by enhancing the local receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandhi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the biased signaling program engaged by the three IL-6 variants resulted from differential receptor trafficking. To test this hypothesis, we fluorescently labeled HyIL-6 and the three IL-6 mutants and followed their receptor-mediated internalization by confocal imaging. Importantly, the dye-conjugated IL-6 variants induced dimerization of endogenous gp130 in HeLa cells, confirming their functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2e</xref>). HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min with the labeled cytokines and their internalization monitored by confocal microscopy. Anti-EEA1 antibodies were used to label early endosomes.

In short, HeLa cells were incubated with the indicated doses of ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) or times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) and internalization of the labeled ligands was monitored by flow cytometry.

We thus postulated that competitive binding of STAT1 and STAT3 for phospho-Tyr on gp130 would result in differential levels of activation of these two transcription factors in the context of short-lived IL-6/gp130 complexes. To test this model, we generated a chimera receptor system, based on the IL-27 receptor complex, to study the influence of the number of phospho-Tyr available in gp130 on ligand-induced STAT1 and STAT3 activation.</p><p>IL-27 triggers signaling by dimerizing IL-27Rα and gp130 receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref>). We took advantage of the shared use of gp130 by the two systems and swapped the intracellular domain of IL-27Rα with that of gp130. Additionally, we generated a second receptor chimera (gp130 ΔY), where the intracellular domain of IL-27Rα was swapped with the gp130 intracellular domain containing a deletion after JAK1 binding site, that is the box1-2 region. As a result of this, while the first chimera receptor can trigger the potential phosphorylation of eight Tyr, the second chimera can only induce the phosphorylation of four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We then stably transfected all the constructs in RPE1 cells, which do not express IL-27Rα endogenously, but express endogenous levels of gp130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To ensure that all the RPE1 clones were homogenous and the effects that we see are specific, we compared the responsiveness of the three clones to HyIL-6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>, HyIL-6 induced comparable levels of STAT1 and STAT3 activation in the three clones, strongly arguing that the endogenous gp130, JAK1, STAT1 and STAT3 levels in the three clones were identical. In response to IL-27, the three clones produced very similar STAT3 activation levels, suggesting that STAT3 activation is very efficient and only requires a minimal set of phospho-Tyr available to reach its activation peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). However, STAT1 activation levels dropped by more than fifty percent in the gp130 ΔY clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), demonstrating that STAT1 activation by gp130 requires a higher number of phospho-Tyr available.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Correlation between number of P-Tyr in gp130 ICD and STATs activation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the different chimera receptors designed for this study.

We focused on Tyr 767, 815, 905 and 915 because these Tyr have been reported to contribute the most to IL-6-induced signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerhartz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). We generated seven different gp130 mutants with different pools of Tyr available for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and transiently expressed them in gp130 KO HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We then quantified STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels induced by the indicated doses of HyIL-6 after 15 min stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, single Tyr mutations did not decrease the STAT1/STAT3 activation levels induced by HyIL-6. Mutation of Tyr 905/915 and 815/905/915 to Phe produced a 50% decrease on the STAT1 phosphorylation levels induced by HyIL-6 stimulation, but only marginally affected STAT3 phosphorylation. Mutation of the four Tyr (Tyr767/815/905/915) to Phe resulted in almost complete loss of both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by HyIL-6. Interestingly, HyIL-6 triggered a biased STAT3 response in the double and triple gp130 Tyr mutants background. This data suggest that in non-optimal activation conditions, such as limited phospho-Tyr availability or short ligand-receptor complex half-life, STAT3 activation is more robust than STAT1 activation.</p><p>To further support the STAT1/3 competition model, we next evaluated whether modulation of the STAT3/STAT1 ratio would influence STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels triggered by the different IL-6 ligands. To this end, we first studied the effect of decreasing the STAT3 levels on STAT1 activation. For that, HeLa cells were transfected with either scrambled siRNA or siRNA specific for STAT3 and then stimulated with the different IL-6 variants. STAT3 levels were decreased by more than 80% in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). As expected, cell lacking STAT3 expression fail to induce STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). While STAT3 silencing did not change the STAT1 activation levels induced by HyIL-6 and Mut3, STAT1 activation was significantly increased upon C7 stimulation, suggesting a competition between STAT1 and STAT3 for Tyr in gp130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). We then investigated whether increasing the levels of STAT1 protein would negatively affect STAT3 activation induced by IL-6. For this purpose, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with STAT1-GFP and the levels of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation were assayed after 15 min of stimulation with 100 nM of the different IL-6 ligands by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). We took advantage of flow cytometry and the GFP-tag on STAT1 to gate HeLa cells expressing different amounts of STAT1 and studied STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in each gated population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, as the levels of STAT1 increased, so did the levels of phospho-STAT1 induced by HyIL-6 stimulation. This effect was not evident for the lower affinity ligands Mut-3, C7 and A1. The opposite results were observed when we analysed STAT3 activation levels. As the levels of STAT1 protein increased, the amount of phospho-STAT3 activated by the different IL-6 ligands decreased, confirming a competition between these two STAT molecules for phospho-Tyr on gp130. Overall, our data strongly support a model where ligand-receptor complex half-life and STATs competition for phospho-Tyr on cytokine receptor intracellular domains maintain a tight equilibrium that allow cells to fine tune their signaling output upon cytokine stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>IL-6 variants induce graded STAT3 transcriptional responses</title><p>Our data clearly indicate that cytokine-receptor complex half-life instructs biased signaling output by cytokine receptors. However, whether the observed changes in signaling ultimately translate into proportional gene expression changes and bioactivities is not clear. To investigate the immediate effects of ‘biased’ IL-6 signaling input on transcriptome of immune cells, we have generated global transcriptional profiles elicited by the three IL-6 variants in human Th1 cells. First, we performed signaling experiments in human Th1 T cells, to confirm signaling biased by the IL-6 variants in cells expressing gp130 and IL-6Rα receptor subunits simultaneously. Purified human CD4 T cells were activated through its T cell receptor (TCR) in vitro and expanded in Th1 polarizing conditions for five days before they were stimulated with saturating doses of HyIL-6 or the three IL-6 variants. As in HeLa cells, Mut3 activated STAT1 and STAT3 to the same extent as HyIL-6 in Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a-b</xref>). C7 and A1 activated STAT1 and STAT3 to different extents with C7 activating 60% STAT1 and 85% STAT3 when compared to HyIL-6, and A1 activating 50% STAT1 and 70% STAT3 when compared to HyIL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a-b</xref>). These resulted in an increased STAT3/STAT1 activation ratio by C7 and A1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, to quantify its effects on gene expression, Th1 cells were stimulated with saturated concentrations of the three IL-6 variants and HyIL-6 for six hours to ensure that the entire cell population respond uniformly to the respective cytokine stimulation and their gene expression program analyzed by RNA-seq studies. We detected the upregulation of 23 genes in response to all four IL-6 variants (Fold change &gt;1.5, FDR &lt; 0.05, RPKM &gt;4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>), which were all classical STAT3-induced genes, validating the RNA-seq study. Importantly, most target genes showed a graded increase in the rate of transcription as a function of increasing STAT3 activity as exhibited by the three IL-6 variants (pSTAT3 levels; hyIL-6 = Mut3&gt;C7&gt;A1). However, the magnitude of transcriptional outputs differs widely from gene to gene, with some genes achieving maximal transcript levels even at low STAT3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). For instance, while Mut3 gene signature resembles that of HyIL-6, C7 and A1 variants gene signatures exhibited a graded response, with some gene induction decreased by 50% (e.g. <italic>SOCS3</italic> and <italic>BCL3</italic>) and other genes expression barely affected when compared to HyIL-6 (e.g. <italic>JAK3</italic>, <italic>ANK3</italic>, <italic>PIM2</italic>). We further confirmed these observations by qPCR studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d-g</xref>). Overall these results suggest that IL-6-induced genes are differently sensitive to corresponding changes in nuclear STAT3 levels, which could provide the cell with the necessary flexibility to fine-tune its responses to wide-range of cytokines levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional program elicited by the different IL-6 variants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) volcano plot showing significant genes differently expressed in Th1 cells after 6 hr stimulation with HyIL6.

Specifically, given that IL-6 variants induced different levels of STAT3 phosphorylation, we quantified genome-wide STAT3 binding sites in Th1 cells as a function of gradient STAT3 activation by the IL-6 variants. As expected, IL-6 stimulation led to STAT3 binding to 3480 genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), which were localized near classical STAT-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). We could detect significant changes in STAT3 binding intensity in response to the different IL-6 variants, which correlated with their STAT3 activation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Of note, although ChIP-seq data identified many genome-wide IL-6-induced STAT3 binding sites, only a handful of those STAT3-target genes (23 transcripts) were upregulated in Th1 cells, suggesting additional mechanisms by which IL-6-induced STAT3 influences gene expression programs. Moreover, when we examined STAT3 bound regions near genes upregulated by IL-6 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), we observed a similar trend to that observed in the RNA-seq studies, that is STAT3 binding intensities were more different in those genes differentially regulated by the IL-6 variants (eg. <italic>BCL3</italic> and <italic>SOCS3</italic>), and more similar in genes equally regulated by all four ligands (e.g. <italic>JAK3</italic> and <italic>PIM2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1h-i</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SOCS3</italic> and <italic>BCL3</italic> that were among the most differentially expressed IL-6-induced genes, contain multiple STAT3 binding sites (Supplemental Table 1), which may enable IL-6 to produce graded transcriptional outputs among its target genes. By contrast, STAT3 target genes with 1 or two binding sites at the gene promoter become saturated at relatively low levels of STAT3 transcriptional activation. This suggests that genes with multiple STAT3 binding sites would be more sensitive to changes in STAT3 signaling levels compared to gene with a single STAT3 binding site. Collectively, our data indicates that IL-6 variants result in graded STAT3 binding and transcriptional responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>IL-6 variants induce immuno-modulatory activities with different efficiencies</title><p>IL-6 is a highly immuno-modulatory cytokine, contributing to the inflammatory response by inducing differentiation of Th17 cells and inhibition of Treg and Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louten et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>). We next asked whether these three activities would be uniformly affected by the biased signaling programs engaged by the three IL-6 variants. For that, we cultured resting human CD4 T cells in Th17, Th1 and Treg polarizing conditions in the presence/absence of the different IL-6 variants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the three variants induced responses that parallel their STAT activation potencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–f</xref>).

C7 and A1 on the other hand produced non-equilateral triangular shapes, exhibiting different induction efficiencies of the three bioactivities. Overall, these results show that not all cytokine bioactivities require the same signaling threshold, and that by modulating cytokine-receptor dwell times, we can decouple or at least bias cytokine-induced signaling programs to mediate specific cellular responses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Immuno-modulatory activities trigger by the different IL-6 variants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Human CD4 T cells were isolated from whole PBMCs and treated with Treg polarizing conditions in the presence of saturating concentrations of the different IL-6 variants for five days.

Two main findings arise from our study: (1) Intracellular traffic dynamics of cytokine-receptor complexes and STATs binding affinities for phospho-Tyr on cytokine receptor ICD act synergistically to define signaling potency and identity, and (2) cells exhibit different gene induction thresholds in response to cytokine partial agonism, which allow them to modulate their responses. The current work, together with previous studies describing signaling tuning in other cytokines systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moraga et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>), outline a general strategy to design cytokine partial agonists and decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy by modulating cytokine-receptor binding kinetics.</p><p>All our IL-6 variants must dimerize gp130 to some extent, since they all trigger signaling. However, our single molecule TIRF data show that low affinity variants struggle to promote detectable gp130 dimerization. These data suggest that non-detectable short-lived IL-6/gp130 complexes can partially engage signaling, but fail to trigger a full response, evoking a kinetic proof reading model. A kinetic proof reading model has been previously proposed for other ligand-receptor systems, including the T cell receptor system (TCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKeithan, 1995</xref>) and more recently Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zinkle and Mohammadi, 2018</xref>). In these two systems, changes on ligand-receptor complex dwell-times induce phosphorylation of different Tyr pools in the receptors ICDs, ultimately recruiting and activating different signaling effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). More recently, this model was used to explain biased signaling triggered by an EPO mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). However, cytokine receptors differ significantly from RTKs and the TCR. While in these latter receptor systems, activation of different signaling effectors is clearly assigned to phosphorylation of specific Tyr in their ICDs, this is not generally true for cytokine receptors. Often only one or two Tyr in the cytokine receptor ICDs are required for signal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>How can short-lived cytokine-receptor complexes engage different signaling effectors that compete for a single phospho-Tyr? Our study provides new molecular evidences suggesting that STAT activation by cytokine-receptor complexes is governed by a kinetic discrimination mechanism. STATs compete for Tyr in receptors ICDs, thus making them sensitive to changes in cytokine-receptor complex dwell-times. STATs binding with low affinity to phospho-Tyr require longer-lived cytokine-receptor complexes and higher ligand doses to reach maximal activation. In agreement with this model, a previous study reported STAT1 and STAT3 binding with different affinities to phospho-Tyr in gp130 ICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wiederkehr-Adam et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, using chimeric receptors and siRNA and overexpression approaches, we show that binding affinity of STAT proteins for phospho-Tyr in receptors ICDs defines signaling amplitude and identity by IL-6. Importantly, this is not the first evidence of STATs competing for phospho-Tyr. IFNα2 activates all STATs molecules, which can be abrogated by a single Tyr mutation in the IFNAR2 ICD, suggesting STAT competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, modulation of STAT protein levels has been described to change signaling specificity by cytokines. IFNγ priming, which result in enhanced STAT1 protein levels, shift the IL-10 response from STAT3 activation to STAT1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrero et al., 2003</xref>). In cells lacking STAT3, IL-6 switches to STAT1 activation, producing IFNγ-like responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa-Pereira et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>An alternative model that could explain our observations is that our IL-6 variants exhibit altered gp130 binding topology. Previous studies have shown that changes on cytokine-receptor binding topology, achieved using cytokine surrogate ligands, resulted in biased signaling programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Livnah et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moraga et al., 2015b</xref>). We cannot formally exclude this possibility for our engineered IL-6 variants. The mutations introduced on the IL-6 variants to enhance their affinity for gp130 could have impacted their receptor binding topologies and therefore their signaling properties. However, we believe this possibility is unlikely. First, the mutations engineered in our variants are located exclusively on the IL-6-gp130 site-2 binding interface, leaving the cytokine backbone untouched and therefore greatly reducing the possibility of alterations on ligand-receptor binding topology. Second, there is a large body of literature showing that mutations in cytokine-receptor binding interfaces do not alter receptor binding topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendoza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraga et al., 2015a</xref>). Indeed, to our knowledge, there is not a single example in the literature of a cytokine mutant binding with alternative topology to its receptor. Third, our TIRF microscopy experiments confirm a canonical stoichiometry of the complex formed by the different IL-6 variants, excluding the formation of higher order oligomers that could result from alternative binding topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Overall, our data support a kinetic proof reading model for cytokine signaling, where cytokine-receptor dwell times determine signaling output by kinetically discriminating activation of STAT molecules based on their binding affinity for phospho-Tyr on cytokine receptors ICDs. One key requirement for kinetic proof reading is the existence of an out-of-equilibrium process and rate-limiting kinetic intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, the IL-6 system also follows this general principle. Internalization of the IL-6-gp130 signaling complex acts as a critical event that breaks the equilibrium by irreversibly capturing intact signaling complexes into endosomes. We have recently quantitatively described this effect in a systematic study with engineered IL-13 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraga et al., 2015a</xref>), showing the critical role of interaction rate constants in such a non-equilibrium process. For the engineered gp130 agonists, we clearly observed that endocytosis is altered, which was presumably caused by differential stability of ligand-receptor interaction (i.e. the off-rate), further supporting kinetic proof reading as the main mechanism for cytokine signaling diversification.</p><p>Initially thought to contribute to cytokine signaling shutdown, the endosomal compartment has emerged in recent years as a signaling hub, not only in cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claudinon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">German et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keeler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shah et al., 2006</xref>) but also in other ligand-receptor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Villaseñor et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies showed that activated JAK and STATs molecules are found in endosomes upon cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payelle-Brogard and Pellegrini, 2010</xref>), suggesting that cytokine-receptor complexes exhibit a signaling continuum from the cell surface to intracellular compartments. In agreement with this model, recent studies showed that cytokine-receptor complexes traffic to the endosomal compartment, where they are stabilized, contributing to signaling fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandhi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraga et al., 2015a</xref>). Only short-lived complexes that fail to traffic to intracellular compartments trigger diminished signaling output. Our data fully support this model and expand it by showing that short-lived complexes that fail to traffic to the endosomal compartment engage a biased signaling program. Low affinity IL-6 variants, which did not induce internalization of gp130, activated more efficiently STAT3 than STAT1. It is possible that the stabilization of short-lived IL-6-gp130 complexes in endosomes provides them with the necessary extra time to activate secondary pathways that engage the receptor with low affinity. An alternative possibility would be that the high density of cytokine receptor phospho-Tyr motifs found in endosomes, as a consequence of the accumulation of cytokine-receptor complexes in the confined endosomal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraga et al., 2015a</xref>), could diminish the advantage exhibited by signaling intermediates binding with high affinity cytokine receptors, therefore favouring the activation of secondary low affinity signaling molecules. Further studies will be required to understand kinetics of signal activation by cytokines in intracellular compartments. An open question pertains to whether the intracellular localization of STATs influence signaling by long- or short-lived cytokine receptor complexes. Early studies described the localization of STAT3 in intracellular membranes, while other STATs association with intracellular membranes is not so well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shah et al., 2006</xref>). Whether signaling by cytokines can be further engineered by modulation of the intracellular localization of STATs requires further investigation.</p><p>In the current study, we show that different genes downstream of IL-6 signaling exhibit different thresholds of activation that can be exploited by IL-6 partial agonists to decouple IL-6 immuno-modulatory activities. How these activation thresholds are established is not clear. STAT proteins face two points where the law of mass action influences their responses the most. The first one pertains to the binding of STATs to phospho-Tyr in the receptors ICDs, and as discussed above, contributes to define signaling potency and identity by cytokine-receptor complexes. The second point is found when activated STATs bind specific Gamma interferon Activated Sequences (GAS) motifs in the promoters of responsive genes. GAS sequences, although conserved, exhibit degrees of degeneracy that allow them to bind STATs molecules with different affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehret et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horvath et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, different number of GAS sequences are found in different responsive promoters. In principle, the combination of STAT binding affinities for GAS sequences and the number of GAS sequence present in the promoters could generate different gene induction thresholds. In agreement with this model, we identified chromatin regions through our STAT3 Chip-Seq studies, that bound STAT3 with different efficiencies, with regions where STAT3 binding was diminished by changes in STAT3 activation levels, and regions where efficient STAT3 binding was detected in all conditions tested. When we analysed the number of GAS sequences and their motifs under those regions, we could detect that genes that were more sensitive to changes in STAT3 phosphorylation presented higher number of GAS motifs than those more resistant. Overall our data support a kinetic-proof reading model for cytokine signaling, whereby cytokine-receptor dwell time and STAT binding affinities for phospho-Tyr on receptors ICDs define potency and identity of cytokine signaling signatures. As the number of STAT molecules activated by partial agonists increases, additional GAS binding motifs are engaged in promoters with multiple GAS binding sites, triggering the induction of graded gene expression responses. In principle, engineering of cytokine-receptor binding kinetics could rescue cytokine-based therapies, by decreasing cytokine functional pleiotropy and toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Human IL-6 wild type and IL-6 variants were cloned into the pAcGP67-A vector (BD Biosciences) in frame with an N-terminal gp67 signal sequence and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, and produced using the baculovirus expression system, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LaPorte et al.

For each STAT3 ChIP-seq library sample, approximately 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were used and the fixed cell palettes were kept at −80°C prior to further processing. The ChIPseq experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liao et al., 2008</xref>) with some modification as described below. In brief, the frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and washed once with 1 mL cold PBS by centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 5 min, the resulting cell pellets were re-suspended in 500 uL of lysis buffer (1X PBS, 0,5% Triton X-100, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by a 5 min centrifugation at 5000 RPM. Then the pellets were washed once with 1 mL of sonication buffer (1X TE, 1: 100 protease inhibitor cocktail), re-suspended in 750 uL of sonication buffer (1X TE, 1: 100 protease inhibitor cocktail and 0,5 mM PMSF) and sonicated for 20 cycles (on-20sec and off-45sec) on ice using VCX-750 Vibra Cell Ultra Sonic Processor (Sonics, USA). The sonicated lysates were centrifuged 20 min at 14000 RPM and the clear lysate supernatants were collected and incubated with 30 uL of Protein-A Dynabeads (ThermoFisher, USA) that were pre-incubated with incubated with 10 ug of anti-STAT3 antibody (anti-Stat3, 12640S, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4°C overnight with gentle rotation. Next day, the beads were washed 2 times with RIPA-140 buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% NaDOC), 2 times with RIPA-300 buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% NaDOC), 2 times with LiCl buffer (0.25 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% NaDOC), once with TE-0,2% Triton X-100 and once with TE buffer. Crosslinks were reversed by incubating the bound complexes in 60 uL TE containing 4.5 uL of 10% SDS and 7.5 uL of 20 mg/mL of proteinase K (Thermofisher, USA) at 65°C overnight for input samples, we used 6 uL of 10% SDS and 10 µL of 20 mg/mL of proteinase K. Then, the supernatants were collected using a magnet and beads were further washed one in TE 0.5M NaCl buffer. Both supernatants were combined, and DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, followed by precipitation with ethanol and re-suspended in TE buffer. The library was constructed following the manufacturer protocol of the KAPA LTP Library Preparation Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Roche, Switzerland). ChIP DNA libraries were ligated with the Bioo scientific barcoded adaptors (BIOO Scientific, Perkin Elmer, USA) with T4 DNA ligase according to KAPA LTP library preparation protocol and the ligated ChIP DNA libraries were purified with 1.8x vol. Agencourt AMPure XP beads and PCR amplified using KAPA hot start High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix and NextFlex index primers (Bioo Scientific, PerkinElmer) for 12 cycle by following thermocycler cycles: 30 s hot start at at 98°C, followed by 12 cycle amplification [98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s] and final extension at 72°C for 1 min. The amplification and quality of the ChIPseq libraries were checked by running 10% of the samples in E-Gel Agarose Gels with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), and if necessary, samples were reamplified additional four cycles using the same thermocycler protocol described above. Then, the libraries were purified and size-selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (1.25x vol. to remove short fragments. The concentration of ChIP-DNA libraries was measured by Qubit-4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher, USA) and equal amounts of each sample were pooled and 50 bp paired-end reads were sequenced on an Illumina 4000 platform by GENEWIZ technology (GENEWIZ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>For RNA-seq library preparation, in vitro polarized human Th1 cells either not stimulated or stimulated with the different IL-6 variants at 37°C for 6 hr, total RNA was extracted and RNAseq libraries were prepared by Edinburg Sequencing Core facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title><p>The quality of generated libraries was inspected using FastQC v0.11.8.

A 150 x magnification objective with a numerical aperture of 1.45 (UAPO 150 3/1.45 TIRFM, Olympus) was used for TIR illumination. All experiments were carried out at room temperature in medium without phenol red supplemented with an oxygen scavenger and a redox-active photoprotectant to minimize photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vogelsang et al., 2008</xref>). For cell surface labeling of mXFP-gp130, antiGFP-NB<sup>DY647</sup> and antiGFP-NB<sup>RHO11</sup> were added to the medium at equal concentrations (2 nM) and incubated for at least 5 min by that ensuring &gt;90% binding given the 0.45 nM binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>). The nanobodies were kept in the bulk solution during the whole experiment in order to ensure high equilibrium binding to mXFP-gp130. Dimerization of mXFP-gp130 was probed before and after incubation with either 20 nM HyIL-6 or 1 µM of the IL-6 mutants (Mut3, C7, A1, IL-6 wt). Image stacks of 150 frames were recorded at 32 ms/frame. For simultaneous dual color acquisition, antiGFP-NB<sup>RHO11</sup> was excited by a 561 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser at 0.95 mW (~32 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) and antiGFP-NB<sup>DY647</sup> by a 642 nm laser diode at 0.65 mW (~22 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). Fluorescence was detected using a spectral image splitter (DualView, Optical Insight) with a 640 DCXR dichroic beam splitter (Chroma) in combination with the bandpass filter 585/40 (Semrock) for detection of RHO11 and 690/70 (Chroma) for detection of DY647 dividing each emission channel into 512 × 256 pixel. In order to probe the dimerization/ligand binding of/to endogenous gp130 presented on HeLa cells, each ligand was (HyIL-6, Mut3, A1 and C7) conjugated to DY547 and DY647, respectively. Prior the experiment HeLa cells were incubated with 10 nM of both dye-conjugated ligands (DY547 and DY647) for 10 min at room temperature and dual colour experiments have been performed like described above.</p><p>Single molecule localization and single molecule tracking were carried out using the multiple-target tracing (MTT) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">You et al., 2016</xref>). Step-length histograms were obtained from single molecule trajectories and fitted by two fraction mixture model of Brownian diffusion. Average diffusion constants were determined from the slope (2–10 steps) of the mean square displacement versus time lapse diagrams. Immobile molecules were identified by the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm as described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Röder et al., 2014</xref>). For comparing diffusion properties and for co-tracking analysis, immobile particles were excluded from the data set.</p><p>Prior to co-localization analysis, imaging channels were aligned with sub-pixel precision by using a spatial transformation. To this end, a transformation matrix was calculated based on a calibration measurement with multicolor fluorescent beads (TetraSpeck microspheres 0.1 mm, Invitrogen) visible in both spectral channels (cp2tform of type ‘affine’, The MathWorks MATLAB 2009a).</p><p>Individual molecules detected in the both spectral channels were regarded as co-localized, if a particle was detected in both channels of a single frame within a distance threshold of 100 nm radius. For single molecule co-tracking analysis, the MTT algorithm was applied to this dataset of co-localized molecules to reconstruct co-locomotion trajectories (co-trajectories) from the identified population of co-localizations. For the co-tracking analysis, only trajectories with a minimum of 10 steps (~320 ms) were considered. The relative fraction of co-tracked molecules was determined with respect to the absolute number of trajectories and corrected for gp130 stochastically double-labeled with the same fluorophore species as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>*</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>*</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where A, B, AB and AB* are the numbers of trajectories observed for Rho11, DY647, co-trajectories and corrected co-trajectories, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Imaging of receptors in endosomes</title><p>For tracing IL-6 uptake into early endosomes, HeLa cells were transiently transfected (PEI) with XFP-gp130 and seeded on 12 mm cover slides placed in a 24-well plate.

receptor trafficking leading to modification of intracellular signalling engagements and outcomes, using the IL6-IL6R system. It addresses a biologically important and technically interesting question of how binding affinity between cytokine ligands and receptors can differentially modulate signalling output. The case with cytokine receptors is contrasted with the biased signalling known in GPCRs, where different ligands produce different responses from the same receptor via allosteric modulations. To study this system, the authors generated a panel of IL-6 variants with differing binding affinities for gp130. They find that these ligands trigger biased signalling based on their affinities and use this system to extract mechanistic insights. More broadly, the authors suggest these results highlight that manipulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters could be a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy, which is a source of toxicity in cytokine-based therapies. This is a very impressive piece of work and an important contribution to the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Kinetics of cytokine receptor trafficking determine signaling and functional selectivity&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Both reviewers have evaluated your manuscript and find that your work addresses a biologically important and technically interesting question of how binding affinity between cytokine ligands and receptors can differentially modulate signaling output. However, both feel that the mechanism that you propose is not clearly described and alternative possibilities are not convincingly excluded. The important points to address are: 1) the data suggests a kinetic effect rather than an affinity effect, whereas an affinity effect is proposed, and 2) the alternative explanation that the different affinity ligands bind in different configurations, leading to differential receptor clustering and thereby different signalling output should be disproven. Some of the imaging data or experiments that affect trafficking are not clear. The labelled ligand experiments with confocal microscopy should be performed as time lapse as function of different ligand concentrations to convincingly demonstrate the differential trafficking of the high/low affinity ligands. In the PITSTOP experiment no statistical significance is given and only again the high affinity HylL6 is showing a clear effect. Are there alternative ways (genetic?) to affect the trafficking that yield more convincing results. In addition, please address point-by-point the comments of the individual reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study claims that ligand-receptor lifetimes (investigated by generating iL6 mutants with different binding affinities) affect cytokine signalling trough differential trafficking of multimeric receptors comprising gp130. IL-6 stimulates signaling via a hexameric receptor comprised of two copies of IL-6, two gp130 and two IL-6Rα receptor subunits. The authors used yeast surface display to engineer a series of IL-6 variants binding gp130 with different affinities. Three variants with different apparent affinities for the receptor complex were investigated: A1 (648 nM) and the high affinity C7 (6.2 nM) and Mut3 (379 pM). My initial enthusiasm for this study was hampered by inconsistencies in some of the interpretation of the experiments. The major point that the authors make is that low affine binding of ligand to the receptor complex impedes receptor internalization leading to STAT3 biased responses at the plasma membrane whereas high affine binding to gp130 causes its internalization also enabling the activation of STAT1 on endosomes. The difference in the ratio of STAT1/STAT3 activity causes differential gene expression. The authors explain this difference in trafficking by the difference in the receptor-ligand lifetime (effectively the difference in koff). In the first result chapter a minor inconsistency confused me: at the end of the paragraph &quot;The binding affinities of three of those variants, belonging to the first and second libraries, were confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, with values ranging from 648 nM (A1) to 6.2 nM (C7) and 379 pM (Mut3) (Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). The table in Figure 1G confirms that both Mut3 and C7 are high affinity, low nM Kd ligands with a KD ratio of approximately 16 (6nM/0.376nM). However, in Figure 1E where gp130 binding is measured the affinities seem to differ by two orders of magnitude for C7 and Mut3, whereas A1 does not seem to bind at all (despite a having a similar affinity as IL-6). What is the binding affinity of HylL-6 for gp130? In general, several further inconsistencies weaken the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. For example, the high affinity C7 mutant ligand is two orders of magnitude less potent in activating STAT1/STAT3 as the high affinity ligand HyIL-6 (Figure 2A,B). Even for the sub-nano-molar Mut3 mutant (super)-high affinity binder, its potency is one order of magnitude less in activating STAT1/STAT3 as the high affinity ligand HyIL-6. Why is this so? Is the affinity of HylL-6 even an order of magnitude higher as that of Mut3? Is a possible explanation that the different ligands induce a different receptor complex configuration by changing the interactions between extracellular domains? Could the balance between IL-6Rα engagement versus gp130 engagement affect signaling outcome? This is indicated by the fact that IL-6 wild type (wt), requires IL-6Rα expression to activate signalling whereas the high affinity Hyper IL-6 (HyIL-6) only requires gp130 and potently triggers signaling in cells lacking IL-6Rα. This all points at a possible other mechanism, where the different mutant ligands generate different extracellular conformations of the gp130 that could engage in different heterotypic receptor clusters with different signalling capacities.</p><p>The imaging data that should support the hypothesis that the lifetime of the receptor-ligand complexes affects the trafficking are not clear. For example, the authors detected the high affinity Mut3 ligand in intracellular compartments that partially co-localized with EEA1 early endosome marker, whereas no fluorescence was detected for the high affinity C7 mutant ligand (factor 3 difference in off rate) (Figure 3D,E). Should this not give some internalisation for high affinity ligands? For any ligand at least binding at the plasma membrane should be visible for concentrations higher than the Kd of the ligand/receptor complex, which is not visible for C7 (40 nM ligand concentration versus 6 nM Kd; Figure 3D). The off-rates given in table one let us approximate the lifetime of the complexes which for the C7 and Mut3 is in the order of ~20 min and ~60 min, which is very long in comparison with the STAT signalling time-scale. The authors also state: &quot;We detected significant ligand induced gp130 co-locomotion for all IL-6 variants except for A1, with levels of co-locomotion paralleling gp130 binding affinities, i.e. HyIL-6&gt;Mut3&gt;C7&gt;A1. Should A1 not have similar to WT IL-6 some engagement of GP130? Is this also not dependent on the outside concentration of A1 (saturating concentrations)? In general, the co-locomotion of receptors for any of the mutant ligands is very sparse (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). What is the reason for this if the functional receptor is a hexameric complex? When the authors compare gp130 degradation, only the high affinity ligand HyIL-6 causes significant degradation. Is it not so that if Mut3 is the high affinity ligand that was actually found on endosomes (Figure 3D) that it should also end up in lysosomes by the usual Rab5/Rab7 switch for early to late endosomes? In the PITSTOP experiment no statistical significance is given and only again the high affinity HylL6 is showing a clear effect. However, this effect on receptor degradation is similar to the non-stimulated case, making the whole link to ligand-receptor lifetime regulating trafficking weaker. The idea of competitive binding for the STATs to gp130 should also be true for gp130 on intracellular compartments? This idea could also be further tested by enhancing the relative expression of STAT1 (instead of knock down of STAT3) versus STAT3 in cells. Is this effect not due to a differential regulation of STAT-binding phosphorylation sites on gp130 by intra-cellular protein tyrosine phosphatases such as PTPN1/2? The factor signalling time is also not taken into consideration in the down-stream differential gene expression effect. Despite the interesting results that are presented, I feel that at this stage the authors have to do substantial additional work to prove that ligand-receptor lifetimes affect receptor trafficking and thereby multimeric receptor signalling via STAT1/STAT3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Martinez-Fabregas et al. addresses a biologically important and technically interesting question of how binding affinity between cytokine ligands and receptors can differentially modulate signaling output. The authors nicely frame the biological background of this problem in the Introduction. The case with cytokine receptors is contrasted with the biased signaling known in GPCRs, where different ligands produce different responses from the same receptor via allosteric modulations. The author's point out that this cannot be applied to cytokine receptors with a single membrane-spanning domain (although I question their certainty on this, see minor points).</p><p>To study this system, the authors generated a panel of IL-6 variants with differing binding affinities for gp130. They find that these ligands trigger biased signaling based on their affinities and use this system to extract mechanistic insights. More broadly, the authors suggest these results highlight that manipulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters could be a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy, which is a source of toxicity in cytokine-based therapies. Overall I think it's a very impressive piece of work and an important contribution to the field. I list a couple of more detailed points and questions below:</p><p>• In their study of differential STAT3/STAT1 activation the authors note that the different ligands drove differential phosphorylation amplitudes, which could not be rescued by increases in ligand concentration. This observation suggests that it is not affinity to which the receptors respond, but rather must be kinetic off-rate. If increasing ligand concentration cannot rescue the signaling differences, then receptor occupancy is not what the cell is measuring. The only other parameter is binding dwell time-very much the way T cell receptor distinguishes peptide MHC ligands. I suggest that the author's data does not support binding affinity as the differentiator, but rather binding dwell time. In the language they use in the text, this distinction is important and it would be useful if the authors elaborated on it more explicitly.</p><p>• The next section, &quot;short lived IL-6-gp130 complexes fail to traffic to intracellular compartments&quot;, does essentially claim a kinetic discrimination mechanism-although the authors don't directly say this. The language still uses terms like &quot;binding energy&quot;. I think the authors should take a more clear stand on kinetic discrimination vs. binding strength. Statements such as &quot;one of the first steps affected by changes in gp130 binding affinity would be the assembly kinetics&quot; are rather unclear. Why would binding affinity affect this? Binding affinity only affects receptor occupancy, and should always be compensated by changing ligand concentration. If the data indicate ligand concentration cannot compensate, then a kinetic proof reading mechanism in which short dwelling events fail to activate-no matter how many there are-seems likely, if not necessary. The nuance here is that kinetic proof reading requires an out-of-equilibrium process and rate-limiting kinetic intermediates (see, for example, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2016, 113, 29: 8218 and Science 2019, 363: 1098). Is the gp130 system capable of kinetic proof reading based on what is known? Perhaps internalization breaks equilibrium and provides the rate-limiting step? It’s not obvious to me that it is, but being able to say anything about this based on their data would be extremely interesting.</p><p>• In the Discussion, the author's seem to dismiss kinetic proof reading as unlikely or difficult to reconcile. However, isn't the STAT competition model the authors articulate providing a form of kinetic proof reading? To some degree this is only a matter of semantics in the definition of the term, kinetic proof reading. But I suggest the fact that the mechanism the authors have identified achieves a form of kinetic discrimination is an important realization, and probably should be identified as a form of kinetic proof reading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49314.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both reviewers have evaluated your manuscript and find that your work addresses a biologically important and technically interesting question of how binding affinity between cytokine ligands and receptors can differentially modulate signaling output.

However, we see now that message did not come across in the manuscript clearly enough and we apologize for any confusion resulting from our language. We have amended the manuscript to clearly state this fact in the revised version. We provide some further points regarding this in the point-by-point answers to the reviewers (below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) the alternative explanation that the different affinity ligands bind in different configurations, leading to differential receptor clustering and thereby different signalling output should be disproven.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite our best efforts we have not been able to obtain protein crystals of our mutants in complex with gp130 and we can, therefore, not unequivocally exclude changes in binding topology. However, while it is possible that the new IL-6 variants bind gp130 in alternative conformations, we believe this to be highly improbable for the following reasons:</p><p>a) When generating the new IL-6 variants we kept the backbone of the cytokine intact and introduced mutations only in the cytokine-receptor binding interface. There is a large body of work done by the Garcia lab and others showing that introducing mutations in cytokine-receptor binding interfaces is a valid strategy to fine-tune binding affinities without changing topology (Levin AM, Nature, 2012; Juntilla IS, Nat.Chem.Biol., 2012; Moraga et al., 2015; Mendoza et al., 2017). In fact, to our knowledge there is not a single example in the literature of a mutation in a cytokine binding interface that alters the overall binding architecture of the ligand-receptor complex, strongly suggesting that the evolutionary pressure that maintains the canonical architecture of the cytokine-receptor complex is too high to be overcome by introducing few mutations in the binding interface. Indeed, the only ligands reported to alter canonical binding architectures are surrogate ligands such as diabodies and peptides (Livnah et al., 1998; Moraga et al., 2015; Mohan K, Science, 2019).</p><p>b) We have additional data, which we can include upon request, showing that IL-6 variants still rely on a classical site-2/site-3 interaction to recruit gp130 and signal, strongly supporting the hypothesis that our mutants recruit gp130 in a similar manner to wild type IL-6. We have generated a dominant-negative version of Mut3, by introducing mutations that disrupt its binding to gp130 via site-3. As a consequence, this new Mut3 variant behaves as an antagonist, able to bind gp130 with high affinity via site-2, but not able to trigger signaling due to its inability to recruit a second molecule of gp130 via site-3. These data confirm that Mut3 uses a site-2/site-3 architecture to assemble a signaling-compatible gp130 complex.</p><p>c) We have performed new TIRF microscopy experiments to confirm the stoichiometry of the complex formed by the IL-6 mutants. These experiments have shown that all IL-6 mutants, as well as HyIL-6, recruit two molecules of gp130 to trigger signaling, excluding the possibility of larger clusters of receptors induced by the mutants. This new data are now part of a new Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><p>We believe that we have strong experimental evidences that support a canonical gp130 binding architecture by the different IL-6 mutants. However, in the absence of a crystal structure we agree that we cannot formally disprove this possibility and we have reflected this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the imaging data or experiments that affect trafficking are not clear. The labelled ligand experiments with confocal microscopy should be performed as time lapse as function of different ligand concentrations to convincingly demonstrate the differential trafficking of the high/low affinity ligands.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this part of the manuscript needs to be strengthened. We have now developed a flow cytometry-based method to monitor IL-6 internalization at a wide range of time and ligand concentrations. These new data sets, presented now in new Figure 3F-G, further reinforce our initial observations that short-lived IL-6-gp130 complexes fail to traffic to intracellular compartments and to induce gp130 degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the PITSTOP experiment no statistical significance is given and only again the high affinity HylL6 is showing a clear effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Blocking receptor internalization is very challenging. High doses of inhibitors like Pitstop will stress the cells leading to overall poor signaling. Complete silencing of clathrin or the use of dynamin dominant negative mutants produces similar outcome. Based on this, we had to find a compromise between inhibition of traffic and cellular health, which led to variability in the experimental outcome. However, we obtained similar effects on signaling when using Pitstop or clathrin silencing, which we interpret as a solid evidence that gp130 traffic was required for STAT1 activation but not STAT3 activation. Nevertheless, we understand the reviewer's concerns and we have now included new data as new Figure 4 A-B, which more clearly show that IL-6 variants exhibit a significant defect in inducing gp130 degradation as compared to HyIL-6. Additionally, using fluorescently labeled HyIL-6, we have now more accurately quantified the inhibition of gp130 internalization upon Pitstop treatment (new Figure 4C). Indeed, Pitstop treatment elicits a very strong inhibition of HyIL-6 internalization. Below, we expand on why only HyIL-6 induces degradation of gp130 in the answers to the reviewer 1 questions.</p><p>Overall, we believe that the new modifications that we have introduced in the text to better explain our conclusions, together with the large array of new experimental data that we are providing, fully support our initial hypotheses and address the majority of concerns raised by the editors and reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study claims that ligand-receptor lifetimes (investigated by generating iL6 mutants with different binding affinities) affect cytokine signalling trough differential trafficking of multimeric receptors comprising gp130. IL-6 stimulates signaling via a hexameric receptor comprised of two copies of IL-6, two gp130 and two IL-6Rα receptor subunits. The authors used yeast surface display to engineer a series of IL-6 variants binding gp130 with different affinities. Three variants with different apparent affinities for the receptor complex were investigated: A1 (648 nM) and the high affinity C7 (6.2 nM) and Mut3 (379 pM). My initial enthusiasm for this study was hampered by inconsistencies in some of the interpretation of the experiments. The major point that the authors make is that low affine binding of ligand to the receptor complex impedes receptor internalization leading to STAT3 biased responses at the plasma membrane whereas high affine binding to gp130 causes its internalization also enabling the activation of STAT1 on endosomes. The difference in the ratio of STAT1/STAT3 activity causes differential gene expression. The authors explain this difference in trafficking by the difference in the receptor-ligand lifetime (effectively the difference in koff). In the first result chapter a minor inconsistency confused me: at the end of the paragraph &quot;The binding affinities of three of those variants, belonging to the first and second libraries, were confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, with values ranging from 648 nM (A1) to 6.2 nM (C7) and 379 pM (Mut3) (Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). The table in Figure 1G confirms that both Mut3 and C7 are high affinity, low nM Kd ligands with a KD ratio of approximately 16 (6nM/0.376nM). However, in Figure 1E where gp130 binding is measured the affinities seem to differ by two orders of magnitude for C7 and Mut3, whereas A1 does not seem to bind at all (despite a having a similar affinity as IL-6).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments and apologize for any confusion resulting from the lack of clarity in our presentation. The binding curves presented in Figure 1E correspond to the on-yeast binding titrations. Although this experiment is very informative and useful to stratify the different mutants based on their relative binding affinities for further studies, it does not provide a K<sub>D</sub> binding constant as the one obtained in the SPR measurements. Additionally, it cannot detect binding of ligands with relatively low binding affinities, as A1 and IL-6 wt, explaining why we do not get binding with these variants in these experimental set up. Therefore, it is not surprising to see differences in binding values from the two different set of experiments, with the SPR providing the most accurate measurement (Moraga et al., 2015). We have now amended the text (Paragraph three of the Results section) to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the binding affinity of HylL-6 for gp130? In general, several further inconsistencies weaken the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. For example, the high affinity C7 mutant ligand is two orders of magnitude less potent in activating STAT1/STAT3 as the high affinity ligand HyIL-6 (Figure 2A,B). Even for the sub-nano-molar Mut3 mutant (super)-high affinity binder, its potency is one order of magnitude less in activating STAT1/STAT3 as the high affinity ligand HyIL-6. Why is this so? Is the affinity of HylL-6 even an order of magnitude higher as that of Mut3?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the missing information on how IL-6 assembles its surface receptor to trigger signaling, which we believe has led to the confusion. We appreciate the point the reviewer is trying to make and have now clarified our language in the revised manuscript (Paragraph three of the Results section). Additionally, we are now providing schematic diagrams displaying the IL-6 receptor assembly kinetics modes used by the different IL-6 ligands described in this study as a new Figure 1A in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Briefly, IL-6 in a first step binds IL-6Rα receptor with high affinity. In a second step, this binary complex recruits gp130, via site-2 on the ligand-receptor interface, to form a hetero-trimeric complex, which cannot trigger signaling. In a third step, two hetero-trimeric complexes come together, via site-3 interaction, to finally form the signaling-compatible hexameric complex. HyIL-6, which is a fusion protein comprised of IL-6Rα and IL-6, directly binds gp130 on site-2 and then recruits a second gp130 molecule via site-3 to trigger signaling. It is important to emphasize that the presence of IL-6Rα helps to stabilize the complex by contributing to the formation of the site-2 and site-3 binding interfaces (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Therefore, in the absence of IL-6Rα, IL-6 wildtype cannot bind gp130 and trigger signaling.</p><p>To produce our IL-6 variants we have mutated the site-2 binding interface on IL-6, with all of the mutants exhibiting an unaltered wild-type site-3 interface. Consequently, the IL-6 variants binding affinities reported in the manuscript correspond exclusively to binding of the mutants to site-2 and not the overall affinity of the complex. What this means is that we have improved the ability of the mutants to find gp130 on the cell surface and therefore their efficiency in forming the intermediate IL-6/gp130 (site-2) heterodimeric complex in the absence of IL-6Rα. However, in order to trigger signaling this heterodimeric (mutant/gp130) complex still requires the recruitment of a second molecule of gp130 via site-3, which exhibit very low affinity, ultimately defining the final half-life of the complex formed. HyIL-6, which comprises IL-6Rα, forms a more stable site-3 binding interface, by stabilization of this binding interface via IL-6Rα/gp130 contacts, therefore forming a longer-lived complex than our engineered mutants, explaining its stronger overall potency.</p><p>We have experimental data that support this binding sequence for the engineered variants, using a Mut3 dominant negative form and can provided upon request. We have ablated site-3 binding on Mut3 by replacing W157, which is located in the center of this binding interface, with a cysteine residue, allowing us to place a FITC molecule via a click chemistry reaction. This in turn completely ablates the ability of Mut3 to recruit a second gp130 molecule via its site-3 interface to trigger signaling. Importantly, Mut3DN inhibits signaling by the lower affinity C7 mutant proving that it is still binding with high affinity to gp130 via its site-2 interface. However, Mut3DN cannot inhibit signaling induced by HyIL-6, even at 50-fold excess, strongly supporting a more stable complex formed by HyIL-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is a possible explanation that the different ligands induce a different receptor complex configuration by changing the interactions between extracellular domains?</p></disp-quote><p>Although possible, we believe this possibility to be very unlikely. Please see the answer that we provide above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the balance between IL-6Rα engagement versus gp130 engagement affect signaling outcome? This is indicated by the fact that IL-6 wild type (wt), requires IL-6Rα expression to activate signalling whereas the high affinity Hyper IL-6 (HyIL-6) only requires gp130 and potently triggers signaling in cells lacking IL-6Rα. This all points at a possible other mechanism, where the different mutant ligands generate different extracellular conformations of the gp130 that could engage in different heterotypic receptor clusters with different signalling capacities.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above IL-6Rα contributes to stabilize the IL-6/receptor complex by interacting with gp130 via site-2 and site-3 binding interfaces. Thus, in the absence of IL-6Rα, the wildtype cytokine cannot recruit gp130 due to its low affinity. HyIL6, which already has IL-6Rα as part of its core, can recruit gp130 and trigger signaling. By contrast, our mutants can bind gp130 via site-2 in the absence of IL-6Rα. While gp130 dimerization is mediated by interactions via site-3 (which does not differ between the different variants), the overall lifetime of the signaling complex for our engineered IL-6 (two IL-6 with two gp130 molecules) is probably limited by the site-2 interaction. We therefore expect differential complex stabilities which ultimately impact their ability to activate STAT1 and STAT3 proteins. We want to emphasize at this point that the signaling as well as the imaging studies presented in original Figure 2,3, 4 and 5 in the manuscript were done in cells lacking IL-6Ra expression in order to characterize the real contribution of gp130 binding to signaling output, therefore explaining the stronger potency exhibited by HyIL-6 and the lack of signaling by wild-type IL-6. To address the alternative scenario suggested by the reviewer we have now performed further TIRF microscopy assays. We now provide strong evidences that all mutants form a stoichiometrically identical complex as the one formed by IL-6 wildtype and HyIL-6, which argues against the formation of larger heterotypic complexes by these mutants (new Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The imaging data that should support the hypothesis that the lifetime of the receptor-ligand complexes affects the trafficking are not clear. For example, the authors detected the high affinity Mut3 ligand in intracellular compartments that partially co-localized with EEA1 early endosome marker, whereas no fluorescence was detected for the high affinity C7 mutant ligand (factor 3 difference in off rate) (Figure 3D,E). Should this not give some internalisation for high affinity ligands? For any ligand at least binding at the plasma membrane should be visible for concentrations higher than the Kd of the ligand/receptor complex, which is not visible for C7 (40 nM ligand concentration versus 6 nM Kd; Figure 3D). The off-rates given in table one let us approximate the lifetime of the complexes which for the C7 and Mut3 is in the order of ~20 min and ~60 min, which is very long in comparison with the STAT signalling time-scale.</p></disp-quote><p>The affinity of the mutants for gp130 exclusively represents their binding to site-2 and not the overall stability of the complex formed. So, while the C7 and Mut3 mutants, as highlighted by the reviewer, will remain bound to gp130 for ~20 min and ~60 min, this is not true for the signaling-compatible tetrameric complex of two IL-6 and two gp130 molecules formed by these mutants, which is limited by the affinity of the mutants for site-3. As a result, even Mut3, which binds with extremely high affinity to site-2, induces a very poor internalization when compared to hyIL-6, which exhibits high binding affinity for both site-2 and site-3 binding interfaces. This said, we agree with the reviewer in that the internalization experiment should be done at a wider range of ligand concentrations and stimulation times to more accurately assess gp130 internalization by the different IL-6 mutants. To address this, we have utilized a flow-cytometry based assay. We have incubated HeLa cells with a wide range of concentrations of the different fluorescently labelled IL-6 variants, or we saturated concentrations at different time points. We have used flow cytometry to quantify the fluorescence signals resulting from intracellular fluorescence molecules. We now show in new Figure 3F and G and 4C that HyIL-6 is the only IL-6 variant that it is robustly internalized in both experimental set ups, with the other IL-6 variants exhibiting very poor internalization, thus supporting our initial observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also state: &quot;We detected significant ligand induced gp130 co-locomotion for all IL-6 variants except for A1, with levels of co-locomotion paralleling gp130 binding affinities, i.e. HyIL-6&gt;Mut3&gt;C7&gt;A1. Should A1 not have similar to WT IL-6 some engagement of GP130? Is this also not dependent on the outside concentration of A1 (saturating concentrations)? In general, the co-locomotion of receptors for any of the mutant ligands is very sparse (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). What is the reason for this if the functional receptor is a hexameric complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer in that the co-locomotion, although reproducible and significant, is sparse. The reason for that is that due to ubiquitous expression of endogenous gp130 in all cell lines, which affect TIRF measurements, we used an available gp130 KO HEK293 clone obtained by CRISPR technology (Schwerd T, J. Ex. Med., 2017). Unfortunately, HEK293 cells are very poor cells for imaging, therefore producing sparse signal as detected here. We have now generated new RPE1 gp130 KO clones, which we have used to repeat the TIRF studies. We are now providing new data shown in new Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2, that robustly show dimerization efficiencies induced by the different IL-6 ligands. Additionally, we have performed new stoichiometric analysis to show that the IL-6 variants are not inducing different receptor oligomerization on the cell surface (new Figure 3E). It is notable that RPE1 cells do not express IL-6Rα, therefore we are not measuring hexameric complex formation, but tetrameric complex (two IL-6 with two gp130) for the different IL-6 variants and IL-6 wild-type, with the exception of HyIL-6, which already has IL-6Rα. This explains why we detect very low dimerization of gp130 in response to IL-6 wt or A1 mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When the authors compare gp130 degradation, only the high affinity ligand HyIL-6 causes significant degradation. Is it not so that if Mut3 is the high affinity ligand that was actually found on endosomes (Figure 3D) that it should also end up in lysosomes by the usual Rab5/Rab7 switch for early to late endosomes? In the PITSTOP experiment no statistical significance is given and only again the high affinity HylL6 is showing a clear effect. However, this effect on receptor degradation is similar to the non-stimulated case, making the whole link to ligand-receptor lifetime regulating trafficking weaker.</p></disp-quote><p>HyIL-6 forms a more stable complex with gp130 than the IL-6 mutants due to its stronger interaction via site-3. The different mutants, due to their weak site-3 interaction, are unable to induce strong receptor internalization and therefore degradation. Although it is true that we detect some Mut3 molecules in endosomal compartments, the levels detected are much weaker than those induced by HyIL-6, and are insufficient to produce a significant decrease in the total levels of gp130. We have now performed more detailed kinetics of gp130 degradation (new Figure 4A and B) by the different IL-6 ligands to strengthen our initial observations. Our new data clearly show that HyIL-6 induces a significantly stronger degradation than the other IL-6 ligands, followed by the Mut3 mutant. C7, A1 and IL-6 ligands do not induce gp130 degradation, but lead to some stabilization of the receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea of competitive binding for the STATs to gp130 should also be true for gp130 on intracellular compartments? This idea could also be further tested by enhancing the relative expression of STAT1 (instead of knock down of STAT3) versus STAT3 in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We now provide new data (new Figure 5F) where we show the effect of STAT1 overexpression in STAT3 phosphorylation by hyIL-6. Indeed, over expression of STAT1 results in decreased STAT3 phosphorylation induced by all IL-6 variants tested, further supporting our STAT competition model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this effect not due to a differential regulation of STAT-binding phosphorylation sites on gp130 by intra-cellular protein tyrosine phosphatases such as PTPN1/2? The factor signalling time is also not taken into consideration in the down-stream differential gene expression effect. Despite the interesting results that are presented, I feel that at this stage he authors have to do substantial additional work to prove that ligand-receptor lifetimes affect receptor trafficking and thereby multimeric receptor signalling via STAT1/STAT3.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is a possibility, we think that it is very unlikely. It has been previously reported that STAT1 and STAT3 compete for the same phospho-Tyr on gp130 (Gerhartz et al., 1996; Schmitz et al., 2000). However, we understand the reviewer point and now provide new data (new Figure 5C-D) where we have studied the contribution of each Tyr on the gp130 ICD to STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation upon HyIL-6 treatment. Our data clearly show that STAT1 and STAT3 compete for the same Tyr in gp130, and only after mutating all four Tyr to Phe we were able to block STAT1/STAT3 activation by HyIL-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Martinez-Fabregas et al. addresses a biologically important and technically interesting question of how binding affinity between cytokine ligands and receptors can differentially modulate signaling output. The authors nicely frame the biological background of this problem in the Introduction. The case with cytokine receptors is contrasted with the biased signaling known in GPCRs, where different ligands produce different responses from the same receptor via allosteric modulations. The author's point out that this cannot be applied to cytokine receptors with a single membrane-spanning domain (although I question their certainty on this, see minor points).</p><p>To study this system, the authors generated a panel of IL-6 variants with differing binding affinities for gp130. They find that these ligands trigger biased signaling based on their affinities and use this system to extract mechanistic insights. More broadly, the authors suggest these results highlight that manipulation of cytokine-receptor binding parameters could be a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy, which is a source of toxicity in cytokine-based therapies. Overall I think it's a very impressive piece of work and an important contribution to the field. I list a couple of more detailed points and questions below:</p><p>• In their study of differential STAT3/STAT1 activation the authors note that the different ligands drove differential phosphorylation amplitudes, which could not be rescued by increases in ligand concentration. This observation suggests that it is not affinity to which the receptors respond, but rather must be kinetic off-rate. If increasing ligand concentration cannot rescue the signaling differences, then receptor occupancy is not what the cell is measuring. The only other parameter is binding dwell time-very much the way T cell receptor distinguishes peptide MHC ligands. I suggest that the author's data does not support binding affinity as the differentiator, but rather binding dwell time. In the language they use in the text, this distinction is important and it would be useful if the authors elaborated on it more explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer. We have amended the text to explicitly state that IL-6/gp130 binding dwell time is the major factor contributing to biased signaling in the gp130 system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The next section, &quot;short lived IL-6-gp130 complexes fail to traffic to intracellular compartments&quot;, does essentially claim a kinetic discrimination mechanism-although the authors don't directly say this. The language still uses terms like &quot;binding energy&quot;. I think the authors should take a more clear stand on kinetic discrimination vs. binding strength. Statements such as &quot;one of the first steps affected by changes in gp130 binding affinity would be the assembly kinetics&quot; are rather unclear. Why would binding affinity affect this? Binding affinity only affects receptor occupancy, and should always be compensated by changing ligand concentration. If the data indicate ligand concentration cannot compensate, then a kinetic proof reading mechanism in which short dwelling events fail to activate-no matter how many there are-seems likely, if not necessary. The nuance here is that kinetic proof reading requires an out-of-equilibrium process and rate-limiting kinetic intermediates (see, for example, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2016, 113, 29: 8218 and Science 2019, 363: 1098). Is the gp130 system capable of kinetic proof reading based on what is known? Perhaps internalization breaks equilibrium and provides the rate-limiting step? It’s not obvious to me that it is, but being able to say anything about this based on their data would be extremely interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestions. We agree that the most likely scenario that explains our results is a kinetics discrimination mechanism. Indeed, we had stated in the Discussion that “These data suggest that non-detectable short-lived IL-6/gp130 complexes can partially engage signaling, but fail to trigger a full response, evoking a kinetic-proof reading model”. However, we agree with the reviewer that the terminology should be more clear and possible mechanisms need to be discussed. We have amended the language in the Discussion to better define these concepts and more clearly state our conclusions. Regarding the reviewer's comments stating the need of an out-of-equilibrium process and rate-limiting kinetics intermediates for a kinetic-proof reading model, we believe that the gp130 system exhibits those requisites. As pointed out by the reviewer, receptor internalization is the critical event that breaks the equilibrium by irreversibly capturing intact signaling complexes into endosomes. We have recently quantitatively described this effect in a systematic study with engineered IL-13 variants (Moraga et al., 2015), showing the critical role of interaction rate constants in such a non-equilibrium process. For the engineered gp130 agonists, we clearly observed that endocytosis is altered, which presumably is caused by differential stability of ligand-receptor interaction (i.e. the off-rate). We have followed the reviewer’s advice and introduce a new chapter in the Discussion to describe these concepts (Discussion paragraph four).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the Discussion, the author's seem to dismiss kinetic proof reading as unlikely or difficult to reconcile. However, isn't the STAT competition model the authors articulate providing a form of kinetic proof reading? To some degree this is only a matter of semantics in the definition of the term, kinetic proof reading. But I suggest the fact that the mechanism the authors have identified achieves a form of kinetic discrimination is an important realization, and probably should be identified as a form of kinetic proof reading.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the idea that cytokine receptor complexes use a kinetic proof reading mechanism to define their signaling output and biological responses. We initially decided to be cautious in our use of the term as there might be some nuances between the cytokine system and other systems (e.g. TCR system) where kinetic proof reading has been proposed. However, we agree that our STAT competition model could be englobed within a more general kinetic proof reading mechanism. We have amended the Discussion to state this more clearly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
