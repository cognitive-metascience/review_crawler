In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, apart from its role in innate immunity, this pathway has also been reported to be important for the elimination of loser cells in a process referred to as cell competition, which can be locally triggered by secreted factors released from winner cells. In this work, we provide evidence that the inhibition of Toll signaling not only increases the fitness of loser cells, but also bestows a clonal growth advantage on wild-type cells. We further demonstrate that this growth advantage depends on basal infection levels since it is no longer present under axenic conditions but exacerbated upon intense pathogen exposure. Thus, the Toll pathway functions as a fine-tuned pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative regulator, underlining the existence of a trade-off between innate immunity and growth during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Toll pathway</kwd><kwd>cell growth</kwd><kwd>cell competition</kwd><kwd>innate Immunity</kwd><kwd>cell fitness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Forschungskredit Candoc University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Germani</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hain</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hain</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Toll pathway inactivation enhances tissue growth and cell fitness when the environment in which animals develop is not deprived of pathogens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Toll pathway was first identified as a master regulator of dorso-ventral patterning in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>) and subsequently shown to serve as the core mechanism for the innate immune response to Gram positive bacteria, fungi, viruses and cancer cells in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lemaitre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Medzhitov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krutzik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Silverman and Maniatis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thoma-Uszynski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the Toll pathway is activated upon infection via the proteolytic cleavage of the cytokine Spätzle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chasan and Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Weber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stein et al., 1991</xref>), which triggers a signal transduction cascade that leads to the nuclear translocation of the NFκB transcription factors Dorsal and Dif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drier et al., 1999</xref>). This ancient and highly conserved cascade starts with the binding of cleaved Spätzle to one of the nine Toll receptors, which in turn associates via its cytoplasmic domain with Myd88, Tube and Pelle. The kinase Pelle then phosphorylates Cactus (IκB), targeting it for proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horng and Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu and Anderson, 1998</xref>). Since Cactus normally retains Dorsal and Dif in the cytoplasm, its degradation causes their release, nuclear translocation and expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), molecules that specifically fight infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulet et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The Toll pathway has more recently been proposed to mediate the elimination of unfit cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>) from tissues via a process known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals as cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>). Weakened, damaged cells, referred to as ‘losers’ in the context of cell competition, are detected and eliminated from developing tissues via delamination and apoptosis when surrounded by fitter cells, generally referred to as ‘winners’. Two well studied paradigms of cell competition are: <italic>Minute</italic> competition, where cells lacking one allele of a ribosomal protein gene are surrounded by wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>), and super-competition, where wild-type cells are surrounded by cells expressing elevated levels of <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno and Basler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>). Overexpression (OE) of Cactus in loser cells rescues cell competition-driven elimination of both <italic>RpL14<sup>+/-</sup>Minute</italic> clones and of wild-type clones surrounded by cells with an extra copy of the <italic>dMy</italic>c gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). It has recently been proposed that dMyc-expressing winner cells release Spätzle and the serine proteases required for its activation, thereby enhancing Toll-dependent apoptosis in neighboring loser cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we observed that inhibition of the Toll pathway by Cactus OE not only rescued the elimination of loser cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), but also conferred a clonal growth advantage to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, the activation of the pathway via Toll-7 or Pelle overexpression caused a reduction of clonal growth: such clones assumed a rounded-up shape, suggesting that cells were undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–1A’’’</xref>, quantified in 1B). Additional regimes of clonal induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) and the use of other pathway components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>) corroborated these results: also overexpression of Dorsal, Tollo and Toll-2 led to a reduction of clonal growth, as well as the overexpression of Toll-10b, the constitutive active form of the Toll-1 receptor. Next, we checked whether the reduction of growth observed upon Toll pathway activation was due to increased apoptosis. Dcp-1 staining revealed that both Toll-7 and Pelle OE clones are highly apoptotic, round up and are finally pushed out of the tissue via delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We further overexpressed Toll-7 and Cactus in the posterior compartment of the wing disc. Toll-7 OE massively induced apoptosis, whereas Cactus OE caused a reduction of apoptosis when compared to the wild-type anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39939.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Toll pathway negatively regulates clonal growth.</title><p>When compared to LacZ overexpressing (OE) clones, here used as a control (<bold>A</bold>), clonal inhibition of the Toll pathway via the overexpression of the NFkB inhibitor <italic>Cactus</italic> (IkB) causes overgrowth (<bold>A’</bold>).

However, no major size differences could be observed, indicating that Toll signaling influences cellular fitness only in situations where cell populations that differ in their ability to respond to infection are intermingled. A corollary of this hypothesis would be that wild-type cells must exhibit higher pathway activity compared to Cactus OE cells, in which the pathway is effectively blocked. Since Toll signaling is a key mediator for the immune response, it is possible that a subliminal pathway activity level stems from chronic exposure to pathogens, due to typically unsterile working conditions. To test this, we grew animals in a fully axenic environment – that is in the complete absence of pathogens - and in a highly infected environment – that is by adding <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This fungus was chosen because of its pathogenic activity that shortens the life span of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As expected, in a <italic>Minute</italic> cell competition scenario, the inhibition of the Toll pathway via overexpression of Cactus in loser cells strongly rescued their elimination in both normal and infected conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’–A’’, B’–B’’</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). However, no rescue of cell competition-driven elimination of loser cells was observed when animals were grown under axenic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Indeed, under axenic conditions Cactus OE <italic>Minute</italic> loser clones were eliminated even more efficiently than control <italic>Minute</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C–D’</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). A similar behavior was observed in the dMyc super-competition context, where Cactus OE rescued loser cell elimination upon infection but not under axenic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus the involvement of the Toll pathway in cell competition depends on the presence of pathogens in the environment in which larvae develop.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39939.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Toll pathway inhibition rescues cell competition-driven elimination of loser clones in an infection-dependent manner.</title><p><italic>Minute</italic> clones, which lack a functional copy of the <italic>RpL14</italic> gene, are eliminated via cell competition under axenic (<bold>A</bold>), normal (<bold>A’</bold>), and infected conditions (<bold>A’’</bold>).

Thus the clonal disadvantage caused by Toll pathway activation inversely correlates with the level of infection, substantially diminishing with increasing degrees of infection. Finally, we asked whether the partially lethal effects of ubiquitous Toll-7 or Cactus OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) depend on the pathogen load (infection or axenic conditions). We found that pathway activation-induced lethality was ameliorated under conditions of extra-infection, while pathway suppression-induced lethality was rescued by axenic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39939.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Toll pathway negatively regulates clonal growth in an infection-dependent manner.</title><p>Under normal laboratory conditions, when compared to LacZ OE clones (<bold>A’</bold>), clonal inhibition of the Toll pathway with Cactus OE causes overgrowth in a wild-type background (<bold>B’</bold>).

This growth difference depends on the level of infection: it is null in axenic conditions and enhanced by addition of pathogens. Most likely, therefore, it is driven by different levels of Toll pathway activity. Importantly though, these different levels must occur in cell populations that cohabitate in the same tissue, as we were not able to detect growth effects in organs entirely programmed to exhibit elevated or reduced Toll signaling. Our findings can therefore be explained by a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in which cells with lower Toll pathway activity profit from, and grow faster than, nearby cells with higher activity. Conversely, cell clones with higher Toll signaling levels (e.g. by overexpressing Toll receptors) are eliminated from the tissue via apoptosis and delamination when surrounded by cells with lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39939.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Infection-dependent role of the Toll pathway in cell growth (pathway inhibition scenario).</title><p>The cartoon shows wild-type cells, colored in violet, that surround red-Cactus overexpressing cells. Toll receptors are present on cell membranes. Spätzle cytokines are drawn as blue circles, Cactus as red circles and NFkB as green circles. Infection with <italic>A. niger</italic> is depicted with black symbols. Nuclear shapes indicate either a dividing or a static cell (<bold>A and B</bold>). Under axenic condition, no pathogens are present in the extracellular environment and, independently of the amount of IkB inhibitor in the cytoplasm, the NFkB transcription factors are unable to translocate to the nucleus. The outcome is a leveled and uniform growth between wild-type and Cactus OE cells (<bold>A</bold>). When cells are naturally or artificially exposed to infectious agents, Toll pathway activation in wild-type cells causes NFkB nuclear translocation. On the contrary, Cactus OE cells remain unresponsive, with NFkB confined to the cytoplasm. This generates a strong growth advantage over the surrounding wild-type cells (<bold>B</bold>). After developmental time, indicated in the cartoon with a clock, clones of red Cactus OE cells are growing over a larger percentage of the tissue upon infection (<bold>A’ and B’</bold>). The source of active Spätzle may be both systemic, as suggested by our experiments, and local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpar et al., 2018</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39939-fig4-v4.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39939.015</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Infection-dependent role of the Toll pathway in cell growth (pathway activation scenario).</title><p>The cartoon shows wild-type cells, colored in violet, that surround orange Toll-7 overexpressing cells, as indicated by the increased number of receptors on the surface of the cells. Spätzle cytokines are drawn as blue circles, Cactus as red circles and NFkB as green circles. Infection with <italic>A. niger</italic> is depicted with black symbols. Nuclear shapes indicate either a dividing or a static cell (<bold>A and B</bold>). Under either axenic or normal conditions, no or ‘natural’ amounts of pathogens are present in the environment. Cells with higher numbers of receptors have presumably higher chances to sense the infection via Spätzle and to therefore activate the Toll pathway, leading to cell death and delamination. Surrounding wild-type cells therefore gain a growth advantage over Toll overexpressing cells (<bold>A</bold>). When a large amount of pathogen is present, activation of the pathway presumably reaches saturation levels in all cells, irrespectively of the number of exposed receptors. Cell growth is therefore leveled among wild-type and Toll overexpressing cells (<bold>B</bold>). After developmental time, indicated in the cartoon with a clock, clones of orange Toll OE cells are growing over a larger percentage of the tissue upon infection (<bold>A’ and B’</bold>).

Likely therefore, the active form of Spätzle is produced in distant organs and reaches the wing disc through the haemolymph. However, it has recently been proposed that wing discs locally produce Spätzle and the serine proteases responsible for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpar et al., 2018</xref>). Via an increased secretion of these factors, Myc OE cells may be able to induce Toll-dependent apoptosis in neighboring loser cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpar et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore possible that local and systemic sources of Spätzle co-exist. Since infection is the initial trigger for the aforementioned effects in cell competition and clonal growth, it will be interesting to investigate whether the local production of Spätzle and serine proteases depends on a systemic response to infection.</p><p>Our findings also underline the important awareness that we are working in non-anthropic environments. Experimental results can dramatically differ because of complex and often unexpected consequences of immune responses. This aspect has been emphasized with experiments conducted in mice in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abolins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Willyard, 2018</xref>). Here we show that analogous issues can affect <italic>Drosophila</italic> research.</p><p>Finally, our results also reveal a phenotypic connection between the two fundamental processes of innate immunity and cell growth at the cellular level. The previous findings that Dorsal induces the transcription of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>rpr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>)</italic> and that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll pathway cross-talks with the growth controlling Hippo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) also suggest a potential mechanistic connection for our observations. The evolutionary implications can be viewed in the light of the life history theory, which seeks to explain natural selection on the basic assumption that environmental resources are limited and organisms establish trade-offs between processes such as reproduction, growth and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Roff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stearns et al., 2000</xref>). Allocating resources into a costly trait like immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">van der Most et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rauw, 2012</xref>) occurs at the expense of other important processes, such as organismal growth. In agreement with this theory, we experimentally show that a cellular trade-off exists between innate immunity and clonal growth during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drosophila stocks and care</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C on a cornmeal food.
