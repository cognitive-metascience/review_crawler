However, the cost of resistance can be mitigated by compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome, and therefore the loss of resistance may proceed too slowly to be of practical importance. We present our study on the efficacy and phenotypic impact of compensatory evolution in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains carrying multiple resistance mutations. We have demonstrated that drug-resistance frequently declines within 480 generations during exposure to an antibiotic-free environment. The extent of resistance loss was found to be generally antibiotic-specific, driven by mutations that reduce both resistance level and fitness costs of antibiotic-resistance mutations. We conclude that phenotypic reversion to the antibiotic-sensitive state can be mediated by the acquisition of additional mutations, while maintaining the original resistance mutations. Our study indicates that restricting antimicrobial usage could be a useful policy, but for certain antibiotics only.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibiotic

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Steady antibiotic overuse has led to the rise and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and can potentially reduce the number of therapeutic options against several dangerous human pathogens. Resistance seriously impacts the effectiveness of treatment, and increases the risk of complications and fatal outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mensah Abrampah et al., 2018</xref>). Strict policies that aim to restrict antimicrobial usage in clinical settings may offer a solution to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guay, 2008</xref>). Such strategies implicitly presume that resistance leads to reduced bacterial fitness in an antibiotic-free environment, and therefore these resistant populations should be rapidly outcompeted by antibiotic-sensitive variants. In theory, the extent of fitness costs determines the long-term stability of resistance, and consequently, the rate by which the frequency of resistant bacteria decreases in an antibiotic-free environment. Resistance mutations frequently incur fitness costs in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson and Levin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levin et al., 1997</xref>), as such mutations impair essential cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, or cell-wall biogenesis. There is a negative correlation between measured fitness costs and prevalence in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Praski Alzrigat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trindade et al., 2009</xref>). This would suggest that fitness costs shape the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the clinics. However, in other cases, such deleterious side effects of resistance mutations are undetectable, and resistance can even confer benefits in specific, antibiotic-free environmental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is frequently assumed that such compensatory mutations mitigate the fitness costs of resistance mutations without affecting the level of resistance. As the range of targets for compensation is much broader, compensatory mutations are more likely than the reversion of resistance mutations. If compensatory mutations are indeed widespread, pathogens can reach both high level of resistance and high fitness. For these reasons, reversion to the original antibiotic-sensitive state under prudent antibiotic use may proceed so slowly that it will have no practical importance in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Hughes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicoloff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schrag et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Several prior laboratory studies support the argument above. It has been reported that antibiotic resistance is stably maintained as a result of compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Björkman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johanson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcusson et al., 2009</xref>), however, instances of compensatory mutations have not been generalized to clinical settings. Several published clinical studies indicate that limited antibiotic use can cause rapid changes in the frequency of resistance. In certain cases, resistance tends to decline both in individual patients and at the community level following restricted antibiotic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dagan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottesman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kristinsson, 1997</xref>). For example, the frequency of erythromycin-resistant <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> steadily declined as a result of reduced use of macrolides in Finnish hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seppälä et al., 1997</xref>). By contrast, months of reduction of sulfamethoxazole clinical treatment in the United Kingdom failed to reach reduced resistance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enne et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>This disagreement between clinical observations and laboratory studies could have multiple reasons. First, antibiotic treatments frequently fail to completely eradicate antibiotic-sensitive bacteria from the population. Following treatment, antibiotic sensitive bacteria with high fitness could rapidly spread in the population, leading to rapid loss of resistance. Second, compensatory evolution may be limited in nature and in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall and MacLean, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogwill and MacLean, 2015</xref>). Indeed, most laboratory studies focused on resistance to a single drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maisnier-Patin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qi et al., 2016</xref>), thus compensatory evolution in multidrug-resistant bacteria has remained largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogwill and MacLean, 2015</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moura de Sousa et al., 2017</xref>). This latter shortcoming is especially noteworthy, because several multidrug-resistant bacteria are difficult to treat with current antibiotic treatment, and therefore the issue of compensatory evolution is especially relevant. Indeed, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms that mitigate the costs of multiple – potentially epistatically interacting – mutations in multidrug-resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trindade et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong, 2017</xref>), which clearly cannot be achieved in studies focusing on single mutants only.</p><p>In this work, we have studied 23 drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that carry 2 to 13 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lázár et al., 2014</xref>). We have found that 60 days of laboratory evolution under antibiotic-free conditions has led to a rapid decline of resistance to certain, but not all antibiotics. This decline in resistance has not resulted from strict reversion mutations that recapitulate wild-type bacteria at the molecular level. Rather, the mutated genes are functionally related, but not identical to those conferring antibiotic resistance. Notably, these mutations perturb membrane-permeability and the activity of regulons involved in defense against drugs and related stresses. They partially restore wild-type fitness in the antibiotic-free medium, and also reduce the level of antibiotic-resistance, at least against certain antibiotics. These considerations could help to identify antibiotics where restricting antimicrobial usage could be a useful policy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of resistance and fitness cost</title><p>In a previous work we had performed adaptive laboratory evolution under gradually increasing antibiotic dosages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lázár et al., 2014</xref>).

Adapting populations were found to display an up to 328-fold increment in their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) relative to the wild-type strain. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance, 60 antibiotic-resistant strains (one clone per each population) were previously isolated and subjected to whole genome sequencing analysis.

Although resistance mutations frequently have associated fitness costs, such costs may decline subsequently through the accumulation of compensatory mutations. It has been argued that such compensatory mutations mitigate the fitness costs of resistance mutations <italic>without</italic> affecting the level of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Hughes, 2010</xref>), suggesting that limiting antibiotic usage may not have much practical utility in clinical settings. However, most prior laboratory studies focused on bacteria carrying a single resistance mutation, whereas antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates usually carry multiple resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogwill and MacLean, 2015</xref>). This issue is all the more relevant, as epistasis is prevalent between antibiotic-resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A specific case of compensation is <italic>molecular reversion</italic>. In this case, the mutation responsible for molecular reversion restores the wild-type, antibiotic-susceptible genetic sequence, and thereby eliminates the fitness costs associated with the resistance mutation. However, molecular reversion is assumed to be generally rare, as it requires very specific and mutational events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Hughes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durão et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, case studies indicate that <italic>phenotypic reversion</italic> can also occur, when the original resistance mutation is maintained, but acquisition of additional mutations simultaneously reduces fitness costs and increases antibiotic-susceptibility. For example, streptomycin-resistance is frequently mediated by resistance mutations in the ribosomal protein gene <italic>rpsL</italic>, but compensatory mutations in other genes involved in translation yield reversion to streptomycin-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moura de Sousa et al., 2017</xref>). As the molecular targets for phenotypic reversion are relatively broad, reversion to the antibiotic-susceptible state may be far more likely than previously appreciated.</p><p>To test the theory of phenotypic reversion, we studied laboratory evolved drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains carrying 2 to 13 mutations and initially displaying reduced fitness compared to the wild-type strain. We found that 60 days of laboratory evolution in an antibiotic-free environment led to a rapid fitness improvement in 51% of the antibiotic-resistant lineages (some of which approximated wild-type fitness).</p><p>Fitness may increase during the course of laboratory evolution as a result of general adaptation to the environment and/or accumulation of compensatory mutations that mitigate the deleterious side effects of resistance. The second option is more realistic, as several mutations that had accumulated during laboratory evolution affected genes involved in bacterial defense mechanisms against antibiotics or in general stress-responses (eg. <italic>rpoS</italic> promoter region/<italic>nlpD</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stoebel et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>potD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shah et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>soxSR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain and Saini, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). An in-depth genetic analysis has also demonstrated epistatic interactions between resistance- and putative compensatory mutations in <italic>marR</italic> and <italic>envZ.</italic> These mutations had accumulated during laboratory evolution and increased fitness in the respective antibiotic-resistant strain, but reduced fitness in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). This latter finding also suggests that compensatory mutations themselves have associated fitness costs, preventing antibiotic-resistant bacteria to reach the full fitness of sensitive variants.</p><p>Crucially, we have demonstrated that drug-resistance declines in an antibiotic-free laboratory environment. In as few as 480 generations, 64.7% of drug-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains showed elevated susceptibilities to at least one antibiotic investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). We did not observe <italic>bona fide</italic> reversion mutations in laboratory evolved bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durão et al., 2018</xref>). This is not unexpected, as compensation via the accumulation of additional mutations elsewhere in the genome is far more likely to occur.</p><p>Detailed genetic analysis of the <italic>mar</italic> regulon also supports the phenotypic reversion hypothesis. MarR is a transcriptional regulatory protein that controls the activity of the <italic>mar</italic> regulon in <italic>E. coli</italic> through the repression of <italic>marA</italic>. The <italic>mar</italic> regulon participates in controlling several genes involved in antibiotic-resistance, including the AcrA/AcrB/TolC multidrug-efflux system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Here we have focused on a multidrug-resistant laboratory evolved <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that carries a mutation in the protein coding sequence of <italic>marR</italic>. This resistance mutation has an associated fitness cost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), promoting the accumulation of further mutations.

For example, in our study, resistance to doxycycline and tetracycline was frequently lost, while aminoglycoside-resistance was generally maintained during the course of laboratory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).</p><p>Our findings appear to be consistent with clinical data. For instance, a Finnish retrospective study assessed the proportion of quinolone-susceptible <italic>E. coli</italic> urine isolates before and after a nationwide restriction of ciprofloxacin use was implemented in Finland. The research revealed that a reduced consumption of quinolone antibiotics resulted in a significant decrease in quinolone-resistance of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottesman et al., 2009</xref>). Our laboratory study also shows that ciprofloxacin-resistance has declined in 66% of initially resistant populations, following a long-term exposure to antibiotic-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Another study examined the impact of a 24 month voluntary restriction on the use of trimethoprim-containing drugs in Sweden on the prevalence of trimethoprim-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> isolated from urinary-tract infections. All clinical isolates were found to retain their resistance levels and carried mutation in <italic>folA</italic>, the target gene of trimethoprim, even after 24 months of trimethoprim restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brolund et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with this clinical study, we have found that all five trimethoprim resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with a <italic>folA</italic> resistance mutation have maintained their resistance following laboratory evolution in antibiotic-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-source data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These considerations must be taken with some caution, as comparison of clinical and laboratory data is not straightforward. For instance, restricted usage of certain antibiotics in hospitals cannot completely eliminate antibiotic selection in a given region due to lack of isolation and cross-resistance between antibiotics.</p><p>In summary, three main patterns indicate that phenotypic reversion to an antibiotic-susceptible state could be common during compensatory evolution. In our study, we have observed i) rapid fitness increase in antibiotic free-medium, ii) associated loss of antibiotic resistance, and we iii) identified specific mutations that simultaneously change both characteristics.</p><p>Our findings suggest that restricting antimicrobial usage could be a useful policy to control the increasing rise and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria, but it may work for certain antibiotics only. We should also emphasize, however, that all our evolutionary experiments were performed in devoid of <italic>any</italic> antibiotics. The next logical step is to study the occurrence of phenotypic reversion during exposure to temporarily changing antibiotic treatments or sublethal antibiotic dosages as it may occur in real-life situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson and Hughes, 2014</xref>). Our study leaves open the question about the extent by which initial fitness costs of resistance mutations and/or intensity of antibiotic selection shapes subsequent compensatory evolution and associated loss of resistance. Finally, our study has focused on chromosomal resistance mutations. It is still unclear whether resistance-conferring plasmids are generally lost or the associated fitness costs are mitigated by genomic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahlberg and Chao, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">K12 BW25113 (wild type)</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000950">25000950</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">SRA project: SRX551437 (<italic>E. coli</italic> AB cross-resistance)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SRR1297006 to SRR1297184 (resistant strains)</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000950">25000950</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">SRA project: SRX551437 (<italic>E. coli</italic> AB cross-resistance)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST AMPICILLIN AM 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412253</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST CEFOXITIN FX 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412285</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST CIPROFLOXACIN CI 32</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412311</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST CHLORAMPHENICOL CL 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412309</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST <break/>DOXYCYCLINE DC 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412328</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST KANAMYCIN KM 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412382</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST NALIDIXIC-ACID NA 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">B30-516500</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST NITROFURANTOIN NI 512</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">B30-530400</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST TETRACYCLINE TC 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412471</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST TOBRAMYCIN TM 256</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412479</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ETEST TRIMETHOPRIM TR 32</td><td valign="top">bioMérieux</td><td valign="top">S30-412483</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">bisBenzimide H 33342 trihydrochloride</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">B2261-25MG</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20513705">20513705</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">AC228131000</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20513705">20513705</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pORTMAGE-3</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884157">26884157</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Addgene: Plasmid #72678</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RStudio (Version 1.1.463)</td><td valign="top">R Core Team (2018). <break/>R: A language and environment <break/>for statistical computing.

The 384-well plates were incubated at 30°C in an STX44 (LiCONiC AG) automated incubator with alternating shaking speed every minute between 1,000 rpm and 1,200 rpm. Plates were transferred by a Microlab Swap 420 robotic arm (Hamilton Bonaduz AG) to Powerwave XS2/HT plate readers (BioTek Instruments Inc) every 20 min and cell growth was followed by recording the optical density at 600 nm. Five technical replicates of three biological replicate measurements were executed on all strains sampled from each time-point of the evolutionary experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Growth curve analysis</title><p>Fitness was approximated by calculating the area under the growth curve (AUGC). AUGC has been previously used as a proxy for fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasenbrink et al., 2005</xref>) and it has the advantage to integrate multiple fitness parameters, such as the slope of exponential phase (growth rate) and the final optical density (yield). AUGC was calculated from the obtained growth curves of a 1000 min time interval following the end of lag phase. The end of the lag phase was identified according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Warringer and Blomberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Warringer et al., 2003</xref>). To eliminate potential within-plate effects that might cause measurement bias, relative fitness was normalized by the fitness of the neighboring reference wells that contained wild-type controls. For each line and each evolutionary time point, relative fitness was calculated as the median of the normalized AUGC of the technical replicates divided by the median fitness of the wild-type controls. At day 0, the technical replicate measurements of the isogenic, independently evolving lines were combined to calculate median fitness for the ancestral antibiotic-resistant strain, since at that time these populations had no independent evolutionary history. Stringent criteria were used to define the set of antibiotic-resistant strains with a substantial fitness defect: significance was determined by the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Significance of fitness increase for the evolving lines derived from antibiotic-resistant strains having initial fitness defect was also calculated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. All tests were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR-corrected <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05).</p><p>As expected, fitness estimated by AUGC showed a significant positive correlation with fitness estimated by growth rate (Pearson’s correlation, r = 0.41, p&lt;2.2e-16) or yield (Pearson’s correlation, r = 0.78, p&lt;2.2e-16). Additionally, we found that AUGC is more robust than yield, that is it shows less variation across biological replicates (median CVs values for AUGC and yield are 8.3% and 14.1%, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)</title><p>Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using standard E-test strips (bioMérieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, overnight cultures of bacteria were diluted to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.6. 100 μl of the diluted inoculum was spread on each MS agar plate and the plates were incubated at 30°C for 24–48 hr. MICs were read directly from the E-test strips according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Based on the MIC results, we categorized each strain as being resistant (R), intermediate (IM) or susceptible (S) to each investigated antibiotic according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI Approved Standard M100, 29th Edition) guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hoechst 33342 (Bisbenzimide H 33342) accumulation assay</title><p>To estimate changes in membrane permeability and efflux pump activity, we implemented a scalable fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coldham et al., 2010</xref>). This method is based on the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent probe Hoechst 33342 (Bisbenzimide H 33342, Sigma-Aldrich). Strains were cultured in eight biological replicates overnight at 30°C and stationary phase cultures were regrown in fresh medium to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.6 at 30°C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g and resuspended in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of all suspensions was adjusted to 0.1, and 0.18 mL of each suspension was transferred to 96-well plates (CellCarrier-96 Black Optically Clear Bottom, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were incubated in a Synergy two microplate reader at 30°C, and 25 μM Hoechst 33342 was added to each well. The wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 BW25113 treated with an efflux inhibitor agent (carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, CCCP, Life Technologies) served as a positive control. The OD<sub>600</sub> and fluorescence curves were recorded for 1 hr with 75 s delays between readings. Fluorescence was read from the top of the wells using excitation and emission filters of 355 and 460 nm, respectively. The first 15 min were excluded from further analysis due to the high standard deviation between replicates. Blank normalized OD<sub>600</sub> values were calibrated by applying the following transformation: OD<sub>calibrated</sub> = OD<sub>600</sub>+0.49312 * OD<sub>600</sub><sup>3</sup>. Data curves were smoothed and fluorescence per OD<sub>600</sub> ratio curves was calculated. Finally, areas under these ratio curves were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Allelic replacements</title><p>Utilizing multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nyerges et al., 2016</xref>) we reconstructed two candidate T60 compensatory mutations and the corresponding T0 resistance mutations in the wild-type genetic background (separately and in combination as well), as well as the compensatory mutations in the corresponding initial antibiotic-resistant strains.</p><p>Each MAGE cycle consisted of the following steps: Upon reaching OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4–0.6, cells were transferred to a 42°C shaking water bath to induce λ-Red protein expression for 15 min at 250 rpm. Cells were then immediately chilled on ice for at least 10 min. Electrocompetent cells were made by washing and pelleting the cells twice in 10 mL of ice-cold dH<sub>2</sub>O. 40 μL cell suspension was mixed with 1 μL of 100 μM oligonucleotide. Electroporation was done on a BTX (Harvard Apparatus) CM-630 Exponential Decay Wave Electroporation System in 1 mm gap VWR Signature Electroporation cuvettes (1.8 kV, 200 Ω, 25 μF). Immediately after electroporation, 1 mL TB + 2 ml LB medium was added onto the cells to allow recovery. The 100,000 diluted cells were spread onto solid medium and incubated at 30°C for 24 hr. Allelic replacement frequencies for all strains were measured at each locus by allele-specific PCR. Selected clones carrying the desired modifications were verified by capillary sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Whole-genome sequencing</title><p>To identify potential compensatory mechanisms, 15 T60 adapted lines derived from a total of 10 antibiotic-resistant T0 strains were chosen for whole-genome sequencing. These T60 lines were chosen to represent diverse patterns of resistance loss, as well as to cover T0 strains adapted to a variety of antibiotics. <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA was prepared with GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR assay in a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). 200 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented in a Covaris M220 focused-ultrasonicator (peak power: 55W, duty factor: 20%, 200 cycles/burst, uration: 45 s) using Covaris AFA screw cap fiber microTUBEs. Fragment size distribution was analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit in a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent) and then indexed sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq Nano DNA LT kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. This, in short, includes end repair of DNA fragments, fragment size selection, ligation of indexed adapters and library enrichment with limited-cycle PCR. Sequencing libraries were validated (library-sizes determined) using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit in a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument, then quantified using qPCR based NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) with a Piko-Real Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and diluted to 4 nM concentration. Groups of 12 indexed libraries were pooled, denatured with 0.1 N NaOH, and after dilution loaded in a MiSeq Reagent kit V2-500 (Illumina) at 8 pM concentration. 2 × 250 bp pair-end sequencing was done with an Illumina MiSeq sequencer, primary sequence analysis was done on BaseSpace cloud computing environment with GenerateFASTQ 2.20.2 workflow.</p><p>Paired-end sequencing data were exported in FASTQ file format. The reads were trimmed using Trim Galore (Babraham Bioinformatics) and cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove adapters and bases where the PHRED quality value was less than 20.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors examine the loss of antibiotic resistance after the termination of experimental evolution that lead to adaptation and increased antibiotic resistance. They examine the cost of resistance and the role of compensatory mutations (or reversions) in alleviating this cost. The three reviewers appreciated the quality of the work and its general interest, but they raised a number of major concerns that can be addressed by modifying the text, reanalyzing some of the results and potentially adding relatively minor experiments. Some of these major concerns relate to the descriptive and qualitative nature of some of the analyses shown that are critical to supporting the conclusions of the study. Others relate to the quality of the presentation and of the discussion of the results as they relate to previous work or to the limitation of the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is generally well written and referenced satisfyingly. However, the introduction is somewhat lagging behind the rest of the text. Claims in the introduction are not always supported by appropriate citations and quality of the writing could be improved in this section. The authors are referred to some specific comments below for examples of elements of the introduction that could be improved. For instance, the introduction describes an important issue related to the fitness cost of antimicrobial resistance, which is the disconnect between the results of experimental evolution studies and clinical observations. Whether resistance to antimicrobials really does carry a fitness cost, and whether it may or may not be maintained in populations of pathogens thanks to compensatory evolution is indeed controversial, and contradictory evidence currently prevents a definitive answer to this question. This manuscript does not directly address this issue, yet the introduction would suggest otherwise. The authors are invited to revise the introduction to better expose the focus and scope of the study.</p><p>2) Results on the loss of resistance appear overly qualitative, at least in the format used in Figure 3 and in the text (subsection “Rapid loss of multi-drug resistance in an antibiotic-free medium”). We believe a synthetic quantitative analysis may be applied to the results provided in Supplementary file 3 and presented in a visually compelling manner. A quantitative measure of loss in resistance and its causal link or not with loss of cost would be more convincing, and would help readers grasp the magnitude of this phenotypic change. The authors already have MIC data: it is just a matter of using it in a transparent data visualization format, which may still use the qualitative categories, but perhaps as an added layer on top of the quantitative data, rather than as the sole reported measure.</p><p>3) As presented, the results suggest association between fitness recovery and resistance loss. The manuscript would be enhanced by a more formal statistical analysis of this association.</p><p>4) The Discussion section provides a list of evidence that the authors claim supports a driving role for compensatory evolution in adaptation to the antibiotic-free environment. We think that 2 out of the 3 evidences mentioned does not support that claim. The first reads: &quot;First, our analysis has revealed major differences in relative fitness across strains adapted to different antibiotics.&quot; We fail to see how differences in fitness between strains supports any role for compensatory evolution. It rather suggests a diversity of molecular mechanisms, which may or may not involve compensation. In other words, this phenomenon appears unrelated to compensation. The next claim which we believe is not supported by the stated evidence is the following: &quot;Third, an in-depth genetic analysis has demonstrated that mutations in marR and envZ increased fitness in the respective antibiotic-resistant strain, but reduced fitness in the wild-type&quot;. This is evidence for epistasis, but not for compensation per se.</p><p>5) In comparison to the extensive analysis done in Lazar Nat Communications 2014, I would have preferred a similar detailed analysis of the evolutionary experiments in this follow-up work. The broad conclusions are expected, but there are insights which this work could uniquely address. For one, it is interesting to know how the fitness cost and resistance level vary with generation-while there is a broad phenotypic reversion of fitness cost, does this happen early on the evolution, does this reversion occur at the same time that resistance is reacquired (or not)? Additionally, what is the reproducibility/repeatability of these time courses across the replicates?</p><p>6) I am curious to know when the mutations found at the end of the experiment (listed in Supplementary file 4) occurred during the lab evolution. Moreover, do the occurrence of specific mutations correlate with the time-changes of fitness cost and resistance level throughout the evolution? This is particularly crucial because there are multiple mutations at the end of the lab evolution and correlating these with fitness cost and resistance level could determine causality and epistasis between mutations.</p><p>7) Why do many of the T60 lines have worse fitness after evolution in antibiotic-free medium? One would expect the fitness to at least stay the same or improve.</p><p>8) Subsection “Laboratory evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains in an antibiotic-free medium”: &quot;adaptation is mainly driven by the set of resistance mutations present in the T0 strains.&quot; Isn't it also possible that mutations are stochastic, and some populations would have higher fitness by chance alone?</p><p>9) Figure 3 and subsection “Rapid loss of multi-drug resistance in an antibiotic-free medium”: Are these differences in ratios statistically significant?</p><p>10) Subsection “Compensatory mutations rather than reversions dominate”: &quot;identify resistance-conferring SNPs in the T0 population that revert back&quot;. What is the likelihood of the exact mutation occurring and invading the population? I would guess this is very low, so searching for the exact mutation would not be a fruitful exercise. How about other mutations in the same genes as those where alterations conferred resistance? The analysis of compensatory mutations reveal that they are located elsewhere in the genome, i.e. not in the resistance genes themselves. This analysis appears superficial. Are these genes somehow functionally related? Part of the same modules? Related by genetic or other types of interactions?</p><p>11) Is there any direct evidence that resistance in the clinic comes at a major fitness cost? Also, the role of HGT is not mentioned, although this is a common means of low-cost resistance. Discussion section: The comparison to clinical restriction is problematic for a few reasons. (1) The clinic has an ecological component where the sensitive strain may still persist and invade the resistant strain once antibiotic selection pressure is ceased. (2) Countries are not isolated, so it is unclear that restriction in one place would eliminate pressure on the population as a whole. (3) Many antibiotic adaptations impart cross-resistance, so continued use of other antibiotics may diminish the effect of restricting another.</p><p>12) Parallel evolution of the wild type would have provided a useful control to distinguish the change in fitness specifically associated with antibiotic resistance phenotypes from general adaptation to the physicochemical environment of the experiment. Continued propagation in presence of antibiotic would also have provided a useful point of comparison. While these data would have enhanced the manuscript, in their absence, a discussion of expected results from these controls may add depth and perspective to the text.</p><p>13) The authors should clarify the caveats and limitations of the study. For example, the results here strongly depend on the fitness cost of resistant mutants acquired from previous evolution in strong selection regime (high antibiotic concentration and large population size) (Lazar Nat Communications 2014). Presumably, the trade-off between resistance level and fitness cost will be different in the low-selection regime and sub-inhibitory concentrations. Thus, the finding of rapid loss of fitness cost may not apply to resistance-conferring mutations evolved under this regime.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47088.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is generally well written and referenced satisfyingly.

The second option is more realistic, as several mutations that had accumulated during laboratory evolution affected genes involved in bacterial defense mechanisms against antibiotics or in general stress-responses (e.g. rpoS promoter region/nlpD gene (Stoebel et al., 2009), potD (Shah et al., 2011), soxSR (Jain and Saini, 2016) (Supplementary file 4). An in-depth genetic analysis has also demonstrated epistatic interactions between resistance and putative compensatory mutations in marR and envZ. These mutations had accumulated during laboratory evolution and increased fitness in the respective antibiotic-resistant strain, but reduced fitness in the wild-type (Figure 5A and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In comparison to the extensive analysis done in Lazar Nat Communications 2014, I would have preferred a similar detailed analysis of the evolutionary experiments in this follow-up work.

Due to a strict deadline on submission of the revised manuscript, we focused on four randomly selected lineages only (CIP5a, DOX3a, TMP9e and TOB9e) and measured resistance levels and fitness at three timepoints: the beginning of, the midpoint and the end of the course of laboratory evolution. We found that at certain time points, decline in resistance and fitness recovery are coupled to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, what is the reproducibility/repeatability of these time courses across the replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the fitness improvements between T60 evolved lines founded from the same T0 genotype versus those founded from different genotypes.

First, the timescale of laboratory evolution was too limited for fixation of neutral mutations driven by stochastic changes in gene frequencies. Second, the accumulated mutations were far from being random: the corresponding genes are mainly involved in bacterial defense mechanisms against antibiotics or in general stress-responses. Finally, reconstruction of putative compensatory mutations increased fitness in a genotype specific manner, see main text Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 3 and subsection “Rapid loss of multi-drug resistance in an antibiotic-free medium”: Are these differences in ratios statistically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, they are. We inserted this result into the corresponding figure legend (Figure 3B):</p><p>“Figure 3C and 3D show the number of T60 lines with resistance maintained/lost to the range of antibiotics tested, as absolute number versus ratio, respectively. Doxycycline (DOX) and tetracycline (TET) resistance was frequently lost (Fisher’s Exact test: odds ratio = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001 for DOX and odds ratio = 0.20, p &lt; 0.01 for TET), while aminoglycoside (kanamycin – KAN, tetracycline – TET) resistance was generally maintained in the T60 lines (Fisher’s Exact test: odds ratio = 14.29, p &lt; 0.001 for KAN, odds ratio = 6.5, p &lt; 0.01 for TOB).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Compensatory mutations rather than reversions dominate”: &quot;identify resistance-conferring SNPs in the T0 population that revert back&quot;. What is the likelihood of the exact mutation occurring and invading the population? I would guess this is very low, so searching for the exact mutation would not be a fruitful exercise. How about other mutations in the same genes as those where alterations conferred resistance? The analysis of compensatory mutations reveal that they are located elsewhere in the genome, i.e. not in the resistance genes themselves. This analysis appears superficial. Are these genes somehow functionally related? Part of the same modules? Related by genetic or other types of interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the low number of mutations that have accumulated during the course of laboratory evolution, we could not perform a rigorous statistical analysis to test this issue. Nevertheless, we provide several examples on functional relatedness between resistance genes mutated in T0 and genes mutated during lab evolution (i.e. found in T60 strains only, Figure 5—figure supplement 1.).</p><p>ompR-EnvZ (FOX8b): A cefoxitin-resistant T0 line carries a resistance-conferring mutation in the transcriptional regulatory protein OmpR. OmpR modulates the expression of major outer membrane protein genes, and forms a two-component regulatory system with the sensory histidine kinase EnvZ, a protein mutated in the corresponding T60 line.</p><p>PhoQ/SoxR – PhoP/SoxS (TMP9c): A trimetoprim-resistant T0 lines carries a mutation in the sensory histidine kinase PhoQ and the redox‑sensitive transcriptional activator SoxR, whereas the T60 line carried compensatory mutations in genes <italic>phoP</italic> (response regulator in two‑component regulatory system with PhoQ) and <italic>soxS</italic> (superoxide response regulon transcriptional activator).</p><p>AcrR-MarR (CIP5a): Mutation in the transcriptional repressor AcrR most likely confers ciprofloxacin-resistance in T0 through activating the AcrA/AcrB/TolC multidrug-efflux system, while a compensatory mutation appeared in MarR, that controls the activity of the <italic>mar</italic> regulon. The <italic>mar</italic> regulon is responsible for regulatingseveral genes involved in antibiotic-resistance, including those that encode components of the AcrA/AcrB/TolC multidrug-efflux system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Is there any direct evidence that resistance in the clinic comes at a major fitness cost?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there is some prior data supporting these claims, and we cite the relevant publications in the main text, such as: Prabh et al., 2018 and Alzigat et al., 2017</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the role of HGT is not mentioned, although this is a common means of low-cost resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We briefly mention HGT in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Finally, our study has focused on chromosomal resistance mutations. It is still unclear whether resistance-conferring plasmids are generally lost or the associated fitness costs are mitigated by genomic mutations (Dahlberg and Chao, 2003).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: The comparison to clinical restriction is problematic for a few reasons. (1) The clinic has an ecological component where the sensitive strain may still persist and invade the resistant strain once antibiotic selection pressure is ceased. (2) Countries are not isolated, so it is unclear that restriction in one place would eliminate pressure on the population as a whole. (3) Many antibiotic adaptations impart cross-resistance, so continued use of other antibiotics may diminish the effect of restricting another.</p></disp-quote><p>We readily admit these caveats. As regards (1), we write in the Introduction:</p><p>“This disagreement between clinical observations and laboratory studies could have multiple reasons. First, antibiotic treatments frequently fail to completely eradicate antibiotic-sensitive bacteria from the population. Following treatment, antibiotic sensitive bacteria with high fitness could rapidly spread in the population, leading to rapid loss of resistance.”</p><p>As regards 2) and 3), we write in the Discussion section:</p><p>“These considerations must be taken with some caution, as comparison of clinical and laboratory data is not straightforward. For instance, restricted usage of certain antibiotics in hospitals cannot completely eliminate antibiotic selection in a given region due to lack of isolation and cross-resistance between antibiotics.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Parallel evolution of the wild type would have provided a useful control to distinguish the change in fitness specifically associated with antibiotic resistance phenotypes from general adaptation to the physicochemical environment of the experiment. Continued propagation in presence of antibiotic would also have provided a useful point of comparison. While these data would have enhanced the manuscript, in their absence, a discussion of expected results from these controls may add depth and perspective to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we addressed this issue as follows:</p><p>“Fitness may increase during the course of laboratory evolution as a result of general adaptation to the environment and/or accumulation of compensatory mutations that mitigate the deleterious side effects of resistance. The second option is more realistic, as several mutations that had accumulated during laboratory evolution affect genes involved in antibiotic or general stress response (e.g. rpoS promoter region/nlpD gene (Stoebel et al., 2009), potD (Shah et al., 2011), soxSR (Jain and Saini, 2016) (Supplementary file 4). An in-depth genetic analysis has also demonstrated epistatic interactions between resistance- and putative compensatory mutations in marR and envZ. These mutations had accumulated during laboratory evolution and increased fitness in the respective antibiotic-resistant strain, but reduced fitness in the wild-type (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors should clarify the caveats and limitations of the study. For example, the results here strongly depend on the fitness cost of resistant mutants acquired from previous evolution in strong selection regime (high antibiotic concentration and large population size) (Lazar Nat Communications 2014). Presumably, the trade-off between resistance level and fitness cost will be different in the low-selection regime and sub-inhibitory concentrations. Thus, the finding of rapid loss of fitness cost may not apply to resistance-conferring mutations evolved under this regime.</p></disp-quote><p>We describe the caveats of our work in more detail, as follows:</p><p>“We should also emphasize, however, that all our evolutionary experiments were performed in devoid of any antibiotics. The next logical step is to study the occurrence of phenotypic reversion during exposure to temporarily changing antibiotic treatments or sublethal antibiotic dosages as it may occur in real-life situations (Andersson and Hughes, 2014). Our study leaves open the question about the extent by which initial fitness costs of resistance mutations and/or intensity of antibiotic selection shapes subsequent compensatory evolution and associated loss of resistance. Finally, our study has focused on chromosomal resistance mutations. It is still unclear whether resistance-conferring plasmids are generally lost or the associated fitness costs are mitigated by genomic mutations (Dahlberg and Chao, 2003).</p></body></sub-article></article>
