protein-protein interactions (PPIs) into stable expression of a reporter gene are useful for genetic selections, high-throughput screening, and multiplexing with omics technologies. We previously reported SPARK (Kim et al., 2017), a transcription factor that is activated by the coincidence of blue light and a PPI. Here, we report an improved, second-generation SPARK2 that incorporates a luciferase moiety to control the light-sensitive LOV domain. SPARK2 can be temporally gated by either external light or addition of a small-molecule luciferin, which causes luciferase to open LOV via proximity-dependent BRET. Furthermore, the nested ‘AND’ gate design of SPARK2—in which both protease recruitment to the membrane-anchored transcription factor and LOV domain opening are regulated by the PPI of interest—yields a lower-background system and improved PPI specificity. We apply SPARK2 to high-throughput screening for GPCR agonists and for the detection of trans-cellular contacts, all with versatile transcriptional readout.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human embryonic kidneys 293 cells</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>luciferase</kwd><kwd>BRET</kwd><kwd>LOV domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Walter V. and Idun Berry Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Christina K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ Biohub Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SPARK2 allows a transcriptional readout of inter- and intracellular protein-protein interactions, with near-zero background, by employing proximity-dependent luciferase-LOV regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central to every biological signaling pathway, there has been keen interest in developing ever-more specific, sensitive, and versatile reporters for detecting them in living cells. In general, existing tools to detect PPIs fall into two broad categories: real-time reporters such as those based on FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Truong and Ikura, 2001</xref>) or protein complementation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerppola, 2006</xref>), and transcriptional reporters such as yeast two-hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller and Stagljar, 2004</xref>) and TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>). The two categories are complementary in that the former reads out PPI dynamics, while the latter provides a stable ‘memory’ of a previous PPI that can be used for cell-based selections or high-throughput screening. We previously reported ‘SPARK’, for ‘Specific Protein Association tool giving transcriptional Readout with rapid Kinetics’, a transcriptional PPI reporter that improves upon yeast two-hybrid and TANGO designs by incorporating light-gating. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, transcriptional activation requires <italic>both</italic> a PPI event and the presence of blue light. Not only does the light-gating dramatically reduce the background of the system, but it also enables temporal specificity because the user can sync the light window to the biological time period of interest (e.g. just before or just after addition of a drug). Instead of integrating PPI events over many hours or days, as yeast two-hybrid and TANGO do, SPARK integrates PPI events over just a 5 min user-selected time window determined by exogenous blue light delivery.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43826.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Motivation and design for SPARK2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Logic diagram for single ‘AND’ gate used in first-generation SPARK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Transcription of the reporter gene requires both light (to open the LOV domain) AND a protein-protein interaction (PPI). (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of SPARK1. Protein A is fused to the LOV domain, protease cleavage site (TEVcs), and transcription factor (TF, Gal4). Protein B is fused to a low-affinity variant of the protease TEVp. In the absence of an interaction between proteins A and B, TEVp recognition of and binding to TEVcs is minimal. Furthermore in the absence of light, the LOV domain cages the TEVcs, protecting it from spurious cleavage by the TEVp. If both light and an A-B interaction are present, then TEVp is recruited to the exposed TEVcs, resulting in the release of the TF Gal4 to the nucleus where it can drive expression of an exogenous reporter gene. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic of PPI-independent background at high SPARK1 expression levels. If protein B-TEVp levels are sufficiently high, TEVp cleavage of the TEVcs could occur even in the absence of protein A-protein B interaction, when light is present. (<bold>D</bold>) Logic diagram for nested ‘AND’ gate used in second-generation SPARK2. Both TEVp recruitment to TEVcs <italic>and</italic> LOV domain opening (via Luciferase-LOV BRET) require a PPI. This double filter for PPI increases the specificity of SPARK2 for the PPI of interest and reduces PPI-independent background. (<bold>E</bold>) Schematic of SPARK2. A blue light-emitting luciferase is fused to protein B and TEVp. Instead of externally supplied light, the luciferase’s substrate luciferin is supplied as a small-molecule drug. When there is an A-B interaction and luciferin is present, the luciferase activates the LOV domain via BRET, allowing the TEVp to cleave the now-accessible TEVcs. (<bold>F</bold>) Schematic of the reduction in background signal in the Luciferin/No PPI condition with SPARK2. Even if the luciferase-arrestin-TEVp is expressed at higher levels, TEVp cleavage of the TEVcs does not occur in the Luciferin/no PPI condition, as the LOV domain remains caged.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43826-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In working with first-generation SPARK (SPARK1), however, we noticed two limitations. The first is that, due to its intermolecular design, SPARK1 performance is highly expression-level dependent. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, protein A-protein B interaction drives together the low-affinity tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) and its recognition sequence (TEVcs), leading to cleavage and transcription factor (TF) release when light is also present. When SPARK1 components are expressed at high levels, however, TEVp interaction with TEVcs becomes proximity-<italic>in</italic>dependent, that is there is significant cleavage and TF release even when A-B interaction does <italic>not</italic> occur (likely because SPARK1 component levels exceed or are close to the TEVp-TEVcs K<sub>m</sub> which is estimated to be ~450 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapust et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kapust et al., 2002</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our practical observation is that SPARK1 performance is best when the components are expressed stably or via viral transduction. Transient transfection methods such as lipofectamine or PEI result in higher expression levels and consequently high background. This reduction in specificity limits the robustness and therefore utility of the tool.</p><p>The second limitation is that light delivery presents a technical challenge, particularly for high-throughput screens, as many robotic platforms are not equipped to dark-cage, deliver light, and then dark-cage again multiwell plates at specified timepoints. Instead, these devices are optimized for liquid handling, that is delivery of compounds to multiwell plates is much more straightforward than controlled delivery of light.</p><p>To address both these challenges, we have developed second-generation SPARK (SPARK2), which incorporates a luciferase to control the light, oxygen, and voltage sensitive (LOV) domain, most likely via a BRET-type mechanism (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Luciferases are enzymes that use O<sub>2</sub> and a small molecule ‘luciferin’ substrate to catalyze the generation of light. First, by utilizing a luciferase, we find that it is possible to time-gate SPARK by <italic>either</italic> luciferin addition or exogenous blue light delivery. This improves the versatility of the tool and makes it more compatible with high-throughput screening platforms. Second, because we found that luciferase-LOV BRET is strongly proximity-dependent, we made LOV domain uncaging also dependent on protein A-protein B interaction by fusing the luciferase to the protease of SPARK2, rather than directly to the LOV domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Whereas in SPARK1, only the TEVp recruitment to TEVcs was regulated by A-B interaction, now in SPARK2 the LOV domain is <italic>also</italic> regulated by A-B interaction. We find that this ‘double dependence’ on A-B interaction makes SPARK2 a much more specific reporter of cellular PPIs, even at high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We demonstrate the utility of SPARK2 on multiple G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), detecting their agonist-dependent activation and subsequent arrestin recruitment with signal to noise ratios as high as 20-fold. We then extend the SPARK2 design to detection of <italic>trans-</italic>cellular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of NanoLuc as the luciferase donor for LOV</title><p>First-generation SPARK1 incorporates an evolved photosensory domain from <italic>Avena sativa</italic> (asLOV2) to regulate access to the protease cleavage site (TEVcs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The LOV domain contains a flavin chromophore that covalently reacts with cysteine 450 upon irradiation with 450 nm blue light. This in turn drives a large conformational change of LOV’s C-terminal J-alpha helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harper et al., 2003</xref>), which can expose or conceal recognition sites, such as TEVcs.</p><p>A recent report describes that cell death can be mediated by the action of luciferase on the flavin-containing protein miniSOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Proshkina et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that luciferase-catalyzed uncaging of asLOV2 may also be possible. To explore this possibility, we considered the range of luciferases used for biological research; these include <italic>Vargula hilgendorfii</italic> (VLuc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson et al., 1989</xref>]), <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> (RLuc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matthews et al., 1977</xref>]), <italic>Gaussia princeps</italic> (GLuc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verhaegent and Christopoulos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Welsh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berglund et al., 2013</xref>]), and <italic>Oplophorus gracilirostris</italic> (NanoLuc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stacer et al., 2013</xref>]). Whereas VLuc requires ATP to produce bioluminescence, limiting it to intracellular use, the others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tung et al., 2016</xref>). Among the ATP-independent variants, NanoLuc has been characterized as one of the brightest-emitting luciferase variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">England et al., 2016</xref>), and its emission wavelength (450 nm) overlaps with the activation spectrum of LOV. NanoLuc’s small size (19 kDa) also reduces potential steric problems when fused to other proteins, and its substrate, furimazine, exhibits greater stability than the coelenterazine analogues used for RLuc, GLuc, and sbLuc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, we selected NanoLuc as our luciferase donor to LOV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NanoLuc-LOV BRET is efficient and proximity-dependent</title><p>To determine whether NanoLuc is able to activate the LOV domain, we first used the LOVTRAP assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) in combination with a simple imaging-based readout. In LOVTRAP, an engineered peptide Zdk1 binds to the C-terminus of the LOV domain in the dark. Upon blue light irradiation and LOV conformational change, the Zdk1 peptide diffuses away from the LOV domain. The system is reversible, such that termination of blue light results in Zdk1 rebinding to LOV. We fused NanoLuc between β2AR and LOV (β2AR-NanoLuc-LOV) and expressed the construct in HEK293T cells together with an mCherry-Zdk1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At baseline in the dark, we observed mCherry localization at the cell membrane, but in response to brief exposure to NanoLuc’s substrate, furimazine (10 µM for 1 min), or to blue light (10 s), the mCherry rapidly relocalized into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Cytosolic mCherry fluorescence was quantified as the average fluorescence 0.5 to 1.5 µm adjacent to the membrane (dashed boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed comparable amounts of mCherry relocalization to cytosol between furimazine and blue light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the NanoLuc-LOV activation was as efficient as exogenous blue light-LOV activation for releasing Zdk1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43826.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Efficient and proximity-dependent NanoLuc-LOV BRET detected using LOVTRAP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of NanoLuc fused to membrane-localized protein β2AR and asLOV2 in LOVTRAP. When asLOV2 is activated by NanoLuc (or blue light), mCherry-Zdk1 dissociates from the C-terminus of asLOV2.

However, the extracellular fusion construct did not release mCherry-Zdk1 from the membrane in response to furimazine. Subsequent blue light delivered to the same cell resulted in the release of mCherry-Zdk1, indicating the LOVTRAP construct was functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). To confirm that this difference was not due to higher expression levels of the intracellular NanoLuc versus extracellular NanoLuc fusions, we measured robust NanoLuc bioluminescence emission from both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). From this experiment, we conclude that NanoLuc activation of LOV is proximity-dependent, as moving NanoLuc only ~5 nm away from LOV prevents its activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NanoLuc integration into SPARK2</title><p>SPARK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) is an ‘AND’ logic gate transcription factor, which detects the coincidence of both a PPI and externally delivered blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this tool, protein A is fused to an evolved LOV domain (eLOV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), a protease cleavage sequence (TEVcs: ENLYFQM), and a transcription factor (e.g., Gal4). eLOV’s alpha helical C-terminus cages the fused TEVcs in the dark, preventing steric access and reducing background cleavage. The other component of SPARK1 is a low affinity protease (TEVp) fused to protein B.

We started with the SPARK1 constructs that have previously been used to detect the PPI between the GPCR beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and its cytosolic effector arrestin; this interaction can be stimulated with the β2AR agonist isoetharine. We fused NanoLuc to arrestin-TEVp and co-expressed this construct in HEK293T cells along with β2AR-eLOV-TEVcs-Gal4 and the reporter gene UAS-Citrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In SPARK1 (and in SPARK2 under light control), TEVp recruitment to TEVcs depends on protein A-protein B interaction, but LOV-TEVcs uncaging depends only on exogenous blue light. Thus, during the time period that LOV is open, even in the absence of an A-B interaction, TEVp may interact with TEVcs (if expression levels approach the TEVp-TEVcs K<sub>m</sub>). This source of background should be eliminated when using luciferin-gated SPARK2, as LOV-TEVcs uncaging is regulated by NanoLuc in a fashion that depends on A-B interaction. In this case, transient interactions between TEVp and TEVcs at high SPARK2 expression levels may not be adequate to produce TEVcs cleavage and TF release.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we repeated the SPARK2 experiment for β2AR/arrestin in HEK293T cells, comparing furimazine- and light-gating by microscopy and single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The highest Citrine/HA intensity ratios were observed with external blue light and isoetharine (+light/PPI condition); however, we measured substantial background when light was delivered but isoetharine was omitted (+light/no PPI condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the other hand, when we used luciferin (furimazine) to uncage the LOV domain instead of external blue light, we found that background Citrine signal was eliminated (no Citrine expression in the +luciferin/no PPI condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We could still observe robust Citrine/HA intensity ratios when using luciferin and isoetharine (+luciferin/PPI condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

We conclude that luciferin-gating of SPARK2 produces higher PPI-specificity than light-gating, due to the incorporation of a PPI-dependent BRET mechanism for LOV domain control that eliminates PPI-independent background.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Intermolecular BRET through a nested ‘AND’ gate is essential for improved specificity</title><p>In SPARK2, a nested ‘AND’ gate is achieved by fusing NanoLuc to the arrestin-TEVp – meaning that first, both the furimazine and the PPI are required for the LOV domain to be uncaged, and then both the LOV domain uncaging and the PPI are required for the TEVcs cleavage. If NanoLuc were installed in SPARK2 directly adjacent to LOV rather than on the TEVp construct, then we would not expect an improvement in specificity in the +furimazine/-PPI condition compared to the intermolecular BRET design of SPARK 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Intramolecular furimazine uncaging of LOV should still occur, but as it now only requires the presence of luciferin but not A-B interaction, the TF activation would no longer have a ‘nested’ dependence on the PPI. We tested this concept by generating a modified β2AR-NanoLuc-LOV-TEVcs-Gal4 fusion construct, which when co-expressed with arrestin-TEVp, employs only a single ‘AND’ gate relying on furimazine and a PPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Compared to the nested ‘AND’ gate design of SPARK2, the single ‘AND’ gate design resulted in high background in the +furimazine/-PPI condition, comparable to the background observed with +light/-PPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). Importantly with 5 min of blue light, the NanoLuc-LOV fusion construct produced a similar ±PPI signal ratio as light-gating with SPARK2, suggesting that there is no steric hindrance due to the fusion of NanoLuc to LOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Second, to activate oβ2AR across cell-cell junctions, we would utilize a second copy of the luciferase NanoLuc on the ‘sender’ cells. With this design, addition of furimazine to cells would be expected to (1) turn on oβ2AR <italic>selectively</italic> at cell-cell junctions that are positive for NanoLuc sender and oβ2AR receiver, and (2) enable NanoLuc-arrestin-TEVp recruited to activated oβ2AR to open the LOV domain and permit cleavage and release of the TF. Reporter gene expression should then be observed specifically in ‘receiver’ cells in contact with NanoLuc-expressing ‘sender’ cells.</p><p>For this system to work, oβ2AR (a chimera between bovine rhodopsin and β2AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airan et al., 2009</xref>)) must recruit NanoLuc-arrestin-TEVp upon activation, and NanoLuc must be able to activate oβ2AR in place of blue light. While <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase has previously been fused to the N-terminus of channelrhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berglund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berglund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2017</xref>) to regulate their activity in vivo (‘luminopsins’), luciferases have not previously been shown to turn on light-sensitive GPCR chimeras such as oβ2AR. Furthermore, proximity-dependent intermolecular luciferase regulation of retinal-binding proteins has also not been previously demonstrated.</p><p>To explore this extension of SPARK2, we started by creating an oβ2AR SPARK2 construct with NanoLuc fused directly to its N-terminus. HEK293T cells expressing this construct along with NanoLuc-arrestin-TEVp and UAS-Citrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were incubated with the co-factor 9-cis-retinal (9cr), as HEK293T do not naturally produce 9cr. As a positive control, we delivered 15 min of blue light to both uncage the eLOV domain and activate oβ2AR. We observed significantly more Citrine-positive cells in the +light/+9cr condition than in the +light/−9cr condition, indicating that the oβ2AR is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In a separate experimental condition, we delivered 30 min of furimazine and 9cr and observed significantly more Citrine-positive cells compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). These results suggest that both extracellular NanoLuc-oβ2AR BRET and intracellular NanoLuc-LOV BRET are occurring in the same cells, enabling TF release to produce reporter signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43826.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Detection of cell-cell contacts using NanoLuc-oβ2AR activation with SPARK2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an extracellular NanoLuc fused to oβ2AR-eLOV-TEVcs-Gal4, co-expressed with NanoLuc-arrestin-TEVp and UAS-Citrine.

Instead of fusing NanoLuc directly to the N-terminus of oβ2AR, we expressed NanoLuc on ‘Sender’ cells, and oβ2AR SPARK2 components separately in ‘Receiver’ cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. For display of NanoLuc on senders, we used the pre-synaptic adhesion protein neurexin as a scaffold, and the extracellular domain of ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talay et al., 2017</xref>) to extend NanoLuc further out from the cell surface. After separately transfecting the two HEK293T populations, we trypsinized the cells to lift them, and re-plated them together in the same dish at a 10:1 sender: receiver ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We exposed the co-plated cells to furimazine and 9cr for 20 min and observed Citrine-positive cells ~ 8 hr later. To positively identify Sender and Receiver cells, we immunostained for HA on the Neurexin-NanoLuc Sender construct and for Flag on the oβ2AR Receiver construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To quantify specificity, we counted the fraction of Citrine-positive Receiver cells that were contacting HA-positive Sender cells (87%; n = 43 cells from 26 FOVs). It is possible that the few Citrine + cells not in contact with NanoLuc +Senders were previously in contact, but the Senders were dislodged during the 8 hr incubation and washing period. To quantify Citrine expression in all Receiver cells, we calculated the ratio of Citrine fluorescence to Flag immunostain detecting the oβ2AR component. We observed a higher overall Citrine/Flag intensity ratio in the condition with furimazine and Sender NanoLuc compared to control conditions with furimazine omitted or Sender NanoLuc omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

These results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that SPARK2 can be combined with intercellular NanoLuc-oβ2AR BRET to enable luciferin-gated, bioluminescence-mediated transcriptional readout of cell-cell contacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Motivated by specificity and versatility limitations of our previously reported SPARK1 PPI detection tool, here we developed improved, second-generation SPARK2. SPARK2 employs a novel design not previously used for PPI detection. Via a single modification of SPARK1<bold>—</bold>addition of a luciferase moiety onto the protease component of SPARK<bold>—</bold>SPARK2 gains two new capabilities: the ability to toggle between light-gating and luciferin-gating for temporal specificity, and greatly reduced background leading to a more PPI-specific tool. We showed that SPARK2 could be used to detect transient arrestin recruitment to several activated GPCRs, giving stable and versatile (Citrine, FLuc) reporter gene readout many hours later. Using luciferin-gating, we used SPARK2 for high-throughput compound screening against activation of two GPCRs. We also extended the SPARK2 design to detection of cell-cell contacts, employing trans-cellular luciferase activation of a GPCR-rhodopsin chimera.</p><p>At the heart of SPARK2 is a proximity-dependent interaction between the blue light-emitting luciferase NanoLuc and the blue-light absorbing photosensory domain LOV. Luciferases have been widely used for bioluminescence imaging in vivo, free from the constraint of excitation light delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tung et al., 2016</xref>). They have also been combined with fluorescent proteins for BRET-based shifting of emission wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2016</xref>), real-time detection of cellular PPIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamdan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfleger et al., 2006</xref>), and calcium sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have expanded the range of luciferase capabilities by fusing them to channelrhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berglund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2017</xref>) and miniSOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Proshkina et al., 2018</xref>), to confer luciferin-control of membrane depolarization and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation, respectively. Here, we continue the trend by showing that luciferase can also regulate the activity of LOV domains. We further demonstrate that such regulation is proximity-dependent, both in the context of LOVTRAP and SPARK2. LOV domains form the basis of a wide-range of optogenetic tools, including LOVTRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), TULIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>), iLID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>), miniSOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shu et al., 2011</xref>), BLINK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberio et al., 2018</xref>), and Magnets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>). It seems likely that if these tools were to also incorporate NanoLuc, this would enable users to toggle between light control and luciferin control, as we do for SPARK2. Furthermore, because we have shown that luciferase-LOV regulation is proximity-dependent, one could envision tool variants in which LOV-mediated functions (PPI induction, protein inactivation/activation, channel opening, etc.) are conditional upon PPIs or subcellular localization events designed by the user. Finally, we note that luciferase regulation is likely to extend beyond LOVs. Cryptochromes (e.g. CRY-CIBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>)) also contain blue-light excitable flavin cofactors, and we showed here that luciferase can also regulate oβ2AR, a retinal-containing blue-light activated GPCR-rhodopsin chimera.</p><p>Besides enabling SPARK2 toggling between light-gating and luciferin-gating, incorporation of NanoLuc onto the protease component of SPARK substantially reduced the PPI-independent background of the system. We rationalize this by the logic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, showing that both inputs into the committed step (TEVcs cleavage) – LOV opening and TEVp recruitment – require protein A-protein B interaction. This contrasts with the simpler logic diagram of SPARK1 (or in a version of SPARK where NanoLuc is directly fused to LOV), in which only TEVp recruitment depends on protein A-protein B interaction. A ‘double filter’ for the analyte of interest (in this case, a PPI) appears to improve the specificity of a reporter for that analyte. We envision that the ‘double filter’ or nested ‘AND’ gate concept could also be incorporated into a range of other reporter designs, particularly those with limited dynamic range. Interestingly, there are numerous examples of natural pathways that incorporate ‘double filters’ to increase specificity, such as tRNA synthetases that catalyze amino acid loading onto cognate tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fersht and Dingwall, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our trans-cellular SPARK2 demonstration adds to the wide array of existing methods for probing cell-cell contacts, including mGRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>), sHRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martell et al., 2016</xref>), LIPSTIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pasqual et al., 2018</xref>), synNotch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>), and trans-TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). While mGRASP, sHRP, and LIPSTIC enable highly sensitive detection, these tools generate signal in the intercellular space between contacting cell populations, and do not highlight or provide genetic access to the cells themselves, preventing further imaging, selection, characterization by RNA-seq, etc. synNotch and trans-TANGO, by contrast, activate transcription factors in contacting cell populations and thus provide more versatile readouts, but they lack temporal-gating which can contribute to high background, and they could potentially perturb normal physiology by introducing non-natural intercellular protein-protein interactions. Trans-cellular SPARK2 has complementary features to these existing methods, although further optimization and characterization are required to make it a broadly useful tool for the study of trans-cellular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (HEK293T)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td>Tested negative for mycoplasma.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-HA</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>C29F4</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Rabbit AlexaFluor 647</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>A27040</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse anti-Flag</td><td>Sigma</td><td>F3165</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Mouse AlexaFluor 568</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>A11004</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td/><td/><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for all plasmids used or generated in this study.</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>Nano-Glo Live Cell Assay System</td><td>Promega</td><td/><td>1:100 substrate</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System</td><td>Promega</td><td/><td>1:1 substrate</td></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>CellSegm toolbox</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hodneland et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>MATLAB R2017a</td><td>Mathworks</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs and cloning</title><p>Constructs used for transient expression in HEK293T cells were cloned into the pAAV viral vector, pC3 vector, or pLX208 vector. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> lists all 18 plasmids used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers feel that your methods development projects provide very useful tools for the investigation of protein-protein interactions and that your current methods development offers new and improved possibilities. However, after discussion of the reviews we feel that the improvement – while useful – is too incremental for a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular a direct comparison with the original method to show the improvement is missing. In addition, an exciting application of the new method that provides new insight into an important biological problem would also have been beneficial. The detailed reviews are attached below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Kim et al. describe a further development of their recently published SPARK method for the identification of protein-protein interactions. In the previous method they had used external light to trigger a conformational change that allows a protease to cleave off a linker to a transcriptional regulator. One problem so far was a relatively high noise level. The authors now show that by combining the protease with a luciferase cleavage only occurs when the protein protein interaction is active, reducing the background signal. They show several applications for their method including cell-cell contacts.</p><p>Overall this is an interesting and very useful further development of their older method that is well documented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors describe refinement of a previously described method (SPARK) to couple simultaneous light application and protein-protein interaction (PPI) to drive transcription. In this iteration, a luciferase domain is added, enabling both substitution of light application with luciferin application (if desired) and reduced background as a result of the steep distance dependence of BRET from the luciferase. They demonstrate that this system works in HEK cell cultures for multiple PPIs. They also show an application using BRET from the luciferase to β2AR to drive transcription as a result of cell-cell contact.</p><p>The instantiation of a nested molecular logic gate to decrease background is a creative work of protein engineering. The work appears to be carefully done and is presented clearly. My enthusiasm for this manuscript and tool is limited by the lack of functional demonstration beyond the reduced preparation of HEK cells in a dish. The complexity of the system (many protein domains/constructs, multiple gating mechanisms) makes it seem unlikely to me that this would be desirable for an in vitro high-throughput screening application. The temporal gating with light or luciferin suggests that the intended use would be intact in vivo preparations, but they don't show any data suggesting that in vivo use is possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Kim and coworkers details the generation and testing of &quot;SPARK2&quot;, a new tool for evaluating cellular protein/protein interactions (PPIs). Taking advantage of the light-dependent conformational changes of LOV domains (and a prior &quot;SPARK&quot; tool by the same group, here renamed &quot;SPARK1&quot;), the authors here develop a transcriptional reporter system which couples the PPI-dependent recruitment of a luciferase-protease fusion hybrid protein to its partner to the subsequent cleavage and release of a transcriptional activator. Of note, this iteration is substantially improved over the prior SPARK by using the luciferase-enabled BRET activation of LOV photochemistry vs. prior illumination-dependent triggering, both improving signal-to-noise and enabling use in HTS-type instrumentation without easy illumination capabilities. The authors exhibit these favorable characteristics in a variety of different formats, most impressively by facilitating the detection of intercellular contacts between a luciferase-tagged protein on one cell to an adjacent cell containing an engineered opto-triggered GPCR.</p><p>In aggregate, I find this manuscript to present some interesting improvements on the SPARK1 tool but with enough concerns to substantially lower my enthusiasm for publication here. Most fundamentally, the improvements here seem to be somewhat expected by a). Proshkina et al., 2018's report that NanoLuc is sufficient to activate LOV photochemistry within the LOV-derived miniSOG proteins and b). the common improvements in S/N expected from &quot;AND&quot; type gates widely in synthetic biology. Several number of points made throughout the manuscript are similarly quite expected (e.g. compatibility of NanoLuc and FLuc) or demonstrated multiple times (e.g. demonstrations that NanoLuc needs to be proximal to LOV domain). Finally, the surprising lack of a direct comparison between SPARK1 and SPARK2 and substantial number of minor technical points (described below) also contributed to concerns that readers would not have some important information presented to them needed to determine the relative utilities of these tools vs. existing alternatives. In aggregate, I suggest that these issues outweigh the strengths of the work to the point that publication elsewhere is recommended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43826.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The instantiation of a nested molecular logic gate to decrease background is a creative work of protein engineering.

Regarding the reviewer’s concern, we point out that there is a broad literature, and indeed entire fields of biology, dedicated to the detection of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human cell in vitro preparations. The are many advantages of performing these experiments in a dish rather than in vivo – less variability in expression levels of the tool, precise control over the timing and delivery of drugs inducing the PPI, and of course higher-throughput (demonstrated below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The complexity of the system (many protein domains/constructs, multiple gating mechanisms) makes it seem unlikely to me that this would be desirable for an in vitro high-throughput screening application.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the number of protein domains/constructs presents a general challenge for implementing SPARK, or other similar PPI-detection tools with the same number of protein fusion constructs (e.g., TANGO (Barnea et al., 2008), synNotch (Morsut et al., 2016)). Because it is difficult to control the relative expression ratios of these multiple constructs, we often observe high amounts of background reporter expression even in the absence of a true PPI using SPARK1. We find that the multiple gating mechanisms that we implemented with SPARK2 circumvent this problem rather than exacerbate it. Across multiple biological replications and different experimenters, we routinely find that SPARK2 results in no additional detectable background in the absence of a PPI. Because the assay is now so robust, we designed and executed a high-throughput drug screen for GPCR activation in order to demonstrate that our platform is desirable and easy to implement for in vitro screening applications. We observed robust detection of compounds that are known to activate β2AR and DRD1, in addition to unexpected compounds that were found to activate DRD1 (e.g. a known DRD2 antagonist, Haloperidol; Figure 4C-E). Furthermore, while we expected dopamine to activate β2AR as a partial agonist, instead we observed no SPARK2 activation, suggesting that dopamine could partially activate β2AR via an arrestin-independent mechanism. These results directly demonstrate the potential for new biological insight using SPARK2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The temporal gating with light or luciferin suggests that the intended use would be intact in vivo preparations, but they don't show any data suggesting that in vivo use is possible.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal gating with light or luciferin, rather than intended to enable intact in vivopreparations, is instead essential for lowering background expression to enable highly specific and sensitive detection of PPIs in vitro. While we demonstrated the necessity of temporal gating extensively in our original SPARK manuscript, given the structure of the Research Advance article, we did not go into detail about the utility of light-gating for in vitro PPI-detection. We have re-emphasized this point in the first paragraph of the Introduction, and explicitly direct the readers back to the original SPARK manuscript as well. We thank the reviewer for highlighting these important points that we have now addressed via new experiments and textual clarifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] In aggregate, I find this manuscript to present some interesting improvements on the SPARK1 tool but with enough concerns to substantially lower my enthusiasm for publication here. Most fundamentally, the improvements here seem to be somewhat expected by (a) Proshkina et al., 2018's report that NanoLuc is sufficient to activate LOV photochemistry within the LOV-derived miniSOG proteins and (b) the common improvements in S/N expected from &quot;AND&quot; type gates widely in synthetic biology.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your concerns. However, we respectfully object to the idea that the improvements enabled here were obvious, or even somewhat expected. We address both points (a) and (b) with our own experimental attempts to replicate the Proshkina et al., 2018 paper, and with a new experiment to illustrate the distinction between our nested “AND” gate design, and the traditional single “AND” gates commonly used in synthetic biology.</p><p>a) Proshkina et al., 2018, reports that NanoLuc-miniSOG BRET can induce phototoxicity and cell death via the production of reactive oxygen species. We agree with the reviewer that this study is relevant to ours, and have cited it prominently in the last paragraph of the subsection “Selection of NanoLuc as the luciferase donor for LOV”, and in the second paragraph of the Discussion. However, we do not agree that Proshkina et al., 2018, makes our results predictable or obvious. We are employing intermolecular, PPI-driven BRET between NanoLuc and LOV, rather than intramolecular BRET via direct NanoLuc-miniSOG fusion (which should be much more efficient). We are using a much more precise and molecularly specific readout of BRET (reporter gene transcription) than cell death. miniSOG and LOV domains have different action spectra and photophysical properties. For all these reasons, the Proshkina result does not guarantee that our SPARK2 design would be successful.</p><p>The second point concerns the robustness of the Proshkina et al. result, particularly for live-cell assays in HEK293T cells. We were concerned when we read that their experiment required treating NanoLuc-miniSOG-expressing cells with 43-75µM furimazine over 48 hours (by comparison, SPARK2 uses 10µM furimazine for 20 minutes). Hall et al., 2012 previously showed that furimazine concentrations must be kept to 10µM or less over 2 hours to be non-lethal to cells. The same first author of the Proshkina et al., 2018 paper published a different paper around the same time that documented furimazine-dependent toxicity in the same cell-line (SK-BR-3) used in their NanoLuc-miniSOG BRET photoxicity paper (Shipunova et al., 2018). They reported ~50% cell death in untransfected SK-BR-3 cells exposed to 20µg/mL of furimazine (52µM) for 48 hours. We attempted to reproduce their experiment ourselves in HEK293T cells, and found no difference in cell viability when comparing untransfected cells to NanoLuc-miniSOG-expressing cells, upon treatment with 75µM furimazine. Our inability to reproduce the key observation of the Proshkina paper (albeit in HEK rather than SK-BR-3 cells) further underscores that their study does not diminish the novelty of our work.</p><p>b) We agree with the reviewer that single “AND” gates commonly improve S/N in the field of synthetic biology. Indeed, this was the main point of our original SPARK1 publication (Kim et al., 2017), which implemented an “AND” gate using light + PPI to achieve improved S/N compared to its predecessor, TANGO (Barnea et al., 2008). However, the starting point for the present study was the observation that this simple “AND” gate design was not adequate for detecting cellular PPIs with high specificity across a range of conditions and expression levels (i.e., tool is not robust). This is why we moved on to design a different logic gate, one based on <italic>two</italic> nested “AND” gates.</p><p>We could have achieved an all-drug-gated version of SPARK by simply fusing NanoLuc directly to the LOV domain, rather than to the arrestin-TEVp. This would mimic a single “AND” gate, in which LOV uncaging by luciferase, plus a PPI-induced interaction between TEVp and TEVcs mediate the release of the transcription factor. In this case, however, we would not expect any improvement in S/N, as the TEVp could still cleave the TEVcs in the absence of a PPI whenever furimazine is present (as in Figure 1C). However, in the <italic>nested</italic> “AND” gate design, even if furimazine is present, the LOV domain will remain caged unless the PPI is also present to bring the NanoLuc-arrestin-TEVp within proximity of the LOV. This nested design is elegantly simple yet effective, requiring <italic>no additional constructs</italic> compared to the single “AND” gate configuration.</p><p>To help make the rationale for this design more clear, we present new data that compares SPARK2 to an alternative design in which NanoLuc is fused directly to LOV. Figure 3E-H show that this alternative design (with intramolecular, PPI-independent NanoLuc-LOV BRET) still results in background signal (in the absence of a true PPI), while SPARK2 with the nested “AND” gate has no additional detectable TEVcs cleavage in the absence of the PPI – even when the furimazine is left in the media for the entire ~8 hour incubation period. Thus, it is not simply the phenomenon of NanoLuc-LOV BRET that is necessary, but the PPI-induced proximity between NanoLuc and LOV that is crucial for eliminating background TEVcs cleavage with SPARK2. The striking difference and improvement we observed with the nested “AND” gate design make us hopeful that it will enable new synthetic biology logic designs, especially when a single “AND” gate is found to have insufficient gating due to variable protein expression in living cells.</p><p>For these reasons above, we ask reviewer 3 to reconsider their judgement that the application of PPI-induced NanoLuc-LOV BRET lacks novelty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several number of points made throughout the manuscript are similarly quite expected (e.g. compatibility of NanoLuc and FLuc) or demonstrated multiple times (e.g. demonstrations that NanoLuc needs to be proximal to LOV domain).</p></disp-quote><p>We felt it was important to thoroughly demonstrate that our tool works robustly across several different contexts – e.g. that proximity-dependence is maintained, and that compatibility with existing luciferase reporters is maintained. We hope the reviewer can agree that while the results could be expected by an expert who has a deep understanding of the LOV domain photochemistry, they remained to be proven to the broader scientific community in a detailed manner. For example, the very reason we demonstrated proximity-dependence multiple times is that this was a consistent concern raised when we presented our work to broader scientific audiences, many of whom were not protein-engineers but instead biologists and potential users of the tool.However, we note that we have moved the proximity-dependence demonstration for SPARK2 into a supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B), as we now include new data in the main Figure 4 demonstrating a biological application of a high-throughput drug screen for β2AR and DRD1 activation (Figure 4C-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the surprising lack of a direct comparison between SPARK1 and SPARK2 and substantial number of minor technical points (described below) also contributed to concerns that readers would not have some important information presented to them needed to determine the relative utilities of these tools vs. existing alternatives. In aggregate, I suggest that these issues outweigh the strengths of the work to the point that publication elsewhere is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a side-by-side comparison of SPARK1 and SPARK2 in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B).The reason we did not do so before was that SPARK2 with light-gating is essentially the same as SPARK1 with light-gating (thus the original submission compared SPARK2 + furimazine to SPARK2 + light, rather than SPARK2 + furimazine to SPARK1 + light).</p><p>We ask that the reviewer please reconsider judgements of novelty and expectation given the stated goals and requisites of an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance. We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful suggestions, which we feel have strengthened the manuscript and highlighted the advantages of SPARK2 over SPARK1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
