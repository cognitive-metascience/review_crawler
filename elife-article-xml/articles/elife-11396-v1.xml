Using a conditional mouse model of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (<italic>Chat</italic>), we report that local elimination of acetylcholine (ACh) in medial habenula (MHb) neurons alters glutamate corelease and presynaptic facilitation. Electron microscopy and immuno-isolation analyses revealed colocalization of ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the central IPN. Glutamate reuptake in SVs prepared from the IPN was increased by ACh, indicating vesicular synergy. Mice lacking CHAT in habenular neurons were insensitive to nicotine-conditioned reward and withdrawal. These data demonstrate that ACh controls the quantal size and release frequency of glutamate at habenular synapses, and suggest that the synergistic functions of ACh and glutamate may be generally important for modulation of cholinergic circuit function and behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11396.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11396.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11396.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neuroscientists are making progress in understanding the brain regions and neural circuits that are involved in reward and addiction. One such region, called the habenula, is found near the center of the brain and sends nerves to another brain region called the interpeduncular nucleus (or IPN for short); this creates a neural circuit that is important for the brain’s responses to nicotine.</p><p>The habenular-IPN circuit is rich in receptors for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. These receptors are also activated by nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit a signal from one nerve to another. These chemicals are packaged into small structures called vesicles, which are found at nerve endings. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a nerve, it triggers the release of a vesicle’s contents into the gap (or 'synapse') between nerve cells. The released neurotransmitters can then bind to receptors on the neighboring nerve cells before being cleared away.</p><p>The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the habenula-IPN circuit are associated with nicotine dependence in mice and humans. Frahm, Antolin-Fontes, Görlich et al. have now investigated what happens when the gene encoding the enzyme that makes acetylcholine is removed from habenular nerves in mice. The experiments revealed that these mutant mice become insensitive to the rewarding properties of nicotine and are protected from the effects of its withdrawal, following long-term exposure. The loss of acetylcholine from habenular nerves was also found to reduce the generation of small electrical currents in the nerves of the IPN. These currents are generated by another neurotransmitter called glutamate. If brain slices from normal mice are infused with acetylcholine or nicotine, these currents become more frequent. This response is not seen in brains of the mutant mice suggesting that acetylcholine helps the release of glutamate from habenular nerve endings.</p><p>Frahm, Antolin-Fontes, Görlich et al. then found that the proteins that transport glutamate and acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles are found at the same sites in nerve endings in the IPN. Further experiments showed that acetylcholine also increases the reuptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles and controls the amount and frequency of glutamate released at habenular synapses.</p><p>These results thus reveal how acetylcholine mediates the effects of nicotine on the brain, in part by regulating the uptake and release of glutamate by habenular nerve endings, identifying a new mechanism important for nicotine dependence. Since many acetylcholine-releasing nerve cells also release glutamate, a future challenge will be to investigate whether the interaction between these two neurotransmitters is important for other processes that rely on acetylcholine, such as memory and thought.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11396.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11396.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cotransmission</kwd><kwd>vesicular synergy</kwd><kwd>habenula</kwd><kwd>presynaptic facilitation</kwd><kwd>nicotine dependence</kwd><kwd>cholinergic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DA035756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibañez-Tallon</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GO 2334/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Görlich</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AH67/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahnert-Hilger</surname><given-names>Gudrun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibañez-Tallon</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local elimination of acetylcholine synthesis in habenular neurons demonstrates a key role for vesicular synergy and neurotransmitter co-release in nicotine dependence.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acetylcholine (ACh) was first described in the heart muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loewi, 1921</xref>), and later in the peripheral nervous system, as a fast acting neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett, 2000</xref>). In the central nervous system (CNS), however, evidence supports the hypothesis that ACh acts by volume transmission and that slowly changing levels of extracellular ACh mediate arousal states contributing to attention, sleep, learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dani and Bertrand, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mesulam et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sarter et al., 2009</xref>). Extracellular ACh levels are limited by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which cleaves ACh into choline and acetyl-coA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rosenberry, 1975</xref>). Cholinergic projection neurons in the medial habenula (MHb) synapse in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which contains extremely high levels of AChE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flumerfelt and Contestabile, 1982</xref>). At synapses with a high concentration of AChE, ACh is so quickly degraded that a single molecule cannot activate a second receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuffler and Yoshikami, 1975</xref>). Since both nicotinic (nAChRs) and muscarinic (mAChRs) acetylcholine receptors are often localized extrasynaptically on dendrites and somata, and presynaptically at axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De-Miguel and Fuxe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Descarries et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Role and Berg, 1996</xref>), it is thought that ACh volume transmission in the IPN requires high frequency stimulation of habenular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ren et al., 2011</xref>). The release of ACh from habenular terminals is consistent with genetic studies demonstrating altered responses to nicotine addiction as a consequence of mutations in nicotinic receptors that are enriched in the MHb-IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although a clear role for ACh in volume transmission and for nAChRs in nicotine dependence has been established, several observations suggest that ACh may have additional functions in cholinergic neurons. For example, it has been demonstrated in several systems that neurotransmitters can be coreleased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guzman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>), and that cooperation between vesicular neurotransmitter transporters located in the same synaptic vesicle (SV) can reciprocally increase the packaging of their respective neurotransmitters into SVs, a process termed vesicular synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, infusion of glutamate receptor antagonists into the IPN results in decreased nicotine intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>) and withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that glutamate-mediated fast synaptic transmission is also important in nicotine addiction. Given evidence that both glutamate and ACh play important roles at habenular-IPN synapses, and that vesicular synergy contributes to the physiology and function of other critical CNS circuits, we were interested in examining the interactions between these transmitter systems in habenular neurons and in determining their contributions to nicotine dependence.</p><p>To investigate the interactions between glutamate and ACh in the MHb-IPN circuit, we locally eliminated ACh at this synapse by genetic deletion of the ACh-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (<italic>Chat</italic>) in MHb neurons in conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters colocalize in a significant fraction of SVs in the central IPN (IPC). Patch clamp recordings showed that glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were smaller in IPC neurons of ChAT-cKO, but unchanged in neurons of the lateral IPN (IPL) which receives non-cholinergic input, indicating that glutamate release is reduced in the absence of ACh. Upon ACh or nicotine superfusion, wild-type (wt) IPC neurons displayed an increased frequency of mEPSC. In ChAT-cKO slices this response was not observed, indicating that presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release is impaired. Direct measurements of glutamate reuptake into IPN SVs in the presence and absence of ACh demonstrated vesicular synergy. Behaviorally, ChAT-cKO mice were insensitive to the rewarding properties of nicotine and displayed no withdrawal signs after cessation of chronic nicotine treatment. Our results, therefore, establish an essential role for ACh corelease with glutamate in habenular neuron function and reveal an additional mechanism that may play an important role in nicotine dependence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditional gene deletion of <italic>Chat</italic> in cholinergic habenular neurons</title><p>CHAT is the only enzyme that synthesizes ACh, and it is expressed at the neuromuscular junction and in several brain areas including the MHb, basal forebrain (BF), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), third cranial nerve (3N) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Thus, to remove the enzyme from habenular neurons, we employed <italic>Kiaa1107-Cre</italic> mice to drive conditional deletion of the CHAT enzyme in habenular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Immunohistochemical analyses of brain sections clearly showed that CHAT immunoreactivity was absent in the MHb, fasciculus retroflexus (fr) and IPN in ChAT-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). To assess the penetrance of the driver Cre-line we quantified the number of neurons that remained positive for CHAT in ChAT-cKO mice across different cholinergic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). This analysis showed that only 0.3% habenular neurons in ChAT-cKO mice retained their immunoreactivity to CHAT, while the number of CHAT positive neurons in striatum, PPTg and LDTg were comparable in wt and ChAT-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). ChAT-cKO and wt mice also displayed comparable immunoreactivity for CHAT in other cholinergic brain areas including BF and third cranial nerve (3N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Taken together, these data show that this genetic manipulation efficiently and selectively eliminates <italic>Chat</italic> in cholinergic habenular neurons, and that it does so after formation of the MHb/IPN circuitry.

These include projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey (PAG) and nucleus of the diagonal band. Studies on the neurotransmitter content of these other inputs indicate that there are only three sources that send cholinergic and glutamatergic projections to the IPN: the MHb, the LDTg and the nucleus of the diagonal band. Importantly, in both the LDTg and the nucleus of the diagonal band, none of the glutamatergic cells overlap with cholinergic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>). This implies that axonal terminals in the IPN that are colabeled with glutamatergic and cholinergic markers originate in the MHb. However, within the MHb there are two distinct populations: a cholinergic population in the ventral MHb that projects to the rostral (IPR), intermediate (IPI) and central (IPC) subnuclei ﻿of the IPN and a peptidergic (Substance P positive) population in the dorsal MHb that projects to the lateral part of the IPN (IPL)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both types of projections release glutamate. To quantify the degree of overlap of glutamatergic and cholinergic synapses in different nuclei of the IPN, we performed double immunostainings in wt and ChAT-cKO mice and calculated the Manders’ colocalization coefficient which ranges from 0 for no colocalization to 1 for complete colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manders et al., 1993</xref>). These analyses indicated an extremely high colocalization of VGLUT1 and VACHT in the IPC of both wt (M1=0.80) and ChAT-CKO (M1=0.79), less overlap in the IPI (wt, M1=0.78, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.77) and IPR (wt, M1=0.68, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.69), and no colocalization in the IPL (wt, M1=0.005, ChAT-CKO, M1=0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together with the published literature, our data demonstrate that the vast majority of cholinergic+glutamatergic input to the IPC originates in the ventral MHb.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11396.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Distribution of cholinergic and glutamatergic axonal terminals in IPN subnuclei.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the segregated projections of medial habenular neurons to IPN subnuclei.

There were no significant differences in the density of VACHT and VGLUT-1-labeled vesicles within 350 nm from the active zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–L</xref>). However the scatter plot distribution showed that VACHT and VGLUT1-labeled vesicles located farther than 350 nm from the active zone were differentially distributed (F(1,936) = 4.954; p&lt;0.05; one-way ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). It has been proposed that SVs might be organized in three functionally distinct pools at increasing distances from the active zone: the readily releasable pool (RRP 0–60 nm), the recycling pool (60–200 nm), and the reserve pool (beyond 200 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rizzoli and Betz, 2005</xref>); however it is still debated whether the recycling and reserve pools are intermingled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>). Our results show similar distribution of vesicles containing ACh and glutamate within the two closer SV pools. However the reserve pool appears to contain more glutamatergic than cholinergic SVs.</p><p>Finally, to determine whether VGLUT1 and VACHT are present in the same synapses and synaptic vesicles, we performed double post-embedding immunogold electron microscopic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). We observed colabeling of VACHT-6 nm and VGLUT1-12 nm gold particles in 72 of 90 labeled synaptic terminals, 8 terminals with only VAChT-6 nm particles and 10 terminals with only VGLUT1-12 nm particles indicating that both transporters are present in the vast majority (80%) of habenular terminals in the central IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To assess whether VACHT and VGLUT1 are present in the same SV, we measured the distance from each VGLUT1-gold particle to the nearest VACHT-gold particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and adopted the criterion described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stensrud et al., 2013</xref>) stating that 90 nm is the maximal distance between gold particles which colocalize in the same vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This distance has been calculated based on the diameter of a synaptic vesicle of approximately 30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gundersen et al., 1998</xref>), which we consistently found to be 35.18 ± 0.43 nm (n=203) in habenular terminals, and based on the distance from an antigen epitope to the center of a secondary antibody conjugated with 10 nm gold particles which spans up to 30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergersen et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, two gold particles located within a distance of 90 nm could potentially label the same vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stensrud et al., 2013</xref>). Considering this maximal theoretical distance of 90 nm, 54.35% of VGLUT1-gold particles (n=75/138) could be located in the same SV as VACHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However given that SVs are closely packed, this may be an overestimate because adjacent particles could also be labeling transporters in neighboring SVs. As control analyses, we quantified the distance from each VGLUT1-gold particle to the closest VGLUT1-particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and the distance from each VACHT to the closest VACHT-gold particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We found that 35.95% of VGLUT1 particles (n=32/89), and 61.08% of VACHT particles (n=113/185) are within 90 nm of each other and could potentially label the same synaptic vesicle. These ultrastructural analyses indicate that ACh and glutamate vesicular transporters are coexpressed in 80% of the axonal terminals in the IPC, and that within each presynaptic terminal a significant fraction of SVs colabel with VACHT and VGLUT immunogold particles, supporting the conclusion that ACh and glutamate can be cotransported into the same synaptic vesicles in habenular cholinergic presynaptic terminals<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11396.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>VACHT and VGLUT1 colocalize in the same synaptic vesicles in axonal terminals in the central IPN.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Double post-embedding immunogold labeling of VACHT (6 nm gold particles) and VGLUT1 (12 nm gold particles) shows colocalization of both transporters in the same synaptic vesicles.

To test whether local release of ACh could influence presynaptic facilitation by activation of nAChRs, we recorded mEPSC upon bath application of nicotine or ACh. Superfusion with nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) or ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) did not change the amplitudes of mEPSCs in either wt, or increased the amplitudes of ChAT-cKO to wt levels, consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease of glutamate vesicular content in presynaptic terminals depends on the presence of intracellular ACh. Importanlty, we observed a significant increase in mEPSC frequency in wt, but not in ChAT-cKO mice upon superfusion with nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of network activity eliminated by TTX, nicotine or ACh activation of nAChRs at presynaptic terminals elicits enhanced discharge of glutamatergic mEPSCs in IPC neurons of wt mice. In contrast there is no presynaptic facilitation in ChAT-cKO neurons, suggesting that presynaptic nAChRs are downregulated in the absence of ACh released by habenular terminals. We next analyzed holding currents as a measure of the excitability of postsynaptic IPN neurons. The values are very similar between genotypes and upon perfusion with nAChR agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), indicating that postsynaptic nAChRs in IPN neurons are not affected by elimination of endogenous ACh. Western blot analyses of nAChRs and GluR1 in IPN extracts did not show significant differences between wt and ChAT-cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>). However this assay cannot distinguish between presynaptic, extrasynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and whether these are at the membrane or not. Given the nAChR-mediated presynaptic effect we have measured, it is possible that ACh might be required for the trafficking of nAChRs to the membrane without affecting the total number of nAChRs in the IPN. Taken together, these data and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> show that the function of presynaptic but not postsynaptic nAChR receptors is reduced in the IPC of ChAT-cKO, and that ACh is necessary for presynaptic nAChR-mediated facilitation and for increasing the vesicular glutamate content.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11396.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release is absent in ChAT-cKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the habenula and IPN subnuclei.

(<bold>D</bold>) Simplified illustration of vesicular synergy: synaptic vesicles are acidified and positively charged by a V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (brown circle) that pumps protons into the SV generating a chemical gradient (ΔpH, inward green arrow) and an electrical gradient (ΔΨ, inward red arrow). The activities of vesicular transporters depend to differing extents on ΔpH and ΔΨ due to the charge on the neurotransmitter and the stoichiometry of coupling to H<sup>+</sup>. VACHT preferentially uses the ΔpH chemical gradient while VGLUT relies more on ΔΨ component. During each transport cycle, VACHT exchanges two protons (H<sup>+</sup>) for one ACh molecule (ACh<sup>+</sup> positively charged) thereby dissipating ΔpH (outward green arrow) twice faster than ΔΨ, a situation promoting VGLUT activity. VGLUT activity exchanges one glutamate molecule (Glu<sup>-</sup> negatively charged) by nH<sup>+</sup> and causes the opposite imbalance dissipating more ΔΨ than ΔpH (outward orange arrow). The transport activity of VGLUT thereby compensates for the bioenergetic imbalance produced by VACHT activity and vice versa. This reciprocal vesicular synergy between transporters allows a maximal accumulation of ACh and glutamate under a constant ΔΨ and ΔpH gradient (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hnasko et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of ACh<sup>+</sup> as it occurs in synaptic terminals of ChAT-cKO mice, there is no exchange of ACh<sup>+</sup>/2H<sup>+</sup> and synaptic vesicles progressively become less positively charged and the plateau level of Glu<sup>-</sup> uptake is reduced.

Vesicular transporters use the energy generated by the v-ATPase that pumps protons into the SV to generate an acidic (ΔpH) and positively charged (Δψ) electrochemical gradient (ΔµH<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). During each transport cycle, two protons will be replaced by one ACh thereby decreasing ΔpH without affecting the positive outwardly directed Δψ, a situation promoting VGLUT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>). The addition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increases vesicular glutamate uptake by increasing the intravesicular pH therefore lowering ΔpH without affecting Δψ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Preobraschenski et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that ACh might work in the same direction. While recent evidence indicates that vesicular synergy is operated by glutamate acting as a buffering anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gras et al., 2008</xref>), the reciprocal synergy has not been reported. To test this possibility, we purified SVs from IPN samples of rats and performed uptake assays. Uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate was measured in the presence of neostigmine, a specific inhibitor of the AChE. Values were corrected for nonspecific uptake in the presence of FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; inhibitor of vesicular transporters). Under these conditions, the accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate in IPN vesicles increased and reached a plateau of 38 ± 3 pmol/ mg of protein at 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). In the presence of ACh, [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate accumulation increased to 51 ± 15 pmol of glutamate/mg of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Thus, addition of ACh increased vesicular glutamate uptake by 35.8 ± 13.6% relative to control vesicles. Addition of the positively charged NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>also led to an increase of glutamate uptake (140.7 ± 13 pmol). The increase by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was much more pronounced than with ACh possibly because NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addresses all glutamatergic SVs present in the IPN preparation, while ACh can only increase glutamate uptake in those SVs equipped with VACHT and VGLUT. Altogether, our results show that ACh synergizes vesicular filling of glutamate, providing additional functional evidence for the coexistence of VACHT and glutamate vesicular transporters in a subset of IPN vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ChAT-cKO mice do not display nicotine-mediated reward and withdrawal behaviors</title><p>Given that local elimination of ACh in habenular neurons reduces glutamate corelease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and impairs nAChR presynaptic facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and given the role for nAChRs in the MHb/IPN in nicotine craving and intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frahm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salas et al., 2009</xref>), we examined the behavioral responses of ChAT-cKO mice to nicotine.

Alterations in the balance of neurotransmitters influence our capacity to cope with addiction, depression and, in the most pronounced cases, can contribute to psychiatric disorders. The studies presented here reveal that ACh production at MHb-IPN synapses is essential for the establishment of nicotine dependence, and that local ACh action plays an important role in withdrawal responses. We demonstrate that loss of ACh selectively in habenular neurons results in a reduction in the content of glutamate in synaptic vesicles isolated from the IPN, supporting the recent finding that MHb neurons corelease ACh and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ren et al., 2011</xref>). We provide functional evidence for a dual role of ACh in the IPN: first, the facilitation of vesicular glutamate uptake into SVs; and second, the modulation of transmitter release through activation of presynaptic nAChRs. Both mechanisms influence the excitability of IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), thus accounting for the lack of nicotine dependence in ChAT-cKO mice.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11396.014</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Cholinergic and glutamatergic cotransmission from habenular neurons to the IPN is essential for development of nicotine dependence.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Schemes illustrating the co-transmission of glutamate and ACh in three situations: in wt mice (<bold>A</bold>), in ChAT-cKO mice (<bold>B</bold>), and in mice injected with glutamate receptor blockers (<bold>C</bold>).

The simultaneous corelease of ACh and glutamate activates presynaptic nAChR and postsynaptic nAChRs and glutamate receptors and is essential for tapering nicotine intake and producing withdrawal symptoms upon nicotine cessation. (<bold>B</bold>) In the absence of ACh in ChAT-cKO both presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release and vesicle glutamate quantal content are reduced leading to reduced glutamate release at ChAT-cKO synapses and consequently insensitivity to nicotine consumption and withdrawal effects.

There is physiological evidence for glutamate corelease with dopamine, GABA, adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and ACh in specific neuronal populations in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</xref>). This allows a very local control of excitatory and inhibitory balance at individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>). While some studies have documented the presence of distinct transporters in the same SV and determined their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zander et al., 2010</xref>), it is also possible that not all corelease can be recognized by analysis of neurotransmitter enzyme synthesis and packaging transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tritsch et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that the different ionic properties of vesicular transporters can foster physiologically complementing functions depending on the electrical (ΔΨ, for VGLUT) or pH gradients (ΔpH, for VAChT, VMAT2, VGAT). We show here for the first time that in the absence of ACh, VACHT can no longer promote glutamate co-entry through VGLUT1/2, thus demonstrating synergy between VACHT and VGLUT1/2 in these synapses. Given previous studies of striatal synapses that demonstrated that loss of VGLUT3 results in a decrease of ACh uptake by synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gras et al., 2008</xref>), and our demonstration that loss of ACh affects glutamate uptake by VGLUT1/2, it seems most probable that transport of glutamate and ACh into IPN vesicles occurs by a reciprocal mechanism. Besides MHb neurons and striatal interneurons, other cholinergic neurons also appear to contain a vesicular glutamate transporter or corelease glutamate, including BF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gritti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>), and spinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nishimaru et al., 2005</xref>). This is also the case in the marine ray, <italic>Torpedo californica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li and Harlow, 2014</xref>). Cotransmission of ACh and glutamate might therefore be considered the rule rather than the exception raising a fundamental question about the role of cotransmitter release and neurotransmitter synergy at cholinergic synapses and suggesting that vesicular synergy of these transmitters must have added an adaptive advantage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cholinergic habenular synapses: ultrastructure and molecular components</title><p>Our studies agree with previous work supporting the coexistence of two modes of transmission: wired and volumetric for glutamate and ACh respectively. In particular, it has been shown that brief stimulation of MHb efferents elicits glutamatergic but not cholinergic responses, and that tetanic stimulation is required to generate slow inward currents mediated by nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ren et al., 2011</xref>). These differences in transmission could be attributed to the existence of a cholinergic synaptic vesicle population distant from the active zone that is released only during high frequency signaling. However, we can exclude this possibility given our demonstration that glutamate and ACh vesicular transporters colocalize in cholinergic SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and that both cholinergic and glutamatergic SV are found in close proximity and far (&gt;350 nm) from the active zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore the two modes of transmission most likely reflect the different distribution of postsynaptic glutamate and ACh receptors. Indeed, a great deal of evidence suggests that ACh diffuses to pre- and extrasynaptic sites where it modulates the release of other transmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Covernton and Lester, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Descarries et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Descarries and Mechawar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Girod et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mansvelder et al., 2009</xref>).

Electron microscopy studies have revealed that these boutons are highly immunoreactive for CHAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lenn et al., 1985</xref>), consistent with our studies indicating that the vesicles visualized in these synapses are cholinergic. Given the high concentration and catalytic power of AChE in the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flumerfelt and Contestabile, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quinn, 1987</xref>), the pre-terminal localization of synaptic boutons in ‘en passant’ synapses along habenular axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parajuli et al., 2012</xref>), and our results showing colocalization of ACh and glutamate transporters in the same SV populations, it seems plausible that high frequency stimulation of MHb terminals is necessary to release sufficient ACh to reach nAChRs in the IPN (volume transmission) while brief stimulation can elicit fast postsynaptic glutamatergic responses (wired transmission).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Prominent role of the MHb-IPN circuit in nicotine dependence</title><p>Several nAChR subtypes in the MHb-IPN pathway are key in the control of nicotine consumption. Receptors containing the β4 and/or α5 subunit contribute to the activation of this tract during nicotine intake and are critical for the aversive (reward-inhibiting) effects of high-dose nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frahm et al., 2011</xref>), while α2, α5 and β4-subunits play a major role in nicotine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salas et al., 2009</xref>). Less is known about the contribution of the MHb-IPN pathway to the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of the α3β4 nAChR blocker conotoxin AuIB, resulted in attenuated reward and withdrawal from nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>). However, although α3β4 nAChR subunits coassemble with α5 nAChRs in about 15–35% of MHb-IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grady et al., 2009</xref>), the reward-enhancing properties of nicotine are not altered in α5-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>). Given the large variety of nAChR subtypes in this circuit and their differential distribution on glutamatergic and GABAergic pre- and postsynaptic terminals, the advantage of local removal of the endogenous ligand ACh to understand the impact of nicotine on this tract is apparent. Thus, using ChAT-cKO mice we were able to demonstrate for the first time that ACh in the MHb-IPN circuit is crucial for the establishment of dependence-related behaviors, including reward and tolerance to nicotine.</p><p>Presynaptic nAChRs at habenular synapses facilitate glutamate and ACh release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Girod et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGehee et al., 1995</xref>), and postsynaptic nAChRs contribute to an increased excitatory response upon activation. However, it appears that GAD-immunoreactive cells constitute the largest population of neurons in the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawaja et al., 1989</xref>) and activation of α4β2 nAChRs located on GABAergic interneurons can trigger spike discharge and GABA-release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Covernton and Lester, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lena et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that ACh and nicotine modulate both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the IPN. Importantly, repeated exposure to nicotine leads to inactivation of nAChRs, thus altering the modulatory effects of the endogenous transmitter ACh. Given that nicotine increases GABA release in the IPN and that continuous nicotine exposure desensitizes α4β2 nAChRs considerably more than α7 and α3β4 nAChRs (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giniatullin et al., 2005</xref>]), it is possible that persistent desensitization of α4β2 nAChRs on GABAergic neurons in the IPN increases the net excitatory output of this tract, as previously demonstrated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mansvelder et al., 2002</xref>). The lack of dynamic changes in nAChR activity on inhibitory neurons in the absence of ACh, and subsequent altered stimulation of efferent targets, could thereby contribute to the insensitivity of ChAT-cKO mice to nicotine-mediated reward and tolerance. Descending projections from the IPN include the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus and LDTg. Both nuclei exchange reciprocal information and provide glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geisler and Wise, 2008</xref>) and cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>) input to the VTA. Therefore, loss of cholinergic communication in the MHb-IPN axis, indirectly influencing activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, fails to induce nicotine-dependent behaviors, including reward, tolerance and withdrawal in ChAT-cKO animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Genetic predisposition to addiction</title><p>The reinforcing properties of nicotine together with the negative withdrawal symptoms that develop upon nicotine cessation are the main reasons for the maintenance of the smoking habit in spite of its known deleterious consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Biasi and Dani, 2011</xref>). Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as risk factors for nicotine dependence and lung cancer in genes encoding nAChR subunits (<italic>CHRNB3-CHRNA6</italic> and <italic>CHRNB4-CHRNA3-CHRNA5</italic> clusters), and in nicotine-metabolizing enzymes (<italic>CYP2A6</italic> and <italic>CYP2B6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bierut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kumasaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thorgeirsson et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, variations in the <italic>CHAT</italic> gene have been associated with prospective smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heitjan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). The studies presented here show that nicotine does not trigger nicotine-dependent behaviors unless the endogenous neurotransmitter ACh is released from MHb neurons to further promote glutamate corelease. In the corticostriatal circuitry, it has been proposed that glutamate homeostasis underlies drug-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalivas, 2009</xref>). After repetitive drug use, deregulation of this homeostasis increases the release of glutamate during drug relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kalivas, 2009</xref>). Similarly, in the MHb, re-exposure to nicotine after abstinence increases the pacemaking of MHb neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gorlich et al., 2013</xref>) and subsequent corelease of ACh and glutamate from habenular axonal terminals. Although it is known that the main action of nAChRs is presynaptic in the CNS and postsynaptic at the neuromuscular junction, no studies have addressed the role of ACh in this mechanism. The studies presented here not only agree with the conclusion that nicotine-induced behaviors act via presynaptic receptors that regulate glutamate release but also show that nicotine is not sufficient to induce dependence unless ACh is released and promotes further release of glutamate. Given that other cholinergic neurons beside MHb neurons corelease glutamate, and our findings demonstrating that ACh controls the quantal size and release frequency of glutamate, it is possible that the synergistic functions of ACh and glutamate may be generally important for modulation of cholinergic circuit function and behavior and that genetic variations in <italic>CHAT</italic> may influence several aspects of glutamatergic transmission in the addiction process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Chat<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Misgeld et al., 2002</xref>) were crossed to <italic>Kiaa1107-Cre</italic> mice (founder KJ227 GENSAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gong et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Kiaa1107</italic> is annotated as <italic>A830010M20Rik</italic> by GENSAT.

Brain tissue was resuspended in ice-cold buffer (in mM: 320 sucrose, 4 HEPES/KOH/pH 7.4, 1 PMSF, protease inhibitor for mammalian tissue (Pi) 1:1000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and homogeneized (10 strokes at 900 rpm (homogenizer clearance: 0.1–0.15 mm, Wheaton, UK)). Nuclei were discarded by centrifugation and the supernatant mainly containing SVs was diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer (ddH<sub>2</sub>O, in mM:10 HEPES/KOH/pH 7.4, 1 PMSF, Pi 1:1000) for osmotic shock and processed with three strokes at 2000 rpm using a Wheaton homogenizer to obtain SVs in suspension. Immunoisolation of SV was performed using paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads: for monoclonal antibodies: Pan Mouse IgG, for polyclonal rabbit antibodies: M-280 sheep anti-rabbit, Life Technologies) were first coated with the respective primary antibodies suspended in coating buffer [PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA (w/v)], supplemented with 0.5 – 1 µg of IgG per 10<sup>7</sup> Pan Mouse IgG beads or 2 x 10<sup>7</sup> M-280 sheep anti-rabbit beads and rotated for 2 hr at 4°C followed by four washing steps. Immunoisolation was performed overnight at 4°C under rotation using a suspension of the coated beads and S1shock fractions diluted with incubation buffer [PBS, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, and 5% BSA (w/v)] to yield a ratio of 50–75 µg protein to 1.4 x10<sup>7</sup> beads (Pan Mouse IgG) or 3.9 x 10<sup>7</sup> beads (M-280). SV bound to beads were washed three times in incubation buffer, and three times in coating buffer. Bead-bound SV were finally dissolved in sample buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takamori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zander et al., 2010</xref>). Beads without primary antibodies (for monoclonal immunoisolation) or with normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, for isolation using polyclonal rabbit antibodies) were subjected to the same procedures and served as control for non-specifically bound material. The protein pattern of isolated SV was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Antibodies used for Western blot were rabbit polyclonal anti VGLUT1 or VAChT (Synaptic Systems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Glutamate uptake</title> <p>Glutamate uptake was performed using a SV-enriched fraction (S1 hyposmotically shocked and spun down as pLP2) from 10 rat IPN. Briefly, membranes of S1shock fraction (see above) were removed (20 min at 29,000 x g) and SV were pelleted (30 min at 350,000 x g (TLA-100.4 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NJ)) resulting in pLP2 fraction. Uptake was performed in K-gluconate buffer (in mM: 146 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 20 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 4 EGTA, 2.9 MgSO<sub>4</sub> (corresponding to 1 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>), 2 Na-ATP, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH) by adding 1 μM neostigmine, 49.5 µM K-glutamate and 0.5 µM [3,43H]-L-glutamic acid (Hartmann Analytic GmbH, Germany) to the SV suspension. Non-specific uptake was performed by adding 60 µM FCCP also used for background correction. Additives were given 10 min before the uptake was started at 25°C. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding ice-cold buffer containing the same ionic constituents used during the uptake. Non-bound radioactivity was removed by centrifugation at 435,000 x g (TLA-120.1 rotor, Beckman Coulter) for 10 min, and the pellets were washed three times. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6500, Beckman Coulter).

Single events represented disruption of two distinct infrared photobeams 3 cm apart in the cage. After injection of saline or different concentrations of nicotine, the number of beam breaks was measured for 15 min. Locomotor inhibition was calculated by normalizing to basal activity values (beam breaks nicotine x 100% / beam breaks saline). For measurement of tolerance behavior, mice were given daily i.p. injections of 0.65 mg/kg nicotine (total of 9 days), starting with saline at day 0 as control activity. Activity was monitored in the open field box every second day for 15 min immediately after injections.</p><p>Home cage activity of single housed animals was measured for 3 days and averaged to 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Conditioned place preference</title><p>A rectangular three-compartment box separated by removable doors (TSE-systems) was used. The center compartment (6 x 15 x 20 cm) is grey with a polycarbonate smooth floor. The choice compartments (17 x 15 x 20 cm) have different visual and tactile cues. Time spent in each compartment was measured with photobeam detectors. During the preconditioning phase (day1) male mice (8–12 weeks old) were placed into the center compartment with closed doors. After 2 min of habituation, doors opened automatically and mice were allowed to explore the three compartments freely for 15 min. The pre-conditioning session was used to determine baseline responses and less preferred compartments were paired with nicotine. Mice exhibiting a strong preference for one side (&gt;150 s) in the pre-conditioning session were excluded. During the conditioning phase (day 2–4), mice were given a saline injection in the morning and a nicotine injection in the afternoon and were confined to either one side or the other of the conditioning box for 20 min. On the preference test (day 5), the doors between the compartments were opened after mice habituated for 2 min in the central chamber and were then allowed to move freely in the three compartments for 15 min. Preference score was measured as time spent in nicotine-paired or saline-paired compartment at day 5 – day 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Nicotine treatment and withdrawal tests</title> <p>Single housed male adult mice were treated with nicotine via the drinking water over 6 weeks, starting at a concentration of 32,5 µg/ml in the first week, increasing to 65 µg/ml in the second week and to 162,5 µg/ml in the remaining 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gorlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salas et al., 2009</xref>). To minimize taste aversion, 2% saccharin was added to both, treatment and control groups. Withdrawal was precipitated by i.p. injection of 2 mg/kg mecamylamine. To measure somatic signs of withdrawal, mice were placed into their home cage immediately after injection and videotaped for 20 min. During this time, following events were scored as somatic signs of withdrawal: body tremors, head nods, paw tremors, grooming, genital licks and scratching. To measure affective signs of withdrawal we employed a light-dark box by placing a dark enclosure with a doorway on one side of the open field boxes (Accuscan &amp; Omnitech Electronics, Columbus, OH). We employed another set of mice (treated with saccharin and nicotine) different from the one used for somatic withdrawal. Withdrawal was precipitated by i.p. injection of 2 mg/kg mecamylamine. Immediately after injection, mice were placed in the dark chamber and allowed to move freely between both chambers for 5 min. Time spent in each chamber was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The assumption that two gold particles within a distance of 90 nm label the same vesicle is likely to give an overestimate of the number of vesicles containing both VAChT and VGLUT1, because gold particles on adjacent vesicles can easily be less than 90 nm apart given the close packing. The estimate of double-positive vesicles may be an overestimate, making it difficult to accept the authors' claims that the majority of SVs in these axon terminals contain both transporters. The authors should present a more compelling argument for why 90 nm is not only the maximum distance for labeling in the same vesicle but also the minimum distance for labeling in adjacent vesicles, or should make textual changes acknowledging the colocalization may be lower.</p><p>2) Given the similarity of the numbers at the bottom of the subsection “Cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs to IPN subnuclei” it would be appropriate to add the word &quot;slightly&quot;, so that the sentence reads &quot;slightly&quot; less overlap in the IPI.</p><p>3) The authors' claim that ChAT deletion resulted in the &quot;complete absence&quot; of nicotine-elicited behavioral responses is too strong of an assertion. Nicotine was still able to elicit hypolocomotion in the ChAT-cKO mice, albeit to a lesser degree than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). The authors also did not provide any evidence to distinguish the effects of the loss of ACh release from these MHb neurons from the effects of altered Glu release from the same afferents. Therefore they are unable to convincingly argue that the behavioral effects are also due to the reported loss of the vesicle synergy and altered Glu signaling. Experiments that attempted to rescue impaired Glu release resulting from the loss of vesicle synergy (i.e. increasing Glu release from the ventral MHb-IPN projection of the ChAT-cKO mice) could have helped to dissociate the effects resulting from separate outcomes of ChAT deletion from ventral MHb neurons. The authors should make textual changes to moderate the assertion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

Double immunostainings with CHAT and EYFP show that 99% (1912 of 1933) of CHAT positive neurons in the MHb are positive for the EYFP reporter while other CHAT populations in striatum, PPTg and LDTg show minimal expression of EYFP (0.5 to 1.3% of CHAT cells). These results demonstrate that the A830010M20Rik-Cre driver strain can be used to specifically target the cholinergic population of habenular neurons without affecting other cholinergic neurons (see subsection “Conditional gene deletion of ChAT in cholinergic habenular neurons”).</p><p>To assess the penetrance of the driver Cre-line, we provide quantification of the number of CHAT positive neurons in ChAT-cKO mice (A830010M20RikCre x floxed ChAT) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (new panels E and F). This analysis shows that only 0.3% habenular neurons are positive for CHAT, while the number of CHAT neurons in striatum, PPTg and LDTg are comparable in wt and ChAT-cKO mice. These data confirm that the A830010M20Rik-Cre strain drives Cre- recombination in 99.7% habenular cholinergic neurons (see the aforementioned subsection).</p><p><italic>2) You need to at least make a better argument for why non-habenular glutamatergic inputs are unlikely and may need to do some additional experiments to shore up this point.</italic> </p><p>To clarify this point we have included a detailed explanation of the inputs to the IPN (subsection “Cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs to IPN subnuclei”). This section describes that the main glutamatergic input to the IPN is from the medial habenula, but there are other glutamatergic inputs to the IPN. These include projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey (PAG) and nucleus of the diagonal band. The neurotransmitter content of these other inputs is as follows:</p><p>a) The LDTg contains cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic (VGLUT2) neurons (Geisler et al., 2007; Wang and Morales, 2009). Importantly the vast majority of CHAT positive neurons are not glutamatergic (Wang and Morales, 2009).</p><p>b) The raphe nuclei are mainly serotoninergic: only the dorsal raphe contains some glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT3) (Herzog et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2009).</p><p>c) The locus coeruleus produces mainly norepinephrine, however some neurons may coexpress glutamate (Fung et al. 1994).</p><p>d) The PAG does not express VGLUT1, but does express a small amount of VGLUT2 (Geisler et al., 2007) and VGLUT3 (Herzog et al., 2004), and is very rich in GABAergic neurons (Reichling and Basbaum, 1991).</p><p>e) The diagonal band contains three populations of neurons: cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic (VGLUT2 and VGLUT3 positive) (Geisler et al., 2007). Importantly none of the glutamatergic cells overlap with cholinergic markers (Henderson et al., 2010).</p><p>f) In addition the great majority of IPN neurons are primarily GABAergic excluding the possibility that the recorded mEPSCs are from local projections (reviewed in (Antolin- Fontes et al., 2015)).</p><p>Our experimental arguments supporting the conclusion that non-habenular glutamatergic inputs are unlikely are the following:</p><p>A) We provide new quantitation of the electron microscopy data that indicates that at least 80% (72 terminals out of 90) of synaptic terminals in the central part of the IPN (IPC) contain synaptic vesicles positive for both VGLUT1 and VACHT and that very few, 11%, are only glutamatergic (10/90)) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>B) As a second method to quantify the degree of overlap of glutamatergic and cholinergic terminals in different nuclei of the IPN, we calculated the Manders’ colocalization coefficient that ranges from 0 for no colocalization to 1 for complete colocalization (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (Manders et al., 1993). These analyses indicate an extremely high colocalization of VGLUT1 and VACHT (M1=0.80) in the IPC and no colocalization in the lateral IPN (IPL).</p><p>C) As the published studies indicate (description of IPN inputs above), there are only three sources of cholinergic+glutamatergic projections to the IPN: the MHb, the LDTg and the nucleus of diagonal band. In both the LDTg and the nucleus of diagonal band, the neurons express either CHAT or VGLUT but not both markers in the same cell (Henderson et al., 2010; Wang and Morales, 2009).</p><p>D) Therefore in the IPC, where we have performed the EM studies and where the electrophysiological recordings show that glutamatergic mEPSCs differ in the ChAT- cKO, 80% of the inputs to the neurons we have recorded are glutamatergic+ cholinergic and thus they originate in the habenula.</p><p>E) In addition, we have performed electrophysiological recordings in the lateral IPN (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which receives non-cholinergic glutamatergic inputs, and we show no differences in glutamatergic mEPSCS between wt and ChAT-cKO. This supports the additional conclusion that glutamatergic inputs that are non-cholinergic are not affected by selective elimination of ACh in habenular neurons.</p><p>To clarify these points, we include new diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) to indicate the specific subnuclei in the IPN where we have performed electron microscopy and electrophysiological recordings, and we have changed the order of the figures to introduce the EM findings and coefficient correlations before the electrophysiological recordings. Taken together, the published literature and our data argue strongly that the vast majority of cholinergic+ glutamatergic input to the IPC originates in the MHb.</p><p><italic>3) You need to better quantify and better support the western blot data, perhaps adding measures of holding current and paired pulse responses.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important point and have included more experimental data and edited this part in the manuscript. We agree that the information provided by the WB is not very quantitative since it does not distinguish between presynaptic, extrasynaptic and postsynaptic receptors and whether they are at the membrane or not. We have rephrased this part in the manuscript, we include additional electrophysiological measurements of holding currents and we have increased the sample size of mEPSC recordings upon nicotine and ACh bath application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results show that the frequency of mEPSCs increases in wt but not in ChAT-cKO. This indicates that there is no presynaptic facilitation in the ChAT-cKO suggesting that the presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in habenular terminals in the IPN are downregulated in the absence of ACh released by the terminals. In contrast, since the holding currents are similar between genotypes, postsynaptic nAChRs in IPN neurons are most likely not affected by elimination of ACh. Taken together, the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and the previous data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) indicate that the function of presynaptic but not postsynaptic nAChR receptors is reduced in ChAT-cKO. The WB does not reflect this functional difference, indicating that the total number of nAChRs in the IPN is unchanged. Given the presynaptic effect we have measured, it is possible that ACh might be required for the trafficking of nAChRs to the membrane.</p><p>We have performed paired pulse responses by electrical stimulation of the fasciculus retroflexus (fr) and recordings in IPN neurons using oblique slices, which included the MHb, fr and IPN, but unfortunately there was too much variability between slices depending on the sectioning of the fasciculus retroflexus. Optogenetic recordings in ChAT-channelrhodopsin (ChR2) mice (as reported in (Ren et al., 2011)) would have been a better alternative, because these would allow direct stimulation of the MHb terminals, versus stimulation of the fr as is needed for electric stimulations. However in our case optogenetic recordings would have required crossing 3 mouse strains (Chat-ChR2 X A830010M20Rik-Cre X Chat <sub>flox/flox</sub> and Chat <sup>flox/flox</sup> must be recombined in both chromosomes (5 generations, approx. 10 months). This is clearly beyond the scope of this revision, and we believe it should not be required.</p><p><italic>4) Additional controls are needed for co-localization experiments. This can probably be done simply by reanalyzing the images already acquired.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have re-analyzed the electron microscopy data and provided distance distributions of large-large (VGLUT1-VGLUT1) and small-small (VACHT-VACHT) gold particles in co-labeling EM experiments by quantitation of the number of gold particles which are at 0-90 (same vesicle), 90-180 (next vesicle) and more than 180 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and 6G</xref>).</p><p>For VACHT-VACHT, the percentage of particles in the same vesicle is 61%.

Why would one look for or expect changes in a post-synaptic dependent mechanism given a pre-synaptic manipulation? Or is the logic that the nicotine induced behaviors all act via presynaptic receptors that regulate glutamate release?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point. Given that nAChRs can act either presynaptically or postsynaptically, we were interested in the detailed mechanisms through which ACh acts when locally released in the CNS. Since the MHb is an extremely rich source of ACh, and since it is implicated in many different aspects of addictive behaviors, we performed this study to investigate the actions of ACh at these synapses and its effects on behaviour.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The paper does a good job of going from biophysics to behavior.

The ChAT KO decreases locomotor inhibition and, perhaps, tolerance to this inhibition (this is limited by a ceiling effect). The KO decreases somatic signs of inhibition, anxiety, and CPP. The authors conclude that &quot;elimination of cholinergic neurotransmission from MHb neurons is sufficient to abolish nicotine-induced responses including tolerance, withdrawal, and conditioned-reinforcement.&quot; This is fair, but it might not all be due to lack of vesicular synergy.</italic> </p><p>We have changed this sentence in the manuscript (subsection “Absence of nicotine-mediated reward behavior and withdrawal in ChAT-cKO mice”).</p><p><italic>The Discussion is overall sensible, but the final hypothesis may go too far. You could also consider the possibility that eliminating ChAT decreases pH in the vesicle (increases deltapH), by decreasing the number of protons leaving. This, in turn, would increase nicotine accumulation in the vesicle (see Tischbirek, Neuron 2012). What might this do?</italic> </p><p>We have changed the last part of the Discussion.</p><p>Generally the transport of each negatively charged anion like glutamate or Cl activates the proton pump to insert a proton for compensation. To sustain transport even if protons are accumulating, VGLUT itself then exchanges H+ against K+ as described in our recent paper (Preobraschenski et al., 2014). We carefully checked the literature and there is no indication that nicotine is actively transported over the plasma membrane by the choline transporter ChT (Mansner, 1977). We also found no indication that nicotine binds to VACHT or is actively taken up. So we think that even if nicotine will be distributed overall including glutamatergic terminal and vesicles, the effect seen will be on all glutamatergic vesicles/ synapses and should give an overall increase in mEPSC.</p><p><italic>Finally, if the vesicle-loading hypothesis is correct, then the authors should phenocopy the acute electrophysiological effects with vesamicol.</italic> </p><p>We tried short application of vesamicol (VACHT blocker) in IPN neurons, but did not see any effects on mEPSC amplitude and/or frequency of mEPSCs in our initial experiments most likely because all the vesicles in the reserve pool have to be exocytosed before vesamicol can change the loading of the next set of SVs. Thus there is a problem with the experimental design that would require sustained activation of habenular neurons while applying TTX to measure mEPSCs. However, we think that these pharmacological experiments might not lead to further conclusions than the ones shown already with a cell specific genetic manipulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
