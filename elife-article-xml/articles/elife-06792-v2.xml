Critical for salmonellae virulence is their ability to survive and replicate within host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 1986</xref>). Following phagocytosis by macrophages, salmonellae are contained within a phagosomal environment containing a diversity of antimicrobial factors including proteases, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, acidic pH and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flannagan et al., 2009</xref>). Salmonellae have multiple mechanisms, including the PhoQ sensor, to sense the phagosomal milieu and respond by increasing their resistance to host antimicrobial factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haraga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Groisman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dalebroux and Miller, 2014</xref>). PhoQ is the sensor kinase component of the PhoPQ two-component regulatory system that governs the phosphorylated state of the response regulator PhoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groisman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1989</xref>). PhoQ exists as a dimer within the inner membrane and has a periplasmic sensor domain (PD) that transduces signals across the inner membrane to the cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain. Following activation of PhoQ by the phagosomal environment, PhoP is phosphorylated and transcriptionally controls a large network of genes (&gt;300), many of which are involved in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fields et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behlau and Miller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belden and Miller, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gunn and Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bearson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bader et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalebroux et al., 2014</xref>). Precise PhoPQ-mediated gene regulation is essential for salmonellae infection as strains with null or constitutively active mutations in PhoPQ are highly attenuated for virulence in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fields et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Galán and Curtiss, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller and Mekalanos, 1990</xref>).</p><p>The PhoQ PD is a member of the PAS-fold and PDC-fold domain families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung and Hendrickson, 2010</xref>). Unlike other PDC-sensors, which bind small ligands in a defined binding pocket or PhoQ PD homologs found in environmental bacteria, the PhoQ PD from bacteria that primarily interact with animals has no apparent binding pocket due to an occluding structural element: α-helices 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prost et al., 2008</xref>). Acidic residues on α4 and α5 and β-strands 5 and 6 in the PhoQ PD form a structural scaffold for binding antimicrobial peptides, as well as the divalent cations Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waldburger and Sauer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prost et al., 2008</xref>). PhoQ kinase activity is repressed and phosphatase activity is dominant at millimolar or greater concentrations of divalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montagne et al., 2001</xref>), presumably due to divalent cation salt-bridges formed between the PD acidic patch and inner membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, PhoQ activity is repressed by feedback inhibition involving the small inner membrane protein, MgrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lippa and Goulian, 2009</xref>). Conversely, bacterial growth in sub-millimolar divalent cation conditions results in PhoQ activation and increased kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996</xref>), presumably due to disruption of salt-bridges between the PhoQ PD and inner membrane. However, the macrophage phagosome has a magnesium concentration of approximately one millimolar and a calcium concentration of approximately 500 micromolar, suggesting PhoQ is not activated by divalent cation limitation during intracellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</xref>). At one millimolar divalent cation concentration, PhoQ can be activated by exposure to pH 5.5 or sub-inhibitory concentrations of CAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>). These are relevant host signals as the macrophage phagosome acidifies to approximately pH 5.5 and contains CAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rathman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, neutralization of acidified macrophage intracellular compartments with chemical inhibitors results in decreased PhoQ-mediated gene expression during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</xref>). Combined, these findings suggested a model in which acidic pH and CAMP activate PhoQ within the macrophage phagosome; however, the individual contribution of these signals to PhoQ-mediated virulence remained unknown.</p><p>Acidic pH and CAMP additively activate PhoQ suggesting that the PD has distinct sensing mechanisms for these stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>). A variety of experimental data indicate that CAMP directly compete with divalent cations for binding sites within the PhoQ PD acidic patch, leading to a model in which CAMP activates PhoQ by disrupting salt-bridges with the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al., 2005</xref>). The mechanism by which PhoQ is activated by acidic pH appears to be distinct from CAMP and involves perturbations to a network of residues surrounding H157 within the α/β-core of the PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we defined conformational changes that occur within the PhoQ PD on exposure to acidic pH. Characterization of the conformational changes induced by acidic pH inspired the construction of PhoQ variants which are impaired for acidic pH and divalent cation sensing, but retain their ability to respond to CAMP. Prior to this study, it was unclear which signals were important for PhoQ-mediated virulence. Utilizing these PhoQ variants, we have now established that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing are dispensable signals for PhoQ-mediated systemic virulence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium, suggesting that CAMP or other host molecules facilitate PhoQ-dependent pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Residues in the PhoQ PD that are dynamic during pH-titration localize proximal to the interface between α-helices 4 and 5 and the α/β-core</title><p>PhoQ is activated in acidic conditions in vitro and within the acidified environment of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) after phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore, to further understand PhoQ dynamics during activation by acidic pH we collected a series of (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC-NMR spectra of the PhoQ PD as a function of pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To extract residue information from the spectra, resonance assignments were determined for the PhoQ PD at pH 3.5, the condition that yielded the greatest number of observable resonances. Of the 138 residues that can yield HSQC signals, 120 resonances could be assigned in the spectrum at pH 3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The remarkably well dispersed spectrum indicates that the PD remains stably folded, even at pH of 3.5.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06792.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The annotated PhoQ PD (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC-NMR spectrum reveals significant peak shifting and broadening during pH titration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC-NMR spectra of neutral to acidic pH-titration of the PhoQ PD.

Such processes will appear in the so-called ‘fast-exchange’ NMR regime due to the rapid on/off rate of protons. Many resonances in the PD spectra exhibited pH-dependent fast-exchange behavior, consistent with ionization of the many histidine and acidic residues. In addition, some resonances broadened and disappeared from the spectrum as a function of pH. This behavior corresponds to intermediate-to-slow exchange and is indicative of a conformational change or the existence of multiple states that interconvert slowly. Thus, pH-dependent changes in the PhoQ PD HSQC spectra reveal regions of the domain that experience changes in functional group ionization and conformational dynamics.</p><p>Spectra, collected at pH 3.5 and pH 6.5, were compared to identify regions in the PhoQ PD that are sensitive to changes in pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Resonances that experienced significant pH-dependent chemical shift perturbations (CSPs &gt; 0.08 ppm) or broadened beyond detection, localize to regions of the protein that contain ionizable functional groups and/or experience conformational dynamics; thereby defining pH-responsive regions in the domain. Of the 120 assigned residues in the PhoQ PD, resonances from 42 residues were affected by transition from pH 6.5 to 3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Due to resonance overlap and broadening, it is difficult to partition the two spectroscopic effects throughout the comparison. Approximately, 20 affected resonances broadened beyond detection at pH 6.5, consistent with pH-dependent conformational dynamics in the PhoQ PD. Furthermore, 66 resonances were relatively unaffected, indicating that the PhoQ PD has pH-insensitive regions.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06792.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The PhoQ PD experiences significant pH-dependent perturbations which map to α4 and α5 and the α/β-core.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC-NMR spectra of the PhoQ PD at pH 6.5 (magenta) and pH 3.5 (black).

A majority of residues affected by pH localize to α1, α2, α4, and α5 and proximal regions, including β5, β6, and β7. As an independent approach, we randomly mutagenized the PD to identify mutations that activate PhoQ in the presence of repressing concentrations of divalent cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). pH-sensitive regions identified in the NMR experiments overlap or are proximal to many of the mutations identified in our screen for activating mutations in the PhoQ PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, asterisks). Similar to the activating mutations, a majority of the pH-sensitive residues form an interconnected network which spans α4 and α5 and the α/β-core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data suggested that PhoQ PD residues and structural features important for activation and repression undergo conformational change during pH titration. A majority of the residues that were unaffected by changes in pH mapped distally to α4 and α5, providing support for the hypothesis that the detection and response to pH is contained within localized structural elements of the PD. Altogether, these observations are consistent with a model where fluctuations in pH promote local conformational dynamics between α4 and α5 and the α/β-core as part of the pH sensing mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A disulfide bond between α-helices 2 and 4 within the PhoQ PD inhibits activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation, but does not restrict activation by CAMP</title><p>The NMR and mutagenesis data suggested that α4 and α5 are dynamic and that the relationship between the two helices and the α/β-core of the PD likely plays a role in activation.

These environments include a variety of antimicrobial factors for which the bacteria must regulate inducible resistance mechanisms in order to survive. These bacterial resistance mechanisms are essential for successful infection, necessitating tight regulation by sensors such as PhoQ. Our study defines α4 and α5 in the PhoQ PD as a pH-responsive structural element that experiences a change in its dynamic behavior upon transition to acidic pH. Furthermore, mutations within the PhoQ PD, predicted to destabilize hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding between the α/β-core and α4 and α5, resulted in loss of PhoQ repression. Limiting flexibility between these structural elements by introduction of a disulfide bond inhibited PhoQ activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. We suggest that PhoQ has evolved α4 and α5 as a unique pH-responsive structural element within the PD, effectively replacing the ligand-binding site that is often found in a similar location in other structurally related PDC sensor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheung and Hendrickson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>This study provides insights for a refined model of PhoQ activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At neutral pH and millimolar divalent cation concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, left), the PhoQ PD is anchored to the inner membrane in a repressed state via cation-bridges, a rigid α/β-core and TDK network, and quiescent α4 and α5. Acidic pH or divalent cation limitation promotes a change in α4 and α5 from a stable to a dynamic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, middle). Acidic pH-induced flexibility in α4 and α5 may destabilize divalent cation salt-bridges between the inner membrane and acidic patch, thereby promoting a loss of divalent cation-mediated repression. Lack of divalent cation salt-bridges between the PhoQ PD acidic patch and inner membrane due to divalent cation limitation may result in electrostatic repulsion between the acidic patch and inner membrane, releasing α4 and α5, and favoring a more flexible state in this structural element. Changes in the relationship between α4 and α5 and the α/β-core surrounding H157 are transmitted to the dimerization interface and TDK network proximal to the membrane resulting in alterations of the transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic HAMP domain, and ultimately resulting in increased PhoQ kinase activity.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06792.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of PhoQ activation and repression.</title><p>(Left) At neutral pH and millimolar divalent cation concentration, the PhoQ PD is maintained in a repressed conformation due to rigidified interactions between the α/β-core (yellow spheres), α4 and α5, and salt-bridges (bronze spheres) formed between the acidic patch (red spheres) and inner membrane.

This model is consistent with predictions previously made in relation to the discovery of the divalent cation bridges between the PhoQ acidic patch and negatively charged membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Molnar et al suggest that the PhoQ PD assumes alternative conformations as the acidic patch moves away from the membrane in the absence of divalent cation. Our findings that restricting movement in α4 and α5 inhibits PhoQ activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation supports the model that the acidic patch and α4 and α5 must remain dynamic for proper signaling. Furthermore, our observations that PhoQ activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are separable from CAMP-mediated activation may indicate that distinct conformational states exist for each of the unique PhoQ-activating and -repressing stimuli.</p><p>Results presented here indicate that α4 and α5 within the PhoQ PD do not adopt a distinct conformation under activating pH conditions, but rather exchange between a rigid, repressed state and an ensemble of conformations that together constitute the acidic pH-activated state. Unlike other pH-sensors that utilize discrete histidine protonation as a mechanism of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williamson et al., 2013</xref>), PhoQ activation by acidic pH does not appear to rely strictly on protonation of histidines. Mutagenesis of H157, which is located in the PhoQ PD α/β-core and is observed to form hydrogen bonds with T129 on α4 and the backbone hydroxyl of T180 on the β7-α6 loop, results in a modest increase in activity; however, it does not account for the entire pH-mediated activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>). Mutation of the other two histidines in the PD (H137 and H120) did not significantly affect activation or repression of PhoQ (data not shown). An alternate mechanism of PhoQ activation by acidic pH may involve pH-induced conformational changes within the periplasmic dimerization interface. Notably, an intermolecular disulfide at position T61C in the PhoQ PD dimerization interface results in increased PhoQ-dependent reporter activity at pH 5.5, suggesting that conformational changes in the dimerization interface can directly affect signal transduction (data not shown). Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that the PhoQ PD dimer dissociates as the pH decreases (data not shown). Additionally, work by Molnar et al support the notion that conformational changes with the dimerization interface are concomitant with activation and repression. Recently, it was shown that the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> chemotaxis receptor, TlpB, utilizes a unique mechanism to sense acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goers Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the TlpB PD may sense pH by adopting a ‘relaxed’ conformation at low pH due to decreased hydrogen bonding to a coordinated urea molecule. It is plausible that similar relaxation may occur in the PhoQ PD between the α/β-core and helices α4 and α5 upon exposure to acidic pH. Therefore, pH-induced conformational changes resulting in structural relaxation or flexibility may be an important mechanism by which pH can be sensed.</p><p>Our previous work suggests that PhoQ activation by acidic pH and CAMP proceed via different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prost et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we have shown that activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are separable from CAMP-mediated activation by rigidifying the interaction between α4 and α5 and the α/β-core. Perhaps, CAMP circumvents α4 and α5 and activates PhoQ via direct interactions within the transmembrane regions adjacent to the acidic patch or disrupts local phospholipid packing promoting conformational changes in the periplasmic and transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, right). Alternatively, it is plausible that CAMP functions as a large steric ‘wedge’. In this scenario, CAMP is recruited to the acidic patch of PhoQ resulting in conformational changes in the PD overcoming any repressive structural constraints between α4 and α5 and the α/β-core.</p><p>Determining the host signals which activate PhoQ has been difficult; past investigations have relied on alterations to host processes via chemical inhibitors to neutralize acidic compartments or targeted mutagenesis to remove known PhoQ-activating antimicrobial peptides from host animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin-Orozco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richards et al., 2012</xref>). Although informative, these studies do not account for unintended host-cell changes due to chemical neutralization of acidic vesicles and organelles or uncharacterized host peptides or molecules which may activate the system. For example, distinct pH-gradients are established and required in eukaryotic vesicular trafficking pathways and chemical neutralization of acidic compartments within these pathways results in a variety of cellular disturbances including inhibition of acidic hydrolases and proteases, perturbation of molecular sorting and recycling, endocytosis and exocytosis dysregulation, and disruption of vesicular fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dean et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mellman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casey et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, chemical neutralization of the SCV is detrimental to intracellular <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium as it results in decreased bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rathman et al., 1996</xref>), presumably due to lack of virulence factor expression. Therefore, it is plausible that the use of chemical inhibitors to block or neutralize acidic host-compartments inhibits processes involved in CAMP maturation or trafficking, thereby preventing activation of PhoQ.</p><p>It is plausible that undefined host molecules or conditions, that require defined pH-gradients, activate PhoQ in vivo. Our observations that activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are not required for significant increases in PhoQ-dependent gene expression in BALB/c macrophage and that PhoQ-dependent gene expression is induced in CRAMP-deficient macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richards et al., 2012</xref>) indicate that uncharacterized host factors, which are likely to be a variety of different cationic antimicrobial molecules, activate PhoQ. Furthermore, multiple host peptides may activate PhoQ in vivo as various host and synthetically derived cationic peptides can activate the system; this is consistent with the large PhoQ PD acidic patch which likely evolved to bind diverse CAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bader et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shprung et al., 2012</xref>). From these observations, it is reasonable to speculate that the acidic patch, located on the α4/α5 structural unit within the PhoQ PD of bacteria that interact with animals, evolved to sense a variety of cationic peptides, as the PhoQ PD from environmental bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> lack these important structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prost et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Though it is tempting to speculate that CAMP may be the dominant PhoQ-stimulant during systemic infection, it is important to remember that sensing may be redundant or host-compartment specific. Further experiments will need to be performed to examine the contribution of acidic pH and divalent cation sensing to PhoQ-mediated bacterial survival during transition from the intestinal tract to systemic environments and determine if ‘bacterial innate immunity’ or the recognition of multiple mammalian signals is redundant. Additionally, perhaps acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ are functions required for survival in <italic>ex vivo</italic> environments, beyond animal hosts.</p><p>The work in this study led to the construction of a specific <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium PhoQ mutant that is inhibited for activation by acidic pH or divalent cation limitation.

Although we have shown that the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> disulfide forms in purified proteins and in bacteria grown in culture, we did not measure disulfide formation for W104C-A128C within host tissues. Host compartments replete with strong oxidizing agents, such as the macrophage phagosome, could potentially disrupt disulfide bond formation. However, multiple <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence factors and homeostatic processes that occur in the macrophage phagosome require disulfide bond formation, indicating that <italic>S. enterica</italic> has robust mechanisms to regulate redox potential and resist hyperoxidation of thiols in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ellermeier and Slauch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lippa and Goulian, 2012</xref>).

Disulfide bond formation in PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Briefly, strain CS1101 or KH85 were grown in LB media supplemented with 100 mg∙l<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin for all non-labeling experiments. For <sup>15</sup>N-labeling and NMR experiments, strain CS1101 was grown in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with 100 mg∙l<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin and 1 g∙l<sup>−1</sup> <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium chloride.

The pH was lowered by approximately 0.5 units at a time by addition of microliter aliquots of 500 mM DCl. HSQC spectra from the pH-titration were collected at pH 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 4.9, 4.1, and 3.5. Standard triple-resonance experiments were collected a pH 3.5 for assignments. Assignments from pH 3.5 were translated to higher pH conditions by tracking chemical shifts through the titration series. NMR experiments were performed at 25°C on a Bruker DMX 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance, triple-axis gradient probe. Data were processed and analyzed using the programs NMRPipe/NMRDraw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and NMRView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson and Blevins, 1994</xref>).</p><p>To identify regions of the PhoQ PD affected by pH, (<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N)-HSQC-NMR spectra of the PhoQ PD were compared at pH 6.5 and 3.5. Resonances that experienced a chemical shift perturbation (CSP) greater than 0.08 ppm and/or that broadened beyond detection were considered significantly affected by pH. CSPs were calculated using the formula ((Δ<sup>1</sup>H) + (Δ<sup>15</sup>N/5))<sup>1/2</sup>. Resonances that did not meet these criteria were considered unaffected. 36 residues within the PhoQ PD could not be unambiguously categorized into these groups because of missing/ambiguous assignments and/or crowding in the spectra.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bacterial gene expression from growth in N-minimal media</title><p>Wild-type (CS093), <italic>phoQ</italic><sup><italic>W104C-A128C</italic></sup> (KH163), and <italic>ΔphoQ</italic> (CS1350) <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium were grown overnight in N-mm 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> pH 7.5.

The inoculum for PO competition experiments was prepared by equally mixing 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu of KH111 (strain A) with 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu of KH112, KH113, or KH114 (strain B) in 2 ml PBS. 6- to 8-week old female BALB/c mice were administered 0.2 ml of the mixture, for a total inoculation of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria for IP infections or 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria for PO infections. For PO competition experiments, mice were deprived food for 5 hr prior to administering bacteria by oral gavage. The inoculum was confirmed for each experiment by plating dilutions on LB media supplemented with either 50 µg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> kanamycin or 100 µg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin. Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation at 48-hpi (IP) or 96-hpi (PO) and spleens were harvested and homogenized in PBS. Homogenized spleens were serial diluted and plated on LB media supplemented with either 50 µg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> kanamycin or 100 µg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> ampicillin in order to determine the cfu∙ml<sup>−1</sup> bacterial burden for each strain. The competitive index (CI) for each strain was calculated using the following formula: CI = (strain B cfu∙ml<sup>−1 spleen</sup>/strain A cfu∙ml<sup>−1 spleen</sup>)/(strain B cfu∙ml<sup>−1 inoculum</sup>/strain A cfu∙ml<sup>−1</sup> <sup>inoculum</sup>).</p><p>For single-strain experiments, cultures of CS093, KH163, and CS1350 were grown overnight in LB media and prepared by serial dilution in PBS. The inoculum was confirmed for each experiment by plating dilutions on LB media. 6- to 8-week old female BALB/c or A/J mice were infected IP with approximately 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cfu in 0.2 ml PBS. Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation at 48- and 96-hpi and spleens were harvested and homogenized in PBS. Homogenized spleens were serial diluted and plated on LB media in order to determine the cfu∙ml<sup>−1</sup> bacterial burden for each strain. All mouse experiments were performed with IACUC approval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bacterial growth curve</title><p>Wild type (CS093), <italic>phoQ</italic><sup><italic>W104C-A128C</italic></sup> (KH163), and <italic>ΔphoQ</italic> (CS1350) were grown overnight in N-mm pH 7.5 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Hicks et al. first performed genetic mutagenesis analyses and NMR structural analyses of PhoQ PD to reveal the mechanism of PhoQ sensing of acid pH. They identified α4 and α5 and their interactions with the α/β core as the pH-responsive structural element; residues with these structural regions experience ionization and dynamic conformational changes upon transition to acid pH condition. Bases on the proposed structural mechanism, the authors then designed a PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant that has an internal disulfide bond expected to restrict the conformal changes of α4/α5 required for sensing acidic pH. Significantly, the mutant does not respond to acidic pH and divalent limitation-induced PhoQ activation by still can mediate cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) activation of PhoQ. This is particularly important as it is for the first time to separate the function of PhoQ sensing of CAMP from sensing the acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. When expressed in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the authors provided strong data demonstrating that the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant behaved similarly as the WT protein in bacterial replication both in cultured macrophages as well as in infected animals. These data potentially resolve a longstanding puzzle about the in vivo function of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component system, i.e. regulating bacterial virulence mainly by responding to CAMP rather than acidification of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing phagosome and divalent cation limitation. PhoQ is one of the major regulators of pathogenesis in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, and is also one of the most well studied histidine kinases. The results presented in this paper are interesting and important, and will be of broad interest. The authors should consider the following points to revise the manuscript.</p><p>Major comments: 1) A major part of the paper depends on the claim that PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> is insensitive to acid pH and divalent cations and sensitive to CAMPs. However, the only evidence is based on a single <italic>phoN</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Given the importance of this property of the PhoQ mutant for the rest of the paper, a little more evidence should be presented to support the claim. Similar data showing that pH and divalent cations do not affect PhoQ-dependent transcription (but CAMPs do) for <italic>phoP</italic> and some other well-studied gene should be shown.</p><p>2) CAMP directly competes with divalent cation for binding sites in the PhoQ PD acidic patch, suggesting a model that the CAMP activates PhoQ by disrupting salt-bridges with the inner membrane. If the CAMP functions through a similar mechanism as the divalent cation in inducing the conformational changes of PhoQ (Figure 7), why the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant that lost the response to divalent cation limitation can still respond to the CAMP. The authors should clarify this in their presentation.</p><p>3) The PhoQ PD can directly interact with the CAMP via the acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader 2005</xref>). Is it possible to measure the binding constant and kinetics? If so, the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> mutant should exhibit a different behavior, for example on an ITC binding assay, due to its restricted motion in α4/α5 structure. Related to the potential mechanism of PhoQ PD sensing of the CAMP, the authors should mention whether there is a functional PhoQ mutant deficient in responding to the CAMP that they are aware of (what about the 14 mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>?).</p><p>4) In the Discussion, it is stated: “Further experiments will need to be performed to examine the contribution of acidic pH and divalent cation sensing to PhoQ-mediated bacterial survival during transition from the intestinal tract to systemic environments and determine if ‘bacterial innate immunity’ or the recognition of multiple mammalian signals is redundant.” The authors should test their PhoQ mutant in competition with wild-type in oral infection of mice. Either outcome (WT outcompetes the mutant or they have the same CI) would be interesting, and this experiment is important for conveying the full significance of the authors’ work and should be straightforward to do.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06792.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A major part of the paper depends on the claim that PhoQ</italic><sup><italic>W104C-A128C</italic></sup> <italic>is insensitive to acid pH and divalent cations and sensitive to CAMPs.

Although <italic>pagD</italic>, <italic>pagO</italic>, and <italic>phoN</italic> are highly upregulated in a PhoQ-dependent manner, in our hands, <italic>phoP</italic> transcription displayed only slight to moderate induction.

Furthermore, our findings are not mutually exclusive from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al. 2005</xref>. Perhaps CAMP activates PhoQ in a series of steps beginning with the displacement of divalent cations at the acidic patch, followed by interactions with the adjacent periplasmic domain or transmembrane regions or disruption of local phospholipid packing. Further investigation will be required to determine the mechanism by which CAMP activates PhoQ. We have clarified this in the Discussion by suggesting possible mechanisms by which CAMP activates PhoQ.</p><p><italic>3) The PhoQ PD can directly interact with the CAMP via the acidic patch (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><italic>Bader 2005</italic></xref><italic>).

We have previously measured cationic peptide binding to the purified periplasmic domain and are not sure why we would reevaluate this given our observation that CAMP activates wild type and <italic>phoQ</italic><sup><italic>W104C-A128C</italic></sup> similarly, suggesting that the binding interactions are roughly equivalent. Additionally, the known CAMP and divalent cation binding sites in the acidic patch were not significantly altered in the PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> PD structure. Measuring CAMP binding affinity of wild type and PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> should ideally be performed in the context of a membrane, as soluble domains may not necessarily reflect physiological binding interactions. Such experiments seem outside the scope of this study, would be difficult to develop and perform, and would delay timely publication and dissemination of our results to interested investigators.</p><p>We have not identified a mutation that exclusively abolishes PhoQ activation by CAMP without perturbing the response to acidic pH and/or divalent cation limitation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader et al. 2005</xref> defined a mutation in the acidic patch (T156K E184K) that reduces PhoQ activation by CAMP; however, recent reevaluation has revealed that this mutant also displays perturbed activation by divalent cation limitation, which was expected since it forms a metal binding site (unpublished observations). Extensive point-mutations in the PhoQ PD acidic patch can lead to reduced activation by CAMP, but activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation are also perturbed (unpublished observations). Further significant investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism by which CAMP activates PhoQ.</p><p><italic>4) In the Discussion, it is stated: “Further experiments will need to be performed to examine the contribution of acidic pH and divalent cation sensing to PhoQ-mediated bacterial survival during transition from the intestinal tract to systemic environments and determine if ‘bacterial innate immunity’ or the recognition of multiple mammalian signals is redundant.” The authors should test their PhoQ mutant in competition with wild-type in oral infection of mice.

As requested, peroral competition infections in BALB/c mice were performed similar to our intraperitoneal competition infections to determine whether acidic pH and/or divalent cation sensing by PhoQ is important in host sites prior to systemic spread. Although more variable due to the nature of the experiment, we observed competitive indices between <italic>wt</italic>/<italic>wt</italic> and <italic>wt</italic>/<italic>phoQ</italic><sup><italic>W104C-A128</italic></sup> in the spleen similar to the IP competitions. <italic>ΔphoQ</italic> had a lower mean competitive index, as expected.
