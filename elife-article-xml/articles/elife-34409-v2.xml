Decapping is required for general 5’ to 3’ mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>), nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He and Jacobson, 2001</xref>), AU-rich element-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fenger-Grøn et al., 2005</xref>), microRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006</xref>), and transcript-specific degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2004</xref>). In yeast, mRNA decapping is carried out by a single enzyme comprised of a regulatory subunit (Dcp1) and a catalytic subunit (Dcp2). Dcp1 is a small EVH domain protein essential for mRNA decapping in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">She et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beelman et al., 1996</xref>) and Dcp2 is a 970-amino acid protein containing a highly conserved Nudix domain at its N-terminus and a large extension at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaudon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunckley, 1999</xref>). The Dcp2 N-terminal domain is essential for the catalysis of cap removal, but may also have additional regulatory activity, as this domain also contains the binding site for Dcp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">She et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>) and interacts with the activation motif of a short Edc1 peptide in vitro in the presence of Dcp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mugridge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valkov et al., 2016</xref>). The decapping role of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain is largely unknown. However, our recent experiments reveal that this domain includes both negative and positive regulatory elements that control both the substrate specificity and the activation of the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme, mRNA decapping also requires the functions of specific regulators commonly dubbed ‘decapping activators’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>). A large number of decapping activators have been identified in yeast and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>), and these factors appear to target distinct classes of mRNA substrates. Pat1, Dhh1, and the Lsm1-7 complex are required for decapping of general wild-type mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>), and NMD-specific regulators (Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3) are required for decapping of nonsense-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He and Jacobson, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicholson and Mühlemann, 2010</xref>). Edc3 manifests the most fastidious substrate specificity, being required for decapping of only the yeast <italic>YRA1</italic> pre-mRNA and <italic>RPS28B</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2004</xref>). Two additional factors, Edc1 and Edc2, originally isolated as high-copy suppressors of specific mutations in <italic>DCP1</italic> and <italic>DCP2</italic>, by themselves appear to be not required for mRNA decapping in vivo but can enhance mRNA decapping in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunckley et al., 2001</xref>). All of these decapping activators are conserved from yeast to humans, but their precise functions in mRNA decapping regulation are largely unknown. The two major functions proposed for yeast decapping activators, translational repression and decapping enzyme activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>), are still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yeast decapping activators exhibit highly specific interactions with each other and with the decapping enzyme. Pat1 interacts with both Dhh1 and the Lsm1-7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3 interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 1997</xref>), and Edc3 interacts with Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>). Pat1, Upf1, and Edc3 also interact with specific binding motifs in the large C-terminal domain of Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harigaya et al., 2010</xref>). These interaction data and additional observations led us to propose a new model for regulation of mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>) in which different decapping activators form distinct decapping complexes in vivo, each of which has a unique substrate specificity that targets a subset of yeast mRNAs. To test aspects of this model, and to further understand the roles of Pat1, Dhh1, and the Lsm1-7 complex in general mRNA decapping we have analyzed the effects of deletions of the <italic>PAT1</italic>, <italic>LSM1</italic>, or <italic>DHH1</italic> genes and the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation. Our results reveal a critical role for the Dcp2 C-terminal domain in regulating mRNA decapping, demonstrate that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 control the decapping of specific subsets of yeast mRNAs, and uncover substantial indirect consequences of mutations in genes encoding components of the decapping apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elimination of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain causes significant changes in genome-wide mRNA expression</title><p>We previously identified multiple regulatory elements in the large C-terminal domain of Dcp2, including one negative element that inhibits in vivo decapping activity and a set of positive elements that promote both substrate specificity and decapping activation. The latter appear to operate by binding to specific decapping activators such as Upf1, Edc3, and Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). To extend our previous study and to further assess the roles of these Dcp2 regulatory elements in in vivo decapping control, we analyzed the effect of C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation. RNA-Seq was used to analyze transcript populations in wild-type yeast cells and in cells harboring the previously characterized <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). This allele produces a Dcp2 decapping enzyme that contains only the first 245 amino acids of the protein, and appears to have constitutively activated and indiscriminate decapping activity, at least with respect to the limited number of mRNAs analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). As with any mutation, truncation of Dcp2 could have a direct effect on mRNA decapping, or it could have an indirect effect on overall gene expression. To identify those transcripts directly affected by C-terminal truncation of Dcp2, we constructed two additional isogenic strains with severely compromised decapping activity and included these two strains in our RNA-Seq experiments. These strains, dubbed <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic>, harbor the same <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> allele but each also contains one additional function-inactivating mutation in an active site residue of the Dcp2 Nudix domain, that is glutamate (E) to glutamine (Q) substitutions at codon positions 153 and 198, respectively. E153 of Dcp2 has been shown to function as a general base during the hydrolysis reaction and E198 is involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination within the Nudix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aglietti et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>E153Q</italic> and <italic>E198Q</italic> mutations essentially eliminate the decapping activity of Dcp2 both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aglietti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>).</p><p>RNA-Seq libraries prepared from wild-type cells and from the isogenic strains harboring the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic>, <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245,</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> alleles showed good read count distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and notable consistency between biological replicates, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Utilizing previously described data analysis pipelines for transcript quantitation and assessment of differential expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2017</xref>), we identified the transcripts that were differentially expressed in each of the mutant strains relative to the wild-type strain. The decapping-deficient <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strains exhibited significant numbers of transcripts that were differentially expressed. We identified 1921 up-regulated and 1845 down-regulated transcripts in the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> strain, and 1346 up-regulated and 1428 down-regulated transcripts in the <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,D</xref>). Given the general requirement for the decapping enzyme in yeast mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>), the detection of a large number of up-regulated transcripts in these two strains was not surprising, that is the up-regulated transcripts are most likely <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates of the yeast decapping enzyme. In support of this interpretation, the up-regulated transcript lists from these strains contain all our previously characterized individual decapping substrates and also exhibited highly significant overlap with the up-regulated transcript lists from <italic>dcp1∆</italic>, <italic>dcp2∆</italic>, <italic>xrn1∆</italic>, and <italic>upf1/2/3∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the finding that a large number of transcripts was also down-regulated in the two decapping-inactive strains was surprising. Similar observations were also made in our recent RNA-Seq analyses of <italic>dcp1∆</italic> and <italic>dcp2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that general inhibition of mRNA decapping may also have severe secondary effects on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34409.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of transcripts differentially expressed in <italic>dcp2-N245, dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin and box plots displaying the average and median read count distributions of the RNA-Seq libraries from <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>dcp2-N245</italic>, <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strains in three independent experiments.

This analysis revealed only 21 differentially expressed transcripts between these two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, leftmost panel). From this result, we conclude that there is no fundamental difference in expression patterns between the two strains. However, because the two strains harbor different <italic>dcp2</italic> alleles, the encoded decapping enzymes may have slightly different albeit significantly reduced activities. Thus, some subtle differences in levels of expression may actually exist for a large number of transcripts between the two strains, as we noticed in our validation experiments (see below). The subtle differences in levels of expression for these transcripts were likely captured in the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> vs. <italic>WT</italic> but not in the <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> vs. <italic>WT</italic> comparison.</p><p>Elimination of the entire C-terminal domain of Dcp2 significantly altered genome-wide mRNA expression. Compared to WT cells, a total of 1530 transcripts were differentially expressed in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells: 616 transcripts showed up-regulation and 914 transcripts showed down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). To assess the specific effect of the C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 on mRNA decapping, we compared the expression pattern of the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain to the patterns of the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Transcripts differentially expressed in these three strains shared a partial overlap, but also exhibited notable differences. A significant fraction of transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain (324 out of 616 for the up-regulated, and 650 out 914 for the down-regulated) had concordant up- or down-regulation in the catalytically inactive strains. Interestingly, the majority of transcripts differentially expressed in the catalytically inactive strains (1567 out of 1891 for the up-regulated, and 1261 out of 1911 for the down-regulated) had unchanged levels in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain. Furthermore, a significant fraction of transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain (292 out 616 for the up-regulated, and 264 out of 914 for the down-regulated) had unchanged levels in the catalytically inactive strains. Together, these results indicate that the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain and the two catalytically inactive strains have largely different global mRNA expression patterns and suggest that the C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 does not block general mRNA decapping, but causes deregulation of decapping for specific mRNAs. To further support this conclusion, we carried direct pairwise comparisons between the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> and the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> libraries.

Because the levels of transcripts from this group were not altered in <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> cells, we reasoned that their decreased accumulation in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells was likely to be caused by accelerated or indiscriminate decapping by a constitutively activated Dcp2 decapping enzyme which had lost its negative regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether elimination of <italic>XRN1,</italic> a gene encoding the 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease that functions downstream of decapping, can restore the levels of the down-regulated transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells.

We selected eleven representative transcripts from the down-regulated group and employed northern blotting to analyze the decay phenotypes of these transcripts in the respective single and double mutant strains. Among the eleven selected transcripts, nine (<italic>GDH1, ARL1, DAL3, YGL117W, RPS9A</italic>, <italic>SUC2, CPA1, HIS4,</italic> and <italic>SER3)</italic> are typical decapping substrates and two (<italic>HCA1</italic> pre-mRNA and <italic>HSP82</italic> mRNA) are atypical decapping substrates, that is the latter are normally subject to degradation by other decay pathways.

Deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> completely restored the mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells for almost all transcripts. In contrast, elimination of <italic>SKI2</italic> or <italic>SKI7</italic> had no effect on mRNA levels for each of the eleven transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells. These results validate our RNA-Seq analyses and demonstrate that decreased accumulation of these representative transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells is indeed caused by accelerated or opportunistic decapping of the mRNAs.

Because Pat1 interacts with both Lsm1 and Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>) we sought to ascertain that the observed overlapping substrate specificities for Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 originated from specific activating functions of these factors, and not from the secondary effects of co-depletion of their interacting partners. Accordingly, we analyzed the levels of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in specific gene deletion backgrounds by employing genomic TAP-tagged <italic>PAT1</italic>, <italic>LSM1</italic>, or <italic>DHH1</italic> alleles known to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>PAT1</italic> had little or no effect on the levels of expression of Lsm1 and Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Similarly, deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> also had no significant effect on the levels of expression of Pat1 and Lsm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Deletion of <italic>LSM1</italic> had no effect on the level expression of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), but consistent with a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnerot et al., 2000</xref>), decreased the level of expression of Pat1 to 35% of its level in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The decreased accumulation of Pat1 in the absence of Lsm1 does not contradict our overall interpretation of overlapping mRNA expression patterns between <italic>pat1</italic>∆ and <italic>lsm1</italic>∆ cells, and, in fact, this observation strengthens our conclusion that Pat1 and Lsm1 function together to promote mRNA decapping. Collectively, these results indicate that the observed overlapping substrate specificities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are attributable to their specific activating functions in mRNA decapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of transcripts uniquely and commonly targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1</title><p>Based on the well established in vivo functions and in vitro activities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tharun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>), we considered the up-regulated transcripts in the <italic>pat1</italic>∆, <italic>lsm1</italic>∆ and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ strains to be direct substrates of these decapping activators for the most part, and the respective down-regulated transcripts in these strains to arise indirectly as a consequence of general defects in mRNA decapping (see above).

Transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups had significantly decreased levels in all six mutant strains. This result shows that transcripts from these two subgroups are sensitive to both partial and complete loss of decapping activity as well as to complete loss of the 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease activity. The concordant down-regulation observed for these transcripts in all our mRNA decay mutant strains strongly argues that they are indirectly controlled by the general 5’ to 3’ decay activities. Transcripts from the down-regulated Down-o-pl subgroup had significantly decreased levels in <italic>dcp1∆, dcp2∆, dcp2-E153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> cells but increased levels in <italic>xrn1∆</italic> and <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells.

In contrast, transcripts from the other two down-regulated subgroups (Down-o-d and Down-a-pld) appear to be controlled indirectly by the general 5’ to 3’ decay activities and thus are not the direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. To obtain further support for this conclusion, we analyzed the pattern of the codon protection index for transcripts in each of these six subgroups. This index is a measure of the degree of a transcript’s co-translational 5’ to 3’ decay and is defined as the ratio of sequencing reads in the ribosome protected frame over the average reads of the non-protected frames of the 5’ to 3’ decay intermediates from a specific transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Values greater than one are indicators of co-translational 5’ to 3’ decay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, transcripts from the Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, Up-a-pld, and Down-o-pl subgroups all had median codon protection index values greater than 1. In contrast, transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups both had median codon protection index values less than 1. These data strengthen our conclusion on the separation of differentially expressed transcripts into direct target and non-target categories. Based on their expression patterns, we suggest that transcripts from the Up-o-d subgroup are targeted by Dhh1, transcripts from the Up-o-pl and Down-o-pl subgroups are targeted by Pat1 and Lsm1, and transcripts from the Up-a-pld subgroup are targeted by all three factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Validation of transcripts controlled directly or indirectly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1</title><p>To validate the results from our RNA-Seq analyses and to assess the proposed decay mechanisms for transcripts in different subgroups controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1, we selected 34 transcripts (representing mRNAs from each subgroup) and analyzed both their levels and patterns of expression by northern blotting.

One implication of this notion is that in addition to providing targeting specificity for the decapping enzyme, decapping activators can also control each other’s activities indirectly by limiting or promoting the free pool of available decapping enzyme. A testable prediction of this dynamic mRNA decapping regulation is that, in addition to stabilizing its targeted transcripts, deletion of a specific activator may also promote the degradation of substrates of the alternative mRNA decay pathways. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the down-regulated subgroups from the differentially expressed transcripts in <italic>pat1</italic>∆, <italic>lsm1</italic>∆, and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells may contain NMD substrates. This analysis revealed that the three subgroups exhibited significantly different enrichment patterns for NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The Down-o-d subgroup (transcripts down-regulated only in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells) was enriched for NMD substrates (Fisher’s exact test, p = 7.3 × 10<sup>−15</sup>). In contrast, the Down-o-pl (transcripts down-regulated only in in <italic>pat1</italic>∆ and <italic>lsm1</italic>∆ cells) was depleted of NMD substrates (Fisher’s exact test, p = 6.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Finally, the Down-a-pld subgroup (transcripts down-regulated in all three deletion strains) showed neither enrichment for nor depletion of NMD substrates (Fisher’s exact test p = 0.12). These results provide additional evidence that transcripts from the Down-o-pl subgroup are direct targets of Pat1 and Lsm1, and show that the Down-o-d subgroup contains a fraction of NMD-targeted transcripts. To validate the latter observation, we selected five representative NMD substrates that were also down-regulated in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells and analyzed their expression levels and patterns in a set of yeast strains described above. As expected, northern analyses showed that all five transcripts (<italic>YIL164C</italic>, <italic>THI22</italic>, <italic>EST1</italic>, <italic>TRP1-1</italic>, and <italic>ALR2</italic>) had decreased levels in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells but increased levels in <italic>upf1</italic>∆, <italic>dcp1</italic>∆, <italic>dcp2</italic>∆, and <italic>xrn1</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, left panel). The decreased accumulation for these five transcripts in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells largely resulted from degradation by NMD as elimination of <italic>UPF1</italic> from <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells caused substantial increases (ranging from 4.0- to 21.6-fold) in the expression levels of each of these five transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, we also observed that <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ <italic>upf1</italic>∆ cells consistently accumulated lower levels (ranging from 28% to 81%) than <italic>upf1</italic>∆ cells for each of these five transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, right panel), suggesting that deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> can also promote NMD-independent degradation of these transcripts. Together, these results indicate that deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> can promote the degradation of a subset of NMD substrates by both NMD-dependent and NMD-independent mechanisms, thus arguing that decapping activators can indeed exert indirect control of each other’s activities in mRNA decapping. This may indicate that the decapping enzyme is limiting under normal growth conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dcp2 C-terminal domain imparts critical in vivo regulatory activities in mRNA decapping</title><p>The yeast Dcp2 decapping enzyme subunit has a modular structure encompassing a conserved 245-amino acid N-terminal Nudix catalytic domain and a 725-amino acid C-terminal extension. While the catalytic function of the N-terminal domain in cap removal is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Floor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">She et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">She et al., 2006</xref>), the decapping role of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain remains to be clarified. Here, we provide genetic evidence that the Dcp2 C-terminal domain imparts important regulatory activities to the decapping enzyme, thus playing a critical role in regulating mRNA decapping in vivo. Elimination of the C-terminal domain altered the expression of more than a quarter of yeast’s protein-coding genes and led to both up- and down-regulation of specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). A key observation supporting a predominantly regulatory role for the C-terminal domain is that transcripts differentially expressed in cells lacking the Dcp2 C-terminal domain only exhibited limited correlation with those differentially expressed in cells whose decapping activity was either severely comprised or essentially absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Our recent experiments revealed that the Dcp2 C-terminal domain harbors both negative and positive regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), leading us to propose that the decapping enzyme is subject to both negative and positive regulation. Recent biochemical data also supports this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paquette et al., 2018</xref>). Our expression profiling of yeast cells lacking the Dcp2 C-terminal domain provides direct experimental evidence for both aspects of this hypothesis. Negative regulation of the decapping enzyme is supported by the observations that deletion of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain led to decreases in the abundance of hundreds of specific transcripts, and that this down-regulation was dependent on maintenance of Dcp2’s catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Importantly, the vast majority of these down-regulated transcripts were not normal decapping substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that deletion of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain eliminates an inhibitory function of the domain and leads to uncontrolled and accelerated mRNA decapping by a constitutively activated and opportunistic Dcp2. Evidence for positive regulation of the decapping enzyme is provided by the observation that elimination of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain also caused up-regulation of hundreds of specific transcripts. As this group of transcripts also exhibited concordant up-regulation in decapping-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), it is likely that the observed up-regulation originates from a deficiency in mRNA decapping caused by loss of a positive regulatory function. Collectively, these observations indicate that the C-terminal domain of Dcp2 encodes important regulatory activities and that loss of these regulatory activities can have direct consequences on decapping of hundreds of specific mRNAs.</p><p>Over the past decade mechanistic investigations of mRNA decapping regulation have largely been focused on the 245-amino acid N-terminal domain of Dcp2, with essentially all biochemical and structural studies using this C-terminally truncated fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mugridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Floor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">She et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">She et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wurm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wurm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charenton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mugridge et al., 2018</xref>). This Dcp2 fragment binds to Dcp1, but lacks the binding sites for most decapping activators, including Pat1, Edc3, and Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). Our genetic experiments here reveal that this N-terminal fragment of Dcp2 encodes a constitutively active decapping enzyme in vivo that can target a variety of mRNAs including those that normally use or do not use decapping-dependent mechanisms in their degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Accordingly, current models of mRNA decapping regulation based on the Dcp2 N-terminal domain may be informative with respect to the catalytic step of decapping, but most likely do not reflect complex aspects of mRNA decapping regulation in vivo such as substrate selection and decapping enzyme activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity</title><p>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 have long been considered as general mRNA decapping activators and their functions are usually thought to be required for decapping of most wild-type mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tharun and Parker, 1999</xref>). Contrary to this expectation, our expression profiling experiments revealed that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are only required for decapping of a subset of transcripts in yeast cells and suggested that these factors have highly specific functions in controlling mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with strong in vivo physical interaction and shared in vitro RNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chowdhury et al., 2007</xref>), our results indicate that Pat1 and Lsm1 function together (probably as a Pat1-Lsm1-7 complex) to target the same set of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). Dhh1 targets a different set of transcripts that only partially overlaps with those targeted by both Pat1 and Lsm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>The partial overlap between transcripts commonly targeted by Pat1 and Lsm1 and those targeted by Dhh1 strongly indicates that these three decapping activators have distinct functions in mRNA decapping regulation and that decapping of individual mRNAs likely has different functional requirements for Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. For example, we identified transcripts regulated by Dhh1 but not by Pat1 and Lsm1 (the Up-o-d subgroup), transcripts regulated by Pat1 and Lsm1 but not by Dhh1 (the Up-o-pl and Down-o-pl subgroups), and transcripts regulated by all three factors (the Up-a-pld subgroup). Since the degradation of transcripts controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 individually or in combination is dependent on the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme and the Xrn1 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) the transcripts in these three groups are most likely <italic>bona fide</italic> decapping substrates. Accordingly, our observation that decapping of individual mRNAs can have different requirements for Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 suggests that mRNA decapping is a multi-step process and that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are likely to function at different steps of the decapping pathway. Given the genetic and physical interactions between Dhh1 and the Not1-Ccr4 deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rouya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maillet and Collart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozgur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>), and the physical interaction between Pat1 and Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charenton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), one possibility is that Dhh1 promotes deadenylation and that Pat1 and Lsm1 recruit the decapping enzyme. In addition, since Pat1 and Lsm1, but not Dhh1, also interact with Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charenton et al., 2017</xref>), the former two factors may also control a step after decapping, that is 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic digestion.</p><p>Transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 all appear to be translated inefficiently as they have relatively low average codon optimality scores, high ribosomal occupancy, and low protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations indicate that the functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in regulating decapping are probably linked to mRNA translation, a conclusion consistent with a recent study linking Dhh1 function in mRNA decay to translation elongation through codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). However, our results indicate that average codon optimality scores of individual mRNAs do not correlate well with a Dhh1 requirement for their decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Hence, the identity and distribution of non-optimal codons in an mRNA may influence the targeting specificity by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1.</p><p>Over past two decades models for the general functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in yeast mRNA decapping were largely generated by assessing the fate of the transcripts derived from two key reporter gene constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>).

These observations highlight potential drawbacks to the use of reporter gene assays and lead to uncertainty about existing models. Most importantly, since both reporter mRNAs are not regulated by Dhh1 it becomes difficult to justify models in which Dhh1 has a direct role in decapping of these transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 also have indirect roles in controlling genome-wide mRNA expression</title><p>Our expression profiling experiments revealed that, in addition to targeting specific mRNAs for decapping, Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 also have indirect roles in controlling mRNA expression in yeast and that eliminating the functions of any of these three factors can have severe consequences for global mRNA accumulation.

In contrast to the up-regulated transcripts, the vast majority of the down-regulated transcripts are not direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, or Dhh1 and their down-regulation is thus likely to result from an indirect consequence of losing the primary functions of these factors in mRNA decapping. Two subgroups of transcripts that are indirectly controlled by the activities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 were identified. One subgroup (Down-o-d) includes transcripts that were down-regulated only in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells and the other subgroup (Down-a-pld) includes transcripts that were down-regulated in all three deletion strains. The transcripts from these two subgroups exhibited concordant down-regulation in yeast cells partially compromised in, or completely lacking, decapping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups are sensitive to loss of both the regulatory and catalytic activities of mRNA decapping and argue that they are indirectly controlled by the status of general decapping activity in yeast cells.</p><p>Unlike the transcripts targeted directly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1, transcripts controlled indirectly by these factors are translated efficiently. Transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups generally have higher average codon optimality scores, lower ribosomal occupancy, and higher protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations suggest that the susceptibility of these transcripts to the loss of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 functions is likely to be dictated by their unique properties in translation. The Down-o-d subgroup contains a small set of NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and the decreased accumulation of these NMD-regulated transcripts in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells largely results from more efficient decapping by an NMD-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, right panel). Because Dhh1 forms several distinct complexes with the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritschler et al., 2009</xref>), more efficient decapping of NMD substrates in the absence of Dhh1 is likely caused by increases in the free pool of the decapping enzyme available for NMD as a consequence of <italic>DHH1</italic> deletion. The majority of transcripts controlled indirectly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are not typical decapping substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The decreased accumulation of these transcripts in the absence of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 probably results from more efficient 3’ to 5’ degradation. One possibility is that these transcripts are normally protected by an unknown factor at their 3’-ends. Inactivation of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 leads to the stabilization of a significant number of transcripts. The stabilized transcripts might sequester the unknown factor from their normal binding substrates and make the latter susceptible to 3’ to 5’ decay. An interesting implication of these observations is that deletion of the genes encoding regulators of other steps in the gene expression pathway may lead to similar indirect and opportunistic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reassessing the major functions of decapping activators</title><p>Current models of mRNA decapping propose two major temporally separated functions for decapping activators, an initial repression of mRNA translation followed by stimulation of the activity of the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Thus, for example, Dhh1 is thought to function principally in repressing translation, Edc3 is thought to activate the decapping enzyme, and Pat1 is thought to possess both activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). It is also generally believed that decapping of individual mRNAs requires the functions of multiple decapping activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Our results from in vivo expression profiling experiments presented here, and genetic analyses published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), challenge these views with data indicating that: a) the main function of decapping activators is to provide substrate specificity, that is to target the decapping enzyme to specific mRNAs; b) individual decapping activators target highly specific subsets of yeast transcripts and generally do not have overlapping regulatory activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>); and c) the decapping enzyme is subject to negative regulation and its activation is most likely coupled to substrate recognition. These principles are not dependent on translational repression, and accumulating experimental evidence indicates that prior translational repression may not be required for decapping to occur. Decapping of individual mRNAs occurs while they are still engaged in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) and this co-translational decay appears to be widespread, both in genome-wide analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>) and in our experiments evaluating the transcripts targeted by Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, decapping activators may not have primary roles in regulating mRNA translation, but instead may function by monitoring mRNA translation initiation, elongation, or termination to target unique

Five micrograms of DNase-treated total RNA was then depleted of rRNAs using the Illumina yeast RiboZero Removal Kit and the resulting RNA was used for RNA-Seq library preparation. Multiplex strand-specific cDNA libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit. Three independent cDNA libraries were prepared for each yeast strain analyzed.

R packages ggplot2, gplots, plyr, reshape2, and gridExtra were used for data pre-processing and visualization. Biostrings, BiocParallel, doSnow, and doParallel were used for parallel processing. Statistical tests were performed using built-in functions in base R distributions. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidian distances between libraries and transcripts with complete linkage. Non-finite (division by 0) and undefined (0 divided by 0) values were removed prior to clustering. The heights of the clustering tree branches indicate distance between two libraries. We used Fisher's exact test to assess different subsets of transcripts for either enrichment or depletion of a particular group of transcripts. We used external data (codon protection index, codon optimality, and protein abundance) as presented by the respective authors without any further refinement. Transcripts that were not included in these datasets were discarded prior to statistical testing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11-2"><title>Analysis of differential mRNA expression</title><p>Transcripts differentially expressed in each of the mutant strains relative to the corresponding wild-type strain were identified using bioinformatics pipelines described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> R64-2-1 S288C reference genome assembly (sacCer3) was used to construct a yeast transcriptome comprised of 7473 transcripts. This transcriptome includes all annotated protein-coding sequences, functional and non-coding RNAs, and the unspliced isoforms of all intron-containing genes, but excludes all of the autonomous replicating sequences and long terminal repeats of transposable elements. The RSEM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) was used to map sequence reads to the transcriptome and to quantify the levels of individual mRNAs with settings --bowtie-m 30 --no-bam-output --forward-prob 0. The expected read counts for individual mRNAs from RSEM were considered as the number of reads mapped to each transcript and were then imported into the Bioconductor DESeq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) for differential expression analysis. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used for multiple testing corrections. To account for replicate variability, we used a false discovery threshold of 0.01 (1%) instead of an arbitrary fold change cutoff as the criterion for differential expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11-3"><title>Analysis of potential mechanisms of mRNA decay</title><p>Our expression analysis identified the transcripts regulated by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. To assess the potential decay mechanisms for the respective sets of transcripts, we analyzed the expression patterns of these mRNAs in mutant cells deficient in decapping or 5’ to 3’ exoribonuclease activities. In addition, to assess the degree of co-translational decay, we also analyzed the codon protection indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>) of these mRNAs in wild-type yeast cells under normal growth coditions. In our analyses, transcripts regulated by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 could be divided into six different subgroups. The up-regulated transcripts were grouped into Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, and Up-a-pld and the down-regulated transcripts were grouped into Down-o-d, Down-o-pl, and Down-a-pld subgroups (see Results). Boxplots were used to examine the distribution and the median value of both the relative levels and the codon protection indices for transcripts from each of these six subgroups. The relative levels of individual mRNAs in mutant cells were determined by comparison to their levels in wild-type cells. The expression data for <italic>dcp1</italic>Δ, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, and <italic>xrn1</italic>Δ cells were from our previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). Codon protection indices for individual mRNAs were generated by Pelechano and collegues based on their data from 5’P sequencing of yeast decay intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). In their study, the codon protection index of a specific transcript is defined as the ratio of sequencing reads in the ribosome protected frame over the average reads of the non-protected frames. Codon protection index values greater than one are indicative of co-translational decay.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11-4"><title>Analysis of intrinsic properties associated with mRNA translation</title><p>To assess the potential links between translation and the functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in mRNA decay, we examined several intrinsic properties associated with mRNA translation for transcripts regulated by these three factors. We analyzed the pattern and distribution of the average codon optimality score, the average ribosome density, and the estimated protein abundance for transcripts from the six subgroups of mRNAs controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. In our analysis, the average codon optimality score of individual mRNAs was calculated based on the optimal or non-optimal codon scores defined by Pechmann and Frydman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pechmann and Frydman, 2013</xref>). The average ribosome density of individual mRNAs was derived from published ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data from wild-type yeast cells grown under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Young et al., 2015</xref>) and was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, raw fastq files were downloaded and sequence reads were trimmed for adapter sequences using cutadapt with settings -a CTGTAGGCA -q 10 --trim-n -m 10. After adapter trimming, sequence reads were mapped to the transcriptome using bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with settings -m4-n2l15 --suppress 1,6,7,8 --best –strata. After bowtie alignment, the riboSeqR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He and Jacobson, 2015b</xref>) was used for preliminary visualizations and frame calling. For our ribosome occupancy calculations, we selected read lenghts that showed a strong preference (&gt; 80%) to a specific reading frame. After this filtering, the ribosome occupancy of individual mRNAs was calculated as coverage_ribo/coverage_rna, yielding a single value of ribosome occupancy for each mRNAs. We used these values to compare the translation efficiency of transcripts from different subgroups of mRNAs that are differentially expressed in <italic>pat1</italic>∆, <italic>lsm1</italic>∆, and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ strains. We excluded transcripts that had no RNA-Seq reads mapping to their ORFs in our analysis. Protein abundance levels came directly from the curated PaxDb (Protein Abundances Across Organisms) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and are the scaled aggregated estimates over several proteomic data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11-5"><title>Deposited Data</title><p>The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jacobson and coworkers present an analysis by deep-sequencing of the transcriptome of various yeast strains carrying mutations in the decapping enzyme, Dcp2, and in some of its co-factors, particularly Dhh1, Pat1, and Lsm1. They show that the non-structured Dcp2 C-terminal domain has a regulatory function in mRNA decapping. importantly they demonstrate that Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 decapping activators may target a selective set of genes. The data raise the possibility that different decay pathways, such as classical decapping activator-dependent, and NMD pathways may compete for the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping complex.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Your paper was reviewed by three experts in the field. It is clear that the paper addresses a very important question, which is the substrate specificity of the different decapping activators in the regulation of mRNA levels in yeast cells. The finding that decapping activators selectively promote the reduction of specific mRNAs is important and novel. However, as you can see from the reviewers’ comments, the paper suffers from several deficiencies, of which the most problematic one deals with the interpretation of the data concerning RNA stability. It is obvious that steady-state RNA levels cannot inform on RNA stability, and therefore without knowing the mechanism of specificity of decapping one can invoke several scenarios, as elaborated by reviewer #3. For example, Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 apparent preference of different targets could just reflect different mechanistic impacts of removing factors having different activities, such as Xrn1.</p><p>We therefore request that you perform new experiments and change the text to respond to the reviewers' criticisms as follows:</p><p>1) Because steady-state RNA levels do not necessarily reflect RNA stability, direct validation of a subset of each group of targets for RNA stability is necessary.</p><p>2) You need to monitor factor levels. Since many decapping activators are known to interact and possibly stabilize each other, the data should be presented that deletion of a specific activator has no effect on levels of other activators. This information could be also available in the literature. In addition, you need to provide a Western of the different Dcp2 truncated proteins and take into account any substantial differences in expression.</p><p>3) The yeast mutants should be better characterized.</p><p>4) The presentation should be improved to fully account for the literature (see below).</p><p>5) You speculate that some of the observations could be explained by the 3' to 5' mRNA degradation pathway being activated or unlocked (for example, subsection “Identification of transcripts uniquely and commonly targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1”, second paragraph). You should test the appropriate <italic>ski2</italic> or <italic>ski7</italic> mutant strains if they are available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>A bioinformatics approach was used to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of yeast strains harboring a truncation of the Dcp2 decapping enzyme C-terminal regulatory domain and the regulators of decapping, PAT1, LSM1, or DHH1. Several key novel findings are reported. First, removal of the Dcp2 C-terminus, unleashes the Dcp2 catalytic domain to indiscriminately target RNAs for rapid decay of transcripts that it would otherwise not degrade, supporting the modulatory function of the C-terminus on decapping. RNA-Seq data from the Dcp2 C-terminal truncated allele (<italic>dcp2-N245</italic>) showed a large number of C-terminal responsive transcripts upregulated, supporting the previously reported autoinhibitor regulatory function in the C-terminus. Second, the decapping activator proteins, thought to be generic stimulators of Dcp2 decapping, are instead transcript specific and selectively target mRNAs to Dcp2 decapping. This is an important new finding and reveals an additional layer of transcript specific regulation for what appears to be the primary decapping enzyme in yeast. Transcripts that are both direct and indirect decapping targets are identified and further bioinformatically characterized to correlate to their translatability. An impressive array of Northern blots is used throughout the manuscript to validate steady state bioinformatic data. Overall the data considerably expands our mechanistic understanding of Dcp2 decapping and the substrate specificity of the respective decapping activators in regulation of mRNA levels in yeast cells.</p><p>One minor clarification should be incorporated: The observed reduction in transcript levels in the decapping protein or decapping activator proteins are interpreted to be exclusively a function of mRNA turnover throughout the manuscript. Since only steady state values are measured, changes in transcription rates/efficiency should also be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Two main findings reported in this work are:</p><p>a) Extension of previous observations from Jacobson's lab that the non-structured Dcp2 C-terminal domain has a regulatory function in mRNA decapping (this is supported by extensive RNA seq and biochemical, analyses of a battery of different yeast strains), and;</p><p>b) Demonstration that Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 decapping activators may target specific set of genes. The latter finding is well documented by the sequencing and Northern data performed with a dozen or so different strains.

At the same time, they are surprised by the fact that levels of some mRNAs are decreased between mutant and wild-type yeasts (subsection “Elimination of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain causes significant changes in genome-wide mRNA expression”, second paragraph) and suggests repeatedly that changes in mRNA decay may induce secondary effects.

The authors' conclusions are thus not sufficiently solid.</p><p>Moreover, studies by others have shown that analyses of mRNA levels don't allow strong conclusions about transcripts whose stability have been altered. Indeed, changes in mRNA decay may be compensated by concomitant modification of transcription rates (e.g., Sun et al., Genome Res. 2012 Jul;22(7):1350-9). To circumvent this problem various strategies assessing the mRNA transcription and decay rates have been implemented over the last 5 years. The use of mRNA levels determined by sequencing as indicative of changes in mRNA decay is currently not appropriate and doesn't allow to derive strong conclusions.

Yet, truncation of Dcp2 may well stabilize the short resulting protein. This possibility is consistent with the observation that the C-terminal domain of Dcp2 is target of ubiquitination (Swaney DL et al., 2013, PMID: 23749301). Some of the data presented may thus need to be interpreted in a context of an increase of the decapping enzyme level, not as resulting from its constitutive activation. Similar issues apply to the other Dcp2 mutants.

Some recent work is also not quoted (e.g., Mugridge et al., 2018).</p><p>- Introduction fails to quote recent work and often focus on the authors work. For example, recent structural analyses have provided insights into the role of the Dcp2 N-terminal domain in decapping but authors only quote structural work of 2008 (Introduction, first paragraph). Also, authors argue that Edc3 interacts with &quot;the large C-terminal domain of Dcp2&quot; when recent studies have shown that it activates Dcp2 in part by binding its N-terminal region.</p><p>- Discussion of differences between Dhh1 and Pat1 fails to mention that the latter has been shown to directly recruit Xrn1 (Charenton et al., 2017). This fact could explain differences in the steady state levels of some transcripts as, in contrast to Dhh1, absence of Pat1 may block both decapping and the downstream degradation of the mRNA body that will be monitored by deep-sequencing. Thus, the conclusion of the authors suggesting that Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 may target different subsets of yeast mRNAs may simply reflect the different mechanistic impacts of removing factors having different activities etc.</p><p>Many minor points would also need to be improved and this manuscript suffers mostly from strong weaknesses.

It is clear that the paper addresses a very important question, which is the substrate specificity of the different decapping activators in the regulation of mRNA levels in yeast cells. The finding that decapping activators selectively promote the reduction of specific mRNAs is important and novel. However, as you can see from the reviewers’ comments, the paper suffers from several deficiencies, of which the most problematic one deals with the interpretation of the data concerning RNA stability. It is obvious that steady-state RNA levels cannot inform on RNA stability, and therefore without knowing the mechanism of specificity of decapping one can invoke several scenarios, as elaborated by reviewer #3. For example, Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 apparent preference of different targets could just reflect different mechanistic impacts of removing factors having different activities, such as Xrn1.</p><p>We therefore request that you perform new experiments and change the text to respond to the reviewers' criticisms as follows:</p><p>1) Because steady-state RNA levels do not necessarily reflect RNA stability, direct validation of a subset of each group of targets for RNA stability is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out the recommended experiments and present their results in new figures (Figures <underline>6 and</underline> B). Our approach utilized temperature shifts in <italic>rpb1-1</italic> strains to inactivate transcription, a method that we and others have used extensively in the past. New double mutants (<italic>pat1Δ/rpb1-1, lsm1Δ/rpb1-1,</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ/rpb1-1</italic>) were constructed, and half-lives were determined for 14 mRNAs representative of the upregulated Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, and Up-a-pld subgroups (see subsection “Validation of transcripts controlled directly or indirectly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1”). As we now note in the text, the results of these experiments “[…] indicate that the increased steady-state accumulation of transcripts from the three subgroups in <italic>pat1</italic>∆, <italic>lsm1</italic>∆, and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells are most likely direct consequences of the loss of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 functions in mRNA decapping and suggest that at least a significant fraction of transcripts from these three subgroups are direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You need to monitor factor levels. Since many decapping activators are known to interact and possibly stabilize each other, the data should be presented that deletion of a specific activator has no effect on levels of other activators. This information could be also available in the literature. In addition, you need to provide a Western of the different Dcp2 truncated proteins and take into account any substantial differences in expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out the recommended experiments and present their results in new figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Our approach utilized western blotting of extracts from cells expressing: a) triple-HA tagged <italic>dcp2-N245, dcp2E153Q-N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> alleles of <italic>DCP2</italic> in otherwise wild-type backgrounds for mRNA decay factors or b) commercially available TAP-tagged alleles of <italic>PAT1, LSM1,</italic> and <italic>DHH1</italic> in strains systematically lacking each of the decapping activators under study. Details of these experiments can be found in the last paragraph of the subsection “Elimination of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain causes significant changes in genome-wide mRNA expression” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Decapping activators Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target specific subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity”. The relevant methodology has been added in the subsection “Yeast strains and plasmids”. These experiments demonstrated that: a) the levels of the Dcp2 proteins expressed in <italic>dcp2-N245, dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> cells were similar or nearly identical (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) and b) deletion of <italic>PAT1</italic> had little or no effect on the levels of expression of Lsm1 and Dhh1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C), deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> had no significant effect on the levels of expression of Pat1 and Lsm1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B) and deletion of <italic>LSM1</italic> had no effect on the level expression of Dhh1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). Consistent with a previous observation (Bonnerot et al., 2000), deletion of <italic>LSM1</italic> decreased the level of expression of Pat1 to 35% of its level in wild-type cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). The decreased accumulation of Pat1 in the absence of Lsm1 does not contradict our overall interpretation of overlapping mRNA expression patterns between <italic>pat1</italic>∆ and <italic>lsm1</italic>∆ cells, and, in fact, this observation strengthens our conclusion that Pat1 and Lsm1 function together to promote mRNA decapping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The yeast mutants should be better characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>The Materials and methods section has been revised to include information on the origin, construction, and growth rates of the different yeast mutants used in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The presentation should be improved to fully account for the literature (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>Six additional references have been added to the Introduction and Discussion.

The results of these experiments, presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, showed that deletion of <italic>SKI2</italic> partially increased the levels of the <italic>GTT2</italic> and <italic>RPP1A</italic> mRNAs in <italic>pat1∆</italic> and <italic>lsm1∆</italic> cells, but did not increase the levels of these two mRNAs in <italic>dhh1∆</italic> cells. These results are now noted in the last paragraph of the subsection “Identification of transcripts uniquely and commonly targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1”. We also attempted to construct double mutants of <italic>dcp2Δ, dcp2-E153Q-N245, dcp2-E198Q-N245, or xrn1Δ</italic> with <italic>ski2Δ or ski7Δ</italic> to further test the proposed decay mechanism. However, we were unable to generate even a single double mutant as all combinations were lethal in our strain background, an observation seen previously in published data from the Parker lab (Anderson and Parker, 1998).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] One minor clarification should be incorporated: The observed reduction in transcript levels in the decapping protein or decapping activator proteins are interpreted to be exclusively a function of mRNA turnover throughout the manuscript.

Work from the Parker lab indicated that Dcp2 is phosphorylated under several stress conditions and one specific phosphorylation event appeared to be linked to the stability of a subset of mRNAs (Yoon et al., 2010), suggesting that cellular decapping activity is likely regulated by growth conditions. To take these observations into account we have added a sentence (subsection “Deletion of DHH1 promotes the degradation of a fraction of NMD substrates”, last paragraph) acknowledging that the decapping enzyme may be limiting under normal growth conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) When discussing physical interaction between Dhh1 and CCR4 /Not (subsection “Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity”, second paragraph and subsection “General computational methods”), refer also to papers by Chen et al., 2014 (Izaurralde's group) and Rouya et al., 2014 (Sonenberg's group).</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to “essential revision” #4 (above), these references have been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) In this manuscript the authors interpret increased mRNA levels in mutant versus wild-type yeast as an indication that mRNA decay is altered (e.g., &quot;up-regulated transcripts are most likely bona fide substrates of the yeast decapping enzyme&quot;).

This fact could explain differences in the steady state levels of some transcripts as, in contrast to Dhh1, absence of Pat1 may block both decapping and the downstream degradation of the mRNA body that will be monitored by deep-sequencing. Thus, the conclusion of the authors suggesting that Dhh1 and Pat1/Lsm1 may target different subsets of yeast mRNAs may simply reflect the different mechanistic impacts of removing factors having different activities etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss the potential role of Pat1 in 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic decay (subsection “Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity”, second paragraph), but we have a different perspective on the possible role of such interactions in the regulation of mRNA decay. The reviewer’s model predicts that <italic>pat1∆</italic> and <italic>xrn1∆</italic> cells would have similar phenotypes, which they don’t. As noted in our response to this reviewer’s point 2 (above), it’s too soon to get precise about mechanism without much more data so we are hesitant to speculate about the role of the Pat1:Xrn1 interaction or the lack of an apparent Dhh1:Xrn1 interaction.</p><p>In short, we believe that the results of our paper shed considerable new light on cellular decapping regulation and we certainly hope that you and the reviewers consider the revised manuscript to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
