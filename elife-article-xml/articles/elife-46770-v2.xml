However, the neuronal substrates of these across-decision processes are not well understood, particularly for auditory decisions. We measured and manipulated the activity of choice-selective neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) while monkeys made decisions about the frequency content of noisy auditory stimuli. As the decision was being formed, vlPFC activity was not modulated strongly by the task. However, after decision commitment, vlPFC population activity encoded the sensory evidence, choice, and outcome of the current trial and predicted subject-specific choice biases on the subsequent trial. Consistent with these patterns of neuronal activity, electrical microstimulation in vlPFC tended to affect the subsequent, but not current, decision. Thus, distributed post-commitment representations of graded decision-related information in prefrontal cortex can play a causal role in evaluating past decisions and biasing subsequent ones.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC009224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Yale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH115557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gold</surname><given-names>Joshua I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC012961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Yale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers (1071421)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsunada</surname><given-names>Joji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A behavioral model, neuronal recordings, and electrical microstimulation reveal that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex plays a causal role in evaluating prior decisions and biasing future decisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perceptual decision-making is a deliberative process that produces a categorical judgment regarding the presence, identity, and other features of a sensory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). This deliberation often requires resolving potentially ambiguous interpretations of the current sensory stimulus with expectations that can be learned by evaluating prior decisions and their outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fecteau and Munoz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>). This learning process can result in sequential effects on a subject’s choices and response times (RTs) when they participate in psychophysical tasks that require one decision after another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer and Whitney, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luu and Stocker, 2018</xref>). Because sequential effects can be present even when a task is designed to generate independent trial-by-trial choices and after extensive training, these effects may represent fundamental, ongoing processes that evaluate and adjust decisions to account for changes in the sensory environment, reward contingencies, and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>). Although neuronal substrates of these sequential effects have been identified in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barraclough et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carnevale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fecteau and Munoz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">St John-Saaltink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lueckmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Histed et al., 2009</xref>), the exact nature of the signals that the brain uses to support these effects is still not well understood.</p><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that neurons in middle-lateral (ML) and anterolateral (AL) belt regions of the auditory cortex encode key features of the sensory evidence needed to solve an auditory-decision task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>). This task required monkeys to report whether a tone-burst sequence contained more low- or high- frequency tone bursts. We found that both AL and ML neurons were modulated by the frequency content of the tone-burst sequence. Moreover, in AL, but not ML, neuronal activity was weakly related to choice, and microstimulation biased the monkeys’ choices. These findings suggest a more direct role for AL in the decision process than for ML. They are also consistent with the idea that AL provides evidence for the decision but leave open the question of where and how in the brain is this evidence interpreted and combined with other information to form the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to identify a role for the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) in forming this auditory decision. We targeted vlPFC because it receives direct and indirect projections from AL and is situated at the apex of the ventral auditory pathway, which is commonly thought to mediate auditory perception and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Romanski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hackett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rauschecker and Tian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russ et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>). Here we show that, contrary to our initial expectations, vlPFC neurons do not appear to encode information relevant to forming the current decision. Instead, vlPFC population activity can encode rich, graded information about the just-completed decision process, including the strength of the sensory evidence, the resulting choice, and whether or not it was correct. These signals, which were apparent from just after the decision was formed until after feedback was received, were closely and causally related to the subsequent decision in a manner that matched each monkey’s idiosyncratic choice strategy. Together, these results imply a role for the vlPFC in the ongoing evaluation and adjustment of auditory decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded and manipulated vlPFC spiking activity in two monkeys while they reported whether a noisy auditory stimulus contained more low- or high-frequency tone bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). A primary benefit of this task is that we could control the strength of the sensory evidence (the fraction of low or high tone bursts in a given stimulus; that is coherence) and relate that evidence to the monkeys’ choices and to vlPFC activity. These monkeys participated in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>), but the behavioral and neuronal data presented here have not been reported previously.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46770.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task and stereotactic location of vlPFC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Each monkey decided whether a temporal sequence of tone bursts was predominantly ‘low frequency’ or ‘high frequency’ and responded with a rightward or leftward movement, respectively, of the joystick.

For high-coherence stimuli, both monkeys almost always reported the correct answer with relatively short RTs. As absolute coherence decreased, performance accuracy decreased and RT increased. These psychometric (choice) and chronometric (RT) data were well described jointly by a drift-diffusion model (DDM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, pink lines; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>). The DDM describes the process of forming a decision by accumulating incoming auditory (sensory) evidence over time to one of two pre-defined boundaries and accounts for both the choice (which boundary was reached) and the decision time (when the boundary was reached). These fits provided a consistently good match to the data (average deviance was 11.82 for monkey T [χ<sup>2</sup> -cumulative distribution, p&lt;0.001] and 10.99 for monkey A [p&lt;0.001]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wichmann and Hill, 2001</xref>). This result indicates that the monkeys had consistent decision strategies, which were independent of the slight session-by-session differences in the choice of low- and high-frequency stimuli.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46770.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Psychophysical performance on the low-high task.</title><p>Psychometric (<bold>a</bold>) and chronometric (<bold>b</bold>) functions for Monkey T (top) and Monkey A (bottom). These functions were generated from their responses on the current trial. Psychometric functions are plotted as the percentage of trials in which a monkey chose ‘high frequency’ as a function of signed coherence, in which larger negative/positive coherence values indicate more low/high frequency tone bursts. The horizontal gray lines on the psychometric plots indicate lapse rates (errors for strong stimuli, presumably reflecting lapses in attention or inappropriate application of the decision-motor mapping), which were estimated from logistic fits (solid blue lines). Chronometric functions are plotted using the mean RT, which was the time interval between stimulus onset and onset of joystick movement. Gray dots are low-frequency choices, and black dots are high-frequency choices. Solid pink curves are simultaneous fits of both the psychometric and chronometric data to a drift-diffusion model (DDM). The horizontal dashed gray lines on the chronometric plots indicate choice-dependent non-decision times (NDT) estimated by the DDM fits.

In general, decision times for both choices increased as the absolute stimulus coherence decreased, which is a typical feature of the DDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). In contrast, non-decision times tended to be strongly asymmetric for the two choices, which reflected differences in the speed and preparation time of the right versus left joystick movements produced by the two monkeys. In subsequent analyses, we define the time of the ‘decision commitment’ as the end of the decision time plus an additional 50 ms to account for stimulus encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also identified idiosyncratic sequential choice biases for the two monkeys. Monkey T tended to use a ‘win-stay, lose-switch’ strategy (top panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>).

If microstimulation was applied at a site that was tuned for low-frequency choices, it tended to cause a low-choice bias on the subsequent trial (single-site example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). In contrast, if microstimulation was applied at a site that was tuned for high-frequency choices, it tended to cause a high-choice bias on the subsequent trial (single-site example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). Accordingly, across the population of microstimulation sites from both monkeys, the induced choice bias on the subsequent trial was correlated positively with the strength and direction of choice selectivity at the given site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>). In other words, microstimulation at a site with neuronal activity that was selective for a low- or high-frequency choice on the current trial biased the monkeys’ choices toward a low- or high-frequency choice, respectively, on the subsequent trial. Further, the absolute magnitude of this bias was positively correlated with the strength of choice selectivity at the site of microstimulation. We did not identify any concomitant, systematic changes in psychometric sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>).</p><p>These microstimulation effects also depended on specific choice patterns, albeit slightly differently for the two monkeys. When microstimulation was applied on a trial that resulted in a rewarded high choice, the subsequent choice tended to be biased in the same direction as the choice selectivity of the neuron recorded at the site of microstimulation for both monkeys (monkey T: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.90, p&lt;0.001; monkey A: ρ = 0.61, p=0.04).

However, these forms of selectivity were not evident until after the time of the decision commitment and thus were inconsistent with a role for these neurons in forming the current decision. Instead, this post-decision selectivity appeared to support sequential adjustments to the decision process. Specifically, post-decision neuronal activity was modulated by each monkey’s idiosyncratic sequential choice biases. Further, electrical microstimulation at vlPFC sites affected the monkeys’ choices on the subsequent, but not the current, trial. Together, these results imply a role for post-decision vlPFC activity in encoding information about the process of forming the just-completed decision that is used to generate individualized biases that affect the subsequent decision.</p><p>These post-decision signals are a form of ‘decision-trace’ activity that has been identified in numerous brain areas, including parts of the prefrontal and parietal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barraclough et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizzi, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Funahashi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsujimoto and Sawaguchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Histed et al., 2009</xref>). This kind of activity represents information about the immediately preceding decision that can be used as part of a feedback-driven learning process to adjust future decisions based on a comparison between the expected and actual outcome of prior decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). Consistent with this idea, the population-level post-decision representations that we identified in the vlPFC are, in principle, sufficient to compute a confidence or reward-expectation signal for the just-completed decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kepecs et al., 2008</xref>). This signal could then be compared to the actual outcome to adjust the subsequent decision, possibly in other cortical or subcortical brain regions known to encode reward feedback and prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schultz, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The fact that our two monkeys used different biasing strategies (win-stay for monkey T, win-switch for monkey A) affects the interpretation of our findings in two primary ways. First, vlPFC selectivity for the subsequent choice was consistent with each monkey’s strategy. This result provides stronger support for the behavioral relevance of these signals than if they encoded features of behavior that were only present on average. Second, our microstimulation effects on the subsequent choice tended to depend on the choice tuning of neurons at the site of microstimulation and not the idiosyncratic sequential bias strategy of the monkey. This result implies that the vlPFC provides a choice-dependent signal that is used to generate sequential biases but may not participate directly in forming the idiosyncratic strategies that use those biases.</p><p>These findings are broadly consistent with recent studies that have shown a role for the vlPFC in strategy-switching and probabilistic-learning tasks, which share features of the sequential effects that we identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rudebeck et al., 2017</xref>). However, our findings of primarily post-decision processing in the vlPFC are somewhat inconsistent with other studies that have implicated the PFC in forming auditory and other decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russ et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. One possible reason is that we sampled a different PFC population than in these other studies, and these different populations make different contributions to decision versus post-decision processing. Another possibility is that previous reports of decision-related activity were also largely post-decisional. However, accounting for this possibility is not straightforward: the previous studies did not use RT tasks, making it difficult to interpret those results in terms of whether the reported decision-related signals occurred before or after the decision was formed on each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russ et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We still do not know the brain regions that form the decision for our task and consequently do not understand the mechanisms underlying these decisions. Because the monkeys’ choice and RT patterns reflected both the temporal accumulation of sensory evidence and sequential choice biases, we would expect these putative brain regions to implement two key operations. First, they should temporally accumulate the sensory evidence that is represented in the auditory cortex, particularly AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>). Second, they should combine this accumulated evidence with historical sensory, outcome, and choice information, similar to that represented in vlPFC, to drive sequential choice biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>). One possibility is a set of other brain areas that have shown information-accumulation activity on other tasks, such as the dorsolateral PFC and parts of the posterior parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>). The posterior parietal cortex is a particularly compelling target of future studies because in rodents, it contributes to history-dependent choice biases on an auditory decision task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>). Another intriguing possibility is an auditory-specific circuit involving the parabelt region of auditory cortex, which receives direct input from AL, projects to the vlPFC, and analyzes acoustic properties of behaviorally relevant sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hackett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Romanski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petkov et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Future studies that aim to identify neuronal activity related to decision formation for this kind of auditory task will likely benefit from not only an RT design to better identify the temporal epoch of decision formation but also a more thorough understanding of the dynamic and possibly idiosyncratic nature of the computations used to convert incoming sensory evidence into the categorical choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). These studies might also benefit from analyses that focus on substrates of subject-specific decision strategies, which help to establish the behavioral relevance of the neuronal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamyan et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in the present study, we found that our monkeys had different strategies of sequential choice biases (win-stay for monkey T versus win-switch for monkey A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These kinds of subject-specific choice biases have been reported previously in humans and animals, but their neuronal correlates have yet to be fully explained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>). Because the monkeys’ idiosyncratic behavioral strategies corresponded to different patterns of vlPFC choice selectivity, it implies that these signals may play a behaviorally relevant, subject-specific role in the evaluation and adjustment of the decision process, rather than providing a simple memory trace of common components of the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsujimoto and Postle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsujimoto and Sawaguchi, 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is worth emphasizing that in our study, the representations in the vlPFC of critical decision-related variables (i.e., choice, outcome, and the strength of the sensory evidence) were not all evident in the spiking activity of individual neurons but instead were seen at the level of neuronal populations. The time course of these representations was also distributed across the neuronal population: different neurons (in our case, recorded in separate sessions) responded selectively at relatively restricted times with onsets that tiled the task epoch in a manner similar to other reports of working memory in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaksas and Pasternak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>).

For trials with ambiguous stimuli (between −20% and +20% coherence), the monkey was rewarded on 50% of randomly selected trials, independent of their behavioral report. The monkey’s reward did not depend on the speed of their behavioral report, only its accuracy. Errors resulted in an increased (by 2 s) inter-trial interval.</p><p>During testing, we generally used 1250 and 2500 Hz as the low and high frequencies, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 12 out of 29 sessions for monkey T, 17 out of 39 sessions for monkey A).

All neuronal signals were sampled at 24 kHz, band-pass filtered between 0.7–7.0 kHz (RA16PA and RZ2, TDT Inc), and stored for online and offline analyses. OpenEx (TDT Inc), Labview (NI Inc), and Matlab (The Mathworks) software synchronized behavioral control with stimulus production and data collection. Single-neuron activity was isolated from the neuronal signals with on-line (OpenSorter, TDT Inc) and off-line (Offline Sorter, Plexon Inc) spike-sorting programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data-collection strategy</title><p>In our initial sessions, once multi-unit spiking activity was detected, we presented tone bursts to generate a frequency-tuning curve. However, because most vlPFC neurons were not frequency tuned (only 3 out of 65 tested sites, Kruskal-Wallis test, p&lt;0.05), we generally used one of three standardized sets of fixed low and high frequencies: (1) 1000 and 3000 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 52 neurons); (2) 1250 and 2500 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 40 neurons); and (3) an arbitrary value &lt;1750 Hz and a value 1–3 octaves above the selected low frequency (<italic>n</italic> = 11 neurons). Next, the monkey participated in the low-high task. We varied stimulus coherence randomly on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>During sessions with electrical microstimulation, we delivered negative-leading bipolar current pulses (frequency of stimulation: 300 Hz; inter-bipolar-pulse interval ~3 ms; pulse duration: 250 µs; amplitude: 25–75 µA) on 50% of randomly interleaved trials using a dual-output square-pulse stimulator (Grass S88) and two optical isolation units (Grass PSIU6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Gold, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>). Microstimulation started with stimulus onset and terminated at joystick movement. Because microstimulation trials were rewarded using the same schedule as non-microstimulation trials, the monkeys were not incentivized to respond differently during microstimulation trials than during non-microstimulation trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>For all analyses, stimulus coherence was calculated from the actual proportion of low- and high-frequency tone bursts that were presented from stimulus onset until the monkey indicated its choice by moving the joystick on a given trial.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Drift-diffusion model</title><p>Psychophysical and chronometric data were fit to a standard drift-diffusion model (DDM), which models a decision process in which noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a fixed bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eckhoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ratcliff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shadlen et al., 2006</xref>). This version of the model had five free parameters: k, A, B, F<sub>1</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub>. k governed the stimulus sensitivity of the moment-by-moment sensory evidence. The evidence had a Gaussian distribution <italic>N</italic> (µ,1) in which the mean µ scaled with the stimulus coherence (COH):<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The decision variable was the temporal accumulation of this momentary sensory evidence. A decision occurred when this decision variable reached a decision bound (+A or -B, which corresponded to a high- and low-frequency choice, respectively). ‘Decision time’ was the time between stimulus onset and the crossing of either bound. Response time (RT; which was the time from stimulus onset to the onset of joystick movement) could also be defined as the sum of this decision time and a ‘non-decision time’ (F<sub>1</sub> for a high-frequency choice and F<sub>2</sub> for a low-frequency choice). Non-decision time includes processes such as stimulus encoding and motor preparation. We defined the time of ‘decision commitment’ as the end of the decision time plus an additional 50 ms to account for sensory latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>).

L represents the upper and lower asymptotes (lapse rates) of the logistic function. β<sub>COH</sub> quantifies the effect of coherence on the monkey’s choices and governs the slope of the psychometric function. β<sub>0</sub> quantifies choice biases and governs the function’s horizontal position. In a separate analysis, we used indicator variables to determine additional choice biases that were conditioned on the outcome of the previous trial: (1) if the choice on the previous trial was rewarded (rewarded high choice =+1, rewarded low choice = −1, not rewarded = 0), and (2) if the choice on the previous trial was not rewarded (not rewarded high choice =+1, not rewarded low choice = −1, rewarded = 0). If a monkey repeated the same choice, the coefficient values of the indicator variables would be positive. If a monkey switched its choice, the coefficient values would be negative. For our session-by-session analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), we removed some sessions from this analysis due to the small number of trials per condition, resulting in 16 sessions for monkey T and 35 sessions for monkey A. A maximum-likelihood procedure fit the logistic function to the behavioral data.</p><p>To quantify the effects of microstimulation on behavior, we fit the logistic function (with additional indicator variables and assumed that each session had a single lapse rate across all microstimulation and non-microstimulation trials) to choice data from subsets of trials in individual sessions and tested whether the choice bias and perceptual sensitivity differed: (1) when microstimulation was applied on the current trial (+1) versus when it was not applied (0), and (2) when microstimulation was applied on the previous trial (+1) versus when it was not applied (0). ‘Choice bias’ was defined as the horizontal shift of psychometric functions. More specifically, the shift was calculated as the difference between stimulus coherences that elicited 50% high-frequency choices. ‘Perceptual sensitivity’ was defined as the change in the slope of the psychometric function determined from the 25% and 75% high-frequency choice points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neuronal analyses</title><p>We did not use statistical methods to predetermine sample sizes.

For correct trials, this convention equates the sign of stimulus coherence with the sign of the associated choice. That is, negative values map onto low-frequency stimuli and choices, whereas positive values map onto high-frequency stimuli and choices. We analyzed choice-related activity in 300 ms time bins, shifted in 10 ms steps. Choice selectivity was quantified using an ROC analysis, which measures the ability of an ROC-based ideal observer to predict a monkey’s choice based only on firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russ et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsunada et al., 2011b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Linear-classifier analysis for population activity</title><p>We used linear classifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop, 2006</xref>) to test whether vlPFC population activity was modulated by stimulus coherence (using four binned ranges of coherence: [1] −100% – −50%, [2] −50 – 0%, [3] 0% – +50%, and [4]+50% – +100%) or by behavioral choice (high- versus low-frequency choices across all coherences). This analysis was restricted to data generated on correct trials only to help to ensure that we could quantify the effects of stimulus coherence and behavioral choice on vlPFC population activity and not outcome effects (correct versus incorrect trials). For each classifier and for each neuron, we z-scored firing rate and randomly subsampled the trials so that we had equal number of trials for each condition. Each classification analysis underwent a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to avoid overfitting. This procedure divided the neuronal data into 10 groups in an iterative fashion, such that one group was a test set and the remaining nine formed a training set. We implemented a linear read-out procedure in which we fit the training set to a linear hyperplane that separated the population response vectors corresponding to the two choices. For the coherence classifier, we implemented a ‘one-versus-all’ classification in which we built four classifiers (one for each binned coherence range) and trained each of them, in an iterative fashion, to discriminate between one particular coherence range versus all of the remaining three coherence ranges. Using the test data, we identified which of the four classifiers had the best performance and report average performance across coherence. For both classifiers, we calculated the fraction of times that the test data was classified correctly and report average performance over 1000 different instantiations of a classifier.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Code availability</title><p>The data analyses were performed in Matlab and are available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsunada, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Joji">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Joji</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Andrew Liu for help with the experimental setup, animal training, and neuronal recording.

The monkeys' behavioural strategies on subsequent trials are interestingly enough idiosynchratic, which provides unexpected insights on the involvement of vlPFC in decision making. The authors also use microstimulation to show that the current trial performance is not necessarily affected by microstimulation throughout the trial, but that the monkeys' decisions on the next trial are influenced. So the role of areas 45 and 46, where they find these neurons, is much more interesting than previously thought with regards to decision related processes.</p><p>1) Clearer presentation of results: Although I'm generally convinced, the presentation of results and figures didn't always seem to line up for me. There were several instances where I simply could not see what the authors were referring to in the figures, even after scrutinizing the Results text and figures several times. I was also convinced that you see stimulus driven, coherence related, decision related, lever related and juice related responses, although you seem to dismiss these and emphasize the effects related to the next trial. So I would strongly recommend that you check and revise the Results presentation, including figures, to ensure it is clear and that the claims in the text lines up with the Results figures: check how your statements are supported by the results, which will require better explication and closer reference to what you point to in specific figure panels for key claims.</p><p>2) Stave off two case study criticism: to stave off criticism that the idiosynchratic patterns are just two case studies rather than consistency in the two animals (suggesting that the patterns are consistent and likely to generalize to other monkeys regardless of the strategies they take with regards to the next trial), I would encourage you to pick this up in the Discussion and point to the data that shows consistent microstimulation effects that relate to the specific decision that the monkey will take next, again related to their strategy.</p><p>3) More complete Discussion: vlPFC has been seen, at least with neuroimaging studies in humans and monkeys, to be sensitive to within trial sequence order effects, or in humans’ language syntax. This suggests that the signals in these parts of the brain, at least in humans, are involved in constructing sequential information, typically on the order of a few seconds. The Discussion and broader appeal of your work could benefit from some consideration of how your results from this part of PFC might inform sequential processing and the time scale at which you think these operations occur, at least based on your data. The Discussion is cursory and could also benefit from considering whether the situation would be different in premotor cortex (v6) and motor cortex (M1). Presumably it is and this sort of future planning is certainly likely to involve more anterior parts of PFC, so it would be good to couch the vlPFC results within the auditory sequence/language processing literature that typically converges in terms of effects in this part of the brain, and with adjacently interconnected territory in PFC/premotor cortex. Relatedly I couldn't quite follow the mechanistic insights in how you view the vlPFC signals to coordinate with those in belt auditory cortex (field AL). So this part too could be more clearly discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents experimental work that builds upon the authors' previous work (Tsunada et al., 2016). While their previous work focused on causal contributions of two primate brain regions (AL- and ML-belts of auditory cortex) to an auditory perceptual decision, the present study investigates neural responses in a downstream region (vlPFC). The authors report that the vlPFC seems to encode primarily post-decision neural signatures for the choice, outcome, and uncertainty in the sensory evidence. Consistent with this finding, microstimulation of this area was found to affect decision on the next trial, thereby revealing causal evaluative processes for the task that affect future behavior.</p><p>Overall, I think that this paper will make a great contribution to the literature.</p><p>1) It is unclear whether there are only two frequency values, one low and one high, or whether there are multiple low- and high-frequencies. Judging by the authors' previous work (Tsunada et al., 2016) and in the subsection “Data-collection strategy” of the current manuscript, it seems like there is a range of frequencies used for the low-high task. If this is indeed the case, then in a ± 100% coherence task, how do the monkeys know whether the frequency being played is low or high? Are they demarcated by a particular frequency that they monkey has learned? Moreover, is the difference between the low- and high-frequency constant? If not, then how do the authors account for the effect this will have on the behavior?</p><p>2) The behavioral analyses and the experimentally rewarded trials seem to be at odds with each other. Based on each trial's coherence, which presumably guides reward on that trial, a tone burst sequence is generated by randomly assigning the frequency of each tone burst to the low- and high-frequency value for that trial. However, for the behavioral analyses, the stimulus coherence was calculated from the actual proportion of low- and high-frequency tone bursts that were presented from the stimulus onset until the monkey indicated its choice by moving the joystick on that trial. In other words, the task seems to be designed such that the monkeys need to infer a latent variable (coherence), which is not what the behavioral analyses seem to be doing.</p><p>To illustrate this point, consider the following. Given that tone bursts last 50ms with 10ms inter-burst intervals, only a few tone-bursts can be presented before the subjects' average RTs (about 8 bursts in 0.5 seconds). So, in a +20% (more high-frequency) coherence trial, it is possible just by chance, that there are more low-frequency bursts before choice, leading the monkey to make an incorrect decision and hence not being rewarded. However, the analyses would consider that the trial had a correct response. Please clarify.</p><p>3) The authors have not mentioned whether they pooled all neurons across trials and monkeys for the classification of choice and coherence (Figure 6), but that seems to be the case.</p><p>4) The authors may want to discuss the compatibility of their results with the following studies that look at the role of vlPFC in decision-making in monkeys:</p><p>– Baxter et al. (2009) show that lesioning vlPFC in rhesus macaques impacts a strategy-based task, but not value-based decision-making.</p><p>– Rudebeck et al. (2017) show that vlPFC is critical in probabilistic learning of stimulus to outcome (state to reward) by performing lesion studies in rhesus macaques.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46770.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A main issue relates to sampling within this pair of case studies that concerns reviewer 1; reviewer 2 thinks that this can be rebutted based on the microstimulation results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now highlight this important point in a new paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“The fact that our two monkeys used different biasing strategies (win-stay for monkey T, win-switch for monkey A) affects the interpretation of our findings in two primary ways.

Rather, we emphasize that because these modulations occur after the decision is completed, they cannot play a role in forming that decision but instead appear to play a role in evaluating that decision (e.g., via a confidence or reward-expectation variable) that is used as part of a trial-by-trial learning process to adjust the subsequent decision. We now clarify this point in the manuscript, particularly in the Results and the first two paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Stave off two case study criticism: to stave off criticism that the idiosynchratic patterns are just two case studies rather than consistency in the two animals (suggesting that the patterns are consistent and likely to generalize to other monkeys regardless of the strategies they take with regards to the next trial), I would encourage you to pick this up in the Discussion and point to the data that shows consistent microstimulation effects that relate to the specific decision that the monkey will take next, again related to their strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion.

So this part too could be more clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. We indicate in the Discussion (fifth paragraph) that the monkeys’ behavioral patterns are consistent with an accumulation of the sensory evidence that in our previous study we found is represented in AL. However, in this study we did not find that vlPFC contributes to this accumulation process. We therefore propose other brain regions that might implement the accumulation, as follows:</p><p>“One possibility is a set of other brain areas that have shown information-accumulation activity on other tasks, including the dorsolateral PFC and parts of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Brody and Hanks, 2016). […] Another intriguing possibility is an auditory-specific circuit involving the parabelt region of auditory cortex, which receives direct input from AL, projects to the vlPFC, and analyzes acoustic properties of behaviorally relevant sounds (Hackett, 1999; Romanski, 1999; Petkov et al., 2004).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) It is unclear whether there are only two frequency values, one low and one high, or whether there are multiple low- and high-frequencies.

We note in the figure legend that “that the two conditions corresponded to differences in lapse rates for monkey T but little effect on the other model parameters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The behavioral analyses and the experimentally rewarded trials seem to be at odds with each other.

Most trials used absolute coherence values &gt;20% (84% of all trials from both monkeys), for which the sign of the actual and intended coherences were always the same. However, as the reviewer pointed out, there can be a small fraction of low-coherence trials that did not match for the sign. Because these low-coherence trials tended to be very difficult for the monkeys, they were rewarded at random, as we indicate in Materials and methods: “For trials with ambiguous stimuli (between -20% and +20% coherence), the monkey was rewarded on 50% of randomly selected trials, independent of the behavioral report.”</p><p>Further, please note that our analysis of selectivity for correct/error trials (Figure 5) used only trials with absolute coherence values &gt;20%, for which the sign of actual and intended coherence was always the same.</p><p>Finally, we have clarified that our sequential analyses were based on whether or not the previous trial was rewarded, which was unambiguous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have not mentioned whether they pooled all neurons across trials and monkeys for the classification of choice and coherence (Figure 6), but that seems to be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we pooled activity for all neurons across trials and monkeys for the classifier analysis. We added this key piece of information to the main text: “…across the population of 103 neurons recorded from all sessions from both monkeys for a linear classifier to decode both stimulus coherence and choice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors may want to discuss the compatibility of their results with the following studies that look at the role of vlPFC in decision-making in monkeys:</p><p>– Baxter et al. (2009) show that lesioning vlPFC in rhesus macaques impacts a strategy-based task, but not value-based decision-making.</p><p>– Rudebeck et al. (2017) show that vlPFC is critical in probabilistic learning of stimulus to outcome (state to reward) by performing lesion studies in rhesus macaques.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these suggestions. We now include these references in our discussion of our findings related to sequential effects (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
