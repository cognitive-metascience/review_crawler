FN is essential for mammalian development and tissue regeneration, and can influence disease such as cancer progression. FN is abundant in blood and in most tissues and is present in provisional matrices of healing wounds and in the stroma of tumors. FN is secreted as a disulfide-bonded dimer, assembled into fibrils of variable diameters and then crosslinked into a fibrillar network of variable rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leiss et al., 2008</xref>) that binds to and serves as a scaffold for numerous other ECM molecules. FN consists of three different repeating Ig-like folded units, called type I-III modules. Whereas type I and II modules are stabilized by internal disulfide bonds, the 15 type III repeats of FN lack disulfide bonds, which confers elasticity to FN fibrils and the ability to modulate fibril rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erickson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oberhauser et al., 2002</xref>). The major cell-binding site in FN is an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif located in the 10<sup>th</sup> type III module (FNIII10) that is recognized by α5β1, αIIbβ3, and αv-class integrins. In addition to the RGD motif, FN harbors the so-called FN synergy site in the FNIII9 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Obara et al., 1988</xref>), which binds α5β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins but not αv-class integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowditch et al., 1994</xref>). The synergy site encompasses the DRVPPSRN sequence in mouse FN and site directed mutagenesis identified the two arginine residues to be essential for all synergy site-induced functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aota et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagae et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In vitro studies have shown that the synergy site increases cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aota et al., 1991</xref>), FN fibril assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sechler et al., 1997</xref>) and platelet adhesion to FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chada et al., 2006</xref>). Based on the crystal structures, the RGD motif forms a flexible loop that physically interacts with both the α5 and β1 integrin subunits, while the synergy site contacts only the head domain of the α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Redick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagae et al., 2012</xref>). The synergy site has been studied using protein- and cell-based assays, which produced different results giving rise to diverse hypotheses regarding the mechanistic properties. One hypothesis based on ultra-structural analyses of the recombinant α5β1 ectodomain and the FNIII7-10 polypeptide proposes that the synergy site aligns the binding interface of the integrin heterodimer with the RGD motif to increase the on-rate constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>on</sub>) of α5β1 binding to FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leahy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takagi et al., 2003</xref>). A combination of theoretical and cell-based studies with FRET sensors inserted into the linker region between FNIII9 and FNIII10 concluded that cell-induced forces reversibly stretch the linker, separate the FN-RGD motif from the synergy site and switch the binding of α5β1 integrins to αv-class integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krammer et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, using a spinning disk device, it was shown that the engagement of the synergy site allows FN-α5β1 bonds (or FN-αIIbβ3 bonds on platelets) to resist shear forces, suggesting that force exposure allows to switch the bonds from a relaxed to a tensioned state, leading to an extension of the FN-integrin bond lifetime and to adhesion strengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedland et al., 2009</xref>). Although these in vitro studies highlight the importance of α5β1 and αIIbβ3 integrin-binding to the synergy site, the mode of action is still unclear and the apparently important roles of these interactions have never been scrutinized in vivo using genetic loss-of-function approaches.</p><p>We decided to directly test the role of the synergy site in vivo by substituting critical residues of the FN-synergy site in mice. We report that mice carrying a homozygous inactivating mutation in the fibronectin gene (<italic>Fn1</italic>)-synergy site (<italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>) are viable, fertile, show no overt organ defects, however, display a mild bleeding tendency and delayed thrombus formation after vessel injury.

We measured tail bleeding time after tail biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and found a significant increase from 4.64 ± 1.50 min (mean ± SD) in <italic>Fn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice to 7.27 ± 1.71 min in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice (p&lt;0.001). Importantly, blood platelet counts were normal in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since αIIbβ3 integrins mediate the uptake of pFN into platelet α-granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ni et al., 2003a</xref>), we performed Western-blotting with lysates from washed platelets and found that the FN content was significantly reduced to 70% in platelets from <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while the levels of pFN were similar in <italic>Fn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (318.7 ± 24.1 μg/ml) and <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> (316.1 ± 31.0 μg/ml) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, plasma levels of fibrinogen were also similar in <italic>Fn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (2.10 ± 0.17 mg/ml) and <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> (2.08 ± 0.07 mg/ml) mice.

To test the extent of bond tensioning on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, we seeded (15, 30 and 60 min) serum-starved <italic>Fn1</italic>-KO fibroblasts onto pFN<sup>wt</sup>- and pFN<sup>syn</sup>-coated substrates, respectively, spun them and treated them with 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate; DTSSP) to crosslink extracellular secondary amines that are within 1.2 nm proximity to each other. We found that the amount of α5 integrins crosslinked to FN in <italic>Fn1</italic>-KO fibroblasts was reduced to 60% on pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Upon spinning, <italic>Fn1</italic>-KO cells increased the proportion of α5 integrins crosslinked to pFN<sup>wt</sup>. Importantly, in cells on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, the tension was unable to increase the number of crosslinked bonds upon spinning and their numbers remained at the same levels as before spinning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which altogether indicates that the spinning force strengthens α5β1-mediated adhesion to FN in a synergy site-dependent manner. Furthermore and in line with a report showing that the conversion of FN-α5β1 bonds from a relaxed to a tensioned state induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on Y397 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kornberg et al., 1992</xref>), pY397-FAK levels were reduced by 54% when cells were plated on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, phosphorylation of Y861-FAK, which occurs independent of substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi and Boettiger, 2003</xref>), was indistinguishable in cells seeded on pFN<sup>wt</sup> or pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since the intensity of FAK Y397 phosphorylation was shown to operate as a sensor for ECM rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seong et al., 2013</xref>), we conclude that fibroblasts attached to pFN<sup>syn</sup> perceive insufficient information regarding substrate stiffness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>αv-class integrins compensate for the absent FN synergy site</title><p><italic>Fn1</italic>-KO cells express high levels of αv-class integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which could, at least in part, compensate for the absence of the synergy site during adhesion strengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we seeded pan-integrin-null fibroblasts (pKO) reconstituted with β1-class integrins to express α5β1 (pKO-β1), or with αv integrins (pKO-αv) to express αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, or with both β1 and αv integrins (pKO-αv/β1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schiller et al., 2013</xref>) on pFN<sup>wt</sup>- and pFN<sup>syn</sup>-coated substrates and evaluated cell adhesion, spreading, and adhesion site formation. From the three cell lines, only pKO-β1 cells exhibited reduced adhesion on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> at all-time points analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, pKO-β1 cells had significantly fewer FAs, contained fewer stress fibers, and spread less on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref> and still images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the areas of FAs determined with paxillin and β1 integrin stainings were significantly reduced on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>), which altogether suggests that pFN<sup>syn</sup>-bound α5β1 integrins fail to organize functional adhesion sites and to induce contractile stress fibers required for cell spreading. pKO-αv cells adhered and spread similarly on pFN<sup>wt</sup> and pFN<sup>syn</sup>, and developed comparably large, paxillin-positive FAs that were anchored to thick stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Importantly, pKO-αv/β1 cells also showed the same adhesion and spreading behavior, and developed similar adhesion sites on pFN<sup>syn</sup> indicating that αv-containing integrins compensate for the absence of a functional synergy site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>). Interestingly, the pKO-αv/β1 cells do not show a delay in the transition from NAs to mature FAs on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, as we observed with <italic>Fn1</italic>-KO cells, which could be due to the significantly higher β3 and lower α5 integrin cell surface levels on pKO-αv/β1 as compared to <italic>Fn1</italic>-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22264.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>α5β1 integrins require the synergy site in FN to induce cell spreading.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adhesion of pKO-β1, pKO-αv and pKO-αv/β1 fibroblasts seeded on pFN<sup>wt</sup> or pFN<sup>syn</sup> for indicated times (n = 3 independent experiments; mean ± sem).

After a very short contact time of ≈ 50 ms, cell and substrate were separated to detect the rupture of the few specific bonds formed between integrins and FN. On FNIII7-10<sup>wt</sup>, the experiments revealed a 3-fold higher binding probability of pKO-αv and pKO-αv/β1 cells compared to pKO-β1 cells, indicating that αvβ3 integrins have a higher affinity for FN-RGD than α5β1 integrins.

The replacement of the FNIII10 RGD motif with the RGE in mice also affects mesoderm development, although less severe and restricted to the vascular system and to the posterior region of the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Girós et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, these defects resemble those observed in <italic>Itga5</italic>-deficient mice indicating that the RGE mutation is sufficient to abrogate α5β1 integrin function and that the synergy site cannot compensate for a dysfunctional RGD motif. Furthermore, the normal development of <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice also excludes an essential role of the synergy site for α5 integrin function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krammer et al., 2002</xref>). A reduced α5β1 integrin function would probably have occurred if the synergy site would indeed guide the binding pocket of α5β1 towards the RGD motif and increase the FN-binding on-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takagi et al., 2003</xref>). However, the absence of obvious ‘α5β1-loss-of-function defects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 1993</xref>) in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice and the normal FN-binding on-rates of pKO-β1 cells in single-cell force spectroscopy experiments indicate that the synergy site is probably dispensable to accelerate α5β1 integrin-FN binding.</p><p>We also demonstrate an unexpected, compensatory role between the FN synergy site and αvβ3 integrins for the vascular coverage by smooth muscle cells. Apparently, the high myosin II-induced forces generated by these cells are only efficiently absorbed with either high αv-class integrin surface levels or a fully functional FN. Whether a similar functional relationship operates also during paraxial mesoderm, whose formation critically depends on the expression of α5β1 and αv-class integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 1999</xref>), cannot be deduced from our experiments. However, the normal mesoderm formation in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice indicates that mesodermal cells require α5β1 to bind the RGD motif but not the synergy site. Interestingly, we also find clear evidence for a compensatory role of the FN synergy site and αv-class integrins for cell spreading and FA maturation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which differs from previous reports showing that α5β1 and αv-class integrins have non-overlapping functions for inducing myosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schiller et al., 2013</xref>) or controlling directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Missirlis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that platelet adhesion to pFN, mediated by αIIbβ3 with contributions from α5β1 and other integrins, plays a critical role for hemostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ni et al., 2003b</xref>). Our findings revealed that the FN synergy site is critically important for the adhesion of wild type platelets in in vitro flow chamber settings, while impaired spreading or defects under static adhesion only arise when αIIbβ3 expression is lost. These findings indicate that the synergy site plays a central role as soon as force is applied to the bonds between FN and platelet integrins. A similar force-dependent requirement of the synergy site was also apparent after arteriolar injuries in vivo, which showed that <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice display diminished platelet adhesion and delayed thrombus formation. This requirement of the synergy site for platelets to resist the shear forces of the blood flow also provides a rational explanation for the prolonged bleeding times observed in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice after tail tip excisions. Interestingly, the in vivo platelet dysfunctions in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice as well as <italic>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice profoundly aggravate in compound <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos where they cause fatal bleedings and an insufficient platelet-mediated separation of the lymphatic vessels from the cardinal vein. Since murine platelets contain around 100 times more αIIbβ3 than α5β1 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeiler et al., 2014</xref>) the compensation of the entire αIIbβ3 pool by the minor α5β1-FN<sup>wt</sup> complexes underscores the fundamental role of the adhesion strengthening property of the synergy site in FN.</p><p>Our mouse strain will allow now to test how the synergy site-mediated adhesion re-enforcement affects the course of tissue fibrosis or cancer development and progression, which are heavily influenced by integrin surface levels as well as tissue rigidity that in turn is modulated by the strength of integrin-ligand bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zilberberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laklai et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed in special pathogen free animal facilities.

Each cantilever was calibrated prior the measurement by determining its sensitivity and spring constant using the thermal noise analysis of the AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</xref>). To adhere a single fibroblast to the AFM cantilever, overnight serum-starved fibroblasts with confluency up to ≈80% were washed with PBS, trypsin-detached for up to 2 min, suspended in SCFS media (DMEM supplemented with 20 mM HEPES) containing 1% (v/v) FCS, pelleted and resuspended in serum free SCFS media. Fibroblasts were allowed to recover for at least 30 min from trypsin treatment. Adhesion of a single fibroblast to the free cantilever end was achieved by pipetting the fibroblast suspension onto the functionalized Petri dishes. The functionalized cantilever was lowered onto a fibroblast with a speed of 1 µm/s until a force of 1 nN was recorded. After ≈5 s contact, the cantilever was retracted with 1 µm/s for 10 µm and the cantilever bound fibroblast was incubated for 7–10 min to assure firm binding to the cantilever. Using differential interference contract (DIC) microscopy, the morphological state of the fibroblast was monitored. For single molecule sensitivity, the fibroblast bound to the cantilever was lowered onto the coated substrate with a speed of 1 µm/s until a contact force of 200 pN was recorded for ≈50 ms contact time. Subsequently, the cantilever was retracted at 1 µm/s and for ≥13 µm until the fibroblast and substrate were fully separated. After the experimental cycle, the fibroblast was allowed to recover for 0.5 s. For each measurement, the area of the substrate was varied.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The fibronectin synergy site re-enforces cell adhesion and mediates a crosstalk between integrin classes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Ambra Pozzi (Reviewer #2), Heyu Ni (Reviewer #3), and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You and your coworkers describe the functional properties of the FN synergy site in mice and cells. You report (1) that the absence of the synergy site produces normal offspring that have only a mild bleeding tendency upon wounding; (2) that intercrosses with <italic>Itgb3</italic>-null mice lead to lethal bleeding due to dysfunctional platelets and mural cells; (3) that plasma FN isolated from mutant mice supports adhesion strengthening rather than an increased on-rate/affinity of α5/β1 for FN. The reviewers felt that interesting and the data are of high quality. However, they raised questions that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit if the authors discuss and compare defects of FN-synergy site-deficient mice and mice carrying an RGD&gt;RGE substitution. This is lacking in the manuscript. The latter mice lack α5/β1 binding and develop defects in paraxial mesoderm and lack tail-bud-derived somites leading to a shortened posterior trunk indicating that the FN-synergy site dependent adhesion re-enforcement is not required for the reported compensation of α5 and αv integrins during (paraxial) mesoderm formation and posterior somitogenesis.</p><p>2) The authors conducted all in vitro experiments with purified FN from wild type and FN-synergy site-deficient mice, except the AFM studies. It would be interesting to also test α5 on rate/activation with full length FN molecules.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the tail bleeding time in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice was observed to be significantly prolonged as compared to WT mice. However, while FN synergy site may be important for hemostasis, it was reported that tail bleeding time (a less than perfect parameter for hemostasis itself) in plasma FN conditional knockout mice was not prolonged (Sakai T et al., Nat Med, 2001). It seems that prolonged bleeding time is found in plasma <italic>FN<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice only with combined deficiency of fibrinogen or following anti-coagulant treatment (Wang Y et al., J Clin Invest, 2014). Are there additional defects in subendothelial matrix organization in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice? Further discussions or experiments are required to explain this bleeding time prolongation in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice.</p><p>4) There is no information regarding the platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma induced by ADP, which is the most common platelet aggregation assay and important information for hemostasis. The concentration of plasma FN in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice is also unclear. These experiments are very easy to do and the information is important for readers to better understand the bleeding disorder of <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice.</p><p>The authors should be aware that plasma FN is an inhibitory factor for platelet aggregation no matter if it is in plasma or released from platelets that internalized by αIIbβ3 from plasma (Reheman A et al., Blood. 2009). However, plasma FN can enhance platelet aggregation when it is associated with fibrin. The authors should read these earlier publications and discuss whether the 70% FN reduction in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>platelets is the explanation of the trends of enhancement of platelet aggregation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> showed a significant decrease of the adhesion strength, indicated by inflection point (τ50) on FN<sup>syn</sup> coated surface. However, this result is inconsistent with the curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, where the τ50 is clearly higher on FN<sup>syn</sup> coated surface than on WT FN coated surface.</p><p>6) Introduction (first paragraph): It has been now well known that αIIbβ3 is not &quot;exclusively expressed on platelets&quot;. It is not only expressed on platelet precursor megakaryocytes, but also mast cells and hematopoietic stem cells. This sentence should be corrected/revised.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The fibronectin synergy site re-enforces cell adhesion and mediates a crosstalk between integrin classes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues (regarding editing cartoons and text) that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: the authors indicate that the 'intensity' of the color in their cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> indicates whether integrins are activated or not. However, in the panel to the right of the cartoon they provide color intensities that are not depicted in the cartoon on the left. Furthermore, the authors need to clearly indicate that darker colors indicate more active integrins than light colors. Finally, the difference in color and/or shape (if any) between integrins activated with or without synergy engagement is not clear.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: although the figure is very nice and informative, it would increase clarity if the authors change the color of integrin α2β1 (green), which is quite difficult to see on the blue and green background of the platelets. Furthermore, fibrinogen and importantly fibrin should be easily visible in the platelet aggregates, to avoid giving the readers a wrong impression that FN alone is sufficient to mediate platelet aggregation. Fibrin is found to be required for FN to support platelet aggregation (Reheman A, Blood, 2009; Wang Y, JCI, 2014). Another important fact is that FN and fibrin fibrils are more abundant close to the vessel wall.</p><p>3) In platelet aggregation tracings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>, the values obtained from <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> were &quot;shifted by +5% to avoid overlapping&quot;. This is not standard presentation and may mislead the readers. We recommend the authors to allow overlapping of aggregation tracings in the figure, particularly when they used different colors to show their aggregation curves.</p><p>4) Please correct the following typos: Results: &quot;comparable normal&quot; should be changed to &quot;comparable to Fn1<sup>+/+</sup> mice and normal&quot;; Subsection “Normal development and prolonged trauma-induced bleeding in <italic>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic> mice” &quot;also&quot; should not be at the beginning of the sentence but rather after &quot;were&quot;; Subsection “The FN synergy site is dispensable for the on-rate of FN binding to α5β1 integrins”, last paragraph: &quot;site&quot; is missing after &quot;synergy&quot;; Discussion, fourth paragraph: it should be acknowledged that platelet adhesion to Fn is mainly mediated by αIIbβ3 integrin under normal conditions.

The α5/αv integrin double knockout mice die at around E8.5 with severe mesoderm defects and absent somites. The FN<sup>RGE</sup> mice die at E9.5-10 with the same phenotype as α5 integrin-null mice and indicating that the RGD&gt;RGE mutation impairs α5 binding to FN and that the synergy site does not suffice α5-mediated adhesion. We added this point to the discussion.</p><p>The second important point is whether the synergy site compensates the lack of αv- mediated adhesion to FN. The αv-null mice have no mesoderm defects. In our in vitro assays, the FN synergy site can compensate the absence of αvβ3 integrins. Unfortunately, we do not know yet whether this is also the case in vivo. We are currently crossing αv-null mice with FN<sup>syn</sup> mice to answer this question. However these experiments will take at least one more year.</p><p><italic>2) The authors conducted all</italic> in vitro <italic>experiments with purified FN from wild type and FN-synergy site-deficient mice, except the AFM studies. It would be interesting to also test α5 on rate/activation with full length FN molecules.</italic> </p><p>We did the experiments and found no significant differences between FN<sup>wt</sup> and FN<sup>syn.</sup>These findingsindicate that the binding on-rate seems to be independent of the synergy site. We show this result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>. Interestingly the pKO cells that do not express integrins showed higher probability of association to the full length FN than to the FNIII7-10 fragment, pointing to non-integrin specific binding events to full length FN. Such binding events could for example be mediated by syndecans.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the tail bleeding time in FN<sup>syn/syn</sup>mice was observed to be significantly prolonged as compared to WT mice. However, while FN synergy site may be important for hemostasis, it was reported that tail bleeding time (a less than perfect parameter for hemostasis itself) in plasma FN conditional knockout mice was not prolonged (Sakai T et al., Nat Med, 2001).

Are there additional defects in subendothelial matrix organization in FN<sup>syn/syn</sup>mice? Further discussions or experiments are required to explain this bleeding time prolongation in FN<sup>syn/syn</sup>mice.</italic> </p><p>We compared the subendothelial distributions of FN, laminin and collagen IV in dermal vasculature of control and <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice and found no differences. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We also examined blood vessel ruptures by immunostaining erythrocytes. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that protein mutations and absence of proteins can have different outcomes. The absence of pFN can trigger compensations that are not induced when pFN<sup>syn</sup> is expressed. It could well be that the absence of pFN is compensated by the increased use of fibrinogen or other hemostatic proteins and that this not occur in <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice. We mention such a possibility in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) There is no information regarding the platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma induced by ADP, which is the most common platelet aggregation assay and important information for hemostasis.

Furthermore, we quantified the concentration of plasma FN and fibrinogen in wild-type and <italic>FN<sup>syn/syn</sup></italic>mice and measured 318.7 and 316.1 μg/ml of plasma FN and 2.10 and 2.08 mg/ml of fibrinogen respectively. The findings are displayed in the Results and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>The platelet aggregations showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref> were not significant. The figures appear enhanced in the FNsyn condition because to avoid overlapping of the graphs, 5 units were added to every resulting value in the aggregations with FN<sup>syn</sup>. Now we explain this in the legend of the figure (currently <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>).</p><p>We repeated the aggregation assays (the three conditions: with collagen, with thrombin and with ADP) and just do not find significant differences between the wild-type and mutant genotypes. The decreased content of pFN in the platelet α-granules from FN<sup>syn</sup> mice indicates that αIIbβ3 integrin adhesion to pFN<sup>syn</sup> is not strong enough to allow an efficient uptake of pFN but its reduction is possibly masked by the high amount of FN in plasma.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> showed a significant decrease of the adhesion strength, indicated by inflection point (τ50) on FN<sup>syn</sup> coated surface.
