secretory pathway proteins. We focus on influenza hemaggluttinin (HA), a viral membrane protein that folds in the host’s ER via a complex pathway. By integrating chemical methods to modulate ER proteostasis with deep mutational scanning to assess mutational tolerance, we discover that upregulation of ER proteostasis factors broadly enhances HA mutational tolerance across diverse structural elements. Remarkably, this proteostasis network-enhanced mutational tolerance occurs at the same sites where mutational tolerance is most reduced by propagation at fever-like temperature. These findings have important implications for influenza evolution, because influenza immune escape is contingent on HA possessing sufficient mutational tolerance to evade antibodies while maintaining the capacity to fold and function. More broadly, this work provides the first experimental evidence that ER proteostasis mechanisms define the mutational tolerance and, therefore, the evolution of secretory pathway proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein

Importantly, the consequences of amino acid substitutions for protein folding depend not just on inherent biophysical properties, but also on the environment in which the nascent chain attempts to fold. In cells, this environment is defined most importantly by the proteostasis network, which consists of a subcellular compartment-specific array of chaperones and quality control factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). These proteostasis factors assist client proteins in navigating complex folding landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wyganowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009b</xref>), and are thus theoretically well-positioned to modulate the mutational landscape accessible to evolving proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38795.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The proteostasis boundary model for protein evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The accessibility of protein evolutionary intermediates is defined by protein stability, folding rate, and misfolding rate.

Yet, to date, virtually all studies experimentally examining evolutionary consequences of eukaryotic proteostasis network factors have focused on a single chaperone – HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sangster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>). These focused studies have shown that HSP90 can (1) buffer the phenotypic effects of standing genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sangster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>) and (2) potentiate the phenotypic effects of new mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>), perhaps by facilitating protein folding and minimizing aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geller et al., 2018</xref>). Looking beyond HSP90, we recently leveraged chemical biology tools to demonstrate that other cytosolic proteostasis factors can also modulate protein evolutionary trajectories and mutational tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The potentially critical impact of the extensive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis machinery on the mutational tolerance and evolution of secretory pathway client proteins has remained unexplored. This gap in knowledge is important because roughly 1/3 of the proteome folds in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, thousands of mutations in ER client proteins cause hundreds of currently incurable diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative pathologies to the lysosomal storage disorders and the collagenopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balch et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, viral membrane proteins often fold in the ER and must rapidly evolve to escape host immune factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doud et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, understanding how ER chaperones influence the ability of client proteins to tolerate mutations and adapt to changing environments is essential as we work to design effective therapies for these diseases.</p><p>Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is a uniquely attractive model protein for systematically and quantitatively evaluating whether and how ER proteostasis mechanisms impact client protein mutational tolerance. The folding of HA is perhaps as well-delineated as for any other membrane protein, and HA interacts extensively with components of the host cell’s ER proteostasis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauter et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakajima et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frabutt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurtley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ueda and Sugiura, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gamblin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pankow et al., 2015</xref>). Co-translationally, HA is heavily <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and engages the ER’s lectin chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, which increase HA’s folding efficiency and prevent misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebert et al., 1997</xref>). During the folding process, HA also interacts with protein disulfide isomerases to form its six disulfide bonds, as well as with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), which are the ER homologs of HSP70 and HSP90, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurtley et al., 1989</xref>). Together, these host ER chaperones and folding enzymes assist HA monomer folding and prevent premature trimerization, ensuring that HA reaches its functional conformation or otherwise is targeted for ER-associated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frabutt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Amino acid substitutions that impair HA stability, folding, or trafficking reduce HA fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Glassman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). ER proteostasis factors that assist HA folding and trafficking are thus poised to modulate HA mutational tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because HA variant fitness is directly coupled to viral replication via HA’s role in host cell binding and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauter et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>), we believed that we could apply a deep mutational scanning strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>) to quantitatively evaluate how ER proteostasis impacts the fitness of all viable single amino acid HA variants. Specifically, we aimed to quantify HA variant fitness by sequencing HA mutant viral libraries after selection in modified ER proteostasis environments, an approach that is substantially more sensitive and higher-throughput than the alternative functional assays employed for deep mutational scanning of non-viral secretory pathway clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, HA is an attractive model secretory protein because HA folding is well-characterized, HA interacts extensively with host ER proteostasis factors, and HA mutational tolerance can be comprehensively quantified by pairing deep mutational scanning with sequencing. Moreover, understanding factors that both constrain and enhance HA mutational tolerance has direct therapeutic relevance. HA is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doud et al., 2017</xref>), and influenza immune escape is thus contingent on HA possessing sufficient mutational tolerance to acquire antibody resistance while still maintaining the capacity to fold and function. The potent impact of host chaperones on viral evolutionary trajectories has only recently been realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>), and it remains unknown whether, and to what degree, host proteostasis mechanisms impact viral protein mutational tolerance.</p><p>Below, we integrate deep mutational scanning with small molecule control of ER proteostasis environments to test the hypothesis that upregulating host ER proteostasis factors mitigates the fitness consequences of otherwise biophysically deleterious amino acid substitutions in HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We examine HA mutational tolerance in cells with basal versus upregulated levels of ER proteostasis factors, both at normal body temperature and at an elevated, fever-like temperature. We find that upregulation of the ER proteostasis machinery broadly enhances HA mutational tolerance, while increased temperature generally reduces HA mutational tolerance. Remarkably, the same HA sites where variants are most commonly temperature-sensitive, and therefore most likely to be biophysically problematic, are also the sites where variants benefit most from upregulation of the host’s ER proteostasis machinery. Thus, enhanced host ER proteostasis mechanisms and increased temperature modulate HA mutational tolerance in opposite directions, a finding with important implications for influenza evolution. More broadly, this work provides the first experimental evidence that the composition of the ER proteostasis network can profoundly impact the mutational tolerance and evolution of secretory pathway clients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modulating ER proteostasis during influenza infection</title><p>The composition of the ER proteostasis network is regulated by a stress-responsive signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Under ER stress conditions, the UPR is activated and the IRE1 and ATF6 signaling cascades upregulate distinct but overlapping sets of ER proteostasis network components via the XBP1s and ATF6f transcription factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we profiled HA mutational tolerance at both a normal (37˚C) and a fever-like (39˚C) temperature in distinctive host ER proteostasis environments. ER proteostasis was modulated either by inducing XBP1s alone or by inducing XBP1s in concert with ATF6f in a small molecule-mediated, stress-independent manner in HEK293<sup>ATF6f/XBP1s</sup> cells using previously characterized chemical genetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). In these cells, activation of tetracycline repressor-regulated XBP1s by the small molecule doxycycline induces the transcriptional response downstream of IRE1, remodeling the ER proteostasis environment by enhancing transcript levels of ~180 ER chaperones and quality control factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, induction of destabilized domain-regulated ATF6f by the small molecule trimethoprim in HEK293<sup>ATF6f/XBP1s</sup> cells increases transcript expression of ~40 ER chaperones and quality control factors that are distinct from but partially overlapping with those regulated by XBP1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>).

Receptor binding sites had slightly, but significantly, enhanced mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction, and were unaffected by increased temperature. In contrast, the mutational tolerance at antigenic sites was substantially impacted by both XBP1s induction and increased temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; functional/structural role). Moreover, sites in N-glycosylation sequons and cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonding, which engage glycoprotein chaperones and protein disulfide isomerases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebert et al., 1997</xref>), had enhanced mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction and reduced mutational tolerance upon increased temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; glyc. sequon/disulfide bond). Some of these sites—discussed in more detail below—were among the most affected by temperature and ER proteostasis factors.</p><p>Furthermore, we assessed whether ER proteostasis mechanisms and temperature differentially impact HA mutational tolerance at sites based on evolutionary conservation and surface accessibility. Specifically, we evaluated site conservation across 989 human H1 sequences from the Influenza Research Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We considered completely conserved sites as conserved and all other sites as variable, and plotted the net site diffsel values for conserved and variable sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; conservation), as well as the site conservation as a function of the net site diffsel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This analysis illustrated that temperature and XBP1s induction affected mutational tolerance at both variable and conserved sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; conservation). However, the mutational tolerance at variable sites was more affected than at conserved sites, as indicated by the net site diffsel values for conserved sites clustering near zero, whereas the net site diffsel values for variable sites were more evenly distributed along the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Still, the modest impact on conserved sites suggested that host temperature and proteostasis mechanisms could modulate mutational tolerance at essentially any site in HA, regardless of the operating structural and functional constraints. This conclusion is consistent with the distribution of net site diffsel values as a function of surface accessibility, which revealed that mutational tolerance was impacted by XBP1s induction and temperature at both buried and surface-exposed sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; surface accessibility), though surface-exposed sites were often more affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We note that, similar to the mutation diffsel distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the site diffsel distributions for ATF6f/XBP1s induction mirrored those for XBP1s induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined the structural location of HA sites most impacted by host proteostasis mechanisms and temperature. Mapping net site diffsel values onto the HA crystal structure revealed that these selection pressures affect the mutational tolerance of sites across HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> (ATF6f/XBP1s)). Many HA sites strongly impacted by host ER proteostasis factors and temperature were in the globular head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). For example, K170, P175, and K176 were among the most mutationally intolerant sites upon increased temperature and the most mutationally tolerant sites upon induction of XBP1s or ATF6f/XBP1s (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These sites are on the surface of the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), in a region where positively charged residues, such as K170 and K176, increase host receptor binding and hinder antibody escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hensley et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, the P175 site was the site most affected by XBP1s and ATF6f/XBP1s activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although P175 is a trans-proline in an unstructured coil, and is therefore less impactful than if found in a region of defined HA secondary structure, its mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction could still be mediated by prolyl isomerase activity regulated by the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, several sites in the stem domain were strongly impacted by host ER proteostasis factors and temperature. For instance, mutational tolerance at the N497 and T499 sites was considerably reduced upon XBP1s induction, ATF6f/XBP1s induction, and upon increased temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), likely because these residues constitute an <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sequon. <italic>N</italic>-Linked glycosylation directs the co- and post-translational folding pathways of HA. Removal of this glycosylation sequon may reduce the interaction of HA with the glycoprotein chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, thereby hindering HA folding and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebert et al., 1997</xref>). Altogether, host ER proteostasis factors and temperature impact the mutational tolerance at sites across the entire HA structure, irrespective of secondary structure and surface accessibility. Sites that are especially affected contain wild-type residues that likely mediate interactions between HA and host ER proteostasis factors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38795.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mutational tolerance at sites across the mature HA protein was impacted by XBP1s induction and increased temperature.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average net site diffsel values (which correspond to mutational tolerance) are mapped onto the HA crystal structure PDBID 1RVX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gamblin et al., 2004</xref>), with select outliers from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> labeled.

Activation of the XBP1s arm of the UPR globally enhanced the mutational tolerance of HA, while increased host cell temperature globally reduced the mutational tolerance of HA. Notably, the variants that were most enriched upon XBP1s induction corresponded to those most depleted upon increased temperature. This anti-correlation indicates that temperature-sensitive variants, which are likely biophysically deleterious relative to wild-type HA, are most likely to be rescued by the ER proteostasis machinery.</p><p>These selection pressures exerted similar fitness effects across the entire HA protein, influencing sites that differ in their secondary structure, surface accessibility, conservation in natural H1 sequences, and functional and structural roles. This impact is in stark contrast to selection pressures such as immune escape or drug resistance, which typically select for variants at a few specific sites. Universally modulating HA mutational tolerance suggests that host temperature and ER proteostasis mechanisms can shift the distribution of fitness effects of mutations on HA, and therefore are likely to broadly influence the accessibility of HA evolutionary trajectories. Because we observe a particularly strong impact at antigenic sites in the HA head domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>), inhibition of ER proteostasis mechanisms may limit the accessibility of antibody escape variants. This therapeutic strategy is especially appealing because prior work has demonstrated that influenza infection can induce the unfolded protein response and that ER proteostasis mechanisms are essential for influenza propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frabutt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hassan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Similar to previous studies on the role of HSP90 in the evolution of endogenous protein clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>), our observations may derive from direct interactions between host proteostasis components and HA, or as an indirect consequence of perturbing proteostasis. The negative correlation we observe between upregulating ER proteostasis factors and increasing temperature evidences the former, because variants with compromised fitness in a biophysically challenging environment are most impacted by the ER proteostasis machinery. Alternatively, ER proteostasis factors and increased temperature may affect the kinetics of infection or expression of third-party mediators that regulate HA function or fitness.</p><p>Irrespective of the precise mechanism, this study provides the first experimental evidence that ER proteostasis factors define the mutational tolerance of a secretory pathway client protein, a phenomenon that likely extends far beyond HA and viral evolution. Prior to this work, chaperones known to potentiate and buffer protein evolution were limited to cytosolic isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>), largely of HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sangster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geller et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we show that this role extends to ER chaperones and quality control machinery involved in the folding and assembly of membrane and secretory proteins. We note that understanding the evolutionary constraints of membrane and secretory proteins is critical, as they comprise highly significant therapeutic targets, including collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiChiara et al., 2016</xref>), G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laschet et al., 2018</xref>), antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2018</xref>), and viral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurtley et al., 1989</xref>). This work suggests that ER proteostasis mechanisms could be tuned to ameliorate protein-misfolding diseases or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. Further investigation into the impact of ER proteostasis factors on the mutational tolerance of additional secretory pathway client proteins, as well as non-client proteins, will elucidate the underlying molecular details and the pervasiveness of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Influenza A virus)</td><td>Influenza A/WSN/1933</td><td>PMID 27271655</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Influenza A virus)</td><td>Influenza A/WSN/1933 <break/>Mutant Library 1</td><td>PMID 27271655</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Influenza A virus)</td><td>Influenza A/WSN/1933 <break/>Mutant Library 2</td><td>PMID 27271655</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(Influenza A virus)</td><td>Influenza A/WSN/1933 <break/>Mutant Library 3</td><td>PMID 27271655</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">HEK293<sup>ATF6f/XBP1s</sup></td><td>PMID 23583182</td><td/></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW181-PB2</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW182-PB1</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW183-PA</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW184-HA</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW185-NP</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW186-NA</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW187-M</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pHW188-NS1</td><td>PMID 10801978</td><td>plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>dms_tools</td><td>PMID 25990960</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The following plasmids were used for generating A/WSN/1933 influenza virus: pHW181-PB2, pHW182-PB1, pHW183-PA, pHW184-HA, pHW185-NP, pHW186-NA, pHW187-M, and pHW188-NS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293<sup>ATF6f/XBP1s</sup> cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere in DMEM (CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (CellGro).

After 2 hr, the inoculum was replaced with fresh WSN media supplied with 0.01% DMSO, 0.1 μg/mL doxycycline, or 0.1 μg/mL doxycycline and 1 μM TMP. 48 hr post-infection, infectious supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and stored at –80°C. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL infectious supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit and at least 10<sup>6</sup> HA molecules were reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 5ʹ-WSN-HA and 3ʹ-WSN-HA primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The dsDNA was purified twice using 0.9 × AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using a Quant-iT PicoGreen assay (Life Technologies). Illumina NexteraXT sequencing libraries were prepared using a Mosquito HTS liquid handler (TTP Labtech) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with 50 bp single-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Pairwise competition sequencing data analysis</title><p>To overcome biases in read mapping from consecutive, multi-nucleotide sequence variants, mapping target sequences were generated for each Influenza A/WSN/1933 HA variant. Briefly, regions flanking the variant (given the experimental read length) would be identified, relevant groups of bases substituted with their engineered variants, and the rest of the sequence substituted with ‘N’ in order to maintain the sequence position of said variants, thus generating sets of ‘pseudo-haplotypes’. Sequencing reads were aligned to the wild-type Influenza A/WSN/1933 HA sequence and the set of pseudo-haplotypes using bwa mem (v. 0.7.12-r1039) (arXiv:1303.3997), with flag –t 16, and sorted and indexed bam files were generated using samtools (v 1.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2009</xref>). These bam files were processed using samtools mpileup with flags –excl-flags 2052, -d 30000000 and the same reference sequences used for mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). Allele counts at each position of the wild-type and pseudo-haplotype sequences were summed and reported along the wild-type Influenza A/WSN/1933 HA sequence for each sample for calculation of variant frequencies. The change in variant frequency upon selection was normalized to that of wild-type, thus providing diffsel values on the same scale as the DMS competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments were performed in biological triplicate with replicates defined as independent experimental entireties (i.e., from plating the cells to acquiring the data). For deep mutational scanning, each biological replicate mutant viral library was prepared from independently generated mutant plasmid libraries, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>). Differential selection values from deep mutational scanning, as well as selection values from pairwise competitions, were tested for significance of deviation from zero (wild-type behavior), using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test in Graph Pad Prism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Enhanced ER proteostasis and temperature differentially impact the mutational tolerance of influenza hemagglutinin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ulrich Hartl as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Raul Andino (Reviewer #2); Jeffery W Kelly (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Philips et al. explore the impact of ER proteostasis on the mutational and fitness landscape of a model substrate of the secretory pathway – influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). The authors extend upon their (and others') previous work on host cell cytosolic proteostasis influence on viral sequence space.</p><p>The authors make use of a saturating library of single site HA mutants in a cellular assay of infection and replicative fitness of the mutant virions in comparison to the wild type HA in various conditions. Using targeted deep sequencing of HA, they were able to identify the spectrum of mutations which were either enriched or depleted (deep mutational scanning or DMS) under these conditions. They show that enhancing host cell ER proteostasis broadly increases mutational tolerance across the length of the model substrate HA and is likely to be relevant to shaping evolutionary trajectories of endogenous secretory pathway proteins. Importantly, they observe a striking rescue of high-temperature sensitive mutants by such an enhanced ER proteostatic state.</p><p>The data presented is comprehensive and extends our understanding of how compartment specific proteostasis mechanisms assist in shaping protein evolution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major issue with the authors’ central conclusion is that they did not examine other viral protein. If the proteostasis machinery has a direct effect on HA evolution it would be important to present evidence that other viral proteins are not affected, e.g. those that are not translocated into the ER. This point is important because it is possible that upregulation of the ER proteostasis pathway may result in pleiotropic and indirect effects on virus evolution. For example, ER proteostasis factors may affect expression of other factors that regulate HA function. Indeed, XBP1s regulates ~350 genes and ATF6f also affects a number of chaperones and quality control components. If other viral proteins are not analyzed, it is difficult to conclude that the observed effect is direct on client proteins.</p><p>It is suggested that the authors make a clear statement to the effect that their data cannot exclude the possibility that proteostasis effects not specific for the ER play a role.</p><p>2) Similarly, the increase on temperature (39°C) could modify factors and the kinetics of infection that indirectly can affect selection on HA variants. For example, have the authors considered the effect on translation and ER translocation rates?</p><p>This point could be addressed either experimentally or verbally.</p><p>3) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the authors examine the modified background conditions prior to conducting the DMS using RNAseq and claim consistency with their previous dataset. A visual comparison in the form of a Venn diagram (fold change based, at least, given that their previous dataset was from microarrays) can be presented to clarify the degree of overlap and outliers, if any.</p><p>4) Subsection “Modulating ER proteostasis during influenza infection”, third paragraph. The authors state that reduced growth did not affect the interpretation of the data. They should provide the average depth per sample and other related statistics either as a supplementary table or describe this in the methods. A replicate fidelity measure like a correlation coefficient or simple PCA would add to the validity of the dataset as a whole.</p><p>5) In the section describing the data filtering (subsection “Deep mutational scanning of HA in modulated ER proteostasis environments”, third paragraph), the reader would like to know the actual dropout percentages as per exclusion criteria (given numerically as a table).</p><p>6) In Figure 5A, the authors describe that at high temperature there is a gross reduction in the variant growth, consistent with the hypothesis of biophysical constraints imposed on them. Physiologically, this is likely due to a misfolding and degradation of the variants. Given that host cells do not upregulate components of ERAD at higher temperature (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) – is ERAD engaged more at such temperatures without burdening the overall proteostasis? Also, in conditions of UPR activation, at permissive and higher temperatures, the RNAseq data reveal highly upregulated ERAD components (in addition to other factors). Should the same variants not be subject to degradation? How many variants do not get enriched upon the ER proteostasis boost? The authors could explain their results in some more specific details.</p><p>7) Again related to Figure 5A, in the subsection “Deep mutational scanning of HA in modulated ER proteostasis environments”, fifth paragraph, describe the redundancy of the variants having a positive diffsel score between XBP1s and ATF6f/XBP1s conditions. Although the authors comment about the similarity, it would be interesting to see which sites overlap and which do not, possibly shedding light on subtle differences between the two modes of UPR activation.</p><p>8) Figure 7A describes the mutational tolerance in the XBP1s condition alone. What about the ATF6f/XBP1s condition?</p><p>9) In Figure 7B and 7C, the y-axis is unclear – is it a continuum from conserved to variable? Buried to exposed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38795.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major issue with the authors’ central conclusion is that they did not examine other viral protein.

In the original submission, we briefly addressed this possibility in the Discussion. We have now expanded that discussion to include the possible secondary effects of increased temperature (as requested in Essential revision #2, below), and also to explicitly state that future work is necessary to determine if the observed effects are specific to secretory pathway client proteins:</p><p>“Similar to previous studies on the role of HSP90 in the evolution of endogenous protein clients (Cowen and Lindquist, 2005), our observations may derive from direct interactions between host proteostasis components and HA, or as an indirect consequence of perturbing proteostasis. […] Alternatively, ER proteostasis factors and increased temperature may affect the kinetics of infection or expression of third-party mediators that regulate HA function or fitness.”</p><p>“Further investigation into the impact of ER proteostasis factors on the mutational tolerance of additional secretory pathway client proteins, as well as non-client proteins, will elucidate the underlying molecular details and the pervasiveness of our findings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the increase on temperature (39°C) could modify factors and the kinetics of infection that indirectly can affect selection on HA variants.

Per the request, this comparison is now presented as a Venn diagram in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. We also expanded our discussion of this dataset comparison to address the degree of overlap and possible explanations for discrepancies (e.g. different treatment conditions and transcriptomic measurements), as follows:</p><p>“The media composition and treatment regimen for influenza propagation differed from the conditions used in the original characterization of XBP1s and ATF6f/XBP1s activation in these cells, which also was performed only at 37 ˚C (Shoulders et al., 2013). […] Still, as expected (Shoulders et al., 2013), transcripts upregulated upon XBP1s and ATF6f/XBP1s induction largely corresponded to secretory pathway and ER stress response genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—source data 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Modulating ER proteostasis during influenza infection”, third paragraph. The authors state that reduced growth did not affect the interpretation of the data. They should provide the average depth per sample and other related statistics either as a supplementary table or describe this in the methods. A replicate fidelity measure like a correlation coefficient or simple PCA would add to the validity of the dataset as a whole.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these sequencing statistics are important for assessing the validity of the dataset. In the original submission, the number of read pairs, number of barcoded read pairs, and number of reads per barcode were reported for each sample in Source Data 1. We now realize that this information was not easily accessible, and revised the Materials and Methods to explicitly describe the sequencing library preparation and data processing and also specified the precise location of this information in Source Data 1. We also note that the samples with reduced viral growth were held to identical library preparation and sequencing data analyses standards, such that the diversity of each mutant viral library was sufficiently sampled and accurately quantified. The revised discussion follows below:</p><p>“At least 10<sup>6</sup> HA molecules were PCR-amplified for preparation of subamplicon sequencing libraries, as previously described (Russell, Trapnell and Bloom, 2018), to ensure sufficient sampling of viral library diversity. […] In a second round of PCR, the complexity of the uniquely barcoded subamplicons is controlled to be less than the sequencing depth, and the remainder of the Illumina adapter is appended (Russell, Trapnell and Bloom, 2018).”</p><p>“dms_tools (http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools/) (Doud and Bloom, 2016) was used to align reads to the Influenza A/WSN/1933 HA reference sequence, count amino acid variants across HA, and calculate the differential selection for each variant between two selection conditions, as previously described (Doud, Hensley and Bloom, 2017). […] For each sample, the number of read pairs, barcoded read pairs, and reads per barcode are reported in Source Data 1 (see sample _summarystats.txt) and the complete sequencing data analyses are available at https://github.com/amphilli/HA_DMS_2018.”</p><p>Furthermore, per the reviewers’ suggestion, we evaluated the correlation between unfiltered site differential selection values for biological replicates, and have provided these correlation coefficients in Figure 3—source data 1. Additionally, we have added a statement to the Results to summarize the correlation between replicates:</p><p>“Notably, the unfiltered biological replicate diffsel values were strongly correlated across HA sites, with correlation coefficients ranging from <italic>R</italic> = 0.67–0.78 (Figure 3—source data 1 and Source Data 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the section describing the data filtering (subsection “Deep mutational scanning of HA in modulated ER proteostasis environments”, third paragraph), the reader would like to know the actual dropout percentages as per exclusion criteria (given numerically as a table).</p></disp-quote><p>There is now a table presented in Figure 3C summarizing the percentage of amino acid space sampled by each replicate mutant library, and also the percentage sampled for all three replicate libraries, and hence passing the filtering criteria. We note that, while calculating these numbers in revision, we noticed a mistake in our original filtering code that caused it to be falsely stringent for select phenylalanine variants and falsely relaxed for select glycine variants. After fixing this mistake and re-analyzing the data, the change in whether these variants passed our filters or not had no significant impact on the results or on any of our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5A, the authors describe that at high temperature there is a gross reduction in the variant growth, consistent with the hypothesis of biophysical constraints imposed on them. Physiologically, this is likely due to a misfolding and degradation of the variants. Given that host cells do not upregulate components of ERAD at higher temperature (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) – is ERAD engaged more at such temperatures without burdening the overall proteostasis? Also, in conditions of UPR activation, at permissive and higher temperatures, the RNAseq data reveal highly upregulated ERAD components (in addition to other factors). Should the same variants not be subject to degradation? How many variants do not get enriched upon the ER proteostasis boost? The authors could explain their results in some more specific details.</p></disp-quote><p>Reduction in variant growth at 39˚C may be caused by enhanced ER-associated degradation (ERAD), as the reviewer suggests, or it may be caused by reduced variant folding rates (and thus slower variant viral growth). Though we do not observe upregulation of ERAD factors (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), our data do not speak to the activity of ERAD components at elevated temperature. As the reviewer suggests, it is certainly possible that ERAD components are engaged more at elevated temperature, resulting in the degradation of HA variants without inducing upregulation of ERAD factors.</p><p>Also as the reviewer suggests, UPR activation indeed upregulates ERAD components, in addition to ER chaperones and other proteostasis factors (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D). Thus, variants could certainly be either assisted or degraded by induction of the UPR. The number of enriched and depleted variants is now noted in Figure 5A, though we emphasize that these numbers are all relative to how the wild-type HA performs, and thus positive and negative values do not reflect folding and degradation, respectively. We modified our Results section to elaborate on these points:</p><p>“This analysis confirmed that increased temperature indeed generally reduced mutant HA viral growth, resulting in depletion (i.e. diffsel &lt; 0) of 597 variants versus enrichment (i.e. diffsel &gt; 0) of only 361 variants, relative to wild-type HA (Figure 5A). […] For example, these perturbations could potentially impact the protein levels and activities of other host proteins that engage HA, or perhaps differentially modulate viral growth kinetics.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Again related to Figure 5A, in the subsection “Deep mutational scanning of HA in modulated ER proteostasis environments”, fifth paragraph, describe the redundancy of the variants having a positive diffsel score between XBP1s and ATF6f/XBP1s conditions. Although the authors comment about the similarity, it would be interesting to see which sites overlap and which do not, possibly shedding light on subtle differences between the two modes of UPR activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this comparison is interesting and have added a correlation plot comparing activation of ATF6f/XBP1s and XBP1s as Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Outliers that are highly enriched or depleted in both conditions are labeled, and the full list of differential selection values for variants in these selection conditions is provided in Figure 5—source data 1. We note that few sites are strongly enriched in one condition and strongly depleted in the other. We also added references to Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1 to support our comments in the manuscript:</p><p>“The enhanced variant growth upon XBP1s induction alone was quite similar to that of simultaneous induction of XBP1s and ATF6f (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1), and is thus either predominantly caused by XBP1s, or by XBP1s-regulated factors that are redundant with those regulated by ATF6f.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7A describes the mutational tolerance in the XBP1s condition alone. What about the ATF6f/XBP1s condition?</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to the mutation differential selection distributions presented in Figure 5A, the site differential selection distributions (i.e. mutational tolerance distributions) for ATF6f/XBP1s are essentially identical to that of XBP1s alone, and were thus excluded from the original manuscript in an effort to simplify Figure 7. To address the reviewer’s question, we have now presented this analysis for ATF6f/XBP1s induction in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, and have commented on their similarity in the manuscript:</p><p>“We note that, similar to the mutation diffsel distributions (Figure 5A), the site diffsel distributions for ATF6f/XBP1s induction mirrored those for XBP1s induction (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Furthermore, we also mapped the site diffsel values onto the HA crystal structure for ATF6f/XBP1s induction (Figure 8—figure supplement 1):</p><p>“Mapping net site diffsel values onto the HA crystal structure revealed that these selection pressures affect the mutational tolerance of sites across HA (Figure 8; Figure 8—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 7B and 7C, the y-axis is unclear – is it a continuum from conserved to variable? Buried to exposed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the y-axis in the original manuscript was unclear and have provided more detailed figure legends for Figures 7B–C to address this concern:</p><p>“(B) Net site diffsel is plotted as a function of site conservation, where x = 0 corresponds to a completely conserved site among 989 non-redundant human H1 sequences (1918–2008) (38). (C) Net site diffsel is plotted as a function of site surface accessibility, where x = 0 corresponds to a buried residue in the (PDBID 1RVX (32)).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
