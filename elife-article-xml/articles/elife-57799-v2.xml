Sixty percent of mRNAs from its extremely AT-rich (81%) genome harbor long polyadenosine (polyA) runs within their ORFs, distinguishing the parasite from its hosts and other sequenced organisms. Recent studies indicate polyA runs cause ribosome stalling and frameshifting, triggering mRNA surveillance pathways and attenuating protein synthesis. Here, we show that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is an exception to this rule. We demonstrate that both endogenous genes and reporter sequences containing long polyA runs are efficiently and accurately translated in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells. We show that polyA runs do not elicit any response from No Go Decay (NGD) or result in the production of frameshifted proteins. This is in stark contrast to what we observe in human cells or <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, an organism with similar AT-content. Finally, using stalling reporters we show that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells evolved not to have a fully functional NGD pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>no go decay</kwd><kwd>poly lysine</kwd><kwd>polyA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Djuranovic</surname><given-names>Sergej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1412336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chalker</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 GM112877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moss</surname><given-names>Walter N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erath</surname><given-names>Jessey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>St. Louis Children’s Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDI-CORE-2015-505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayguinov</surname><given-names>Peter O</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>St. Louis Children’s Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDI-CORE-2019-813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayguinov</surname><given-names>Peter O</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011912</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayguinov</surname><given-names>Peter O</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007338</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Barnes-Jewish Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayguinov</surname><given-names>Peter O</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adaptations in protein synthesis and mRNA surveillance machinery enabled the malaria-causing parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to efficiently and accurately translate long polyA nucleotide runs into long poly-lysine peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complex life cycle of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, responsible for 90% of all malaria-associated deaths, involves multiple stages in both the human and mosquito hosts. Asexual replication during the intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC) is tightly regulated over a 48 hr period, involving the expression of the majority of its genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gerald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caro et al., 2014</xref>). Progression through asexual stages (ring, trophozoite, schizont) of the IDC requires a strictly controlled panel of gene expression profiles for each stage. A range of 16–32 daughter cells results from the IDC. Thus, a single, originating merozoite must undergo several rounds of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and nuclear division in a relatively short period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gerald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caro et al., 2014</xref>). The apparent necessity for rapid and accurate DNA replication needs to be accompanied by large-scale RNA transcription and protein synthesis. These processes occur during the 24 hr of trophozoite stage before erythrocytic schizogeny and cytokinesis. Recent saturation-level mutagenesis of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome further emphasized and demonstrated that genes associated with cell cycle control, translation, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and drug resistance are more likely to be essential for parasites fitness and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang, 2018</xref>). However, a faithful execution of these fundamental processes is challenged by the extremely AT-rich <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome: averaging ~81% in overall AT content. With a relatively small difference in AT-richness between the non-coding and coding regions; <italic>P. falciparum</italic> represents a unique case from other AT-rich organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Glöckner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Szafranski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zilversmit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Erath et al., 2019</xref>). While the underlying reasons for such disproportionate representation of the four nucleotides in any given genome may be different, it is of vital importance that shifts towards extreme AT- or GC-richness must be accommodated by adaptation of the transcription and translation apparatuses; enabling the cell to transcribe and translate each gene appropriately.</p><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that the translation of genes with polyadenosine runs (polyA tracts), primarily coding for lysine residues, is attenuated in the majority of tested organisms presumably due to ribosomal stalling and frameshifting on such RNA motifs by action of ribosome-quality control complex (RQC) and mRNA surveillance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur and Djuranovic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tournu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szádeczky-Kardoss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tuck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). In human tissue cultures, the presence of just 12 adenosines in an mRNA-coding region was found to reduce the yield of protein synthesis by more than 40%, and runs of 30–60 adenosine nucleotides reduce protein synthesis by more than 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). This effect on translation was observed in all tested organisms that include fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), yeasts (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>), plants (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zilversmit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tournu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szádeczky-Kardoss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tuck et al., 2020</xref>); arguing for a universal response to coding polyA repeats. The consequence of translational arrest or slippage on polyA runs is the activation of RQC and one or more mRNA surveillance mechanisms, mainly No-Go (NGD) and Non-sense Mediated Decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur and Djuranovic, 2018</xref>). High AU-content within transcript coding regions and an extreme AAA and AAU codon bias increase the propensity for polyA tracts in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saul and Battistutta, 1988</xref>). Additionally, a ‘just-in-time’ transcriptional and translational model of gene expression during the relatively short trophozoite stage of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> IDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coulson et al., 2004</xref>) make a rapid protein synthesis in an AU-rich transcriptome an appealing problem. While both, DNA and RNA polymerases must contend with high DNA AT-content, it is also puzzling what adaptations <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have made to its translational machinery to overcome the unusual AU-richness of mRNAs, which would affect the fidelity and efficacy of protein synthesis. With ‘just-in-time’ translation of numerous A-rich coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Szafranski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Erath et al., 2019</xref>) and poly-lysine proteins harboring an AAA codon bias, expressed at all stages in the parasite life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bunnik et al., 2013</xref>), the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> translation machinery would represent an exception in protein synthesis compared to other organisms.</p><p>Here we present data that indicate that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> translational machinery and its NGD pathway have adapted to translate long runs of polyadenosine nucleotides into poly-lysine repeats. Using comparative bionformatic analyses, we show that malaria parasites contain an unusually high numbers of polyA-tract-containing genes compared to other eukaryotic organisms. We find this to be a common feature of all analyzed <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species regardless of their AT-content, arguing for evolutionary conservation of such sequences in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomes. Expression of endogenous genes and reporters with polyA tract motifs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells results in efficient and accurate protein synthesis in direct contrast to what we observe for human-tissue cultures and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> cells. We find no evidence for either ribosomal stalling or frameshifting during the translation of long polyadenosine runs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells. Interestingly, induction of the NGD pathway by either reporter with stable RNA structure or isoleucine starvation results in reduced reporter protein levels but without any detectable changes in mRNA levels, arguing for alterations in the NGD pathway. Finally, our analysis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosome structure suggests a model whereby multiple changes may have evolved to accommodate the unusual AU-richness and high percentage of poly–lysine runs of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptome and proteome, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Plasmodium species:</italic> A paradigm-breaking genus</title><p>Previous studies indicated that polyA runs in the coding sequences serve as hurdles to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur and Djuranovic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tournu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szádeczky-Kardoss et al., 2018</xref>) that efficiently reduce protein yield and initiate NGD to degrade the mRNA. Given the very high AT-content in certain eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Glöckner, 2000</xref>) we sought to explore the association between coding region AT-content and transcript polyA-tract-motif abundance. In doing so, we analyzed 152 eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We focused on stretches of polyadenosine nucleotides, or as defined previously 12A-1 motifs; sequences with a minimal length of 12 A’s allowing for one mismatched base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>). We settled on 12A-1 sequence pattern since the presence of this motif reduces protein production by 40–60% in multiple human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tuck et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequent analyses indicated that the reduction in protein amounts for genes with 12A-1 motif could be attributed to ribosome stalling and frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>).

These two groups, which also appear to be separated geographically, demonstrate that even with a reduction in genomic AT-content, selective pressure exists for <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> to maintain polyA tract motifs. However, regardless of a selective reduction of AT-content in some <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, or an almost complete lack thereof in the case of avian <italic>Plasmodium</italic> counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Videvall, 2018</xref>), the trend of harboring a high ratio of polyA-affected transcripts given a particular AT-richness, as well as their conservation within a significant number of genes across species, remains a paradigm-breaking hallmark of the genus.</p><p>To further emphasize the differences between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and other organisms, we analyzed the number of genes that harbor polyA runs as well as the total length of consecutive adenosine nucleotides in transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, respectively). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> showed a significantly higher amount of genes with polyA runs of ≥12 A’s in a row when compared with its human and mosquito (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Over 63% of genes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have polyA tract motifs, while only 0.7–2% of total genes in humans and mosquito genomes, respectively, contain these motifs. We used the most recently updated Ensembl database to look into coding sequences of lab strain of malaria <italic>P. falciparum 3D7</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens,</italic> and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). While there is already a significant difference in the number of genes with eleven consecutive adenosines (<italic>P. falciparum 3D7</italic> – 1555, <italic>T. thermophila</italic> - 364 and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> - 77 genes), the most striking sequence difference is associated with 16 consecutive adenosines (16As). The <italic>P. falciparum 3D7</italic> genome contains 188 genes with 16As, while the human host and AT-rich <italic>T. thermophila</italic> together have only three genes (<italic>T. thermophila</italic> two and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>T. thermophila</italic> a protozoan with an overall 73% AT-rich genome and 24,000 predicted genes, had almost nine times less genes with twelve consecutive adenosines than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 172 and 1526, respectively. <italic>Ensembl</italic> database reports 105 <italic>P. falciparum 3D7</italic> genes with exactly 18As and more than 150 genes with more than 20 consecutive adenosines (20-65As, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analyses of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes in the PlasmoDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beznosková et al., 2013</xref>), curated explicitly for malaria parasite species, report more than double that number with 329 genes having runs of ≥20 consecutive adenosines. Most of these genes appear to be annotated as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> specific. However, PlasmoDB also shows genes with up to 59 consecutive adenosines in conserved pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase gene (PfML01_010014200), which is involved in the inositol metabolism and signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beznosková et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the maximum length of consecutive adenosine runs in coding sequences of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomes indicated 111 As in <italic>P. falciparum fch four</italic> strain with the human host or 132 As in <italic>P. reichenowi</italic>, strain causing chimpanzee malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Erath et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Habich et al., 2016</xref>). As such, the length of polyA runs in coding sequences of malaria parasites exceeds the length of the average size of 3’UTR polyA tails found on the majority of transcripts in eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Sachs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chang et al., 2014</xref>).

However, it was already shown that codon bias and tRNA abundance do not correlate with codon selection in genes coding for lysine repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>). The poly-lysine repeats in proteins of the analyzed model organisms are usually encoded by AAG codons. To investigate the distribution of AAA and AAG codons in poly-lysine tracts in more detail, we analyzed transcripts from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and 152 other eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed a complete reversal of the trend exhibited in other organisms, including humans and the AT-rich <italic>T. thermophila. P. falciparum</italic> had the highest abundance of transcripts hosting four consecutive AAA codons in runs of four lysine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This divergence from other analyzed transcriptomes is preserved in other members of <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic>, with <italic>P. berghei</italic> being an extreme example using only AAA codons in 68% of transcripts coding for poly-lysine runs. Finally, we analyzed the biological function and essentiality of the polyA tract and poly-lysine containing genes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome. Previous analysis indicated that 70–85% of orthologs of polyA tract carrying genes from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have the same polyA motifs in genes from other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, regardless of their genomic AT content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Habich et al., 2016</xref>). The high degree of the conservation of polyA tracts has also been noted for other eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>). A majority of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> polyA tracts genes and poly-lysine proteins fall into the group of essential genes based on the recent mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang, 2018</xref>). This outcome is expected given that gene ontology results indicate enrichment in gene products involved in crucial cellular processes such as protein synthesis, RNA biogenesis, and chromosome segregation. The same gene ontology groups were previously observed in poly-lysine repeats and polyA tract genes of the other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to these groups, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species also had enrichment of polyA tract motifs in a group of genes defined as the cellular and pathological cell adhesion ontology group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As such, our overall bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomes represent a unique set of organisms that have an enrichment of polyA tracts in the coding sequences. The overall conservation of both polyA tracts in the transcriptome and poly-lysine repeats in the proteome of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been evolutionary selected and conserved due to possible benefits for the parasite.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reporters with polyA tracts are not a problem for <italic>P. falciparum</italic></title><p>As mentioned earlier, polyA tracts and poly-lysine repeats cause a reduction in mRNA stability and protein amounts, respectively, due to the ribosomal stalling and frameshifting on such motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthur and Djuranovic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garzia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Juszkiewicz and Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tournu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szádeczky-Kardoss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>).

While we observe a relatively small increase in the number of elongating ribosomes on polyA segments in the late trophozoite and schizont stages of IDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is unclear if these indicate higher protein expression or are just an artifact of a general increase in protein synthesis at this IDC stages.</p><p>In parallel with analyses of ribosome profiling data, we also selected a small subset of polyA tract-containing genes for independent expression analysis. We followed PfGAPDH (PF3D7_1462800) as a control gene without polyA tract, and <italic>Pf</italic>ZFP (PF3D7_1464200 (three polyA tracts and run of 20 consecutive adenosines), <italic>Pf</italic>CRK5 - PF3D7_0615500 (four polyA tracts and run of 20As) and <italic>Pf</italic>IWS1L - PF3D7_1108000 (three polyA tracts and run of 31As), to represent genes with polyA tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>Pf</italic>ZFP is a zinc-binding protein with homology to the human ZC3H6 gene (Zinc Finger CCCH Domain-Containing Protein 6), <italic>Pf</italic>CRK5 is cdc2-related protein kinase five and PfIWS1L is transcription elongation factor associated with RNA Polymerase II. We used a sorbitol based method to synchronize <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Dd2 strain at the ring stage of IDC and followed transcript profiles over the next 48 hr of the parasite life cycle. The mRNA profiles of three polyA tract genes were analyzed using qRT-PCR and normalized to the expression of <italic>Pf</italic>GAPDH in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Dd2 lab strain. A time-course study of synchronized parasite culture indicated that the selected polyA tract transcripts are efficiently transcribed at all-time points when compared to the control gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, the increase in transcription of all three polyA tract genes followed previously described just-in-time transcription profile in trophozoite and schizont IDC stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p>Finally, mRNA translation could also be affected by the ability of RNA to fold into unique functional structures; for example RNA secondary structures have been shown to coordinate ribosomal frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mouzakis et al., 2013</xref>), slow ribosomal progression to allow protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Faure et al., 2016</xref>) and to affect ribosomal density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zur and Tuller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2017</xref>). To determine the RNA structural characteristics of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptome, we analyzed the ability of all coding sequences to form thermodynamically stable RNA secondary structures using an in silico approach to characterize RNA folding landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2019</xref>). We compared the relative structural stability of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptome to that of humans and the AU-rich <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. On average, the coding sequences from <italic>T. thermophila</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> yielded structures with higher predicted minimum free energy (MFE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), than those from the coding sequences of human genes; a result which mostly correlates with the higher overall AU-content of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> transcripts. In this analysis, each MFE is also characterized by a thermodynamic z-score (see Materials and methods). The thermodynamic z-score normalizes for nucleotide content and suggests whether sequences may form potentially functional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clote et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, the thermodynamic z-score indicates whether a nucleotide sequence has been ordered to adopt a more stable secondary structure than its nucleotide content would typically produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clote et al., 2005</xref>) (which is the case for many ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freyhult et al., 2005</xref>) as well as RNA regulatory structures embedded in mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">O'Leary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly transcriptome z-scores revealed no significant differences between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This result indicates that while RNA folding stability varies between species, following from skews in nucleotide content, the potential occurrence of ordered, structured motifs does not. This suggests that globally, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> coding sequences do not appear ordered to adopt structures any more stable than would be expected for random sequences or with the same nucleotide content found <italic>in T. thermophila</italic>. However, expression of reporters with polyA-tracts in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> is strongly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This computational effort does not take into account the most recent work describing the m6A mRNA methylation dynamics within <italic>P. falciparum</italic> coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumgarten et al., 2019</xref>).

The Pelota protein in complex with Hbs1 recognizes and rescues stalled ribosomes with an empty A site on long polyA stretches, absence of tRNAs during starvation, damaged mRNAs, or stable RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guydosh and Green, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsuboi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hilal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becker et al., 2011</xref>).

The deletion of RACK1/Asc1 in human or yeast cells was also shown to increase the production of proteins with polybasic peptides, however, at the cost of increased frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuroha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wolf and Grayhack, 2015</xref>). The recent report has shown that the absence of Asc1 in yeast generally slows down elongation, promoting frameshifting on problematic CGA-CGA pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms proposed for the polyA-induced ribosome stalling involves the inhibitory conformation of polyA tract mRNA in the A site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). This proposed mechanism for polyA stalling induction should not depend on species, because ribosome nucleotides interacting with π-stacked polyA sequences are universally conserved (A1756 and C1634, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). No significant differences in the mRNA tunnel have been observed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sun et al., 2015</xref>).

Altogether these observations do not explain why the mRNA tunnel and interactors of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosome could influence the efficient translation of polyA tracts.</p><p>Recently it was postulated that the stalling on the polyA tracts is an effect of a synergy between polyA-induced suboptimal geometry at PTC and poly-lysine interactions with ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>).To further investigate whether additional differences in the ribosome structure contributed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> adaptation to long polyA tracts and poly-lysine repeats, we analyzed the ribosome peptide exit tunnel of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as predicted by the MOLE 2.5 toolkit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sehnal et al., 2013</xref>). While a recent study found no differences in charge pattern along the peptide tunnel in eukaryotes, notably between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dao Duc et al., 2019</xref>), we observed changes in hydrophobicity across the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interactions between clusters of positive charges and hydrophobic environments are generally unfavorable even during protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>). Along this line, the ribosome exit tunnel of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> seems to be generally more hydrophilic, including the constriction site. Given a substantial length of poly-lysine peptide required to induce stalling on downstream polyA tracts (6 to 11, depending on the experimental system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>) it is plausible that the upper and the central tunnel are contributing to the observed effects. This is what is observed in other organisms. The free energy profile of lysine across the <italic>H. marismortui</italic> ribosome exit tunnel, which also has a hydrophobic region between the PTC and constriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicates the presence of a significant energy barrier after the constriction site, not before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petrone et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, in vitro translation of poly-lysine and poly-phenylalanine using <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes resulted in rather different paths and rates of the extension of nascent peptide due to postulated hydrophobic entry to the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Picking et al., 1991</xref>). Moreover, in a recent structure of the polyA stalled yeast ribosome, the unresolved density was also indicated in this part of the exit tunnel next to the PTC and above the constriction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, it seems that the ribosome peptide exit tunnel of parasites adapted to accommodate synthesis of long runs of poly-lysine residues by reducing electrostatic barriers below the PTC and at the constriction site. The resulting dynamics of translation of poly-lysine might be high enough to reduce the chances for unfavorable interactions between mRNA and ribosome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Polypeptide exit tunnel as predicted by MOLE service from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ribosome (PDB:3j79) (<bold>A</bold>) and human ribosome (PDB: 6d90) (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>The constriction site flanked by L22 and L4 is marked in the orange clamp, and lining residues in both cases are marked with ball-and-stick visualization.

So as is the case of polybasic residues, analyses of codon usage within poly-lysine peptides revealed that the expected frequency of AAA codons compared to AAG codons in runs of four consecutive lysine residues is lower in the coding regions of genes for multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koutmou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Habich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Such species-specific evolutionary conservations usually result in traits that are beneficial for survival.

It seems plausible that amino acid starvation could allow uncharged Ile-tRNAs to fill the A-site and block Pelo binding thus preventing NGD and RQC activation in this case. Similarly, Leu- or Arg-starvation experiments in HEK293 cells do not result in global change in mRNA stability but rather increase in translation termination and ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Darnell et al., 2018</xref>).

Our studies indicate that increased <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Pelo levels, at least during the amino acid starvation, do not cause targeted mRNA degradation.

However, it was recently indicated that an inhibitory conformation of mRNA in the A-site of the ribosome, as well as the polybasic character of the nascent polypeptide chain in the ribosome, peptide exit tunnel, are crucial for the poly(A)-mediated stalling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). It is not clear from the conservation of the 18S rRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and structure of the ribosome A-site in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) how parasite ribosomes would circumvent an inhibitory conformation of the polyA mRNA in the A site seen in yeast and mammalian ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tesina et al., 2020</xref>). It might be that changes in the peptide exit tunnel of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) have partially contributed to the adaptation to the synthesis of long poly-lysine runs by reducing the potential stalling effects associated with translocation of polybasic peptides through hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>). However, contributions of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>’s ribosome exit tunnel in overcoming poly-lysine induced ribosome stalling still need to be tested experimentally. It is also plausible that translation rate is a factor here. Chandrasekaran and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>) in their polyA stalling study had observed a significant difference in the number of lysines required for stalling between in vitro system and cells. They have explained the observation by a 5-fold differences in translation rate.</p><p>In conclusion, to adapt to polyA tract translation for the production of the polybasic and homopolymeric lysine repeats, the malaria-causing parasite has altered its mRNA translation quality control pathways as well as its ribosomal proteins and ribosome structure. The additional diversity of <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walliker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McCutchan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Waters et al., 1989</xref>) and possible activity of yet unknown ribosome-associated factors promote the possibility of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ‘specialized ribosomes,’ which allow for polyA tract translation into poly-lysine sequences of functional proteins. Further insights into differences between components of translational machinery and mRNA surveillance pathways present in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and host organisms, as well as the physiological role(s) of conserved poly-lysine repeats, will provide answers to these questions and enable identification of new drug targets against malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the various aspect of these phenomena, particularly their importance in physiology, considering that their substrate mRNAs with runs of multiple AAA codons, are quite rare in eukaryotic genomes. Therefore, it has been previously proposed that RQC on mRNAs with polyA sequence within ORFs may have anti-parasitic significance. In this manuscript, Djuranovic and colleagues demonstrate a very interesting observation that the malaria-causing parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, circumvent the ribosome stalling process at polyA sites, despite having a remarkable number of mRNAs with long polyA tracks. Thus, this manuscript clearly advances our understanding of this process and extend the field further and should be of interest to investigator in various fields. However, despite its strengths in providing convincing data on the unusual nature of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcriptome and the apparent deficiency of the mRNA decay pathway in this species, the manuscripts does not properly address the other possible aspect of the RQC-induced silencing; mRNA translation. In addition, the robustness of the data produced by ribosome profiling assay maybe compromised due to technical issues as described below. Therefore, the manuscript may benefit from additional experimentation/analyses to verify this aspect.</p><p>1) The contribution of translational repression in this process is not properly addressed. This is an important issue in light of the emphasize that the authors placed on the main role of the mRNA sequence, rather than amino acid sequence of the nascent peptide, in stalling. Nevertheless, while the authors quite clearly demonstrate the lack of efficient mRNA decay pathway, their explanation for the absence of stalling at polyA sequences in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> seems to rely solely on the differences in the exit channel of the ribosome. This comes across as changing the goal post. Rather than explaining why the mRNA sequence does not induce stalling, the authors in fact try to address why the peptide doesn't induce stalling. On this note, it is unclear why the authors focused only on measuring the mRNA levels of a few of the candidate genes with more than 22As (Figure 4). It is quite possible that due to deficiency in the mRNA decay pathway, the target mRNAs are only translationally repressed, but it does not rule out the potential translational repression. As it stands, it is unclear whether the ribosome stalling and RQC pathway in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is deficient, or the observed phenomenon is merely due to the deficient mRNA decay. Therefore, performing a polysome profiling assay and western blot for the candidate proteins would be suitable additions to confirm the lack of stalling on mRNAs with long polyA tracts in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p>2) It has been previously shown that pre-treatment of the samples with translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide and anisomycin could complicate the analysis of ribosome stalling by ribosome profiling assay and result in false negative outcome, when investigating ribosome pausing/stalling on poly-basic sites (Requião, et al., 2016). From what could be deduced in the Materials and methods section, the samples seem to have been pre-treated with cycloheximide for 10 minutes before collection. Therefore, this may in fact take away from the reliability of the observation that there is no ribosome pausing at polA tracts in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> based on the ribosome profiling assay, as it may be a false negative observation due to artefacts caused by cycloheximide.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Pavlovic-Djuranovic et al. show that poly(A) tracks in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> are efficiently translated and their translation does not trigger No Go Decay (NGD). This is very interesting since translation of poly(A) sequence elicits NGD in human cell or in <italic>Tetrahymenathermophila</italic>, which is an organism with an AT-content similar to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The authors further show that isoleucine starvation causes upregulation of Pelo but suggest this Pelo is not involved with NGD. Inserting a stem loop in their reporter construct disrupts protein synthesis but still does not trigger NGD. The authors hypothesize that the ribosome rescue pathway is evolved in this parasite differently than other organisms and NGD is not triggered upon ribosome stalling. They speculate that loss of RACK1's association with the ribosome and other structural differences could underlie these trends, though no data are offered to test these hypotheses. Overall, this paper grapples with an intriguing observation and improves our understanding of ribosome quality control system in different organisms. However, the paper seems to have been quickly written and lacks clarity. While much of the data are negative, it is worth sharing if further experiments could be performed in some cases to more clearly explain what models are being tested and directly show the results in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> are unlike those in other organisms.</p><p>List of major concerns:</p><p>Is it possible that during poly(A) translation, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosomes miscode and incorporates amino acids other than Lys? A mass spectrometry analysis of the reporter peptide could address this possibility and show that the ribosome faithfully translates Lys codons without miscoding and frameshifting.</p><p>It is difficult to see the difference between human and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosome occupancy in Figures 3A and 3B. It should be shown by distinct colors and the color code should be included in the figure legends. What do the error bars signify? Is the large central dip in 3B significant? Also, the authors should explain how many genes are going into the analysis and how they are controlling for the possibility that a few strongly-expressed genes are dominating these effects (how was normalization done?).</p><p>The authors refer to previous studies where frameshifting was attributed to translation of poly(A) sequences. They do not see frameshifting when poly(A) reporters were examined here in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. However, they do not show that their reporters do cause frameshifting in human cells. Is there a positive control to show these reporters can cause it? (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3). If not, perhaps the language should be adjusted to not limit the effects to frameshifting.</p><p>The authors do not show or cite evidence that Ile-starvation leads to substantial ribosome stalling in their cells. They also do not cite cases where Pelo has been observed to target ribosomes that are stalled awaiting an aa-tRNA. Gcn1 and Gcn20 have been thought to directly sense stalled ribosomes under these conditions. Are those factors present here? Is eIF2α phosphorylated and could Pelo be downstream of ATF4?</p><p>The argument that overexpression of Pelo can stimulate mRNA degradation has not been previously shown (i.e. a study of mRNA stability in an overexpression strain). The DHH8 mRNA level could be increased during Ile starvation for any number of reasons and the authors have not shown ribosome stalling on this transcript is occurring. The authors should provide results from other Ile codon containing transcripts or correlate mRNA levels with Ile content globally by RNA-seq. It's not clear this is the best test for NGD.</p><p>Figure 4C: the stem loop construct, HA-pelo protein level seems to be increased – why is this occurring? Is this the natural variation between experiments? If so, how do we know the difference in 4B is significant? Were replicates done? Also, it is concerning that +polyA<sub>36</sub> containing peptide migrates to the same exact place in the gel as -polyA<sub>36</sub> peptide despite additional 12 positively charged amino acids. Is this just a resolution issue in this particular gel? Also, what is the band migrating at ~15 kD and why could it be changing with different constructs? Finally, there is a faint band that is just a bit heavier than the HA-mCherry product – is this the reporter with stem loop present?</p><p>The section on RNA structure and, particularly, z-scores for transcript stability was not very comprehensible. It appears the authors were asking whether poly(A) regions (&quot;native&quot; regions?) were more or less stable than randomly selected regions, but I could be wrong. Overall, this section did not seem to make any compelling arguments toward explaining the lack of no-go decay in this organism.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> translational machinery condones polyadenosine repeats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The second reviewer provides comments on the text and offers excellent suggestions for improvements, vis-a-vis the explanation for the rationale for experiments. Also, some of the later figure panels might be better added to supplemental materials. The comments are noted below. We hope you find these suggestions helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have mainly answered my major concerns in the first version of the manuscript, particularly regarding the potential artifacts caused by cycloheximide pretreatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript addressed the major concerns by performing new experiments (polysome profiling, 2D gels) and by including additional controls. The text and figures are improved, and the story is now more compelling. The remaining issues are fixable and the most significant one is the writing, which still does not offer clear rationales for why some experiments were performed and tends to overinterpret results. In addition, the writing suffers from many typographic errors (some noted below) and some figures can benefit from a better presentation.</p><p>1) Figure 4: While the explanation of methodology is improved, I'm not sure what information Figures 4C and 4D add to the story. The text implies that the AT-rich genome could affect structure of mRNAs (less stable). The rationale for this analysis was not clearly stated. It is implied that if evolution has compensated for structure, there would be an effect in the z-scores. But how would this be related to assays of stalling? What is the predicted observation? Since the assay is indirect (structure is not measured) and the purpose is not clearly articulated, I suggest either placing these figures into supplementary or removing them from the manuscript.</p><p>2) Figure 6: The authors state that previous microarray analysis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> showed that Ile starvation does not globally change mRNA levels. Therefore, the rationale to choose this experiment to study NGD in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is unclear. Why did the authors expect changes on Ile-rich mRNAs given the prior study already showed &quot;similar overall levels for the majority of mRNA transcripts&quot;? Second, is it known that in mammalian cells that aa starvation induces NGD? If so, that should be clearly cited and explained. Alternatively, amino acid starvation could allow uncharged tRNAs to fill the A-site and block Pelota binding, so positive control data in mammalian cells establishing this expectation would add confidence. Third, in yeast, the mRNA stabilizing effects of loss of Dom34 is not that strong and I'm not sure anyone has observed increased mRNA degradation in a Dom34/Pelota overexpression experiment. If such data exists, it should be cited, as it would add confidence. Without offering a stronger rationale for these experiments, the conclusions from this figure are highly speculative and the authors should soften the claims and possibly move it to supplementary data.</p><p>3) It is widely accepted that NGD is part of RQC and the authors should clarify that, as previously requested, in the Introduction.</p><p>4) To make Figures 4A and 4B clearer, I recommend directly adding labels for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on top of the graphs and improving the figure legends. It's not clear that the first sentence of the legend refers to both A and B. It's not clear what &quot;taken into account&quot; means without context of the main text. Showing full, uncut error bar in Figure 4B and then providing an inset with the y-axis occupancy of 200 may help readers to better grasp this figure since the boxes extending off the plot is misleading. Also, the technical artifact leading to the dip should be acknowledged in the legend. It's not clear why this artifact is not also present in A and therefore whether this artifact is masking the pause in B. To make this more convincing, the authors could create a control dataset where pauses were computationally introduced and then successfully detected (i.e. a positive control). Alternatively, some explanation should be offered in the text as to why this dip does not void this analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57799.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Two major arguments of reviewer’s were, lacking of evidence for ribosomal stalling and the use of cycloheximide in the ribosome profiling dataset from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (previously published in Caro et al., 2014). We should point out that there are articles that indicate that cycloheximide artifacts (described in Requião et al., 2016 or Santos et al., NAR, 2019) might be restricted to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells, ie: Sharma et al., bioRxiv 746255; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/746255; Duncan and Mata, Sci. Rep., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10650-1.</p><p>As seen from the above articles cycloheximide artifacts are not present in the ribosome profiling data from humans and other species and are somewhat challenging to infer to <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> However, we have decided to address this problem experimentally. We have now included experiments to show that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosomes can be stalled without inducing targeted mRNA degradation. We did polysome profiles without pre-incubation of parasites with cycloheximide and inspected the distribution of wild type (-polyA<sub>36</sub>), polyA tract (+polyA<sub>36</sub>) and stem loop (StL) transcripts. We found that stem loop mRNA distribution correlates mostly with disomes, while polyA and will type constructs are found in higher polysome fractions. These results are now included in Figure 5. These results strengthens our data that polyA tracts are not stalling <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ribosomes. The data on stem-loop construct further indicate that the stalling of ribosomes, and reduced protein production, in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells does not lead to targeted mRNA degradation (as shown in our original data). This answers also general comment to our original submission, whether the P<italic>lasmodium</italic> ribosome are able to stall or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The contribution of translational repression in this process is not properly addressed.

We followed the distribution of all transcripts, control transcript (GAPDH) and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ribosomes by qRT-PCR. We found that stem loop construct distribution correlates mostly with disomes, while polyA and wild type constructs are found evenly distributed in polysomes. This strengthens our data that polyA tracts are not stalling <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ribosomes. This also further indicates that the stalling of ribosomes with stem loop in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells does not lead to targeted degradation (our original data).

The western blot analyses of reporters show opposite, protein synthesis from polyA tract transcripts is comparable, if not enhanced, compared to synthesis from transcripts without polyA tracts. The same is through in ribosome profiling data where polyA tract constructs from human tissue cultures indicate ribosome stalling (Figure 4A, regardless of cycloheximide treatment) while <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcripts do not (Figure 4B). This analysis is plotted for 1167 transcripts from the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells with polyA tracts shorter than 22 adenosine nucleotides (22A-1 sequences). While we would be happy to test the expression of some of these endogenous constructs by western blot analyses, there are only a few available antibodies for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins. PfHAD1 and PfHSP70 are used in our western blots, but unfortunately, these proteins do not host polyA tracts. However, our western blot analyses are done on reporters with and without polyA tract with 36 consecutive adenosines. We have commented on cycloheximide treatment in our general response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] However, the paper seems to have been quickly written and lacks clarity.

We have also increased the clarity of our manuscript by further changing original text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>List of major concerns:</p><p>Is it possible that during poly(A) translation, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosomes miscode and incorporates amino acids other than Lys? A mass spectrometry analysis of the reporter peptide could address this possibility and show that the ribosome faithfully translates Lys codons without miscoding and frameshifting.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have analyzed our reporter constructs using 2D gels to show whether fidelity and quality of protein synthesis stay intact in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells. We show now in the new Figure 3 that regardless of the lysine codons (AAA or AAG) both polylysine containing proteins shift their position from the wild-type (-polyA<sub>36</sub>) control by +1 overall charge in isoelectric point (pI for wild-type 6.2, pI for 12xLys 7.2). The position of protein products from 12xAAA and 12xAAG is identical on those gels arguing for no significant miscoding and frameshifting on either of these constructs. If such events do occur, they do not contribute significantly to overall quality or change in protein expression of polyA tract constructs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to see the difference between human and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ribosome occupancy in Figures 3A and 3B. It should be shown by distinct colors and the color code should be included in the figure legends. What do the error bars signify? Is the large central dip in 3B significant? Also, the authors should explain how many genes are going into the analysis and how they are controlling for the possibility that a few strongly-expressed genes are dominating these effects (how was normalization done?).</p></disp-quote><p>Both figures are symmetrical, with the center of the plot being the beginning of the polyA segment, left side being upstream of polyA segment. Both plots intentionally use the same y-axis scale to enable comparison. Barplots at each position denote first and third quantile (box ranges), the median is denoted with the horizontal line inside a box. Vertical lines denote 1.5*IQR range from the box (standard box plot representation). There was no normalization done (other than applied by GWIPS pipeline), only removing of entries without occupancy or with low average occupancy, to improve signal to noise ratio (as described in the Materials and methods). For a human this resulted in the plot based on 32 polyA fragments (32 transcripts), out of 102, that had occupancy at the start if the polyA segment more significant than 0. This is due to the fact that polyA tract genes are generally not expressed well in most of the organisms and, as such, have reduced amount of reads over polyA segments in ribosome profiling data sets. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> analyses is done on 1167 genes. That is why outer whiskers (1.5*IQR lines) extend beyond the plot because there are many more data points with good occupancy. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> plot has a central dip due to the inability of bioinformatics software to correctly map very long polyA fragments (as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1). A similar procedure of removing poorly mapped fragments was applied here as well. There was no statistical assessment done in these plots – they simply show the difference between occupancy distributions in these two species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors refer to previous studies where frameshifting was attributed to translation of poly(A) sequences. They do not see frameshifting when poly(A) reporters were examined here in Plasmodium. However, they do not show that their reporters do cause frameshifting in human cells. Is there a positive control to show these reporters can cause it? (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3). If not, perhaps the language should be adjusted to not limit the effects to frameshifting.</p></disp-quote><p>Ribosomal frameshifting on polyA tracts was previously shown in <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells with the identical or similar constructs, as well as endogenous human genes (ZCRB1). These experiments are described in Arthur et al., 2015; Koutmou et al., 2015; as well as Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017. We should also point out that ribosomal frameshifting was seen on sequences shorter than 36 consecutive adenosine constructs starting with 3 or 4 consecutive lysine AAA codons (9 or 12A polyA tracts).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not show or cite evidence that Ile-starvation leads to substantial ribosome stalling in their cells. They also do not cite cases where Pelo has been observed to target ribosomes that are stalled awaiting an aa-tRNA. Gcn1 and Gcn20 have been thought to directly sense stalled ribosomes under these conditions. Are those factors present here? Is eIF2α phosphorylated and could Pelo be downstream of ATF4?</p></disp-quote><p>Dan Goldberg’s lab originally reported Ile-induced starvation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (cited as Babbitt et al., 2012). This manuscript argues that Ile-starvation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells is able to induce a state of hibernation through the arrest of protein synthesis with phosphorylation of eIF2α. This phosphorylation of eIF2α in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is happening in a GCN2-independent fashion, and without existing TOR-nutrient sensing pathway nor activation of ATF4 homolog. The same manuscript gives micro-array analyses of transcript levels that also indicate no significant change in the mRNA levels of the majority of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes during the 48 hours starvation period (our focused qRT-PCR analysis in Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The argument that overexpression of Pelo can stimulate mRNA degradation has not been previously shown (i.e. a study of mRNA stability in an overexpression strain). The DHH8 mRNA level could be increased during Ile starvation for any number of reasons and the authors have not shown ribosome stalling on this transcript is occurring. The authors should provide results from other Ile codon containing transcripts or correlate mRNA levels with Ile content globally by RNA-seq. It's not clear this is the best test for NGD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included qRT-PCR analyses for additional eight <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes with multiple runs of Ile-residues (3-7 consecutive Ile). As noted from the new Figure 5C, the general trend is rather no-change or stabilization of Ile-rich transcripts during the Ile-starvation experiment. We have also expanded our analyses of stem loop constructs and included new Figure 4C, which indicates the stalling of ribosomes on the stem loop transcript in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C: the stem loop construct, HA-pelo protein level seems to be increased – why is this occurring? Is this the natural variation between experiments? If so, how do we know the difference in 4B is significant? Were replicates done? Also, it is concerning that +polyA<sub>36</sub> containing peptide migrates to the same exact place in the gel as -polyA<sub>36</sub> peptide despite additional 12 positively charged amino acids. Is this just a resolution issue in this particular gel? Also, what is the band migrating at ~15 kD and why could it be changing with different constructs? Finally, there is a faint band that is just a bit heavier than the HA-mCherry product – is this the reporter with stem loop present?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not noticed an increase in the Pelo transcript or protein in parasites transfected with stem-loopp construct. HA-pelo was supposed to be normalization control in Figure 4C (now Figure 5A) and difference for Pelo protein is due to the differences in loading amounts of samples. The difference in HA-pelo amounts and transcript levels in Figure 6A and 6B (or previous Figure 4A and 4B) is a consequence of 48-hour Ile-starvation of parasites. As noted in figure legends, these experiments were done in 3 biological replicates. We think that no obvious change between -polyA<sub>36</sub> and +polyA<sub>36</sub> in this gel is due to the resolution issue. We have now also included 2D gels (Figure 3) of -polyA<sub>36</sub>, +polyA<sub>36</sub> constructs and 12xAAG Lys construct to indicate a shift in isoelectric point of polylysine protein. 15kD band appearing in gels and causing cross-reactivity in western blots is contaminant of human hemoglobin. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite cultures are grown in human erythrocytes (98% of total protein is hemoglobin) and while we tried to lyse erythrocytes and get rid of most of hemoglobin prior to parasite lysis the amount of hemoglobin present in lysed samples is very hard to control. This is why we used PfHAD1 and endogenously tagged HA-pelo as normalization controls for western blot analyses. Finally, we would like to think that the faint band in Figure 5A is indeed HA-mCherry protein from stem-loop construct (StL). We just did not want to speculate whether this band indeed represents protein product from StL construct. We have also tried HA-immunoprecipitations with lysates expressing this particular construct (StL) without clear enrichment of protein corresponding to this band.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section on RNA structure and, particularly, z-scores for transcript stability was not very comprehensible. It appears the authors were asking whether poly(A) regions (&quot;native&quot; regions?) were more or less stable than randomly selected regions, but I could be wrong. Overall, this section did not seem to make any compelling arguments toward explaining the lack of no-go decay in this organism.</p></disp-quote><p>Since mRNA translation could be affected by the ability of RNA to fold into unique functional structures, we wanted to test whether mRNA transcripts between three tested species (human, <italic>Tetrahymena,</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic>) have a different propensity in RNA folding. This is because RNA secondary structures, especially A-rich sequences, have been shown to coordinate ribosomal frameshifting, impact RNA stability, or slow ribosomal progression to allow protein folding.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revised manuscript addressed the major concerns by performing new experiments (polysome profiling, 2D gels) and by including additional controls. The text and figures are improved, and the story is now more compelling. The remaining issues are fixable and the most significant one is the writing, which still does not offer clear rationales for why some experiments were performed and tends to overinterpret results. In addition, the writing suffers from many typographic errors (some noted below) and some figures can benefit from a better presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful reviewer #2 for their comments. In the revised manuscript, we have followed majority of the suggestions on improving the text as well as presentation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 4: While the explanation of methodology is improved, I'm not sure what information Figures 4C and 4D add to the story. The text implies that the AT-rich genome could affect structure of mRNAs (less stable). The rationale for this analysis was not clearly stated. It is implied that if evolution has compensated for structure, there would be an effect in the z-scores. But how would this be related to assays of stalling? What is the predicted observation? Since the assay is indirect (structure is not measured) and the purpose is not clearly articulated, I suggest either placing these figures into supplementary or removing them from the manuscript.</p><p>4) To make Figures 4A and 4B clearer, I recommend directly adding labels for H. sapiens and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on top of the graphs and improving the figure legends. It's not clear that the first sentence of the legend refers to both A and B. It's not clear what &quot;taken into account&quot; means without context of the main text. Showing full, uncut error bar in Figure 4B and then providing an inset with the y-axis occupancy of 200 may help readers to better grasp this figure since the boxes extending off the plot is misleading. Also, the technical artifact leading to the dip should be acknowledged in the legend. It's not clear why this artifact is not also present in A and therefore whether this artifact is masking the pause in B. To make this more convincing, the authors could create a control dataset where pauses were computationally introduced and then successfully detected (i.e. a positive control). Alternatively, some explanation should be offered in the text as to why this dip does not void this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have moved Figure 4C and 4D to supplementary material as a new Figure 4—figure supplement 5. In order to improve presentation of the data we have included new Figures 4A and 4B as well as further explained data presented in Figure 4. and new Figure 4—figure supplement 5. Based on the reviewer suggestion we have also included explanation for the technical artifact in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6: The authors state that previous microarray analysis in Plasmodium showed that Ile starvation does not globally change mRNA levels. Therefore, the rationale to choose this experiment to study NGD in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is unclear. Why did the authors expect changes on Ile-rich mRNAs given the prior study already showed &quot;similar overall levels for the majority of mRNA transcripts&quot;? Second, is it known that in mammalian cells that aa starvation induces NGD? If so, that should be clearly cited and explained. Alternatively, amino acid starvation could allow uncharged tRNAs to fill the A-site and block Pelota binding, so positive control data in mammalian cells establishing this expectation would add confidence. Third, in yeast, the mRNA stabilizing effects of loss of Dom34 is not that strong and I'm not sure anyone has observed increased mRNA degradation in a Dom34/Pelota overexpression experiment. If such data exists, it should be cited, as it would add confidence. Without offering a stronger rationale for these experiments, the conclusions from this figure are highly speculative and the authors should soften the claims and possibly move it to supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for the Ile-starvation experiment was taken from the previous studies with histidine-induced stalling (using 3-AT, Guydosh and Green, Cell 2014), protein synthesis and subsequent translational arrest during erythroid and platelet maturation (Mills et al., 2016 and Mills et al., 2017), Leu- and Arg-starvation experiments (Darnell et al., Mol Cell 2018) as well as cycloheximide-induced stalling (Simms et al., 2017). We wanted to check whether <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells react differently during global translational arrest looking more specifically to Ile-rich transcripts as well as levels of NGD factor Pelota and HSP70 chaperone. Based on the reviewer comments and results from Darnell et al., 2018, we have softened our claims and included other explanations for Ile-starvation experiment. We have previously cited Mills et al., 2017, for Pelota overexpression experiments in human cells. This study clearly states that transgenic overexpression of the Pelota in human platelets results in more rapid degradation of most cytoplasmic platelet transcripts (average half-life, 3.7 vs 5.7 hours in control).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is widely accepted that NGD is part of RQC and the authors should clarify that, as previously requested, in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included clarification of RQC and NGD in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
