Unlike Pgm, PgmLs lack a conserved catalytic site, suggesting that they rather have an architectural function within a multi-component excision complex embedding Pgm. PgmL depletion can increase erroneous targeting of residual Pgm-mediated DNA cleavage, indicating that PgmLs contribute to accurately position the complex on IES ends.

The most commonly studied transposases harbor an RNase H-related catalytic domain including three conserved acidic residues DD(D/E) and have been grouped into distinct superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curcio and Derbyshire, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wicker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hickman et al., 2010</xref>). During evolution, exaptation of transposon-borne genes has sometimes given rise to novel cellular functions through a process called domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Volff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jangam et al., 2017</xref>). Several instances of domesticated DD(D/E) transposases have been reported, some of which still exhibit at least partial catalytic activity. The <italic>Transib</italic>-originating Rag1 protein catalyzes V(D)J recombination of vertebrate immunoglobulin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>); SETMAR, a partially active domesticated <italic>mariner</italic> transposase, is involved in DNA double-strand break repair in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2014</xref>); α3, domesticated from a <italic>hAT</italic> transposon, and Kat1, domesticated from a <italic>Mutator</italic>-like element, carry out mating type switching in the yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsoum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rajaei et al., 2014</xref>). CENP-B, related to <italic>mariner</italic> elements, serves as a centromere-binding factor, but its ancestral catalytic domain is no longer required for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mateo and González, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transposases from the <italic>piggyBac</italic> family have repeatedly been domesticated in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouallègue et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, five <italic>PGBD</italic> (<italic>piggyBac</italic>-derived) genes have been identified, but their cellular function has so far remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sarkar et al., 2003</xref>). The most ancient, <italic>PGBD5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pavelitz et al., 2013</xref>), encodes a protein with a highly divergent catalytic domain that is active for DNA cleavage and transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henssen et al., 2015</xref>) and promotes DNA rearrangements in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henssen et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>PGBD1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> are conserved in mammals, but their encoded proteins have lost the DDD catalytic triad characteristic of active PiggyBac (PB) transposases and their cellular function is unknown. <italic>PGBD3</italic> and <italic>4</italic> are restricted to primates. Pgbd3, expressed as a fusion with the Cockayne Syndrome CSB transcription factor, does not carry an intact catalytic site, but has retained specific DNA binding activity to <italic>piggyBac</italic>-related genomic sequences, which may expand the gene network that is transcriptionally regulated by CSB-Pgbd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiner and Gray, 2013</xref>). In contrast, Pgbd4 harbors a conserved DDD triad, but its cellular function is unknown. Remarkably, catalytically active domesticated PB transposases play an essential role during developmentally programmed genome rearrangements in the ciliates <italic>Paramecium</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vogt and Mochizuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotes characterized by their nuclear dimorphism, with two types of nuclei coexisting in the same cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott, 1994</xref>). The diploid germline micronucleus (MIC), transcriptionally inactive during vegetative growth, undergoes meiosis and transmits the parental genetic information to the zygotic nucleus during sexual reproduction. The highly polyploid somatic macronucleus (MAC), streamlined for gene expression and essential for cell growth, is fragmented and destroyed at each sexual cycle and a new MAC develops from a mitotic copy of the zygotic nucleus. During MAC development, massive genome amplification takes place and, following a few endoduplication rounds,~30% of germline sequences are removed from the somatic genome in <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>). In both species, DNA elimination requires the introduction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) at the boundaries of eliminated sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saveliev and Cox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gratias and Bétermier, 2003</xref>). Two modes of sexual reproduction have been described in <italic>Paramecium</italic>: conjugation and autogamy, a self-fertilization process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betermier and Duharcourt, 2014</xref>). In both processes, programmed DNA elimination targets two types of germline sequences. Repeated sequences, for example transposable elements (TEs) or minisatellites, are removed in association with chromosome fragmentation. In addition, the precise excision of 45,000 single-copy non-coding Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs), which interrupt 47% of all genes in the germline genome, allows proper assembly of functional open reading frames in the somatic genome, essential for the survival of sexual progeny. <italic>Paramecium</italic> IESs are short (93% shorter than 150 bp), non-coding sequences, whose size follows a sinusoid-shaped distribution with a periodicity equal to the helical pitch of double-stranded B DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>). IESs are flanked with a conserved TA dinucleotide at each end; a single TA remains at the excision site. IES ends define a loosely conserved 8 bp consensus sequence (5’-TAYAGYNR-3’), of unclear mechanistic significance. Indeed, how the excision machinery accurately targets IES ends remains an open question.</p><p>IES excision is a precise ‘cut-and-close’ mechanism that starts with the introduction of DNA DSBs centered on the flanking TAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gratias and Bétermier, 2003</xref>). PiggyMac (Pgm), a domesticated PB transposase with an intact DDD catalytic motif, is responsible for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois et al., 2017</xref>) and the resulting DSBs are repaired through the classical non-homologous end joining pathway (C-NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapusta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>). Tight coupling of DSB introduction and repair is thought to be ensured by the assembly of a Pgm/Ku complex required for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marmignon et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report the discovery of five groups of paralogous <italic>Paramecium</italic> domesticated PB transposases, designated as Pgm-like(s) (PgmL), that appear to be novel essential components of the Pgm-associated complex. Using a combination of RNAi-mediated knockdowns (KDs), immunofluorescence microscopy and whole genome sequencing, we show that each PgmL group is essential for Pgm nuclear localization during the sexual cycle and efficient genome-wide IES excision. In some KDs, residual Pgm complexes lacking one PgmL partner are still detected in the developing MAC and retain partial activity. However, they tend to incorrectly target IES excision boundaries, resulting in excision errors. Our data, as a whole, indicate that six groups of domesticated PB transposases, including one catalytically active subunit (Pgm) and five additional partners (PgmL), act together to carry out IES excision. We discuss a model, in which PgmLs associate with Pgm, favor and stabilize its nuclear localization and ensure the precise positioning of DNA cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel domesticated PB transposase genes in the <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> genome</title><p>Two structural domains can be predicted in Pgm using the Pfam protein family database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2016</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/">http://pfam.xfam.org/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The most conspicuous change is a specific increase in the proportion of partial internal excision errors, reaching more than 50% of all de novo errors in PgmL1- or PgmL3-depleted cells. Over-representation of this particular class of errors is not observed in partial <italic>PGML2</italic> KDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that erroneous targeting of alternative internal boundaries is not a general consequence of limiting availability of the excision machinery, but is a specificity of <italic>PGML1</italic> and <italic>PGML3</italic> KDs. In the latter two KDs, most erroneous internal boundaries are shifted by 10 to 11 bp from the canonical TA, resulting in excision of DNA fragments shortened by one helical turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The position of alternative boundaries cannot be explained simply by a biased distribution of TA dinucleotides in IESs, since internal TAs can be found 5 to 6 bp away from reference IES boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), but they are not used in partial internal excision errors. Except for the TA, erroneous alternative boundaries do not match the general consensus sequence for IES ends (5’-<underline>TA</underline>YAGYNR-3’), nor do they define a novel sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, ‘unused’ canonical ends exhibit no particular sequence motif - different from the general consensus - that would suggest a preference of PgmL1 or PgmL3 for a specific sequence. Finally, we noticed that error-prone IESs, for which an internal TA (mostly shifted by 10 to 11 bp) is used in erroneous excision events, follow a different size distribution from the global IES population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>): IESs of 66 bp and above are over-represented, whereas 47 bp and shorter IESs are largely under-represented.

The remaining ~17% IESs that are still excised in <italic>PGML1</italic> or <italic>PGML3</italic> KDs are prone to excision errors, suggesting that PgmLs are stricty required for efficient and accurate excision.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37927.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for IES excision mediated by a multicomponent Pgm/PgmLs complex.</title><p>This figure summarizes the observed effects of <italic>PGML</italic> KDs on Pgm-mediated IES excision. In line with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois et al., 2017</xref>) and known properties of the <italic>T. ni</italic> PiggyBac transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), the catalytically active form of Pgm is assumed to be a dimer. In the absence of information about the stoichiometry of the complex, one Pgm homodimer (active catalytic site drawn as a star) is represented at each IES boundary, with a large bridging structure formed by all PgmLs. In a fully assembled complex, PgmL subunits are proposed to drive the correct positioning of the Pgm catalytic site onto both TA cleavage sites (indicated by arrows). Following <italic>PGML</italic> KDs, we propose two distinct situations. In <italic>PGML1</italic> or <italic>PGML3</italic> KDs, the depleted complexes can exist but are misassembled. As a consequence, Pgm nuclear stability is reduced (the phenotype is more pronounced in a <italic>PGML3</italic> KD than in a <italic>PGML1</italic> KD) and Pgm activity is altered, because incorrect positioning of catalytic subunits generates specific partial internal excision errors at low frequency (a dotted arrow points to the erroneously targeted alternative TA). In the other three KDs, IES excision complexes depleted for PgmL2, PgmL4 or PgmL5 are totally inactive. This might result either from strong misassembly of the complex or its dissociation (or non-assembly).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-37927-fig7-v1"/></fig><p>We show here that PgmLs can each interact directly with Pgm and we previously reported that Pgm also has homo-oligomerization properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies will address whether these interactions are mutually exclusive, whether PgmLs interact with each other and, more importantly, which among these interactions participate in the assembly of the full excision complex. The <italic>Paramecium</italic> system shares interesting features with the higher-order complexes (transpososomes) that interact with transposon ends during <italic>bona fide</italic> transposition. Biochemical and structural studies of DD(D/E) transposases and retroviral integrases bound to their cognate DNA substrates have revealed that assembly of a productive transpososome often involves more transposase subunits than those actually engaged in catalysis, the supernumerary subunits playing an architectural role within the transposition complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Montaño et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hickman et al., 2014</xref>); reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>). In particular, recent studies have shown that the <italic>T. ni</italic> PB transposase dimerizes in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2017</xref>) and higher-order complexes were proposed to assemble during <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morellet et al., 2018</xref>). Within a transpososome, all transposase subunits are generally identical because they are encoded by a single gene carried by the mobile element itself. In <italic>Paramecium</italic>, multiple domesticated transposase genes encode the different subunits that together carry out IES elimination. Selection pressure to maintain a fully conserved catalytic triad has been exerted on only one of these genes (<italic>PGM</italic>) and previous work established that at least two Pgm subunits are present in the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubois et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with a model in which their catalytic sites are positioned on each TA boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The catalytic domain of PgmL proteins has evolved more rapidly, suggesting that PgmLs rather have an architectural function within the complex. Moreover, PgmL proteins differ in their domain organization and PgmL depletions have different effects on IES excision efficiency and accuracy, which suggests that all PgmLs may not play exactly the same role. Of note, the conservation of two Ds in PgmL4, which is the most closely related to Pgm, indicates that its RNase H domain, although probably inactive, has evolved under selection pressure, suggesting that it may play a particular role in the catalysis of DNA cleavage. RNAi-mediated depletion of PgmL2, PgmL4 or PgmL5 completely abolishes Pgm cleavage activity and its stable nuclear localization, perhaps by impairing correct assembly of the excision complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and/or loosening its interaction with chromatin, preventing us at this stage from proposing a specific function for these three proteins. In contrast, PgmL1- or PgmL3-depleted complexes exhibit residual activity associated with an increased bias for partial internal excision errors involving the use of alternative 10 bp shifted TA boundaries. Because such a bias is not observed in partial <italic>PGML2</italic> KDs, our data cannot simply be attributed to partial depletion and rather point to a specific function of PgmL1 and PgmL3. We propose that incomplete machineries devoid of PgmL1 or PgmL3 can still interact with IESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), even though much less efficiently and with lower accuracy than fully assembled complexes. The size biases observed in the population of excised IESs in <italic>PGML1</italic> or <italic>PGML3</italic> KDs might reveal that one function of these two PgmL subunits is to provide the architectural versatility required to adjust to the variable features of eliminated sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Size biases of partial internal excision errors recapitulate evolution-driven IES size distribution</title><p><italic>Paramecium</italic> IESs exhibit a characteristic size distribution, with a minimum size of 26 bp and a ~ 10 bp periodicity proposed to result from mechanistic constraints on IES excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>). The present study of partially active PgmL1- or PgmL3-depleted complexes is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>The overlapping subsets of IESs that still excise efficiently in <italic>PGML1</italic> and <italic>PGML3a and b</italic> KDs tend to be larger in size than an equivalent pool of strongly retained IESs, with an under-representation of 46 to 47 bp IESs and over-representation of 75 to 77 bp (and larger) IESs. No specific sequence other than the usual consensus was found at the ends of excised or strongly retained IESs in these KDs, indicating that no particular motif defines the subsets of PgmL1- (or PgmL3)-dependent or independent IESs. We propose, instead, that PgmL1 and PgmL3 contribute to the positioning of Pgm-dependent DNA cleavages at correct TA boundaries, thus fine-tuning the size of the excised sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, residual activity of PgmL1- or PgmL3-depleted machineries reveals an over-representation of partial internal excision errors, leading to excision of IES-derived fragments one turn of a DNA helix shorter than reference IESs, a distance that corresponds to the periodicity of the IES size distribution. Remarkably, erroneous excision of 46 to 47 bp IESs that would have led to excision of 36 to 37 bp fragments is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, 36 to 37 bp IESs are prone to partial internal errors resulting in excision of 26 to 28 bp fragments. These observations indicate that sequences of 36–37 bp may be mechanistically difficult to excise, as proposed previously based on the existence of a ‘forbidden’ peak corresponding to this size range in the distribution of genomic reference IESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, IESs from the 26 to 28 bp peak do not yield erroneously excised 10 bp shorter TA-indels, supporting the notion that 26 bp is the minimum size for excision by the Pgm-associated machinery. Taken together, our data provide strong experimental support to the hypothesis that mechanistic limitations have imposed strong constraints on <italic>Paramecium</italic> IES size during evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Domesticated PB transposases in ciliates and other species</title><p>The distantly related ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, which separated from <italic>Paramecium</italic> at least ~500 M years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parfrey et al., 2011</xref>), harbors a clear Pgm ortholog, Tpb2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that carries out imprecise excision of intergenic IESs, which constitute the vast majority of IESs in this ciliate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vogt and Mochizuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>). Additional <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> domesticated PB transposases (Tpb7p and Lia5p), also lacking a conserved DDD triad, may somehow be related to <italic>Paramecium</italic> PgmLs, although the evolutionary relationships between <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic> proteins are difficult to assess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the role of Tpb7p is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>), Lia5p is essential for Tpb2p-dependent DNA elimination, localizes on IESs before excision and is involved in the delimitation of their excision boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shieh and Chalker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suhren et al., 2017</xref>). Lia5p and Tpb7p may represent functional homologs of PgmLs for IES excision, but whether they interact with Tpb2p and how they contribute to DNA elimination at the molecular level remain to be established. In addition to the Tpb2p/Lia5p system, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> encodes two other domesticated PB transposases, Tpb1p and Tpb6p, that precisely excise a distinct subset of 12 intragenic <italic>piggyBac</italic>-related IESs, in a Tpb2p-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in contrast to <italic>Paramecium</italic>, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> possesses two distinct IES excision machineries, each responsible for elimination of a particular subset of IESs. In spite of their differences, the two ciliate species provide remarkable examples of the participation of multiple-component protein complexes composed of catalytic and non-catalytic subunits, all domesticated from the same transposase family, in a transposition-related reaction. In humans, the Pgbd1 to Pgbd5 PB domesticated transposases do not all carry a fully conserved catalytic triad. Based on our <italic>Paramecium</italic> work, future investigations should take into consideration the possibility that Pgbd proteins may be involved together in the same cellular function(s).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In silico protein sequence analysis</title><p><italic>Paramecium</italic> genes and protein sequences were uploaded from the ParameciumDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaiz and Sperling, 2011</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/">https://paramecium.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/</ext-link>) and accession numbers are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors' group previously reported that the domesticated PiggyBac transpose Pgm is required for the programmed genome rearrangement (IES elimination) in <italic>Paramecium</italic>. In this manuscript, the authors identified and characterised additional five groups of domesticated PiggyBac transposes, PgmL1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in <italic>Paramecium</italic>. All these PgmLs most likely are catalytically inactive because they lack the endonuclease &quot;DDD&quot; residues. The authors showed that all PgmLs can be co-precipitated with Pgm when they were co-expressed in insect cells. All the PgmL proteins localised to the new macronuclei, where programmed genome rearrangement occurs. Individual RNAi knockdown of each PgmL (or PgmL group) inhibited: 1) the production of functional new macronucleus; 2) partially (in PgmL1 KD) or severely (in PgmL2, 3, 4 or 5 KD) the accumulation of Pgm in the new macronucleus; and 3) severely (but not completely) the eliminations of IESs. The residual IES elimination events in the absence of PgmL1 or PgmL3 were accompanied with high frequency of errors in which excision boundaries tend to shift by ~10-11 bp internal to IESs. The authors concluded that PgmLs act together with Pgm to carry out precise IES excisions and that PgmL1 and 3 are important for proper positioning of the complex.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall this is an interesting study providing new insight into molecular components involved in IES excision in <italic>Paramecium</italic>. The understanding of the mechanistic contribution of the PgmL proteins is still limited but these results are definitely suitable for publication providing several features of the phenotypes are clarified.</p><p>1) The conclusion on chromatin association on fixed cells is not convincing as impact of Triton can vary greatly between proteins. In addition, the authors conclude an exacerbation with Triton (from 50-60% to 85% decrease): what is the statistical validation for this difference?</p><p>Well established protocols exist to purify soluble chromatin and chromatin bound fractions (with inclusion of control proteins) and this should be used to establish the phenotype in PgmL depleted cells.</p><p>2) 3B: The interaction analysis requires additional validations:</p><p>Indicate that WB was done with anti-HA; Add MW markers.</p><p>Other issues with this experiment: The use of 500mM salt does not always avoid interaction with DNA as some proteins can bind DNA at high salt, so this is not a convincing argument; The level of purification should be presented, because any contaminant co-purifying with MBP-Pgm could be responsible for interaction with PgmL. How do the authors exclude this possibility? Also control should be included with use of another HA tagged protein, as HA could interact with Pgm.</p><p>3) Figure 5. A PgmKD should be shown (data is in Figure 5—figure supplement 3) to compare with PgmLKD and to evaluate what is the background signal.</p><p>The authors suggest that excision events observed in PgmL1 and 3KD are due to partial depletion, and support this conclusion based on the partial KD of PgmL2 which is convincing. The authors also conclude that PgmL1 and 3 have a specific role based on the difference of excision events observed in these KD and the partial PgmL2KD. This conclusion is based on the comparison of size distribution and is not convincing. Although the distributions do appear in part different, it is not possible to tell what is reproducible and statistically significant:</p><p>The authors should confirm the specificity of PgmL1 and 3 by analyzing the type of errors observed in partial KD of PgmL2: it is expected that the use of 10bp shifted TA is not observed. This point is essential to validate the model presented in Figure 7.</p><p>4) The model figure (Figure 7) is misleading because i) presence of the all PgmLs and Pgm in a same complex has not been demonstrated; ii) it was previously shown that Pgm can form homo-oligomer; iii) all of the PgmLs can directly bind to Pgm; iv) interactions among PgmLs have not been analysed.</p><p>The middle section (PgmL1 and 3KD) is also confusing: the authors aim to summarize the consequences of PgmL1 and 3 KD, but since they have distinct properties, they present only the complex in the absence of PgmL1 but arrows refer to 1 and 3.</p><p>5) Because PgmL1 and 3KD have lower IES excision frequency, it is not clear what is the actual error rate (after normalization for excision rate)?</p><p>6) Insert the information about the general consensus for IES ends (subsection “PgmL1- or PgmL3a&amp;b-depleted cells are prone to IES excision errors”, last paragraph).</p><p>7) Figure 6E: it would be interesting to have a plot of the fraction of IE with errors among excised IES.</p><p>8) Discussion: To conclude of a defect in nuclear import is an overstatement and far to be demonstrate by the data; Discussion about specific roles of PgmL1 and 3 (subsection “IES excision in <italic>Paramecium</italic> is carried out by multiple partners including Pgm and five novel domesticated PB transposases”, last paragraph) not so convincing because KD are partial.</p><p>Other comments</p><p>9) Figure 1A: The drawing of the first line (Pfam domain) is not clear: Where is DDE_Tnp_1_7?; The RnaseH fold is in orange? The DDE_Tnp_1-like zinc ribbon is in grey?</p><p>What do black vertical lines represent, presumably the catalytic D? Why only two lines in PB? Why none in Pgm?</p><p>10) Figure 1B: What does &quot;?&quot; mean?</p><p>11) Please explain in the main text what are T0, T5, T11. Impossible to understand for non-aficionados.</p><p>12) Transgene expression the GFP-fusion PGML upon injection into MAC of vegetative cells.

Can you clarify the statement:</p><p>&quot;Because variable amounts of DNA from old MAC fragments are present in the samples, the retention scores calculated in each experiment cannot be considered as absolute measurements of IES retention in the new MAC.&quot;: What is the range of variation, has it been quantified, if so could this be used to normalize retention score.</p><p>This is confusing and no explanation is provided as to why distribution of scores differs between Pgml2 and 4 for instance.</p><p>Also, an explanation is needed to understand that at the same retention score some as statistically significantly not retained, some are not (grey vs. magenta). Is this due to number of reads for different IES? It seems that the different IES are plotted by bins of retention score windows? Please clarify?</p><p>Add KD next to genes.</p><p>15) Figure 5C: significantly longer excised IES: which statistical test?</p><p>16) Figure 5D: Absence of 46-47 in PgmL: not very clear (in particular for Pgml3 KD): zoom out on the graph. Why is it important? What is the implication?</p><p>17) Figure 6E is a plot of partial internal errors not only of the 10 to 11bp shift as written in the text (subsection “PgmL1- or PgmL3a&amp;b-depleted cells are prone to IES excision errors”, last paragraph).</p><p>18) Update Morellet 2018 reference.</p><p>19) Figure 3—figure supplement S1: What does the cross mean?</p><p>20) Subsection “<italic>PGML</italic> KDs have a genome-wide impact on IES elimination”, last paragraph: Cannot find progeny survival data in Figure 1—figure supplement 3?</p><p>21) Why are the correlation coefficients of PgmL2KD with other KD and with the partial KD so low?</p><p>22) Some of the supplementary figures are not mentioned in the main text, please revise or remove.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37927.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>[…] 1) The conclusion on chromatin association on fixed cells is not convincing as impact of Triton can vary greatly between proteins.

As shown for control cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, Pgm remained in the insoluble fraction under all extraction conditions tested, whereas histone H3 started to be solubilized at 300mM NaCl in the salt fractionation protocol (lane 3). This suggests that Pgm is insoluble under these conditions, consistent with our independent observation that proper Pgm detection in total extracts or in purified nuclei requires three-minute boiling in 5% SDS, prior to denaturation in Laemmli buffer. We observed that Pgm behaved similarly in PgmL-depleted cells. For this reason, we cannot – for the moment – address biochemically the chromatin-associated status of Pgm.</p><p>Accordingly, we have removed our initial statement that Pgm is more loosely bound to chromatin in the absence of PgmL proteins from the Results section and only refer to its nuclear localisation.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37927.036</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Attempts to extract endogenous Pgm from chromatin in control cells.</title><p><italic>Paramecium</italic> nuclei were purified by low-speed centrifugation of autogamous cell lysates, as described (Arnaiz et al., 2012).

Indeed, we performed a control DRaCALA DNA binding assay (Differential Radial Capillary Action of Ligand Assay, see Donaldson et al., 2012), which we have included in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A. While Pgm clearly binds DNA at low NaCl concentration (50 or 100 mM), no DNA binding was detected at 250 mM NaCl and above. We are, therefore, confident that co-purification of Pgm and PgmLs cannot be explained by simultaneous binding of both protein to the same DNA molecule. We have included these clarifications in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The level of purification should be presented, because any contaminant co-purifying with MBP-Pgm could be responsible for interaction with PgmL.

Indeed, over-representation of one particular type of errors (i.e. partial internal) is clearly specific for these two KDs and is not observed in partial <italic>PGML2</italic> KDs.

We are aware that more work is needed to provide deeper insight into the organization and stoichiometry of PgmL subunits in the Pgm-associated complex. We have prepared a simplified version of Figure 7, in which no assumption is made with regard to the exact number of PgmLs present in the complex. In line with previously published data (Dubois et al., 2017) and with known properties of the canonical PiggyBac transposase from <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (Jin et al., 2017), we have drawn Pgm as a dimer positioned at each TA cleavage site. The revised model has been focused on the control of DNA cleavage at IES ends. As stated above, we agree with other reviewers’ comments (see reply to point 1) that speculating on the role of PgmL in stabilizing Pgm association with chromatin is premature at this stage. The first paragraph of the Discussion has been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Because PgmL1 and 3KD have lower IES excision frequency, it is not clear what is the actual error rate (after normalization for excision rate)?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to experimental limitations, it is not possible to calculate IES excision rates precisely. Indeed, the DNA used for high throughput sequencing is prepared from nuclear preparations enriched in developing MACs, but fragments of the old MAC always contaminate these preparations. Thus, in our sequencing datasets, IES<sup>-</sup> reads do not exclusively represent de novo excision events that took place in the developing MACs. Furthermore, because the contamination is variable from one sample to the other, no simple correction can be applied to our data to accurately remove the contribution of the old MAC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Insert the information about the general consensus for IES ends (subsection “PgmL1- or PgmL3a&amp;b-depleted cells are prone to IES excision errors”, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6E: it would be interesting to have a plot of the fraction of IE with errors among excised IES.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was available in our initial Figure 6—figure supplement 1.

In addition, the double feeding procedure that we used to silence <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic> consists in feeding <italic>Paramecium</italic> cells with a 1:1 mix of induced bacteria producing dsRNA homologous to each gene.

The variability has different causes that are very difficult to control, among which the physiological state of cells (strong starvation conditions accelerate the loss of old MAC fragments) and the fragment size at the time of cell fractionation (low speed centrifugation will selectively eliminate smaller fragments). Guérin et al. (BMC Genomics 2017, 18:327) used an additional flow cytometry sorting step to enrich preparations of developing MACs from Pgm-depleted cells and obtained higher IES retention scores in their 98% pure MAC preparation than in the “non-sorted” sample shown in Figure 5A. This procedure will certainly improve future analyses, without completely eliminating the problem of quantifying the level of contamination by old MAC DNA in different preparations. This makes normalization still problematic at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, an explanation is needed to understand that at the same retention score some as statistically significantly not retained, some are not (grey vs. magenta).

For each IES, the number of reads corresponding to IES<sup>+</sup> and IES<sup>-</sup> molecules were compared between the two samples and a statistical test for the significance of each boundary score was performed using the published ParTIES package (Denby Wilkes et al., 2015). Given that the number of reads covering an IES differs between samples and from one IES to the other, the significance of IES retention may differ for IESs showing similar retention scores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that the different IES are plotted by bins of retention score windows?
