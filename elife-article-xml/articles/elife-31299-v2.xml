Short telomeres can impair tissue regeneration and are found both in hereditary and sporadic cases. We show here that telomerase expression using AAV9 vectors shows therapeutic effects in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis owing to a low-dose bleomycin insult and short telomeres. AAV9 preferentially targets regenerative alveolar type II cells (ATII). AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic>-treated mice show improved lung function and lower inflammation and fibrosis at 1–3 weeks after viral treatment, and improvement or disappearance of the fibrosis at 8 weeks after treatment. AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment leads to longer telomeres and increased proliferation of ATII cells, as well as lower DNA damage, apoptosis, and senescence. Transcriptome analysis of ATII cells confirms downregulation of fibrosis and inflammation pathways. We provide a proof-of-principle that telomerase activation may represent an effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis provoked or associated with short telomeres.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31299.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (or IPF for short) is a rare disease that scars the lungs. The condition gets worse over time, making it harder and harder to breathe, and eventually leading to death. Patients typically only survive for a few years after being diagnosed with IPF. This is because, as yet, there is no cure; the available treatments only act to lessen the symptoms.</p><p>Several risk factors have linked to the development of IPF, among them, the presence of short telomeres. Like the plastic tips on shoelaces, telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten with age, and when they become too short the cell stops dividing and often dies in a process known as apoptosis. IPF can develop when the telomeres in the cells that repair everyday wear and tear in the lungs (known as ATII cells) become too short. This means that the damage goes unrepaired, triggering an immune reaction and uncontrolled scarring.</p><p>Telomerase is an enzyme that can lengthen short telomeres, and Povedano, Martínez et al. set out to develop a new treatment approach that would use this enzyme to correct the short telomeres, and cure the scarring seen in IPF. Gene therapy was used to introduce the gene for telomerase into mice that had scarring in their lungs due to short telomeres.</p><p>Povedano, Martínez et al. found that, when injected into the mice, the telomerase gene therapy was able to reach ATII cells and could help to heal the lungs. At the level of individual cells, mice treated with telomerase had longer telomeres, meaning that more of their ATII cells stayed alive and kept dividing to regenerate the lung tissue. Consistent with previous studies, the telomerase gene therapy caused no negative side effects in the mice; for example, there was no increased risk of cancer.</p><p>These findings may possibly lead to new treatments for those patients suffering from IPF associated with short telomeres. Developing this approach into a clinical trial could in the future benefit many IPF patients who currently have very limited treatment options.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>telomeres</kwd><kwd>pulmonary fibrosis</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>AAV9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2013-45111-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Telomerase gene therapy represents a novel effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis associated with short telomeres by improving pulmonary function, decreasing inflammation and accelerating fiber disappearance in fibrotic lungs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian telomeres are protective structures at ends of chromosomes that consist of TTAGGG repeats bound by a six-protein complex known as shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Lange, 2005</xref>). A minimum length of telomeric repeats is necessary for shelterin binding and telomere protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Lange, 2005</xref>). Telomerase is an enzyme composed of two subunits, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the RNA component (<italic>Terc</italic>), which is used as template for the de novo addition of telomeric repeats to chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greider and Blackburn, 1985</xref>). Adult tissues, including the stem cell compartments, do not have sufficient telomerase activity to compensate for the progressive telomere shortening associated with cell division throughout lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Canela et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vera et al., 2012</xref>). When telomeres reach a critically short length, this triggers activation of a persistent DNA damage response at telomeres and the subsequent induction of cellular senescence or apoptosis. Indeed, this progressive shortening of telomeres with increasing age is considered one of the hallmarks of aging both in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, critical telomere shortening at the stem cell compartments results in the loss of the regenerative capacity of these compartments eventually compromising tissue renewal and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blasco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the rate of telomere shortening throughout lifespan has been shown to be influenced both by genetic factors (ie., mutations in genes necessary for telomere maintenance) and environmental factors (ie., cigarette smoke has a negative effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armanios, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In support of critical telomere shortening being a determinant of aging and longevity, increased TERT expression in the context of cancer resistant transgenic mice was sufficient to delay aging and extend mouse longevity by 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomás-Loba et al., 2008</xref>). More recently, these findings have been translated into a potential therapeutic strategy by using adeno-associated vectors (AAV) to transiently activate telomerase in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bär et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, treatment with <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy using non-integrative AAV9 vectors of adult mice was able to delay aging and increase longevity by decreasing age-related pathologies such as osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, as well as neuromuscular and cognitive decline. Furthermore, the onset of cancer was also delayed in the <italic>Tert</italic> treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> delivery specifically to the heart was sufficient to significantly increase mouse survival and heart function upon myocardial infarction, which was concomitant with decreased fibrosis and increased cardiac myocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bär et al., 2014</xref>). These findings support the notion that telomere shortening is at the origin of age-related diseases and that, by delaying or reverting this process with telomerase, it is possible to delay and treat more effectively age-associated diseases, such as heart infarct.</p><p>Extreme telomere shortening can occur prematurely in individuals with mutations in telomerase and other telomere maintenance genes causing the so-called telomere syndromes, which include dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia and pulmonary fibrosis, among others (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>]). These syndromes are characterized by premature loss of the regenerative capacity of tissues, affecting both high and low proliferation tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holohan et al., 2014</xref>). Among the telomere syndromes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common condition associated with telomere dysfunction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armanios, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>). Both familial and sporadic cases have been linked to telomerase mutations, either in <italic>TERT</italic> or <italic>TERC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, mutations in <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>TERC</italic> account for 8–15% of familial and 1–3% of sporadic cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armanios, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, sporadic cases of IPF, not associated with telomerase mutations, also show shorter telomeres compared to age-matched controls, with 10% of the patients showing telomeres as short as the telomerase mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>). Telomerase mutations have also been found in up to 1% of smokers showing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also leading to abnormally short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, in spite of its prevalence, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is still a life-threatening lung degenerative disease, with few available therapeutic options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 2011</xref>). As an example, the recently FDA-approved drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, show anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahluwalia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karimi-Shah and Chowdhury, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2014</xref>), and slow IPF progression but are not curative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunninghake, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karimi-Shah and Chowdhury, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, to date, lung transplantation is the only curative therapeutic option in less than 5% of IPF patients with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lama, 2009</xref>). Thus, development of new, more effective, therapeutic strategies aimed against treating the origin of the disease is urgently needed.</p><p>An important limitation to the development of new therapeutic strategies has been the lack of appropriate pre-clinical mouse models. Induction of acute pulmonary fibrosis with high doses of bleomycin in mice has been the most widely used preclinical model, although the disease spontaneously reverses in this model after 2–3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mouratis and Aidinis, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, telomerase-deficient mice with short telomeres do not spontaneously develop pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alder et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that additional insults contribute to the disease in addition to the genetic defects. In support of this notion, we recently demonstrated that treatment with low doses of bleomycin (0.5 mg/kg BW), which normally do not lead to pulmonary fibrosis in wild-type mice, however, results in full-blown progressive pulmonary fibrosis in telomerase deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, this model shows that short telomeres are at the molecular origin of pulmonary fibrosis and could represent a useful pre-clinical tool to test the challenging hypothesis of whether therapeutic strategies based on telomerase activation maybe effective in the treatment of the disease.</p><p>Here, we tested this hypothesis by using a <italic>Tert</italic> based gene therapy in mice diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis owing to treatment with low doses of the lung-damaging agent bleomycin in the context of short telomeres, a scenario that resembles pulmonary fibrosis in humans associated with short telomeres. Our findings demonstrate that <italic>Tert</italic> treatment significantly improves pulmonary function, decreases inflammation, and accelerates fiber disappearance in fibrotic lungs as early as 3 weeks after viral treatment, resulting in a more rapid improvement or disappearance of the fibrosis. At the molecular level, AAV9-treatment results in telomere elongation and increased proliferation of ATII cells, also significantly decreasing DNA damage, apoptosis, and senescence in these cells. Further supporting these findings, telomerase treatment induces gene expression changes indicative of increased proliferation, lower inflammation and decreased fibrosis in isolated ATII cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells prevents pulmonary fibrosis progression induced by short telomeres and restores lung health</title><p>Here, we set to address whether telomerase treatment of adult mouse lungs by using AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> vectors could effectively prevent the progression of pulmonary fibrosis provoked by damage to the lungs (ie.,low-dose bleomycin) and the presence of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>), a scenario that resembles both familiar and sporadic cases of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armanios, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>). To this end, we used our previously described mouse model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis induced by a low bleomycin dose in the context of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, owing to the fact that short telomeres per se in the context of the telomerase-deficient mouse model are not sufficient to induce pulmonary fibrosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alder et al., 2011</xref>), we previously generated a mouse model for pulmonary fibrosis associated with short telomeres by treating telomerase-deficient mice from the second (G2) and fourth (G4) generation, G2-G4 <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> with a low dose of bleomycin (0.5 mg/kg body weight). This low dose of bleomycin is not sufficient to induce pulmonary fibrosis in wild-type mice, but leads to progressive pulmonary fibrosis in the G2-G4 <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). It is relevant to note that this is in contrast to the widely used mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis using a much higher dose of bleomycin (2 mg/kg body weight), which leads to pulmonary fibrosis in wild-type mice but does not recapitulate the short telomere phenotype present in human patients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In particular, we show here that male wild-type mice inoculated either with vehicle or with the standard high-dose bleomycin protocol did not show any significant telomere length changes 4 weeks after bleomycin challenge compared to vehicle inoculated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that this mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis does not recapitulate one of the molecular features of the human disease (ie, the presence of short telomeres). Further supporting this notion, treatment of these mice with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> did not show any significant decrease in the amount of fibronectin compared to the empty vector-treated lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To test the efficacy of telomerase gene therapy in our mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by DNA damage to the lungs (ie.,low-dose bleomycin) and the presence of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>), we selected AAV9 serotype owing to its high viral transduction of the lungs, and its low immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zincarelli et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, we previously showed that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> transduced lungs cells showed <italic>Tert</italic> mRNA over-expression for at least 8 month post-infection of the vector, as well as resulted in re-activation of telomerase as determined by Telomerase Repeated Amplification Protocol (TRAP) in adult lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012</xref>). To determine the transduction efficiency of the lungs in our current study, we intravenously (IV) injected wild-type adult mice with AAV9-<italic>eGFP</italic> and determined eGFP expression in the lungs 2 weeks later. We found transduction of 3% (GFP positive cells) of total lung cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we addressed which adult lung cell types were being transduced with the AAV9 vector. We previously described that alveolar type II cells (ATII) cells are a key cell type in the origin of pulmonary fibrosis owing to dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we performed double immunofluorescence against eGFP and the surfactant protein C (Sftpc), a specific marker of ATII cells. We first observed that 13.4% of total lung cells were ATII cells (Sftpc-positive cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is in line with the 12–15% reported abundance of ATII cells in whole lung cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobbs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Velden et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, we observed that 17% of total ATII cells were transduced by AAV9-<italic>eGFP</italic> (GFP-positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, more than 80% of all the GFP-positive lung cells were ATII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that AAV9 has a specific tropism for these cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31299.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment targets ATII cells leading to remission of pulmonary fibrosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of immunofluorescence against eGFP (in red) and Sftpc (in green).

Two weeks after bleomycin treatment, we performed computed tomography (CT) to identify those mice with abnormal radiological images of the lungs, indicative of inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Approximately 50% of the mice showed an abnormal radiographic pattern presenting reticular opacities suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). These mice with an abnormal CT pattern were divided in two random groups, one group was intravenously (IV) injected with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> and the other group was injected with the empty vector, as control placebo group. Disease progression was followed longitudinally in both cohorts both by performing weekly spirometry during the first 3 weeks after viral treatment, to measure lung function, as well as by CT imaging at 1, 2, 4 and 7 weeks post viral treatment to follow progression of the abnormal radiographic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, only one week after viral treatment, CT imaging showed that all abnormal radiological images in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice regressed in size, while they further increased in size in mice treated with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). After the second week of treatment, we observed a regression of the affected CT lung volume in both groups, although at all time points analyzed the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice showed significantly smaller volume of the CT lesions as compared to mice treated with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Importantly, at week seven after treatment with the viral vectors (week nine after the induction of fibrosis with bleomycin), the affected CT lung volume in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice corresponds to only 5% of total lung volume, while at this point mice treated with the empty vector still exhibited 40% of total lung volume affected as indicated by CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>Given the small size of mouse lungs, CT imaging as PF diagnose is not fully accurate since inflammation can also give rise to abnormal CT pattern. As an independent longitudinal non-invasive indicator of improvement of pulmonary lesions in the treated mice, pulmonary function was determined by using plethysmography (spirometry) that measures the amount of air left in the lung after deep inhalation and forced exhalation, both previous to viral treatment and during the first 3 weeks after treatment. We observed that lung function measured as the ratio between lung resistance and dynamic compliance worsen in the AAV9-Empty treated mice compared to the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> controls already the first week after viral treatment. Importantly, pulmonary function in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice became similar to that of healthy mice non-treated with bleomycin at two weeks post-viral treatment and was maintained thereafter, illustrating the efficacy of the treatment at restoring lung health. In contrast, mice treated with AAV9-Empty show significant higher LR/Cdyn values as compared to healthy and to AAV9-<italic>Tert,</italic> indicating a worsened pulmonary function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in order to confirm the areas of the lung affected with fibrosis, at week eight after viral treatment with the vectors, all mice were sacrificed for histopathological, biochemical, and molecular analysis of the lungs. First, we confirmed increased expression of <italic>Tert</italic> mRNA by qPCR in the lungs of AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice compared to mice treated with the empty vector, which lacked detectable <italic>Tert</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bär et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next used Masson´s trichrome staining to quantify the lung fibrotic areas by histochemistry. We considered ‘severe fibrosis’ when more than 30% of the lung parenchyma was affected by fibrosis; ‘mild fibrosis’ when less than 10% of the lung parenchyma was affected; and ‘non-fibrotic lungs’ when no signs of fibrosis were found. We found that at week 8 after treatment with the viral vectors (week 10 after the induction of fibrosis), all mice treated with the empty vector showed severe fibrosis as indicated by more than 30% of the lung parenchyma affected by fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). In contrast, none of the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice showed severe fibrosis at this point. Instead, 50% of <italic>Tert</italic>-treated mice presented mild fibrosis lesions and 50% were completely free of fibrotic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Thus, 50% AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice showed undetectable fibrosis as determined by Masson´s trichrome staining at 8 weeks post-viral treatment, while all empty vector treated mice still showed severe fibrotic lesions.</p><p>Picrosirius red staining of lungs to determine collagen deposition, confirmed that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice presented one-third less collagen deposition compared to mice treated with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). As an independent biochemical method, we determined collagen peptides containing hydroxyproline on whole lung tissue at 8 weeks after treatment with the viral vectors using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which has been previously validated to quantify collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chaerkady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montgomery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ono et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taga et al., 2014</xref>). As validation of the technique in our experimental setting, we determined collagen peptides containing hydroxyproline in non-fibrotic lungs from <italic>Tert</italic>-deficient mice that had not been treated with bleomycin and in fibrotic lungs from <italic>Tert</italic>-deficient mice treated with bleomycin at 5 weeks post-bleomycin treatment (0.5 mg/kg BW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). The results show that bleomycin treated lungs present a 2-fold increase in the amount of collagen peptides containing hydroxyproline compared to control lungs not treated with bleomycin (w/o bleomycin) in agreement with induction of fibrosis by bleomycin in <italic>Tert</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), thus validating this method for quantification of fibrosis. At 8 weeks after viral treatment (10 weeks post bleomycin treatment), AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs showed 2-fold lower content in collagen peptides containing hydroxyproline compared to AAV9-Empty treated lungs, indicating that telomerase treatment improves collagen removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). Analysis of total procollagen levels in the lung using western blot analysis also showed approximately 50% and 30% lower levels of procollagen in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice compared to the controls at 3 and 8 weeks post-viral treatment, respectively, suggesting that <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy leads to a more rapid removal of fiber deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In line with lower collagen, AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs also showed significantly less αSMA-positive myofibroblasts compared to empty vector-treated mice, in agreement with the fact that these cells are associated with collagen deposition in human IPF patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), thus suggesting an inactivation of fibrotic foci upon <italic>Tert</italic> treatment.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31299.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment leads to lower collagen deposition, less inflammation and decreased active fibrotic foci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of picosirius red staining visualized by polarized light where collagen fibers are bright orange from mice treated either with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> or empty vector 8 weeks post-viral treatment.

Of note, macrophages and fibroblasts were discarded from the analysis based on cell morphology. These findings indicate that <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy rescues DNA damage, apoptosis and cellular senescence in mice diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis owing to critically short telomeres. However, as these histological analyses do not permit distinguishing among different cell types, to specifically address the DNA damage burden in ATII cells we performed double immunohistochemistry staining with anti-SFTPC to mark ATII cells and anti-γH2AX to mark cells with DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The results clearly show that the amount of damaged ATII cells in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs is reduced by 3-fold compared to control mice treated with the AAV9-Empty vector at 3 weeks post-viral treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment results in increased proliferation of ATII cells</title><p>To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy results in significant remission and healing of pulmonary fibrosis owing to short telomeres, we next studied telomere length specifically in the ATII cells of mice treated with either AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> or the empty vector. To this end, we performed an Immuno-FISH using a telomeric PNA probe and a Sftpc antibody to specifically mark ATII cells in lung samples at 8 weeks post-viral treatment. We analyzed telomere intensity in both Sftpc positive (ATII) and negative (non-ATII) cells. We found that ATII cells have shorter telomeres than non-ATII cells in telomerase-deficient mice in agreement with our previous findings indicating that these cells are important for the regeneration of lung damage induced by dysfunctional telomeres, as they have undergone more cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, ATII cells from mice treated with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> showed the same telomere length than the surrounding non-ATII cells, suggesting that telomerase treatment is preserving telomeres in these cells in the context of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). Indeed, the percentage of short telomeres of ATII cells compared to non-ATII in empty vector-treated mice (ATII/non-ATII ratio = 1.4) is significantly higher than in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice (ATII/non-ATII ratio = 0.98). We considered short telomeres those spots with an intensity ≤30 a.u. corresponding to 20th percentile. The percentage of short telomeres from ATII cells was normalized to non-ATII cells to avoid inter-individual variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that specific telomerase targeting to ATII cells results in improved telomere length maintenance and a consequent reduction in DNA damage burden of these cells compared to ATII cells from mice treated with the empty vector.</p><p>Next, we addressed the effects of <italic>Tert</italic> treatment on the ability of ATII cells to proliferate and regenerate the damaged lung tissue upon diagnosis of fibrosis. To this end, double immunofluorescence against the ATII cells-specific marker Sftpc and the proliferation marker Ki67 was performed in lung samples at 8 weeks post-viral treatment. We found that <italic>Tert</italic> treated mice showed a 2-fold increase in Ki67 positive cells in whole lung tissue compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). When specifically looking at ATII cells, we observed a 2-fold increase in the total number of Sftpc positive cells and 2.5-fold increase in Ki67 positive ATII cells in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs compared to the empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). Although we cannot distinguish between the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> infected and non-infected ATII cells, the fact that 80% of the total AAV9-infected lung cells are ATII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggests that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment is resulting in increased proliferation of these cells leading to a higher potential for lung regeneration and the remission of lung fibrosis. Thus, the higher number of proliferating ATII cells are in agreement with the significant lower percentage of short telomeres in ATII cells in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs as well as with the significant decrease in the number of p21 and p53 positive cells in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment leads to gene expression changes indicative of higher regeneration potential</title><p>Next, we studied gene expression changes induced by <italic>Tert</italic> expression in the context of lung fibrosis. To this aim, we first performed DNA microarray analysis from the post-caval lung lobe from mice diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis which were treated either with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> or with the empty vector at 8 weeks post viral treatment with the vectors (5 mice were included per group). We found that only 53 genes were significantly upregulated (False Discovery Rate, FDR &lt; 0.05) in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice compared to mice treated with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This FDR cutoff highlights the significance of the gene expression changes observed, as only 5% of the hits are expected to be false positive. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed significantly deregulated pathways between both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Those pathways found upregulated in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs presented a signature related with DNA replication and mitosis, apoptosis, DNA repair, the leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway, and extension of telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upregulation of the ‘extension of telomeres pathway’ is in line with improved telomere maintenance in ATII cells treated with <italic>Tert</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, upregulation of DNA replication and mitosis pathways is in line with increased proliferation in ATII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, pathways downregulated in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> compared to AAV9-Empty treated lungs were related to fibroblast growth factor receptors, Wnt and TGF-β pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Of interest, four of the pathways downregulated by <italic>Tert</italic> are related with fibroblast growth factor receptors; that is, the FGFR2C, FGFR4, FGFR and the FGFR1 ligand binding and activation cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As FGF1-FGFRc over-expression has been shown to contribute to pathogenesis in IPF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacKenzie et al., 2015</xref>), these findings suggest that <italic>Tert</italic> impairs fibroblast activation, thus facilitating fibrosis regression. In line with this, we also found a downregulation of the TGF-β pathway in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs. This is in agreement with our previous findings that <italic>Tert</italic> overexpression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) induces downregulation of TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geserick et al., 2006</xref>).

As an example, the recently FDA approved drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone can significantly reduce the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in patients although no full-remissions have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunninghake, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karimi-Shah and Chowdhury, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2014</xref>).Thus, new therapeutic strategies aimed to cure the disease are still needed.</p><p>As short telomeres have been shown to be at the origin of both sporadic and familial cases of pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>), here, we set out to address the potential of telomerase gene therapy in the treatment of these cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To this end, we used a pre-clinical mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by damage to the lungs (ie., treatment with a low bleomycin dose) and the presence of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>), a scenario that resembles both familiar and sporadic cases of the human disease which are associated with the presence of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>). It is important to note that only the presence of short telomeres per se in mice deficient for telomerase does not lead to pulmonary fibrosis (PF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alder et al., 2011</xref>). We generated a new, more ‘humanized’ mouse model for pulmonary fibrosis by subjecting <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with short telomeres to small doses of bleomycin (0.5 mg/kg body weight). This low dose of bleomycin is not sufficient to induce pulmonary fibrosis in wild-type mice, but synergizes with short telomeres in the context of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice leading to full-blown, progressive pulmonary fibrosis, recapitulating many of the features of the human disease, including the presence of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blasco et al., 1997</xref>). We further show here that the most widely used mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, which is based on treating wild-type mice with a high dose of bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson and Bowden, 1974</xref>), do not present short telomeres in the lung. Thus, to our knowledge the mouse model used here is the only available mouse model to date that develops pulmonary fibrosis as a consequence of telomere length defects as it is also the case of human patients with pulmonary fibrosis associated to short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here we extensively demonstrate by using biochemical, functional, and histochemistry analysis, that <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy (AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic>) in mice diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis leads to a more rapid regression of pulmonary fibrosis and improves pulmonary function as early as weeks 1 and 3 after treatment and this is maintained at the end-point of the experiment at week 8, when a significant percentage of mice show curation of the fibrosis.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the major lung cell type transduced by AAV9 are ATII cells, previously shown by us to be at the origin of pulmonary fibrosis owing to dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>). ATII cells have been also proposed to be involved in lung regeneration upon injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serrano-Mollar et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Tert</italic> increased expression in ATII cells results in improved telomere maintenance and proliferation of these cells, which is concomitant with lower DNA damage as well as decreased presence of apoptotic and senescence cells already at week 3 after AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment. As a consequence, <italic>Tert-</italic>treated mice show a better pulmonary function as well as decreased inflammation and decreased fibrosis (lower collagen depots). These results are in line with the notion that short telomeres can impair the ability of stem cells to regenerate tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blasco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flores et al., 2008</xref>), and with recent findings suggesting that IPF is the result of defective regeneration upon repetitive epithelial cell injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ryu et al., 2014</xref>). Of clinical relevance is the observation that these beneficial effects of <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy are achieved with a transduction efficiency of 3% of total lung cells and 17% of ATII cells.</p><p>Of relevance, we show here that <italic>Tert</italic> expression in fibrotic lungs leads to downregulation of pathways involved in fibroblast activation and, in particular, of the TGF-β pathway. Indeed, gene expression analysis of isolated ATII cells from <italic>Tert-</italic>treated mice showed downregulation of p53 signaling, apoptotic pathways and of several inflammation-related pathways including the TGF-β, NF-KappaB, IL2 and TNF signaling pathways as early as 1 week after <italic>Tert</italic> treatment. Dampening of inflammation upon <italic>Tert</italic> treatment was further demonstrated by decreased levels of a large number of cytokines already at 3 weeks post-viral treatment that were maintained all throughout the experiment. These pathways are known to be important players in IPF, and are targeted by the currently approved treatments for this disease, such as pirfenidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inomata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oku et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, in contrast to the available IPF treatments, pirfenidone and nintedanib, which are not able to induce disease remission neither in patients nor in preclinical mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inomata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>), we show here that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> therapy effectively accelerates the regression of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We would like to propose that this might be due to the fact that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> therapy targets one of the molecular causes of the disease, namely short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Povedano et al., 2015</xref>), which in turn we show here that results in decreased DNA damage and improved proliferative potential of the ATII cells, and subsequently in decreased fibrosis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with this, it was shown that treatment with GRN510, a small molecule activator of telomerase, suppresses the development of fibrosis and accumulation of senescent cells in the lung in a model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le Saux et al., 2013</xref>).

The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 250 nl/min onto an analytical column packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ beads,2.4 μm, 75 μm x 50 cm (Dr. Maisch), heated to 45°C. Solvent A was 4% ACN in 0.1% FA and Solvent B acetonitrile in 0.1% FA. The gradient used was a 150 min curved gradient from 2% B to 33.2% B in 130 min. The MS acquisition time used for each sample was 150 min. The Q-q-TOF Impact was operated in a data dependent mode. The spray voltage was set to 1.35 kV (1868 nA) and the temperature of the source was set to 160°C. The MS survey scan was performed at a spectra rate of 2.5 Hz in the TOF analyzer scanning a window between 150 and 2000 m/z. The minimum MS signal for triggering MS/MS was set to a normalized threshold of 500 counts. The 20 most abundant isotope patterns with charge ≥2 and m/z &gt; 350 from the survey scan were sequentially isolated and fragmented in the collision cell by collision induced dissociation (CID) using a collision energy of 23–56 eV as function of the m/z value. The m/z values triggering MS/MS with a repeat count of 1 were put on an exclusion list for 60 s using the rethinking option. For protein identification and quantification raw data were analyzed by MaxQuant interrogating a database containing mouse Uniprot Canonnical/TrEmbl sequences plus the most common contaminats (43936 entries), with Metionine and Proline Oxidation (HydroxyProline) allowed as variable modifications. A normalization factor was calculated to correct for variations in total protein content in each sample. Hydroxyproline-containing collagen peptides were quantified and their intensity values were normalized to the total peptide intensity for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cytokines array</title><p>Cytokine levels in lungs were analyzed by Mouse Cytokine Array (ProteomeProfiler mouse Cytokine Array Panel A from R&amp;D Systems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The pixel density was determined by Image J Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Telomere analysis</title><p>Q-FISH determination on paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Suárez et al., 2000</xref>). After deparaffinization, tissues were post-fixed in 4% Formaldehyde 5 min, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS and incubated at 37°C 15 min in pepsin solution (0.1% Porcine Pepsin, Sigma; 0.01M HCl, Merck). After another round of washes and fixation as above-mentioned, slides were dehydrated in a 70%–90–100% ethanol series (5 min each). After 10 min of air-drying, 30 μl of telomere probe mix (10 mM TrisCl pH7, 25 mM MgCl2, 9 mM Citric Acid, 82 mM Na2HPO4, 70% Deionised Formamide –Sigma-, 0.25% Blocking Reagent –Roche- and 0.5 μg/ml Telomeric PNA probe -Panagene) were added to each slide. A cover slip was added and slides incubated for 3 min at 85°C, and for further 2 hr at RT in a wet chamber in the dark. Slides were washed 2 × 15 min in 10 mM TrisCl pH7, 0.1% BSA in 70% formamide under vigorous shaking, then 3 × 5 min in TBS 0.08% Tween20 and then incubated in a 4`,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) bath (4 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) in PBS) before mounting samples in Vectashield (VectorTM). Confocal image were acquired as stacks every 1 μm for a total of 3 μm using a Leica SP5-MP confocal microscope and maximum projections were done with the LAS-AF software. Telomere signal intensity was quantified using Definiens software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>RNA was extracted from post-caval lobe frozen lungs with RNeasy kit following manufacturer instruction (Qiagen, cat. N° 73504) and RNA integrity analyzed in an Agilent Bioanalyzer. cDNA was synthesised and analyzed on Agilent´s Mouse Genome DNA microarray, following the manufacturer´s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Microarray background subtraction was carried out using normexp method. To normalize the dataset, we performed loess within arrays normalization and quantiles between arrays normalization. Differentially expressed genes were obtained by applying linear models with R limma package (Smyth GK) (Bioconductor project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>). To account for multiple hypotheses testing, the estimated significance level (p value) was adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. Those genes with FDR &lt; 0.05 were selected as differentially expressed between the AAV9-treated and non-treated groups. This standard FDR threshold assumes a 5% of false positives in most impactful genes obtained in the differential expression analysis. The raw data have been deposited in GEO database (accession number GSE93869).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied using annotations from Biocarta, KEGG, NCI pathways and Reactome. Genes were ranked based on limma moderated t statistic. After Kolmogorov-Smirnoff testing, those gene sets showing FDR &lt; 0.05, a well-established cut-off for the identification of biologically relevant gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), were considered enriched between classes under comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were isolated from mouse lungs of both groups AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> and AAV9-empty vector. Lungs were extracted and introduced in HBBS buffer with antibiotic and 1% BSA. Separate the lobules of the lung on a dish mince them with a scalpel. Transfer them to a GentleMacs tube with HBBS, antibiotics,, 1% BSA, DNAse I (60 units/mL) (Sigma, DN25) and collagenase type I (70 units/mL) (GIBCO, Cat. Number 17100). Then we run the GentleMac program ‘lung 1’, after the program incubate the sample at 37°C for 30 min and at the end we run the GentleMac program ‘lung 2’. Cell suspension was filtered through a 40 μm stainer and then centrifuge 1200 rpm 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 2 mL ACK Lysis Buffer to lyse red blood cells. Incubate 4 min. at room temperature. We added DMEM without serum to wash, centrifugate and discard supernatant. At the end, resuspend cells in PBS with EDTA (1 mM), Hepes (25 mM) and 3% FBS to start staining with LysoTracker as described in commercial protocol (Molecular Probes, LysoTracker Green DND-26, Cat. Num. L7526) and the following antibodies from Pharmingen (BD Biosciences, San Jose CA): PE antimouse CD45, PE antimouse CD31, APC antimouse EpCAM. DAPI (Sigma, St Louis MO) was used to identify dead cells. Data was collected and the defined populations (CD45-CD31-EpCAM + LysoTracker + and LysoTracker-) were sorted using an InFlux cell sorted (BD, San Jose CA), we excluded cell aggregates by using pulse processing in the scatter signals and dead cells in the basis of DAPI staining. All data was analyzed using FlowJo software v9.8.5 (Treestar, Ahsland OR).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to D Megias for microscopy analysis, to J Muñoz and F García for hydroxiproline analysis as well as to CNIO Histopathological Unit.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathleen Collins as a guest Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Hockemeyer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Short telomeres are a significant risk factor for the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Critically short telomeres impose an irreversible loss of alveolar type II (ATII) cells. This manuscript utilizes a short telomere mouse model (G2 <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) in which pulmonary fibrosis is induced by low dose bleomycin treatment. It examines the effect of upregulation of <italic>Tert</italic> expression via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) delivery on fibrosis and associated functional, tissue, cellular, molecular, and gene expression changes. The results demonstrate overall improvement across several assays in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice compared to the AAV9-empty controls.</p><p>The interest of this work for the <italic>eLife</italic> audience lies in its clinical relevance as proof of principle for telomerase-activation therapy of PF. Therapies to reverse pulmonary fibrosis by increasing telomere length are needed. Concerns were raised as to whether the mouse model of PF is close enough to the human disease versus another example of telomerase activation saving short-telomere mice from tissue insult. The authors need to explicitly justify the mouse model, noting that unlike the human disease, there is an improvement in the Bleo/AAV9-empty mice over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>, and 3E). Thus the comparison made in this work is between improvement +/- <italic>Tert</italic> instead of improvement vs. no improvement that would be the case in human disease therapy.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit from being streamlined towards the clinical model and relevance. The claims made from studying the ATII cells and the transcriptional profiling should be toned down, as proper lineage tracing is not performed.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether the sex of the mouse was taken into account. This is important, particularly, given their prior findings (Povedano, et al., 2015).</p><p>3) It is quite remarkable that approximately 80% of eGFP+ cells in the lung after AAV9-eGFP injection were ATII cells. Less than 20% of the ATII cells, however, were eGFP+. If AAV9 transduces 30% of lung cells, but ATII cells comprise ~60% of alveolar epithelial cells and 15% of peripheral lung cells, these numbers don't make sense. It would be good to know what% of lung cells are transduced and what percent of lung cells are ATII to understand the phenomenon reported in the paper. Moreover, it is also striking that transduction of such a minor fraction of ATII cells has the impact it does. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> are difficult to interpret given each point in time is normalized to the corresponding measurement for the AAV9-empty control. A better comparison would be with the AAV9-empty control at week 0 as well as to mice not exposed to bleo but treated with AAV9-empty. The time points should also be carried out to 8 weeks post AAV9 treatment so one can determine whether the reversal of fibrosis as measured by CT and histology correlates with improvement in function.</p><p>5) CT appears to be a poor measure of fibrosis given that in the AAV9-empty mice less than 50% of the lung volume appears affected at 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), yet 100% of mice have severe fibrosis based on histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, the CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) data suggest that a large percentage of G2 <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are able to recover to some extent following bleo treatment. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>6) At what time point were the mice used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? As above, it is important to know how the measurements compare to mice that were mock-bleo treated followed by AAV9-empty. While there may be statistically significant differences between AAV9-empty and AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice, it is important to know how the absolute values at any given time point differ from lung not treated with bleo.</p><p>7) There needs to be more clarity with respect to what AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment does with respect to fibrosis – does it enhance removal, decrease additional deposition, or a combination of both? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and 2E</xref> suggest more rapid removal at the earlier time point.</p><p>8) The cytokine panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2J and 2K</xref> need to be interpreted beyond there being a statistically significant difference between the AAV9-empty and AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> mice at the two time points. There needs to be some interpretation as to whether the specific differences or lack thereof (e.g., M-CSF, TIMP-1, TNF-a) make sense. E.g., if macrophages are major drivers in pulmonary fibrosis does no change in M-CSF fit the proposed effect? If collagen removal is at play, does it make sense there was no change in TIMP-1? Do the authors have an idea as to why the hallmark inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is higher or similar for AAV9-empty mice and AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> mice at the 3 week time point?</p><p>9) It is not clear what time point was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-K</xref>. This is important because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows marked reduction in p53 and p21 at 8 weeks even in the AAV9-empty. How does this correlate with the telomere and proliferation measurements?</p><p>10) The authors should show evidence of reactivation of telomerase in the <italic>Tert</italic>-AAV treated <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. This is particularly important as any difference in telomere length between AAV-empty and AAV-TERT treated mice is hard to discern (very little extension of telomeres may be necessary for a physiological effect).</p><p>11) The manuscript needs to be very carefully edited for spelling, grammar, and scientific writing. There are numerous errors throughout.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Therapeutic effects of telomerase in mice with pulmonary fibrosis induced by damage to the lungs and short telomeres&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article was evaluated by the original peer reviewers, overseen by guest Reviewing Editor Kathleen Collins and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All of the reviewers appreciate the revisions to the manuscript in content and in presentation. The concern that remains, after group discussion, whether there is actual reversal of fibrosis. The revised manuscript explains very clearly the criteria for scoring disease reversal, but (per reviewer discussion) &quot;authors have not shown that they have reversed or treated PF in these mice&quot; because they have not shown the specific pathology present at the time the mice are treated with AAV. The specific concerns are that perhaps only inflammation is present at that time, fibrosis ensues in the AAV-Empty but not the AAV-TERT mice, and the primary effect of AAV-TERT treatment is reversal of the inflammatory response. Nonetheless, the work demonstrates a significant benefit of AAV-TERT treatment in this model. The key word is &quot;reversed&quot;, which is used three times in the text, one at the end of the Introduction after explaining what the diagnosis is that is reversed (so OK), then two at the very start of Results (header and first sentence) (also in the short title). If you could change this to something like &quot;prevents pulmonary fibrosis progression and restores lung health&quot; then the concerns are obviated. Perhaps it is possible to explain in the Discussion how humans present with the disease, but since humans and mice are not the same, this might not integrate well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31299.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Concerns were raised as to whether the mouse model of PF is close enough to the human disease versus another example of telomerase activation saving short-telomere mice from tissue insult.

Thus the comparison made in this work is between improvement +/- Tert instead of improvement vs. no improvement that would be the case in human disease therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the justification of the mouse model used here and previously developed by us (<italic>Tert knock out</italic> mice with short telomeres treated with a low bleomycin dose as a trigger of pulmonary damage), we previously showed that it recapitulated many aspects of the human disease including presence of short telomeres and development of a full-blown progressive disease (Povedano et al., 2015). In addition, we previously studied telomere length in other existing mouse models of PF to assess whether they could be used for the <italic>Tert</italic>-based gene therapy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis owing to short telomeres. On one hand, we analyzed telomere length in wild-type mice with pulmonary fibrosis owing to a standard bleomycin treatment, which is a widely-used mouse model for this disease (Adamson and Bowden, 1974). However, telomere length was not significantly affected in this mouse model, unlike the human IPF patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also tested telomere length in an additional mouse model that develops severe pulmonary fibrosis: the Fra2 knock-in mouse model (Eferl et al., PNAS, 2008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Again, Fra1-deleted mice diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis did not show any significant telomere length changes in lung cells, unlike human PF patients with short telomeres. These previous results constituted the motivation and rational of why we ruled out these mouse models for our AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy studies. Instead, we intentionally chose <italic>Tert</italic>-knock out mice that present short telomeres and develop pulmonary fibrosis upon a low-dose bleomycin insult (Povedano et al., 2015). Thus, while wild-type mice with normal telomere length do not develop PF upon this low-dose bleomycin insult, the telomerase deficient mice presenting short telomeres develop PF, indicating that short telomeres are one of the underlying causes of PF. This is the only mouse model to our knowledge that develop PF as a consequence of telomere length defects. We now discuss these issues in the revised manuscript (Discussion, second paragraph). Finally, we would like to kindly indicate that, as in any other gene therapy trial, our approach consists in the reintroduction of a functional missing gene. In the case of pulmonary fibrosis owing to telomerase deficiency, this is a real clinical need, as there are a significant percent of patients suffering idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated to either telomerase mutations or to short telomeres (<italic>Tert</italic> and <italic>Terc</italic> account for 8-15% of familial and 1-3% of sporadic cases). Furthermore, up to 10% of patients with <italic>no telomerase mutations</italic> show telomere length in the range of mutation carriers, which could also benefit of a <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy approach.</p><p>As per the second commentary by the Editor regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, we would like to highlight that even though in the longitudinal CT analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> there is an apparent decrease of the affected area also in the empty-treated mice, given the small size of mouse lungs, CT imaging is not fully accurate to diagnose PF since inflammation can also give rise to abnormal CT pattern. For this reason we also performed longitudinal analyses of pulmonary function as determined by spirometry in these same mice. The results show that pulmonary function is not recovered in the AAV9-empty treated mice compared to the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, histopathological diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, clearly shows that while all of the AAV9-empty treated mice show severe fibrosis at the end-point of the experiment, 50% of the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice show complete remission of fibrosis and the other half show mild fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), thus highlighting the beneficial effects of <italic>Tert</italic> treatment in this model of disease. Nevertheless,as suggested by the reviewer, we now state in the revised manuscript that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> therapy leads to more rapid improvement of PF as compared to AAV9-empty treated mice (Introduction: last paragraph; Discussion: third, sixth and last paragraphs).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31299.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mean telomere length in wild type and fibrotic Fra2 Knock-in mice.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31299-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit from being streamlined towards the clinical model and relevance.

This conclusion is explicitly expressed in the text (Abstract; Discussion, last paragraph). We however think that the results obtained from the study of ATII are relevant as we previously demonstrated that ATII cells are a key cell type in the origin of pulmonary fibrosis owing to dysfunctional telomeres (Povedano et al., 2015). Nevertheless, we have now toned this down in the revised manuscript text by indicating that future lineage tracing experiments would be of interest (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear whether the sex of the mouse was taken into account. This is important, particularly, given their prior findings (Povedano, et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>All mice in this study were males. We have now stated this in the revised manuscript text (Results: page 7, 1st paragraph; page 9, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; Methods: page 23, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is quite remarkable that approximately 80% of eGFP+ cells in the lung after AAV9-eGFP injection were ATII cells.

Moreover, it is also striking that transduction of such a minor fraction of ATII cells has the impact it does. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have now re-written this in the revised manuscript text (subsection “<italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells reverses pulmonary fibrosis induced by short telomeres”, second paragraph). In the revised manuscript, we now include the data obtained in the current study on the percentage of transduced GFP+ cells upon AAV9-GFP delivery both with respect to total lung cells and with respect to total Sftpc+ ATII cells (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In particular, we find that 3% of total lung cells and 17.6% of ATII cells are transduced with AAV9-GFP (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, by determining abundance of Sftpc-positive cells with regards to total lung cells we found that 13.4% of lung cells were ATII cells which is in agreement with the previously described 12-15% abundance of these cells in lungs (Dobbs, 1990; Van der Velden et al., 2013). Thus, our findings indicate that the large majority (79.5%) of lung cells transduced by AAV9 vectors correspond to ATII cells (cells positive for both Sftpc and for GFP with regards to total number of cells positive for GFP). The fact that AAV9 transduces ATII cells is of great importance as we have previously demonstrated that induction of severe telomere dysfunction specifically in these cells is sufficient to induce full-blown and lethal PF in mice (Povedano et al., 2015). As mentioned above, we have clarified this point in the revised manuscript. In particular, with approximately 17% of transduced ATII cells we observed a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation of global ATII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice compared to mice treated with the AAV9-empty vector and this was sufficient to clearly have beneficial effects on PF. We now discuss in the revised manuscript (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> are difficult to interpret given each point in time is normalized to the corresponding measurement for the AAV9-empty control.

The time points should also be carried out to 8 weeks post AAV9 treatment so one can determine whether the reversal of fibrosis as measured by CT and histology correlates with improvement in function.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised manuscript we now show absolute values (LR/Cdyn) for every single time point and include mice non-treated with bleomycin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The results clearly show that AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice present a similar pulmonary function as compared to healthy mice (non-treated with bleomycin) from two weeks onwards. In contrast, mice treated with AAV9-empty show significant higher LR/Cdyn values as compared to healthy and to AAV9-<italic>Tert,</italic> indicating a worsened pulmonary function (subsection “<italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells reverses pulmonary fibrosis induced by short telomeres”, fourth paragraph). We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which has clearly improved the figure and reinforced the message of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) CT appears to be a poor measure of fibrosis given that in the AAV9-empty mice less than 50% of the lung volume appears affected at 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), yet 100% of mice have severe fibrosis based on histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, the CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) data suggest that a large percentage of G2 Tert<sup>-/-</sup> mice are able to recover to some extent following bleo treatment. This needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer in that CT measurement of PF in mice is not the most accurate method to detect fibrosis due to the small size of mouse lungs and that inflammation can also give rise to an abnormal CT pattern. However, this technique is the only one that allows to perform an in vivo follow-up of the lungs. Nevertheless, the CT data show significant difference between the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated and AAV9-emptytreated mice at one week after IV injection. While in the AAV9-emptytreated mice the fibrotic volume increases, in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated ones the fibrotic volume decreases. In addition, after the second week of treatment, we observed a regression of the affected CT lung volume in both groups, although at all time points analyzed the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice showed significantly smaller volume of the CT lesions as compared to mice treated with the empty vector. Nevertheless, we have now revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> by comparing the affected areas at different times post-treatment to the initial area affected within each treatment group (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which shows more clearly the therapeutic effect of <italic>Tert</italic> treatment compared to the treatment with the empty vector. As an additional way to longitudinally follow the effects of AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment on PF development, we also show spirometry data, again clearly showing an improvement in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated group compared to mice treated with the empty vector (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We have also rephrased this point in the revised manuscript (subsection “<italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells reverses pulmonary fibrosis induced by short telomeres”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Importantly, in this work we assay fibrosis by several other different means than CT imaging; i.e. by quantification of hydroxiprolin containing collagen peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), by Western blot of collagen at two different time-points after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>), by histological methods (Masson’s trichrome and Sirius red stainings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>) and by immunofluorescence techniques for α-SMA quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-G</xref>). We also assessed inflammation and expression of a wide panel of cytokines, as well as molecular markers of DNA damage, apoptosis and senescence at two different time points after treatment with the gene therapy vectors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) At what time point were the mice used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? As above, it is important to know how the measurements compare to mice that were mock-bleo treated followed by AAV9-empty. While there may be statistically significant differences between AAV9-empty and AAV9-Tert treated mice, it is important to know how the absolute values at any given time point differ from lung not treated with bleo.</p></disp-quote><p>The time points at which the mice were analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and throughout the manuscript have been clearly stated in the text and in figure legends.</p><p>The aim of this study was to address the therapeutic potential of <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy as a novel treatment for PF. For that reason, we used as controls mice that received the same low-dose bleomycin treatment than AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice but instead were treated with the AAV9-empty vector as placebo. Although we agree with the reviewer that mice without bleomycin AAV9-empty could also constitute an interesting control, we think that for our purposes Bleo/AAV9-empty is the most informative control. Including at this stage a non-bleomycin treated group would greatly delay publication of our results without significantly changing the main findings of our manuscript on the effectivity of <italic>Tert</italic> gene therapy in our mouse model of PF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There needs to be more clarity with respect to what AAV9-Tert treatment does with respect to fibrosis – does it enhance removal, decrease additional deposition, or a combination of both? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and 2E</xref> suggest more rapid removal at the earlier time point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data we have indicate that telomerase expression leads to a more rapid removal of fiber deposition as compared to AAV9-treated mice. This is an interesting point and we have discussed it in the revised manuscript text (subsection “<italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells reverses pulmonary fibrosis induced by short telomeres”, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The cytokine panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2J and 2K</xref> need to be interpreted beyond there being a statistically significant difference between the AAV9-empty and AAV9-Tert mice at the two time points. There needs to be some interpretation as to whether the specific differences or lack thereof (e.g., M-CSF, TIMP-1, TNF-a) make sense. E.g., if macrophages are major drivers in pulmonary fibrosis does no change in M-CSF fit the proposed effect? If collagen removal is at play, does it make sense there was no change in TIMP-1? Do the authors have an idea as to why the hallmark inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is higher or similar for AAV9-empty mice and AAV9-Tert mice at the 3 week time point?</p></disp-quote><p>The aim to analyze a large panel of cytokines at two different time points, 3 and 8 weeks post AAV9 inoculation, was to get an overall insight of the inflammatory status of the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> compared to the empty treated lungs during the viral treatment. The results clearly show decreased levels of almost all the cytokines analyzed at both time-points in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> lungs, indicating less inflammation. Several lines of evidence implicate cytokines in fibrosis. Abnormal cytokine expression in fibrotic tissues indicate association between a cytokine and the fibrotic process. However, such changes do not necessarily implicate the cytokine as a contributor to the fibrotic process, as they can be a result rather than a cause of the disease. To implicate specific cytokines as a casual factor of fibrosis more extensive work is needed. We think we have not sufficient data to draw any conclusion about the potential roles of specific cytokines in the observed PF improvement in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated mice. Therefore, we rather show our cytokine analysis as a descriptive observation indicating less inflammation in the AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> as compared to control treated lungs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It is not clear what time point was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-K</xref>. This is important because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows marked reduction in p53 and p21 at 8 weeks even in the AAV9-empty. How does this correlate with the telomere and proliferation measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, the time points at which the mice were analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are now indicated in the revised text and revised figure legend. The higher number of proliferating ATII cells are in agreement with the significant lower percentage of short telomeres in ATII cells in AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treated lungs as well as with the significant decrease in the number of p21 and p53 positive cells in AAV9-<italic>Ter</italic>t treated lungs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This has been now discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment results in increased proliferation of ATII cells”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors should show evidence of reactivation of telomerase in the Tert-AAV treated Tert<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This is particularly important as any difference in telomere length between AAV-empty and AAV-TERT treated mice is hard to discern (very little extension of telomeres may be necessary for a physiological effect).</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we show a clear transcriptional expression of TERT in the telomerase deficient mice treated with AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> while this expression is undetectable in AAV9-empty treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also show a 10% increase in telomere length and a significant reduction in the percentage of short telomeres in ATII cells of AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> as compared to AAV9-empty treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 E-G</xref>). Regarding reactivation of telomerase in the adult lungs upon AAV9-<italic>Tert</italic> treatment, we have demonstrated it in a previous paper (Bernardes de Jesus et al., 2012). We now cite this in the revised manuscript (subsection “<italic>Tert</italic> targeting of alveolar type II cells reverses pulmonary fibrosis induced by short telomeres”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The manuscript needs to be very carefully edited for spelling, grammar, and scientific writing. There are numerous errors throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully edited the revised manuscript</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All of the reviewers appreciate the revisions to the manuscript in content and in presentation. The concern that remains, after group discussion, whether there is actual reversal of fibrosis. The revised manuscript explains very clearly the criteria for scoring disease reversal, but (per reviewer discussion) &quot;authors have not shown that they have reversed or treated PF in these mice&quot; because they have not shown the specific pathology present at the time the mice are treated with AAV. The specific concerns are that perhaps only inflammation is present at that time, fibrosis ensues in the AAV-Empty but not the AAV-TERT mice, and the primary effect of AAV-TERT treatment is reversal of the inflammatory response. Nonetheless, the work demonstrates a significant benefit of AAV-TERT treatment in this model. The key word is &quot;reversed&quot;, which is used three times in the text, one at the end of the Introduction after explaining what the diagnosis is that is reversed (so OK), then two at the very start of Results (header and first sentence) (also in the short title). If you could change this to something like &quot;prevents pulmonary fibrosis progression and restores lung health&quot; then the concerns are obviated. Perhaps it is possible to explain in the Discussion how humans present with the disease, but since humans and mice are not the same, this might not integrate well.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have changed the word “reversed” by “prevents the progression of pulmonary fibrosis and restores lung health” in the text. The short title has been replaced by “Prevention of pulmonary fibrosis progression by telomerase.</p></body></sub-article></article>
