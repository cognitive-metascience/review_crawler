that have been associated with increased motor neuron excitability and decreased inhibition. However, whether spasms involve activation of premotor spinal excitatory neuronal circuits is unknown. Here we use mouse genetics, electrophysiology, imaging and optogenetics to directly target major classes of spinal interneurons as well as motor neurons during spasms in a mouse model of chronic SCI. We find that assemblies of excitatory spinal interneurons are recruited by sensory input into functional circuits to generate persistent neural activity, which interacts with both the graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons to generate spasms, and inhibitory interneurons to curtail them. Our study reveals hitherto unrecognized neuronal mechanisms for the generation of persistent neural activity under pathophysiological conditions, opening up new targets for treatment of muscle spasms after SCI.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23011.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23011.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>spasms</kwd><kwd>persistent neural activity</kwd><kwd>spinal interneurons</kwd><kwd>motor neurons</kwd><kwd>spinal transection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>693038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiehn</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS090919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiehn</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hjärnfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiehn</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiehn</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spinal excitatory interneurons trigger persistent neural activity in spinal network to generate muscle spasms after spinal cord injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to disturbed sensory, autonomic, and motor functions. In the immediate phase following SCI the excitability of the spinal networks caudal to the injury is completely depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klussmann and Martin-Villalba, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rossignol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwab et al., 2006</xref>). This initial state of motor depression is often followed by a maladaptive state of hyper-excitability of the spinal circuitries referred to as spasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biering-Sørensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dietz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hultborn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Little et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nielsen et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2007</xref>) and characterized by an increase in spinal reflexes and by the appearance of involuntary sustained muscle contractions or spasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>) often triggered by innocuous sensory stimuli or muscle stretch.</p><p>At the premotor neuron level appearance of spasms has been hypothesized to be related to an increased gain in sensory signaling to motor neurons caused by a reduced pre-synaptic inhibition of sensory afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia and Rymer, 2005</xref>), an alteration in the efficacy of spinal inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crone et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shefner et al., 1992</xref>), or a shift from a hyperpolarizing to a depolarizing action of the inhibitory synaptic inputs onto motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>). At the motor neuron level the development of spasms has been linked to the increased expression of plateau potentials – carried by voltage-gated persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents – allowing motor neurons to sustain tonic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eken et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn and Eken, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2010</xref>). However, all behaviorally relevant motor activities require excitatory drive to orchestrate the generation, maintenance and termination of motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hägglund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), leading to the possibility that muscle spasms may be the result of aberrant spinal excitatory drive to motor neurons. Indeed long-lasting excitatory postsynaptic potentials may be detected in motor neurons during sustained motor responses in chronic spinalized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brumovsky, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, whether activity in interneurons is involved in initiating, maintaining, and terminating spasms is unknown.</p><p>To address these issues we have developed a chronic spinal cord mouse model that mimics aspects of SCI and offers the possibility to combine detailed electrophysiological and imaging studies of both motor neurons and neurotransmitter-defined populations of interneurons to directly monitor and perturb their activity during muscle spasms. The approach builds on a chronic spinal cord model developed in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1999</xref>) that targets a transection to the sacral segment of the spinal cord thereby producing spasms in the tail muscles without affecting limb muscles or bowel and bladder functions. We find an increased but graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons, which alone does not account for spontaneous and sensory-evoked spasms. However, optical imaging in chronically spinal cord transected mice unmasked persistent neural activity in spinal interneurons with distinct spatiotemporal relationship during muscle spasms. Optogenetic activation and inactivation of spinal excitatory interneurons causally linked their activity to the triggering and maintenance of the spasms. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation of spinal inhibitory interneurons revealed a functional inhibition that played a role in sculpturing and curtailing muscle spasms.</p><p>Our study reveals a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for muscle spasms after chronic spinal cord transection whereby assemblies of excitatory interneurons are recruited into functional circuits by weak sensory inputs, generating persistent excitatory activity that drives motor neurons even if inhibition is still functionally active. Accordingly, our study shifts the widely held view that muscle spasms after SCI are the result of increased motor neuron excitability and reduced spinal inhibition acting as a source of excitation. It therefore provides new directions for treatment of spasms after SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Appearance of spasms in tail muscles after chronic spinal cord transection in mice</title><p>We generated a mouse model of SCI with a transection at the second segment of the sacral spinal cord, affecting just tail muscles.

The relationship between the stimulus strength and the amplitude of the H-reflex is plotted in the two panels below (mean ± S.D). The threshold for the H-reflex (T) was estimated as the lowest stimulus strength necessary to elicit the monosynaptic response. All other stimulus strengths are expressed as multiples of this strength. In both acutely (N = 7) and chronically spinal cord transected mice (N = 10) the H-reflex (green trace) had a lower threshold than the M-wave (blue trace) caused by the direct antidromic activation of muscles. As the stimulus strength increased the H-reflex was smaller in both cases similar to what has been reported in H-reflex studies. Notably, in chronically spinal cord transected mice the rise of the H-reflex was steeper (slope of straight line to fit the rising part, chronically transected = 66.25 versus acutely transected = 47.93, Spearman r test, p&lt;0.0001) suggesting that motor neurons were hyper-excitable. Moreover, in chronically spinal cord transected mice the polysynaptic responses (red traces) were shifted to much lower stimulus thresholds in chronically spinal cord transected than in acutely spinal cord transected mice (paired T-test, p&lt;0.05), indicating hyper-excitability in interneuron circuits.

However, since the trans-genetic approach is likely to labeled Vglut2 expressing afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brumovsky, 2013</xref>), there is a possibility that such terminals will also be stimulated by the light, possibly contributing to the activation of intraspinal circuits. To evaluate this possibility we recorded the dorsal root potentials both in acutely and chronically spinalized mice. These recordings showed that light stimulation indeed led to antidromic activation of afferents, but that this activation was short-lasting (20–50 ms) and only present in the beginning of the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref></xref>). These experiments exclude that the dominant effect of light stimulation on spasm generation originates from the activation of Vglut2<sup>+</sup> afferents since neither persistent firing of the Vglut2 terminals nor persistent dorsal root reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos et al., 2011</xref>) were seen.</p><p>To further substantiate that glutamatergic spinal circuits support muscle spasms after chronic spinal cord transection, we performed optogenetic inactivation of eINs in <italic>Vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>; R26 eNpHR3-YFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>).

This inhibitory effect was not due to inhibition of neurotransmitter release from all afferents since the monosynaptic inputs to motor neurons were intact during the co-incident electrical and light stimulation (compare insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DII–III</xref>) and the recorded dorsal-root-evoked potentials were reduced by less than 10% during light illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, evidence that the spasms are the results of the recruitment of spinal eINs in several spinal segments comes from experiments where the optogenetic stimulation was delayed with respect to the electric stimulation in the same segment (n = 10, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D<sub>IV</sub></xref>) or was restricted to distant segments from the electrically stimulated segment (n = 15, N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>).

Here we demonstrate that muscle spasms are generated by a combination of persistent activity in sequentially recruited spinal excitatory interneurons that interact with a graded expression of plateau potentials in motor neurons. Moreover, we show that inhibition is functional active and does not drive the spasms.</p><p>Several studies reported the appearance of long-lasting EPSPs at the motor neuron level after chronic spinal cord transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brumovsky, 2013</xref>) but the contribution of the excitatory inputs has been neglected as a direct cause of spasms generation and maintenance. By using a mouse model of chronic spinal cord transection that allows recordings from motor neurons as well as selective visualization and manipulation of identified groups of interneurons, we show the direct involvement of excitatory interneuron populations in generating the spasms. First, motor neurons receive a massive barrage of excitatory inputs during spasms. Second, the temporal dynamics of the excitatory spinal interneuron activity correspond to the spasm generation. Thirdly, light stimulation In <italic>Vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>; ChR2</italic> mice initiated spasms. Although this stimulation may also activate terminals that express Vglut2 this activation was short-lasting, suggesting a substantial contribution from eINs activation to spasm generation. Finally, the absence or the severe reduction of spasms when eINs were optogenetically inhibited suggested a necessary role of eINs that could not be substituted by direct monosynaptic activation of motor neurons mediated by Vglut1 expression primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brumovsky, 2013</xref>). All together these experiments suggest a pivotal role of eINs in triggering and sustaining the persistent neural activity. Importantly, the sustained activity was not generated by excitatory persistent dorsal root reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos et al., 2011</xref>). Such prolonged effects were not elicited neither by electrical nor optogenetic stimulation in the present study.</p><p>With respect to motor neurons our study complement previous studies using a chronic spinal cord transection model of the sacral spinal cord in rats which showed a graded expression of plateau properties in motor neurons below the transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1999</xref>). The plateau properties are generated by persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Bennett, 2003</xref>), whose manifestations are regulated by constitutively opened 5-HT receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2010</xref>) or 5-HT released from cells in the spinal cord containing the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wienecke et al., 2014</xref>). Our study also shows that motor plateau properties are more prevalent after chronic spinal cord transection, and the degree of expression of these properties matches the firing pattern of individual motor neurons during spasms. However, similar to what has been reported in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2001b</xref>) we find that only about 10% of the motor neurons express full plateau potentials needed to support sustained firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiehn et al., 1996</xref>) after chronic spinal cord transection. The majority of motor neurons expressed partial plateau properties, characterized by membrane properties that will promote but not by themselves sustain prolonged firing in the absence of synaptic inputs. Together, these findings underscore the contribution of these biophysical properties to prolonged firing in motor neurons after SCI but make it unlikely that motor neuron plateau properties are the main carrier of spasms.</p><p>Alteration in inhibitory circuits after SCI has been described in multiple studies as a result of reduced presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee and Chakravarty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), reduced reciprocal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee and Chakravarty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>) and down-regulation of the KCC2 chloride-transporter in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulenguez et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, our findings explicitly demonstrate that the activity of iINs is increased after chronic spinal cord transection with no sign of a decreased efficacy of inhibitory inputs onto motor neurons. The presence of a silent period preceding electrically-evoked spasm suggested that inhibition was still activated by sensory stimulation and it was able to suppress motor neuron responses. Furthermore, the optogenetic activation of iINs in the sacral spinal cord was able to suppress spasms and all motor responses after chronic spinal cord transection. In contrast, iINs were not able to generate and/or maintain the persistent neural activity driving MNs during muscle spasms as revealed by optogenetic stimulation both in vivo and in vitro, showing that inhibition is not reverted to depolarizing IPSPs that triggers motor output. So the functional role of inhibition is to sculpture and terminate the prolonged spasms. Our study therefore shifts the focus away from a decreased inhibition as a cause of spasm generation and reassigns to iINs a key functional role in shaping the temporal expression of muscle spasms and its termination.</p><p>Profound changes at the network as well as at the single cell level appear in the chronic state of SCI in humans as well as in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maier and Schwab, 2006</xref>). Our study represents the first investigation where the functional impact of these changes has been directly tested, revealing insights about the operational logic of spinal circuits after injury. The appearance of persistent activity in spinal circuits may emerge from changes in network properties and/or biophysical properties of the spinal INs after transection. Indeed, the number of cells responding to low-threshold dorsal root stimulation appeared to be much higher after chronic spinal cord transection. Possible explanations for this are that proprioceptive afferents – whose activity is important for motor recovery after spinal cord transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>) – provide stronger activation of excitatory neurons due to intraspinal sprouting of proprioceptive afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</xref>) or due to reduced presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kathe et al., 2016</xref>). The increased activity of excitatory interneurons may also engage mechanisms of feed-forward and/or recurrent excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbinanti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang, 2001</xref>). Feed-forward circuits among excitatory neurons may be recruited by the chronic spinal cord transection as a result of intraspinal sprouting. Moreover, since the populations of eINs were activated more than once, recurrent excitatory loops may develop or be released after the transection. Finally, plateau potentials or voltage dependent amplification due to the presence of persistent inward currents in interneurons is also likely to be involved. Previous experiments have shown that interneurons in dorsal and ventral horns may express plateau properties before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbinanti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Derjean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russo and Hounsgaard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theiss et al., 2007</xref>) and after chronic spinal cord transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dougherty and Hochman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Husch et al., 2012</xref>). The mouse model offers future possibilities to selectively manipulate these properties in interneurons to understand the impact of such currents on the operation of the spinal network after SCI.</p><p>The clinical treatment of spasms relies mostly on drugs acting on GABA receptors suppressing motor responses at the premotor neuronal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dietz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2004b</xref>). The nature of the changes underlying chronic spinal cord transection, we described here, opens up new understandings and potential new targets in treating the maladaptive state of spinal circuits after SCI. Some of the most promising pharmacological approaches for the therapeutic management of traumatic SCI seem to exert their main motor effect through a silencing of glutamatergic transmission, like riluzole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</xref>), and the different blockers of the serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed selective interference with glutamatergic transmission could open the possibility to dampen the persistent activity in excitatory circuits, leaving the inhibitory ones intact, as obtained with drugs currently used for antiepileptic treatment and off target for chronic pain treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Landmark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sills, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Wild-type mice of both sexes were used (4–6 months old, weight: 23 g ± 1.9, body length 8.2 cm ±0.3, mean ± SD).

Before surgery animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and eye ointment was applied to protect the eyes form de-hydration. Deep anesthesia was confirmed when reflexes and tail pinch responses were absent. The second sacral segment (S2) was localized at the level of the second lumbar (L2) vertebral body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>). The back of the animal was shaved and sodium iodine was applied to prevent infection. A vertical incision was made in the skin in over the spinous process of the L2 vertebral body and the muscles were cut with small eye scissor to localize the Ligamentum Flavum between the rostral part of the L2 vertebral body and the caudal part of the L1 vertebral body. Once the spinal cord was clearly visible, Xilocaine (1%) was applied locally on S2 before the tissue was aspirated with a small glass pipette (diameter of 100 µm), connected to a vacuum pump. Care was taken not to severe the dorsal and ventral arteries, which provide blood supply to the spinal cord below the transection. When the transection was visually seen to be complete, the muscles surrounding the spinal column were sutured to close the opening above the damaged spinal cord and to protect it from mechanical pressure. Then the skin was sutured and the animal was allowed to recover. Animals were given post-surgery treatment of Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/Kg) and Carprofen (5 mg/Kg) subcutaneously for 2 to 5 days. The injury only affects the tail muscles with no bladder or hindlimb involvement. However, animals were followed twice a day for the first week for signs of infection or change in body weight. Infections were treated with antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy (Tribrissen, subcutaneous for 5 days).

This normalization process was applied to all the INs considered in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Drugs</title><p>Picrotoxin (10 µM; Sigma), strychnine (1 µM; Sigma), mephenesin (1 mM; Sigma), and Kynurenic acid (0.5–1 mM; Sigma) were bath-applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and cellular counts</title><p>The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in Phosphate-Buffer-Saline (PBS). The sacral spinal cord was removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, rinsed in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS overnight and cryo-embedded in OCT mounting medium. Transverse sections of the spinal cord (20 µm) were obtained using a cryostat. Sections were incubated for 24 hr at 4°C with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum and 0.5% Triton X-100: chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs 1020; 1:2000), rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, Rockland 600-401-379). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson or Invitrogen and incubated at 1:400 for 4 hr at room temperature. A fluorescent Nissl staining (NeuroTrace Blue 1:200, Life Technology) was added during the secondary antibody incubation. Slides were rinsed and mounted in Vectashield medium and scanned on a LSM5 confocal microscope (Zeiss Microsystems) using x20 or x40 objectives. Multiple channels were scanned sequentially to prevent fluorescence bleed through and false-positive signals. A contrast enhancement and a noise reduction filter were applied in Adobe Photoshop for publication images. Fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescence labeling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgius et al., 2010</xref>) using a Vglut2 probe spanning the base pairs 540–983 (produced by Dr. L. Borgius). Neurons were counted on the left and right side of the spinal cord slice, using raw z-stack confocal images obtained with a 20x objective and spanning the entire thickness of the sections. Counts were done manually with the help of the cell-counter plug-in in ImageJ, in three non-adjacent sections per mice (N = 3). Cellular counts per section were expressed as a percentage of glutamatergic cells (Vglut2 mRNA positive) expressing GCaMP3’ per individual animal. A grand-mean ± standard deviation (SD) was calculated across animals to produce bar-graphs for the different strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Optogenetic stimulation</title><p>Conditional transgenic mice expressing Channelrhodopsin2 or enhanced Halorhodpsin-3 were crossed with <italic>Vglut2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> or <italic>VIAAT<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>In vivo experiments</title><p>Optical fibers for in vivo stimulation of spinal neurons were implanted as previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caggiano et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, a laminectomy at the third lumbar spinal vertebra was performed to expose the first segment of the coccygeal spinal cord. Small metal bars were used to clamp the vertebrae and kept in place by a mounting plate. The plate had a central opening over the spinal cord. The central opening was filled with silicone elastomer (World Precision Instruments). A cannula, maintained with a cannula holder on a stereotactic frame, was slowly lowered to 200 µm above the surface of the spinal cord at the level of the midline. The cannula was then secured by means of cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic and covered with a dust cap. The skin was sutured and the animal was allowed to recover. In vivo stimulation of spinal neurons was then performed connecting an optical fiber to the cannula with the animal: a) in a mouse restrainer (see previous section about EMGs) to evaluated and quantify the tail muscle responses with EMGs, or b) in a corridor with simultaneous high frequency camera acquisition (MotoRaterapparatus, TSE-Systems) to evaluate the overall behavioral response. Stimulations of ChR2 or eNpHR3 positive cells were obtained using a 473 nm or a 550 nm laser scanning system (UGA-40; Rapp Optoelectronic) triggered by Master 8, AMPI to deliver trains of stimuli (20 ms pulse duration, 10 Hz frequencies, and train durations of 1.5 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>In vitro experiments</title><p>Stimulation of the dorsal root and recording of dorsal and ventral roots were performed as previously described simultaneously with the optogenetic stimulation of ChR2 or eNpHR3 positive cells obtained with a 473 nm or a 550 nm laser scanning system (UGA-40; Rapp Optoelectronic) to illuminate with an intensity around 30 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> as measured with a laser power meter (Coherent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn Hochman (Reviewer #1); Robert M Brownstone (Reviewer #2); Aya Takeoka (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present work identifies a clear role for premotor neuronal networks in the generation of persistent motor activity generating muscle spasms after spinal cord transection. Insights provided profoundly alter our conceptual understanding of spinal cord transection-induced motor spasms and will undoubtedly lead to new avenues of exploration in the area of clinical therapeutics. The experimental work leverages a powerful sacral spinal cord/tail animal model of motor spasms with genetic crosses in transgenic mice to undertake high throughput assessment of the role of spinal excitatory (vGluT2) and inhibitory (VIAAT) interneurons and includes imaging of their activity with the genetically encoded calcium indicator (Cre-dependent GCaMP3) and their selective activation or inhibition with light activated CHR2 or Halorhodopsin. The work provides fundamentally novel insights at many levels into the neural phenomenon and putative neural circuits underlying spinal cord transection-induced motor spasms. The study is presented with clarity and does an exceptional job of parsing and relating temporal activity in inhibitory and excitatory interneurons to the expression of persistent motor activity. There are some concerns that should be addressed to make the conclusions of the paper strong and clarify some issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns that should be addressed to make the conclusions of the paper strong and clarify some issues.</p><p>1) There are possible confounding issues with the experimental design that could impact interpretation/circuit dissection of events leading the generation of persistent motor activity. These are related to; (i) lack of consideration of genetic approaches in vGluT2 populations also including activation and or inhibition of afferents axons, (ii) lack of consideration of a contribution from spiking activity in afferents (e.g. evoked dorsal root reflexes initiated by actions from inhibitory interneurons), and (iii) lack of certainty that optogenetic actions on inhibitory interneurons is able to activate or inhibit sufficient population of interneurons generating the silent period. At the very least, these limitations need to be considered in the discussion.</p><p>One important control that should be performed is to show that optical excitation in vGluT2::CHR2 mice is only recruiting excitatory interneurons. Thus, in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> panels using vglut2-cre mice, it is possible that optical illumination may also recruit (CHR2) or inhibit recruitment (halo) vGluT2<sup>+</sup> primary afferents directly. One simple control experiment is undertaking the usual optical cord illumination in vgltu2::CHR2 mice but this time while recording in an adjacent dorsal root. This could be done in uninjured mouse without much added effort. Absence or presence in dorsal root recordings of time-locked antidromic spikes would determine whether they are or are not also directly activating intraspinal afferent axons. If they are, this needs to be integrated into the paper, because right now the authors are assuming the optical stimulus only activates (or inhibits) excitatory interneurons. If this experiment isn't to be be performed, the authors should justify why (e.g. perhaps these controls have already been done in other experiments using these mice).</p><p>The need for this control arises, for example in Figure 6D3, if some vGluT2<sup>+</sup> primary afferents are recruited by the electrical stimulus, and they are also hyperpolarized by the optical stimulus, then pairing them could have prevented recruitment of this subpopulation of afferents. In this manner, lack of observed response may be not due to hyperpolarization of excitatory interneurons but to reduced recruitment of afferents initiating the response.</p><p>If the authors do such a control experiment and illuminate spinal cord as always in vGluT2::CHR2 mice and see no direct antidromic recruitment in recordings from the dorsal root, this would strongly support their untested presumption that optical actions in vglut2-cre mice result exclusively from changing the excitability of excitatory interneurons.</p><p>2) Some aspects of the presentation should be clarified and some of the conclusions scaled back a bit. A primary concern is the use of the term &quot;SCI&quot;. The authors have done spinal cord transections – not &quot;true&quot; models of SCI (clip, drop weight, etc). They should be clear about using a spinal transection model (which is the appropriate model to use for the study), and refer to transection and not SCI throughout the manuscript (including the title).</p><p>Secondly, in the Abstract the authors say they &quot;directly target all major classes of spinal interneurons&quot; – there is no reason to say this. This led the reviewers to think that the authors were going to study each class independently. What they have done is to look at excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The claim thus seems to overreach.</p><p>Thirdly, it is questionable about whether or not this is a &quot;new model&quot; – technically it is because it's in the mouse, but Bennett developed this model in the rat, and has been using it for decades. So it's more of an extension of a model. This claim of novelty should be scaled back.</p><p>3) The authors did not systematically follow spontaneous vs sensory induced spasm. Analyses were often skewed to sensory induced spasm and reasons were not given clearly why.</p><p>4) The authors should address whether spontaneous activity in primary afferents is responsible for the persistent activation of excitatory interneurons. This could be entertained as a possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>5) The authors should consider the potential connectivity rearrangements of primary afferents after injury may contribute to spasm.</p><p>6) The authors should address the possible contribution of &quot;partial plateau potentials&quot; in motoneurons to the spasms, and should be cautious about completely excluding these properties as playing a role.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23011.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are some concerns that should be addressed to make the conclusions of the paper strong and clarify some issues.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There are possible confounding issues with the experimental design that could impact interpretation/circuit dissection of events leading the generation of persistent motor activity.

At the very least, these limitations need to be considered in the discussion.</italic> </p><p>These are all valid points and we thank the reviewer(s) for bringing them up. We have addressed these issues in a number of ways including a more cautious writing, incorporating discussion of possibilities that we stimulate afferents, clarification of the text, and further experiments as outlined below and in response to individual reviewers comments.</p><p><italic>(i) lack of consideration of genetic approaches in vGluT2 populations also including activation and or inhibition of afferents axons,</italic> </p><p>We recognize these issues. Using a transgenetic approach, as here, we will label Vglut2 expressing primary afferents that might also be stimulated by light. Experimentally we cannot completely exclude that possibility.</p><p>We have, however, done new experiments with recordings of the dorsal root potential during light stimulation. The experiments show that optogenetic stimulation of the dorsal root alone with a long pulse (1.5 second) generates a short-lasting antidromic activation of the dorsal root (about 30-50 ms long) despite a longer motor response appeared in the ventral root which in in acutely spinalized animals lasted as long as the stimulation and in chronically spinalized mice evoked a prolonged activity corresponding to a spasm (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These experiments exclude that a persistent activation of afferents cause the persistent activation of excitatory interneurons, inhibitory interneurons or motor neurons and also suggest that the light-activation of afferents may contribute but not be the main mechanism of spasms.</p><p>With regard to inhibition of Vglut2 expressing terminals with halorhodopsin, there are a number of observations from the present study that suggest this is not the primary cause of the reduction of the spasms.</p><p>1) The monosynaptic input to motor neurons elicited by electric stimulation of the dorsal root is the same with and without optogenetic inhibition of Vglut2 terminals (Figure 6DII-III insets), showing that there is still primary afferent excitation to the spinal network at least from the proprioceptive fibers.</p><p>2) We recorded the dorsal root during electric stimulation only and during simultaneous optogenetic inhibition of Vglut2 (as suggested by reviewer 1, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). We see a less that 10% decrease in the evoked dorsal root responses due to optogenetic inhibition.</p><p>3) Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of Vglut2 cells can still inhibit development of spasms even when it is delivered after the termination of the stimulation (Figure 6CIV and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F-G</xref>).</p><p>4) Lastly, if we electrically stimulate the dorsal root of a segment distant from the optogenetic stimulation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-G), we also see a complete suppression or a reduction of spasms, confirming that spasms are based on a polysynaptic spinal network involving Vglut2 cells.</p><p><italic>(ii) lack of consideration of a contribution from spiking activity in afferents (e.g. evoked dorsal root reflexes initiated by actions from inhibitory interneurons), and</italic></p><p>We have performed dorsal root recordings both in acutely and chronically spinal cord transected mice. We do see spike activity in the dorsal root after each stimulus, but it only last about 40 ms after in the beginning of the stimulus (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and never after this short-lasting activation. We are therefore convinced that prolonged firing of afferent fibers and/or dorsal root reflexes do not sustain the prolonged activity in excitatory neurons during spasms.</p><p> <italic>(iii) lack of certainty that optogenetic actions on inhibitory interneurons is able to activate or inhibit sufficient population of interneurons generating the silent period.</italic> </p><p>We do not have any direct evidence that we recruit the same number of inhibitory interneurons with electrical and optogenetic stimulation (and this is true for every study that use electric vs optogenetic approaches to drive cell firing). Presently, with the available transgenic approach we have no way of imaging (with GCaMP3’) and optogenetic stimulating (using ChR2) inhibitory neurons because imaging and stimulation use the same wavelengths. In small scale (less than 50 neurons) this can be done with viral approaches; experiments that are outside the scope of this study. The fact that optogenetic stimulation is working suggests that we activate a sizable number of inhibitory neurons. The fact that we inhibited inhibitory neurons responsible for the silent period is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> that shows phase advance of the spasm when the inhibition is suppressed in the silent period, similar to what happens when the inhibition is removed with drugs. We cannot think of any other experiments to show that more directly. Notable the activity of inhibitory neurons matches time-wise the silent period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Both the monosynaptic input and the polysynaptic input during the stimulation is reduced, possibly through presynaptic inhibition of low threshold afferents. This is part of the effect that we want to show. Moreover, we also show that inhibition is active and able to terminate the ongoing spasm. We think that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that clearly. Finally, activation of iINs does not trigger premature spasms.</p><p><italic>One important control that should be performed is to show that optical excitation in vGluT2::CHR2 mice is only recruiting excitatory interneurons. Thus, in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref> panels using vglut2-cre mice, it is possible that optical illumination may also recruit (CHR2) or inhibit recruitment (halo) vGluT2<sup>+</sup> primary afferents directly. One simple control experiment is undertaking the usual optical cord illumination in vgltu2::CHR2 mice but this time while recording in an adjacent dorsal root. This could be done in uninjured mouse without much added effort. Absence or presence in dorsal root recordings of time-locked antidromic spikes would determine whether they are or are not also directly activating intraspinal afferent axons. If they are, this needs to be integrated into the paper, because right now the authors are assuming the optical stimulus only activates (or inhibits) excitatory interneurons. If this experiment isn't to be be performed, the authors should justify why (e.g. perhaps these controls have already been done in other experiments using these mice).</italic> </p><p>As stated above we have now done these controls (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). There is activation of intraspinal afferent axons – but only for a very short period. The reverse experiments indicate a necessity for timed activity in eINs to activate the spasms (also supported by their activity and the recorded EPSCs/EPSPs in motor neurons during the spasm).</p><p><italic>The need for this control arises, for example in Figure 6D3, if some vGluT2<sup>+</sup> primary afferents are recruited by the electrical stimulus, and they are also hyperpolarized by the optical stimulus, then pairing them could have prevented recruitment of this subpopulation of afferents. In this manner, lack of observed response may be not due to hyperpolarization of excitatory interneurons but to reduced recruitment of afferents initiating the response.</italic> </p><p><italic>If the authors do such a control experiment and illuminate spinal cord as always in vGluT2::CHR2 mice and see no direct antidromic recruitment in recordings from the dorsal root, this would strongly support their untested presumption that optical actions in vglut2-cre mice result exclusively from changing the excitability of excitatory interneurons.</italic> </p><p>The above points address these issues.</p><p><italic>2) Some aspects of the presentation should be clarified and some of the conclusions scaled back a bit. A primary concern is the use of the term &quot;SCI&quot;. The authors have done spinal cord transections – not &quot;true&quot; models of SCI (clip, drop weight, etc). They should be clear about using a spinal transection model (which is the appropriate model to use for the study), and refer to transection and not SCI throughout the manuscript (including the title).</italic> </p><p>We agree with this point and have changed the wording to transection that is more correct. We believe that the point raised here by the reviewers is extremely important in the field. We would like to point out thought that SCI is used many studies even after complete transection (e.g. Boulenguez et all., Nature Medicine, 2010 and Murray et all., Nature Medicine, 2010) and the field will definitely benefit from a clear definition of terms to indicate the specific type of lesions (transection vs spinal cord injury) as well as clear indication of the model (acute vs chronic and neonatal vs adult). This will help to specifically relate the interpretation of the results to the models used in the study.</p><p><italic>Secondly, in the Abstract the authors say they &quot;directly target all major classes of spinal interneurons&quot; – there is no reason to say this. This led the reviewers to think that the authors were going to study each class independently. What they have done is to look at excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The claim thus seems to overreach.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the word ‘all’.</p><p><italic>Thirdly, it is questionable about whether or not this is a &quot;new model&quot; – technically it is because it's in the mouse, but Bennett developed this model in the rat, and has been using it for decades. So it's more of an extension of a model. This claim of novelty should be scaled back.</italic> </p><p>We do not completely understand this critique since we used the word only in the Abstract to indicate a “new” mouse model. Clearly Bennett generated the transection model of the sacral cord in the rat to study spasticity and plateau potentials, which was probably inspired by two studies: 1) the plateau potential work in Hultborn’s lab in cats after chronic spinal cord transection (Eken et al. 1999) and 2) the tail transection model first developed by Ritz et al. 1992 in cat.</p><p>However, we have removed the word ‘new’. We actually now (and in the previous version) explicitly give credit to the previous rat model in the Introduction: “To address these issues we have developed a chronic spinal cord mouse model that mimics aspects of SCI and offers the possibility to combine detailed electrophysiological and imaging studies of both motor neurons and neurotransmitter-defined populations of interneurons to directly monitor and perturb their activity during muscle spasms. The approach builds on an chronic spinal cord model developed in the rat (Bennett et al., 1999) that targets a transection to the sacral segment of the spinal cord thereby producing spasms in tail muscles without affecting limb muscles or bowel and bladder functions.”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors did not systematically follow spontaneous vs sensory induced spasm. Analyses were often skewed to sensory induced spasm and reasons were not given clearly why. Some of the Minor comments of Reviewer 3 address this issue.</italic> </p><p>We mostly used the sensory induced spasms to investigate the neural circuits that generate them after chronic transection because sensory induced spasms allowed a better control for quantification of the observed effect. We go a long way to demonstrate that the spontaneous spasms in vivoand in vitroshare the same characteristics as the sensory evoked spasms and we have no reasons to believe that the underlying neuronal mechanisms should be different.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should address whether spontaneous activity in primary afferents is responsible for the persistent activation of excitatory interneurons. This could be entertained as a possibility in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have recorded from dorsal roots during sensory evoke spasms. We do not see maintained dorsal root activity. We now mention that in the text and have added a Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should consider the potential connectivity rearrangements of primary afferents after injury may contribute to spasm.</italic> </p><p>We aim at addressing these issues, which is not straight-forward, in future studies. However we introduce potential involvement of primary afferent reorganization in the Discussion:</p><p>“The appearance of persistent activity in spinal circuits may emerge from changes in network properties and/or biophysical properties of the spinal INs after transection. Indeed, the number of cells responding to low threshold dorsal root stimulation appeared to be much higher after chronic spinal cord transection. Possible explanations for this are that proprioceptive afferents – whose activity is important for motor recovery after spinal cord transection (Takeoaka et al. 2014; Turkay et al. 2014)- provide stronger activation of excitatory neurons due to intraspinal sprouting of proprioceptive afferents (Krenz and Weaver 1998) or due to reduced presynaptic inhibition (Kathe et al. 2016). The increased activity of excitatory interneurons may also engage mechanisms of feed-forward and/or recurrent excitation (Abbinanti et al., 2012; Wang, 2001). Feed-forward circuits among excitatory neurons may be recruited by the chronic spinal cord transection as a result of intraspinal sprouting. Moreover, since populations of eINs were activated more than once, recurrent excitatory loops may develop or be released after the transection. Finally, plateau potentials or voltage dependent amplification due to the presence of persistent inward currents in interneurons is also likely to be involved. Previous experiments have shown that interneurons in dorsal and ventral horns may express plateau properties before (Abbinanti et al., 2012; Derjean et al., 2003; Russo and Hounsgaard, 1994; Theiss et al., 2007) and after chronic spinal cord transection (Dougherty and Hochman, 2008; Husch et al., 2012). The mouse model offers future possibilities to selectively manipulate these properties in interneurons to understand the impact of such currents on the operation of the spinal network after SCI”.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should address the possible contribution of &quot;partial plateau potentials&quot; in motoneurons to the spasms, and should be cautious about completely excluding these properties as playing a role.</italic>We agree with this comment and realize that we were too categorical in the previous version. We have qualified the description and specifically mention the contribution of the graded expression of these properties to spasms in the, Abstract, Results and Discussion. We retain, however, that the motor neuronplateau properties, although important, may play a less pronounced role in spasm generation than previously proposed. This does not exclude that plateau properties in interneurons play a role for spasm generation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
