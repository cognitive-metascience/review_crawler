mediated by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein are important topics. Although accumulating evidence indicates the importance of deubiquitination enzymes (DUBs) in innate immunity, it is unknown if they participate in A3G stability. Here, we found that USP49 directly interacts with A3G and efficiently removes ubiquitin, consequently increasing A3G protein expression and significantly enhancing its anti-HIV-1 activity. Unexpectedly, A3G degradation was also mediated by a Vif- and cullin-ring-independent pathway, which was effectively counteracted by USP49. Furthermore, clinical data suggested that USP49 is correlated with A3G protein expression and hypermutations in Vif-positive proviruses, and inversely with the intact provirus ratio in the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Our studies demonstrated a mechanism to effectively stabilize A3G expression, which could comprise a target to control HIV-1 infection and eradicate the latent reservoir.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>USP49</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>APOBEC3G</kwd><kwd>Vif</kwd><kwd>deubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Special Research Program of China for Important Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10302103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Special Research Program of China for Important Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017ZX10202102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Key Program 81730060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The International Collaboration Program of the Natural Science Foundation of China and the US NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81561128007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Joint-Innovation Program in Healthcare for Special Scientific Research Projects of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201803040002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201704020226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009334</institution-id><institution>Pearl River S and T Nova Program of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201806010118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>USP49 can increase A3G protein expression and enhance its anti-HIV-1 activity, which is also correlated with hypermutations and affects the HIV-1 latent reservoir.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human apolipoprotein-B-mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) is a member of the cellular polynucleotide cytidine deaminase family. It can be incorporated into <italic>vif</italic>-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) virions and mediates C–U conversion in the newly synthesized minus-stranded HIV-1 DNA to trigger the breakage of viral DNA or the generation of G-to A lethal hypermutations, resulting in a premature stop codon or mutated viral protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mangeat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheehy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Alternatively, A3G can physically block the reverse transcription process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwatani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pollpeter et al., 2018</xref>). Because of these combined effects, A3G exerts potent antiviral activity. Meanwhile, it also induces sub-lethal hypermutations, which would not significantly impair viral infectivity but indicate an important driving force for HIV-1 genetic variations. This ultimately aids in viral evolution or facilitates viral responses to selective pressures such as the development of antiviral drug resistance or the evasion of immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jern et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). However, the HIV-1 accessory protein viral infectivity factor (Vif) can effectively antagonize the antiviral activity of A3G by inducing its degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mehle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheehy et al., 2003</xref>). Vif interacts with A3G through its N-terminal domain and has a SOCS-box motif within its C-terminal domain, which recruits ElonginB, ElonginC, and Cullin5 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, subsequently mediating the ubiquitination of A3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). CBF-β can increase the stability of HIV-1 Vif and promote assembly of the Vif-Cullin 5-E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jäger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Further, some clinical in vivo analyses of Vif-positive HIV-1 quasispecies indicated that A3G mediates lethal hypermutations and leads to the accumulation of G-to-A hypermutations in the Vif-positive HIV-1 genome, subsequently resulting in a large number of defective proviruses in the viral reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borzooee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Pasquale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kieffer et al., 2005</xref>). The expression level of A3G is also correlated with viremia and CD4 counts in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amoêdo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kourteva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pace et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ulenga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vázquez-Pérez et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, partial mutations in the <italic>vif</italic> gene can impair its anti-A3G activity and increase the frequency of hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fourati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The homeostasis of eukaryotic cells is maintained by a well-tuned balance between the biosynthesis and degradation of proteins. Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and their degradation by the UPS has emerged as a major regulatory process in virtually all aspects of cell biology. The UPS comprises the main non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that consists of three major components, the proteasome holoenzymes, a number of ubiquitin ligases, and a broad spectrum of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey-Elkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ventii and Wilkinson, 2008</xref>). Ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process, and it has become increasingly apparent that deubiquitination also has an important function in regulating the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. However, In contrast to extensive studies on ubiquitination, the roles that deubiquitination play in host–virus relationships are less investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey-Elkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nijman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to host DUBs, which play an important role in the maintenance of innate or acquired immunity, virus-encoded DUBs also affect the immune system to support their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumari and Kumar, 2018</xref>). Recently, some reports have indicated that DUBs directly bind viral proteins and affect their functions. For example, USP7 interacts with the Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) of Epstein-Barr virus and the ubiquitin E3 ligase ICP0 of the herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) to affect viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holowaty et al., 2003</xref>). It also interacts with HIV-1 Tat and stabilizes this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>). Further, a USP14 inhibitor was found to inhibit the replication of Dengue viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nag and Finley, 2012</xref>), whereas USP11 can interact with NP protein to inhibit influenza virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2010</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms and their interactions with the USP have not been well elucidated.</p><p>Although the involvement of UPS in Vif-mediated A3G degradation is well known, whether DUB proteins participate in this important host-virus interaction is completely unknown. In this study, we screened a DUB-targeting siRNA library and found that USP49 participates in the stability of A3G protein. Further, we aimed to elucidate the association between USP49 and A3G in the presence of Vif, which could occur during natural HIV-1 infection. Our findings provide important insights into the role of USP49 in Vif-mediated A3G degradation. By enhancing the expression of A3G protein, USP49 exerts potent anti-HIV-1 activity and is involved in the generation of defective proviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening of a DUB-RNAi library identifies that USP18/41/49 regulates the expression of APOBEC3G</title><p>The human genome encodes approximately 100 putative DUBs. Based on the composition in relation to the catalytic motif, DUBs can be grouped into at least five subfamilies as follows: the ubiquitin-specific proteases/ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (USPs), the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs), the Josephin or Machado-Joseph disease protein domain proteases (MJDs), and the Jab1/MPN domain-associated metalloisopeptidase (JAMM) domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nijman et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We purchased a DUB siRNA library targeting 86 DUB genes and developed a cell-based high throughput system to screen DUB proteins that participate in the stability of an A3G-GFP fusion protein in 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After two rounds of screening, we identified siRNAs specifically for USP18, USP41, or USP49 that could facilitate Vif-mediated A3G degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).To further validate our screening results, we subsequently used DUB-specific siRNAs to knock down the expression of DUBs and co-transfected these with A3G-HA- and Vif-HA-expressing plasmids. After 48 hr, we performed a western blot to confirm that these DUBs could counteract Vif-mediated A3G degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further, the overexpression of USP18, USP41, or USP49 also supported this result. Among them, USP49 was the most capable of inhibiting this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Considering A3G exerts its antiviral effect in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallois-Montbrun et al., 2007</xref>), we first constructed GFP-tagged DUB proteins. When these GFP-tagged proteins were transfected into HEK293T cells, we found that USP18 and USP41 were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas USP49 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48318.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screening of a DUB-RNAi library identifies that USP 18/41/49 regulates the expression of A3G.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of five DUB subfamilies.

To better understand the interaction between these DUBs and the Vif-A3G pathway, we co-transfected these three plasmids at different amounts into HEK293T cells. The results showed that USP49 significantly suppressed the downregulation of A3G when Vif levels were moderate. However, with an abundance of Vif protein, the protective effect of USP49 was quite limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

After determining the dose-effect relationships among A3G, USP49, and Vif, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, we transfected Vif and A3G at a ratio 1:2. After normalization to HIV-1 p24 antigen for the resulting pseudotyped viruses, TZM-bl cells were infected.

When we transfected Vif and A3G at a ratio 1:1, the overexpression USP49 was found to inhibit HIV-1 infection and the inhibitory effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, we sequenced the target motif of A3G on HIV-1 protease (the prot (nt 2280–2631)) region to detect hypermutations.

After normalization to HIV-1 p24, TZM-bl cells were infected with these viral particles and virus infectivity was determined by luciferase assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, USP49 regulated the infectivity of HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Further, we generated viral particles overexpressing USP49 in the presence or absence of A3G.

Furthermore, we sequenced the proviral DNA in the cultures at the 21 day time point and analyzed the hypermutation with HYPERMUT soft online. We have not found any reversion of the Y40H mutation in the proviral DNA.

This result verifies that the inhibition of USP49 can promote the degradation of A3G and subsequently reduce the hypermutation in virus.These data indicated that the anti-A3G effect of Vif can be enforced by depletion of the A3G protein stabilizer USP49, alternatively supporting the fact that USP49 enhances the anti-HIV-1 effect of A3G.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48318.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>USP49 enhances the inhibitory effect of A3G on the infectivity of HIV-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were first transfected with USP49-specific siRNA.

It has been reported that A3G is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, where it exerts its antiviral effect; interestingly, USP49 was also found to be partly localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed the colocalization of A3G and USP49 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), raising the possibility that USP49 and A3G interact directly. We therefore performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment and found a strong interaction between Flag-USP49 and HA-A3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Meanwhile, HA-tagged A3G also interacted with endogenous USP49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).We have also performed the experiment with RNase A treatment and found that the interaction between A3G and USP49 is direct and not mediated by RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since USP49 is a deubiquitination enzyme, we first examined whether it regulates the level of A3G ubiquitination in cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, overexpression of USP49 resulted in a significant decrease in the poly-ubiquitination of A3G, whereas overexpression of the USP49-C262A mutant, which lost DUB enzymatic activity, failed to alter A3G ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). It is known that ubiquitin contains seven lysine (K) residues including K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63, through which poly-ubiquitin chains are linked to the substrate proteins.

Recently, it has been shown that USP49 interacts with p53, dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSP), or FKBP51 in the nucleus, and consequently suppresses the ubiquitination of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Regarding innate immunity, it can negatively regulate cellular antiviral responses via the deconjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin in STING, an adaptor protein that senses cytoplasmic DNA and is involved in various innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that although USP49 is mainly distributed in the nucleus, it also exists in the cytoplasm. We also revealed a novel function for USP49 in the cytoplasm; specifically, it stabilizes A3G by counteracting Vif-mediated A3G ubiquitination by removing the ubiquitin from A3G. As a result, it significantly enhances the anti-HIV-1 activity of A3G. Our data also verified that its anti-HIV-1 effects are mainly due to the stabilization of A3G.</p><p>By studying the protection of A3G from degradation through DUB knockdown, we unexpectedly found that a Vif-independent degradation pathway for A3G. This pathway occurs via the UPS as MG132 could also block the degradation and ubiquitination of A3G. This phenomenon could explain why there are some ubiquitination sites on A3G that are not located at the C-terminus of A3G and not regulated by Vif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwatani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). We attempted to identify the host E3 protein(s) that could be involved in A3G ubiquitination. At least, we found that the cullin family is not involved, as the inhibitor MLN4924 was ineffective and siRNAs for Cullin1-7 did not affect this process. Further, the depletion of elonginB and elonginC also did not affect the degradation of A3G, which clearly distinguishes this effect from the Vif-dependent degradation pathway.</p><p>It is well known that APOBEC proteins are not only involved in anti-HIV-1 immunity, but also counteract many viruses such as hepatitis B virus, adeno-associated virus, and some herpes viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulliard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Narvaiza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suspène et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). They also play a key role in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esnault et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narvaiza et al., 2012</xref>). Especially, they are involved in the development of mutations in tumors, which is a key factor for tumorigenesis and the development of drug-resistance or the escape from immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Law et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swanton et al., 2015</xref>). It remains largely unknown how APOBEC3 proteins maintain their stability under these conditions. We identified that DUBs prevent the Vif-independent degradation of A3G, showing a new mechanism underlying the regulation of APOBE3 protein expression. Given the importance of the A3G protein and the potential functions of DUBs, future studies hold significant promise to exploit these novel mechanisms and develop therapeutic antiviral or antitumor agents. Nevertheless, considering that there are hundreds of E3 proteins, the identification of the E3 protein required for the Vif-independent degradation of A3G is interesting but beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>The development of A3G-mediated sub-lethal hypermutations in the Vif-positive HIV-1 genome in vitro and in vivo has been widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borzooee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Pasquale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jern et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kieffer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Given that USP49 protects A3G from the Vif-dependent and Vif-independent degradation pathway, it is important to study the possible correlation between USP49 expression and A3G expression, and subsequently HIV-1 disease progression. In this report, we found a correlation between USP49 expression and A3G protein expression in vivo, as well as some important parameters related to HIV-1 disease progression and the components of the viral reservoir, through clinical correlation analysis. Although these data are preliminary, they support the hypothesis that the stabilization of A3G protein could lead to sub-lethal hypermutations or eventually lethal hypermutations in the HIV-1 genome, resulting in the accumulation of defective proviruses. Therefore, USP49 and A3G could comprise a strong driving force to contain the actual viral reservoir. Moreover, our data indicated that the expression of USP49 protein in HIV-1-infected individuals could be used to indicate the quality of defective proviruses and the actual size of the viral reservoir, potentially serving as a possible new biomarker to evaluate the prognosis of HIV-1-infected patients. In summary, our work not only provides a new host antiviral mechanism, but also suggests an important opportunity for the development of new methods to control HIV-1 infection and eradicate the viral reservoir.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

After normalization for HIV-1 p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Clonetech), TZM-bl cells (2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates) were infected with viruses which containing 5 ng of p24 antigen. And then, luciferase enzyme activity was determined at 72 hr post infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo deubiquitination assay</title><p>For the in vivo deubiquitination assay, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-USP49 wild-type (WT) or HA-USP49 with a mutant at Cys 262 to Ala (C262A mutant), Flag-A3G, and Ub-HA. After 2 days, cells were treated with MG132 (10 uM) for 24 hr before being harvested. The cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies for 4 hr at 4°C. Then, the precipitated immunocomplexes were separated by SDS–PAGE and blotted with anti-Ub and anti-A3G antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Peripheral blood for the isolation of primary CD4 cells was obtained from HIV-1-infected individuals. One part of HIV-1-infected individuals had been on cART for at least 12 months and had maintained undetectable HIV-1 viremia (&lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml of plasma). Another part was the newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients with high HIV-1 RNA copies in plasma. All the HIV-1-infected individuals were recruited from Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. Buffy coats derived from the blood of healthy donors were used in in vitro experiments. All human samples were anonymously coded in accordance with the local ethical guidelines (as stipulated by the Declaration of Helsinki). The Ethics Review Board of Sun Yat-Sen University and the Ethics Review Board of Guangzhou 8<sup>th</sup> People’s Hospital approved this study. Written informed consents were provided by all study participants, and the protocol was approved by the IRB of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital (Guangzhou, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Isolation and culture of primary CD4+ T cell and HIV-1 infection</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donors and isolated using Ficoll gradient centrifugation, followed by culturing in the conditioned RPMI 1640 medium. The CD4+ T cells were then isolated by MACS microbead-negative sorting using human CD4+ T cell isolation kit (BD Bioscience). The purity of CD4+ T cell fraction was higher than 95%. Then the CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were activated by 1 μg/ml anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs and 100 U/ml IL-2 for 3 days, followed by infection with HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>, HIV-1<sub>NL4-3VifY40H,</sub> or HIV-1 reporter viruses. The HIV-1 viruses were generated by transfecting 293 T cells with pNL4-3 or pNL4-3 VifY40H. Productive infection was determined by P24 ELISA kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA isolation and real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p>Cellular viral DNA/RNA was isolated from the CD4 T-cells of HIV-1 infected individuals according to the instructions using AllPure DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Magen, R5112-02). Then cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The qRT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using SYBR Green (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and normalized to endogenous actin and GAPDH mRNA levels using gene-specific primers for each target (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Nested RT-PCR and sequencing</title><p>RNA from CD4+ T cells was extracted with an RNase minikit (Qiagen) and used for amplification of viral <italic>vif</italic> or partial <italic>env</italic> genes (V1-V3 region). The first-round PCR was performed using a one-step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), and second-round PCR was performed with High Fidelity Prime Star (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used for this experiment are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. For clonal sequencing, PCR products were TA cloned into the pMD-18 T vector (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and 10 clones were sequenced for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Hypermutation analysis</title><p>The percentages of G-to-A mutations were quantified with online Hypermut software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html">www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rose and Korber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2005</xref>). Virion-associated RNA from viral outgrowth of the same subject was also sequenced as a reference sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA)</title><p>The procedures for IPDA described previously were followed with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruner et al., 2019</xref>). In general, the IPDA is performed on DNA from 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD4+ T cells. Genomic DNA is extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with precautions to avoid excess DNA fragmentation. Quantification of intact, 5’deleted, and 3’deleted and/or hypermutated proviruses was carried out using primer/probe combinations optimized for subtype B HIV-1. The primer/probe mix consists of oligonucleotides for two independent hydrolysis probe reactions that interrogate conserved regions of the HIV-1 genome to discriminate intact from defective proviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). HIV-1 reaction A targets the packaging signal (Ψ) that is a frequent site of small deletions and is included in many large deletions in the proviral genome. The Ψ amplicon is positioned at HXB2 coordinates 692–797. This reaction uses forward and reverse primers, as well as a 5’6-FAM-labeled hydrolysis probe. Successful amplification of HIV-1 reaction A produced FAM fluorescence in droplets containing Ψ, detectable in channel 1 of the droplet reader. HIV-1 reaction B targets the RRE of the proviral genome, with the amplicon positioned at HXB2 coordinates 7736–7851. This reaction used forward and reverse primers, as well as two hydrolysis probes: a 5’VIC-labeled probe specific for wild-type proviral sequences, and a 5’unlabelled probe specific for APOBEC3G hypermutated proviral sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Successful amplification of HIV-1 reaction B produced a VIC fluorescence in droplets containing a wild-type form of RRE, detectable in channel 2 of the droplet reader, whereas droplets containing a hypermutated form of RRE were not fluorescent.</p><p>Droplets containing HIV-1 proviruses were scored as follows. Droplets positive for FAM fluorescence only, which arises from Ψ amplification, was scored as containing 3′ defective proviruses, with the defect attributable to either APOBEC3G mediated hypermutation or 3′ deletion. Droplets positive for VIC fluorescence only, which arises from wild-type RRE amplification, was scored as containing 5′ defective proviruses, with the defect attributable to 5′ deletion. Droplets positive for both FAM and VIC fluorescence was scored as containing intact proviruses. Double-negative droplets contained no proviruses or rare proviruses with defects affecting both amplicons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Digital droplet PCR</title><p>The procedures for ddPCR described previously were followed with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruner et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, The ddPCR was performed on the Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG Digital Droplet PCR system using the appropriate manufacturer supplied consumables and the ddPCR Supermix for probes (no dUTPS) (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For HIV-1 proviral discrimination reactions, 600 ng of genomic DNA was analyzed in each reaction well. Uninfected donor CD4+T cells was performed for each IPDA run as a negative control while qualified genomic DNA of J-Lat 6.3 cell line was analyzed in each IPDA run as a positive control. Multiple replicate wells were performed for each reaction type to ensure a consistent quantification, and replicate wells were merged during analysis to increase IPDA dynamic range. Results are expressed as intact proviral DNA copies per 10<sup>6</sup> CD4+ T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics analysis were performed with GraphPad Prism 6. All of data were reported as mean ± SEM. For multiple comparisons, a one-way followed by the Bonferroni’s correction (only two groups were compared) was applied. Correlation was estimated by Pearson correlation coefficients (for parametric data). Differences were found to be significant when P was less than 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001, as indicated by single (*), double (**), or triple asterisks (***) within the figures. Most graphs were produced using Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Special Research Program of China for Important Infectious Diseases (2018Z × 10302103 and 2017Z × 10202102), the Important Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of China (81730060), the International Collaboration Program of the Natural Science Foundation of China and the US NIH (81561128007), and the Joint-Innovation Program in Healthcare for Special Scientific Research Projects of Guangzhou (201803040002) to HZ.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;USP49 potently stabilizes APOBEC3G protein and inhibits HIV-1 replication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors identified the deubiquitinase USP49 as a factor that stabilizes the host antiviral factor APOBEC3G (A3G). USP49 interacted with and removes ubiquitins from A3G, and thereby prevents the degradation of A3G. Analysis of clinical samples of HIV-1 infected patients revealed that USP49 expression is directly correlated with hypermutation rate and inversely correlated with intact proviruses in latent reservoirs. While the reviewers found the paper interesting, some essential revisions are needed before it can be published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more solid and systematic data to show that USP49 inhibits HIV-1 infectivity through A3G. Particularly, in Figure 2B, please show by Western blotting that A3G levels are rescued in cells and its virion incorporation is increased in a USP49 dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, please show that the inhibition of viral replication is associated with increased hypermutation of the proviral DNAs in target cells.</p><p>2) The authors should provide more quantitative data to show that the effects are significant. Specifically, the authors should quantitate the Western blot bands and plot the results of 2-3 independent experiments. Representative Western blots with adequate exposure may be needed such that the effects may look more obvious. This requirement applies to Figure 1C,D, and Figure 3B,E,F. New experiments may not be needed here.</p><p>3) The authors should show that USP49 works with the endogenous A3G to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity. Particularly, in Figure 2D, the authors should compare effects of USP49 on the viral infectivity with or without downregualtion of endogenous A3G. A different cell line may be needed in which the endogenous A3G is expressed at a functionally detectable level.</p><p>The full reviews are listed below. The rationale for the revisions may be better understood in the context of the full reviews. In addition, the comments should be helpful for the authors to improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors screened siRNAs targeting deubiquitinases for those involved in Vif-mediated degradation of A3G and identified USP49 as one that promoted the stability of A3G. The authors further demonstrated that USP49 interacted with A3G and reduced its ubiquitination. In HIV-infected patients, the expression levels of USP49 correlated well with A3G expression and disease progression parameters including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and viral loads. Furthermore, the expression levels of USP49 correlated with the hypermutation rates of the Vif-positive proviruses. These are important findings that would be interesting to a broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>, though the paper should be better written and some concerns need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) Figure 2D. USP49 is expected to aid the endogenous A3G to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity. But we do not see that effect here. One explanation is that in these cells there is little or no endogenous A3G. In this case a cell line that expresses A3G at a level functionally detectable should be used to analyze the effect of USP49 with or without A3G downregulation. In the whole paper, A3G was overexpressed. It is important to show that USP49 works with the endogenous A3G to inhibit HIV infectivity.</p><p>2) Figure 3E. Was USP49-Flag co-expressed in this experiment? If no, where is the USP49-Flag panel from? If yes, it should be indicated in the figure legend. In the latter case, the experiment would have been too complicated. Maybe the endogenous ESP49 was mistakenly labeled as USP49-Flag?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can regulate the stability of proteins. The authors found that a DUB, USP49, directly interacts with A3G and removes ubiquitins from A3G, increasing its steady state levels and its antiviral activity. It was also observed that Vif can mediate degradation of A3G by a cullin-ring-independent pathway that is counteracted by USP49. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that USP49 expression is directly correlated with hypermutation and inversely correlated with intact proviruses in latent reservoirs.</p><p>Overall, some innovative experiments that explore the role of deubiquitinating enzymes in Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G are described. While some of the results are strong, others are not as convincing. Additional results that support and strengthen some major conclusions are needed.</p><p>Figure 1E: At the low dose of Vif, GFP expression is increased to ~1.7-fold compared to the no Vif control. Is this due to a Vif-independent effect or is this just variation between experiments? Three independent transfection experiments should be done and provide error bars, and to establish the reproducibility of the results.</p><p>It is stated that USP49 significantly suppressed downregulation of A3G at moderate levels of Vif, but the effect was limited at high levels of Vif. However, the fold increase in the GFP expression seems higher when high levels of Vif were transfected.</p><p>Figure 2B: The dose-dependent suppression of infectivity with increasing levels of USP49 in the presence of A3G and Vif is convincing. The authors should provide western blots in parallel to show a dose-dependent increase in steady-state levels of A3G in cells and in virion-incorporated A3G. In addition, the authors should provide data indicating that the dose-dependent decrease in infectivity is accompanied with higher frequencies of G-to-A hypermutation of proviral DNAs in infected cells.</p><p>Figure 2E: A Y40H Vif mutant was used to carry out the experiments over 21 days. The authors should sequence the proviral DNA in the cultures at the 21-day time point to verify that the rescue in virus was not due to reversion of the Y40H mutation and due to suppression of USP49.</p><p>Figures 3D and 3E: the rescue in A3G-HA levels in cells and in virion lysates is very mild and not convincing. As stated above, a dose-dependent rescue of A3G levels and their virion incorporation should be shown by performing quantitative western blots and at least three independent experiments.</p><p>Figure 3F: The result that MLN4924 did not rescue A3G levels is not convincing; multiple experiments with quantitative western blots should be shown.</p><p>Figure 3G: Did the authors verify that the siRNA knockdowns of the cullins were effective in reducing the steady-state levels of cullins? How efficient was the knockdown and is it possible that residual amounts of cullins remaining were sufficient to induce degradation of A3G-GFP?</p><p>The vertical axis should indicate that a fold decrease in GFP expression was being measured to avoid confusion.</p><p>Figure 4B and 4C: The IP experiments should be performed with and without RNase treatment to show that the interaction between A3G and USP49 is direct and not an indirect interaction mediated by both proteins binding to RNA.</p><p>Figure 6E – 6G: More informative figure legends and methods description are needed to clarify these results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48318.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more solid and systematic data to show that USP49 inhibits HIV-1 infectivity through A3G.

How efficient was the knockdown and is it possible that residual amounts of cullins remaining were sufficient to induce degradation of A3G-GFP?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. To address your concerns, we first detected the knockdown efficiency of these siRNAs by qRT-PCR and the results demonstrated that the knockdown efficiency of siRNA is more than 70% (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>Moreover, two more experiments proved the efficiency of siRNAs (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C). One was that the siRNA knockdown of Cullin5 decreased the degradation of A3G through Vif-dependent way. This indicates that the siRNA for Cullin5 was very effective. Another experiment was that the expression of AID increased when Cullin7 was inhibited by the siRNA. Cullin7 is involved in the degradation of AID, which was reported by our group recently (Luo et al., 2019). In both experiments, the effects of Cullins were significantly inhibited by siRNA. If these Cullins are involved in the Vif-independent degradation of A3G, the current 70% knockdown efficiency would be enough to cause detectable changes in the results. However, we did not see any effect of the Cullin1-7 knockdown (by siRNA) on the A3G-GFP expression. Therefore, according to our existing experimental results, we believe that Cullin1-7 do not participate in the Vif-independent degradation pathway of A3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The vertical axis should indicate that a fold decrease in GFP expression was being measured to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion.

We have described the details of IPDA methods in the revised manuscript. These methods were reported by Siliciano’s lab in 2019 (Katherine et al., 2019). It is a quantitative approach for measuring the reservoir of latent HIV-1 proviruses.</p><p>In general, the IPDA was performed on DNA from 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with precautions to avoid excess DNA fragmentation. Quantification of intact, 5’deleted, and 3’deleted and/or hypermutated proviruses was carried out using primer/probe combinations optimized for subtype B HIV-1. The primer/probe mix consists of oligonucleotides for two independent hydrolysis probe reactions that interrogate conserved regions of the HIV-1 genome to discriminate intact from defective proviruses (Supplementary file 2). HIV-1 reaction A targets the packaging signal (Ψ) that is a frequent site of small deletions and is included in many large deletions in the proviral genome. The Ψ amplicon is positioned at HXB2 coordinates 692–797. This reaction used forward and reverse primers, as well as a 5’6-FAM-labelled hydrolysis probe. Successful amplification of HIV-1 reaction A produced FAM fluorescence in droplets containing Ψ, detectable in channel 1 of the droplet reader. HIV-1 reaction B targets the RRE of the proviral genome, with the amplicon positioned at HXB2 coordinates 7736-7851. This reaction used forward and reverse primers, as well as two hydrolysis probes: a 5’VIC-labelled probe specific for wild-type proviral sequences, and a 5’unlabelled probe specific for APOBEC3G hypermutated proviral sequences (Supplementary file 2). Successful amplification of HIV-1 reaction B produced a VIC fluorescence in droplets containing a wild-type form of RRE, detectable in channel 2 of the droplet reader, whereas droplets containing a hypermutated form of RRE were not fluorescent.</p><p>Droplets containing HIV-1 proviruses were scored as follows. Droplets positive for FAM fluorescence only, which arises from Ψ amplification, was scored as containing 3′ defective proviruses, with the defect attributable to either APOBEC3G mediated hypermutation or 3′ deletion. Droplets positive for VIC fluorescence only, which arises from wild-type RRE amplification, was scored as containing 5′ defective proviruses, with the defect attributable to 5′ deletion. Droplets positive for both FAM and VIC fluorescence was scored as containing intact proviruses. Double-negative droplets contained no proviruses or rare proviruses with defects affecting both amplicons.</p><p>These explanations were added to the manuscript in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
