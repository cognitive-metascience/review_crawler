strand only and excludes the other strand from the ring. This mode of translocation allows helicases to bypass blocks on the strand that is excluded from the central channel. Unlike other replicative helicases, eukaryotic CMG helicase partially encircles duplex DNA at a forked junction and is stopped by a block on the non-tracking (lagging) strand. This report demonstrates that Mcm10, an essential replication protein unique to eukaryotes, binds CMG and greatly stimulates its helicase activity in vitro. Most significantly, Mcm10 enables CMG and the replisome to bypass blocks on the non-tracking DNA strand. We demonstrate that bypass occurs without displacement of the blocks and therefore Mcm10 must isomerize the CMG-DNA complex to achieve the bypass function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA helicase</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replisome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langston</surname><given-names>Lance D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayle</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Yurieva</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgescu</surname><given-names>Roxana E</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Mike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM38839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langston</surname><given-names>Lance D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayle</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Schauer</surname><given-names>Grant D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yurieva</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Nina Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgescu</surname><given-names>Roxana E</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Mike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical data demonstrate an unexpected and critical function for the enigmatic Mcm10 protein in helping the eukaryotic CMG helicase/replisome bypass roadblocks on the DNA that may also explain Mcm10 function at origins of replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The replication of cellular DNA requires use of a helicase to separate the interwound strands. The replicative helicase in all domains of life is a circular hexamer. There are four superfamilies of hexameric helicases, SF3-6, that assort into two main groups, the bacterial helicases (SF4,5) that have ATP sites derived from the RecA fold and the eukaryotic/archaeal helicases (SF3,6) that have ATP sites derived from the AAA+Â fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>). In all cases, the subunits of hexameric helicases are composed of at least two major domains, giving them the appearance of two stacked rings, an N-tier ring and C-tier ring; the motors are contained in the C-tier ring. The RecA based bacterial helicases track 5ââ3â on DNA with the C-tier motors leading the N-tier, as determined by crystal structures of bacterial Rho (SF5) and DnaB (SF4) complexed with ssDNA, while structures of eukaryotic bovine papilloma virus E1 (SF3) and S. cerevisiae CMG (SF6) with DNA show that these helicases track 3ââ5â with the N-tier ahead of the C-tier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Hexameric helicases are thought to act by encircling only one strand of DNA upon which they track and exclude the non-tracking strand to the outside of the ring, thereby acting as a wedge to split DNA in a process often referred to as steric exclusion and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyubimov et al., 2011</xref>). Whether a helicase functions by steric exclusion is determined by biochemical experiments that place a bulky block on one or the other strand of the duplex. For a steric exclusion helicase, a block placed on the non-tracking strand (i.e. the strand that is excluded from the central channel) does not inhibit helicase unwinding, while a block placed on the tracking strand stops the helicase because the bulky block cannot fit through the central channel.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29118.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CMG-fork structure and isomerization needed for bypass of lagging strand blocks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of a hexameric helicase in the steric exclusion mode, encircling the tracking strand and excluding the non-tracking strand from the central channel.

(<bold>C</bold>) Illustration of CMG encountering a lagging strand block in the modified steric exclusion mode, partially encircling both strands of the duplex DNA as shown in (<bold>B</bold>).

This 11-subunit assembly is referred to as CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2-7, GINS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>). The recent cryoEM 3D structure of S. cerevisiae CMG helicase at a DNA replication fork shows a unique DNA binding feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). Instead of encircling only ssDNA, the zinc fingers of the N-tier encircle and bind theÂ dsDNA and the DNA unwinding point is buried inside the central channel; the unwound leading strand then proceeds through the central channel into the C-tier motor domain. The lagging strand is not visualized in the structure, indicating mobility, and is proposed to enter the initial part of the central channel defined by the N-terminal zinc fingers and then exit the surface of CMG, through a gap between two zinc fingers. The dsDNA is held at a 28Â° angle to the central channel, surrounded by the zinc fingers at the âtopâ of CMG. The dsDNA appears to be tightly held because if the CMG-dsDNA contact was flexible the DNA would have been averaged out during 3D reconstruction.</p><p>The structural evidence that S. cerevisiae CMG encircles dsDNA during unwinding is supported by recent biochemical experiments using strand specific dual streptavidin blocks that show CMG is halted by a block placed on either the non-tracking (lagging) or the tracking (leading) strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, given a sufficiently long time S. cerevisiae CMG can proceed through the lagging strand block without displacing the streptavidin, suggesting that CMG slowly isomerizes to a classic steric exclusion mode that only encircles the tracking (leading) strand or isomerizes by ring opening to bypass the block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>). Earlier studies in Xenopus extracts demonstrate that replisome progression is not hindered by a dual streptavidin block on the lagging strand and conclude that CMG functions in a steric exclusion mode by only encircling the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). Considering that the zinc fingers of isolated S. cerevisiae CMG encircle dsDNA, we proposed that Xenopus extracts contain a factor that facilitates isomerization of CMG on DNA such that it can bypass blocks on the non-tracking strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The present study identifies Mcm10 as the factor that enables CMG to rapidly bypass a block on the lagging strand. Mcm10 is unique to eukaryotes and is an essential gene product that, when mutated, causes abortive entry into S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merchant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Solomon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thu and Bielinsky, 2013</xref>). Mcm10 has two internal DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robertson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2008</xref>) and is known to bind Mcm2-7 and Cdc45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christensen and Tye, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Perna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Douglas and Diffley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perez-Arnaiz et al., 2016</xref>). Mcm10 is generally thought to act as an initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thu and Bielinsky, 2013</xref>). The licencing of an origin in G1 phase involves several proteins to form a head-to-head double hexamer of Mcm2-7. Additional initiation factors transform the Mcm2-7 double hexamer into two head-to-head CMGs during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>) but Mcm10 is not required for this action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watase et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Mcm10 is only required at the last step of initiation and is proposed to either activate CMG helicase or help separate the two CMGs for bidirectional replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watase et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Additional studies indicate that Mcm10 may also function at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chadha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke and Bielinsky, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The current study demonstrates that Mcm10 forms an isolable stoichiometric complex with CMG that greatly stimulates CMG helicase activity (up to 30-fold) and enhances processivity. Strikingly, Mcm10 uniquely promotes CMG bypass of a lagging strand block without displacing it, suggesting that Mcm10 isomerizes the CMG-DNA complex either to a steric exclusion mode or by facilitating ring opening. In contrast, leading strand blocks inhibit CMG unwinding but Mcm10 helps CMG displace the blocks and continue unwinding, consistent with the idea that Mcm10 makes CMG a more powerful, processive helicase. Despite the strong stimulation of helicase activity, Mcm10 has little effect on CMG-dependent DNA synthesis by the replisome in vitro, particularly in the presence of the Mrc1-Tof1-Csm3 complex. However, the replisome becomes stalled by lagging strand blocks in the absence of Mcm10, indicating that CMG uses an internal unwinding mechanism even in the context of rapidly moving replisomes. Stalled replisomes are released by addition of Mcm10, further supporting the idea that Mcm10 functions at the level of the helicase to enhance processivity, provide additional power and to enable blocked replisomes to bypass obstacles on the DNA. These functions may also explain the role of Mcm10 in origin initiation as described in the Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mcm10 forms a complex with CMG and greatly stimulates helicase activity</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> we titrated Mcm10 into a helicase assay using a fixed amount of CMG and a synthetic forked DNA with a 50 bp duplex and 40-nt dT ssDNA tails. Stimulation by Mcm10 is remarkable, with over 30-fold enhancement of CMG unwinding at 2â in the presence of only one molecule of Mcm10 per CMG (compare lane 5 to lane 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Reactions containing Mcm10 are complete by the 5 min time point, while the CMG reaction without Mcm10 continues slow unwinding during the 10 min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results at different Mcm10 concentrations indicate that maximal stimulation of CMG is observed with two subunits of Mcm10 for each CMG complex and further addition of Mcm10 beyond this amount has little effect. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Control reactions with Mcm10 alone, lacking CMG, show no unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Reactions with Mcm10 sometimes give a supershift of some of the substrate (e.g. lanes 5, 8, 11, 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) which we interpret as a gel shift of Mcm10 that remains bound to DNA, as Mcm10 is a known DNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robertson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2008</xref>). To determine if other DNA binding proteins such as RPA or E. coli SSB stimulate CMG, we performed experiments in which CMG unwinding was initiated and then either Mcm10, RPA or SSB was added. The results show that the stimulation of CMG is specific to Mcm10 and that RPA and SSB do not substitute for Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29118.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mcm10 binds CMG and stimulates its helicase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Titration of Mcm10 in a CMG unwinding assay.

CMG and a 3-fold molar excess of Mcm10 were mixed, attached to beads, then washed twice and eluted with Flag peptide.

This result suggests that Mcm10 enhances the processivity of CMG and possibly also stimulates the rate of CMG unwinding. Examination of the first 5 min of unwinding in the presence of Mcm10 shows a short delay in the appearance of products using the 160 bp duplex compared to the 50 bp duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We took advantage of this delayed appearance of the longer products to design an experiment that approximates the average rate of unwinding by CMG-Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). CMG was pre-incubated with an equimolar mixture of the two different length substrates and then the reaction was started by the addition of ATP and Mcm10. The substrates and products migrate at distinguishable positions in a native PAGE gel allowing us to observe the appearance of both products in the same reaction.

The final extent of unwinding is similar for both substrates, so the delay reflects a difference in time of unwinding the two DNAs due to their difference in length rather than a difference in helicase activity on the two substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mcm10 stimulates CMG-dependent leading strand replication in the absence of Mrc1-Tof1-Csm3</title><p>Having observed stimulation of CMG by Mcm10 in helicase assays, we wished to determine whether Mcm10 also stimulated CMG in the context of the DNA replication fork.

CMG is pre-incubated with the DNA substrate (in the presence or absence of Mcm10) for 5â at 30Â° C to allow CMG loading onto the 3â tail of the fork (see reaction scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Mcm10 is essential for initiation in the plasmid assay system and this requirement presents difficulty in determining whether Mcm10 also enhanced the rate of replication fork progression when Mrc1-Tof1-Csm3 was present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). In our experiments, CMG is added as a purified complex enabling a direct test of whether Mcm10 stimulates fork speed in the presence of these additional factors.

The autoradiogram shows that in the presence of the MTC complex, full length 2.8 kb product can be observed after 3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 6), indicating a rate of 20 ntds/s (933 ntds/min), close to the 1.5â1.9 kb/min rate of replisomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodgson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekedat et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the MTC complex clears up the many immature products formed in the absence of MTC, suggesting that replication forks that stop or pause are brought to full length by the MTC complex. Addition of Mcm10 to leading strand replisome reactions containing the MTC complex does not result in a faster replication fork rate under the conditions used and may have even slightly slowed the replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 11â15).

To explain these apparently conflicting results, we hypothesized that Mcm10 is required for replisome progression in particular circumstances, for example when CMG is hindered by DNA-bound proteins or other structural impediments on DNA. Indeed, Mcm10 is required for efficient initiation of DNA unwinding at an origin, a situation in which the two CMG complexes block one another's progression because they must pass each other in order to establish two bidirectional forks (see Discussion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that Mcm10 may help CMG overcome blocks, we examined the effect of Mcm10 on CMG unwinding of forked DNA with strand-specific blocks on either the lagging or leading strand of the duplex portion of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, respectively). In these experiments, the block is formed by two biotinylated nucleotides on one DNA strand or the other, spaced 6 bp apart, that are tightly bound by the 53 kDa streptavidin protein. We recently showed that CMG unwinding is inhibited by biotin-streptavidin on either strand and is nearly inactive when two biotin-streptavidin blocks are present on either strand of the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>). This is unique to CMG, as thus far all other hexameric helicases examined are not blocked by an obstruction on the non-tracking strand and are only blocked by an obstruction on the translocating strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hacker and Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakano et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibition of hexameric helicases by a block on one strand but not the other is interpreted as a steric exclusion mode of unwinding in which the non-tracking strand is completely excluded from the central channel of the helicase ring, thereby explaining why bulky substituents on the non-tracking strand do not affect helicase unwinding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29118.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mcm10, but not MTC complex, enables CMG and the replisome to bypass a lagging strand block.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the helicase reaction scheme.

Isomerization for bypass could be achieved by CMG encircling only the leading strand or the Mcm2-7 ring within CMG may crack open for bypass, as detailed later in the Discussion.</p><p>In contrast to studies with pure CMG, studies of replication in Xenopus egg extracts show that two adjacent streptavidin blocks spaced 5 bp apart on the non-translocating (lagging) strand are quickly bypassed (within 10 min) by the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that our earlier study showed that isolated CMG is strongly inhibited by a dual streptavidin block, suggests that some other factor in the complete extract helps CMG bypass lagging strand blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langston et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether Mcm10 may be the factor that facilitates CMG bypass of a lagging strand block we examined CMG unwinding of the forked DNA substrate with two biotinylated nucleotides on the duplex portion of the lagging strand template (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Control reactions lacking Mcm10 show that CMG helicase is essentially shut down by the streptavidin blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes 2â4 without streptavidin to lanes 5â7 with streptavidin) as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>). But surprisingly, when Mcm10 is added, the rate and amount of unwinding are the same in the presence and absence of streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes 8â10 and 11â13). Hence, Mcm10 enables CMG to rapidly bypass or displace a dual streptavidin block on the lagging strand. This observation mirrors results observed in the Xenopus system, which was assumed (but not demonstrated) to bypass these blocks without displacement. Ability of CMG to bypass lagging strand blocks with Mcm10 present in the pure protein system resolves the discrepancies between use of purified CMG (without Mcm10), and observations in Xenopus extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2017</xref>). We revisit the issue of whether streptavidin blocks are bypassed or displaced later in this report.</p><p>Having previously shown that the MTC complex greatly stimulates progression of the leading strand replisome even in the absence of Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we tested the MTC complex in CMG helicase assays to see if it enhances the ability of CMG to bypass blocks on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast to Mcm10, MTC was unable to promote CMG bypass of the block (compare lanes 11â13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to lanes 11â13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also note that MTC did not stimulate CMG unwinding even in the absence of the block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> compare lanes 8â10 with MTC to lanes 2â4 without MTC), suggesting that MTC does not function at the level of CMG unwinding. Together with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, these data suggest that Mcm10 and MTC affect fork progression in very different ways. In contrast to Mcm10 mediated bypass of lagging strand blocks, CMG unwinding was delayed and strongly repressed by a dual streptavidin block on the leading strand even with Mcm10 present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mcm10 is needed at the replication fork to bypass lagging strand barriers</title><p>To further investigate the functions of Mcm10 and MTC at a replication fork, we adapted the helicase substrate from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâC</xref> to support DNA replication. The 3â tail of the fork was extended to accommodate a primer for DNA synthesis and the reaction was staged as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. First, CMG was added with ATP to allow helicase translocation to the block, followed by Pol Îµ/RFC/PCNA/dNTPs to see if the âpushâ on CMG from a Pol Îµ-PCNA motor can overcome the block. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> lanes 1â3 show that Pol Îµ-PCNA extended the <sup>32</sup>P-primer to the stalled CMG (~66 bp) but had limited ability to bypass the block to form the 141 bp full-length product. TheÂ ~91 bp bands result from forks lacking CMG, so Pol Îµ-PCNA extends to the fork but cannot proceed further because Pol Îµ lacks strand displacement capability and relies on CMG to unwind the DNA for leading strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). MTC has little or no effect on block bypass by the replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> lanes 7â9), and is comparable to Pol Îµ-PCNA-CMG in lanes 1â3. By contrast, addition of Mcm10 allows the replisome to efficiently and rapidly proceed past these blocks as evidenced by the appearance of full length 141 bp product in lanes 4â6. These results confirm that Mcm10 is needed for replisome bypass of a block and they also indicate that neither MTC nor Pol Îµ-PCNA is able to drive the forward movement of a stalled CMG in the absence of Mcm10.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Lagging strand blocks are bypassed while leading strand blocks are displaced</title><p>We next addressed whether Mcm10 enables CMG to bypass the lagging strand streptavidin or whether the apparent stronger helicase activity of CMG helicase provided by Mcm10 enables CMG to displace the lagging strand blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The results demonstrate that streptavidin is displaced from the unwound product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Hence, Mcm10 appears to provide CMG with more translocation force than CMG alone, consistent with the increase in processivity of CMG in the presence of Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that a stoichiometric CMG-Mcm10 complex can be reconstituted and isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplements 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>) and that Mcm10 greatly stimulates CMG unwinding and processivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of Mcm10 on fork progression per se is relatively insignificant in the absence of blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, we find that Mcm10 enables CMG and the replisome to bypass lagging strand blocks that otherwise bring unwinding and leading strand synthesis to a halt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The function of Mcm10 in facilitating replisome bypass of lagging strand blocks is consistent with genetic studies showing that Mcm10 deficiency leads to genome instability and increased dependence on post-replication and recombinational repair pathways to maintain viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports have solved the structure of the internal DNA binding region of Xenopus Mcm10 and documented that the internal region has two DNA binding elements, an OB fold and a zinc finger, that allow it to bind ssDNA and/or dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robertson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2008</xref>). Following the internal DNA binding region is a C-terminal region that forms the main interaction site to Mcms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Douglas and Diffley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quan et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Mcm10 appears to bind to the N-tier region of the CMG complex that faces the forked junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as recent studies show that interaction of Mcm10 with Mcm2-7 is mediated primarily through an interaction with a conserved domain in the N-terminal region of the Mcm2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these known properties of Mcm10, we propose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that, upon encountering a lagging strand block, Mcm10 binds at the N-tier of CMG and also binds DNA at the fork. This places Mcm10 between CMG and the forked junction such that duplex DNA no longer enters the zinc fingers that line the top of the central channel of CMG. In this configuration, Mcm10 isomerizes CMG to a steric exclusion mode where it is capable of bypassing blocks on the non-tracking strand as observed with other hexameric helicases and with the complete replisome in the Xenopus extract system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). Two alternative isomerization reactions that would also facilitate lagging strand block bypass without displacement include one in which Mcm10 cracks open the N-tier of the Mcm2-7 ring of CMG, bypasses the block, and recloses the N-tier. Similarly, Mcm10 might enable opening of both the N- and C-tiers, either simultaneously or in succession, to bypass the blocks. These alternative isomerization reactions are described in detail inÂ (Figure 8 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langston et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29118.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of Mcm10 function.</title><p>Proposed model of Mcm10 mediated isomerization of CMG-DNA at a replication fork.

One possible reason that CMG evolved a requirement for another protein to bypass a lagging strand block is for regulation of fork initiation and progression. It is documented from several laboratories that the head-to-head (N-to-N) double hexamer of Mcm2-7 at an origin matures to form two CMGs on dsDNA without unwinding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watase et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Mcm10 is required at the last step of origin initiation to âactivateâ CMG to unwind DNA as detected by RPA binding to the ssDNA products. These observations can be explained by the findings of this report. Specifically, CMG is known to track with the N-tier ahead of the C-tier, and therefore head-to-head CMGs at an origin are directed inward toward one another. Hence, each CMG blocks the other CMG at an origin. However, if Mcm10 activates the CMGs to locally unwind DNA, as observed by head-to-head SV40 T-antigen hexamers that produce ssDNA ârabbit earsâ at the viral origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wessel et al., 1992</xref>), the two CMGs could isomerize to encircle opposite single-strands and pass one another to form bidirectional forks (see Figure 8B in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>]). This same action may also promote termination, when two forks meet, enabling the CMG based replisomes to easily pass one another.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><bold>Is Mcm10 a stable component of a moving replisome</bold>?Â </title><p>Considering that Mcm10 does not appear to increase the elongation rate of the replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), it may not be required at all times. For example, Mcm10 might only be needed to help the replisome bypass blocks on the lagging strand which conceivably could be performed by a dynamic Mcm10 that interacts only transiently with a stalled replisome. Alternatively, Mcm10 mediated isomerization of CMG-DNA may remain stable, in which case Mcm10 may not be needed for some time after its first use, and in fact an Mcm10 effect on CMG that only requires transient Mcm10 binding has been demonstrated in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mcm10 binds remarkably tightly to CMG, eluting as a CMG-Mcm10 complex from beads after high salt washes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and the CMG-Mcm10 complex also remains associated and elutes from a MonoQ ion-exchange resin at high ionic strength (400â450 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, some studies suggest Mcm10 is a component of moving replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chadha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LÃµoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke and Bielinsky, 2004</xref>). However, other cellular studies indicate that Mcm10 is not in constant association with the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watase et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while the salt stability of the CMG-Mcm10 complex reported here suggests it might remain attached to the replisome, its kinetics of attachment are not addressed here and Mcm10 could still be dynamic with CMG, or its on/off rates with the replisome could be affected by other proteins in the cell. Future structural and single-molecule studies of CMG-Mcm10 may be expected to shed light on further details about the dynamics of Mcm10 and the mechanism of its replisome bypass function at stalled replisomes described in this report.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Radioactive nucleotides were from Perkin Elmer and unlabeled nucleotides were from GE Healthcare.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from Langston and O'Donnell investigates the role of MCM10 in eukaryotic helicase function. They show convincingly that a stable complex forms between MCM10 and the CMG, and that the MCM10/CMG complex shows a dramatic improvement in helicase activity over the CMG alone. Although these are significant findings in their own right, they claim that MCM10's primary function is not to improve CMG action per se (as MCM10's effect on the CMG is eclipsed by that of the MTC complex), but to fundamentally alter the mechanism of translocation, isomerizing the CMG between a double-stranded to single-stranded encirclement mechanism for the purpose of bypassing blocks. All known hexameric DNA helicases translocate on one strand and exclude the other strand of a DNA fork. Langston, O'Donnell and colleagues previously observed that the eukaryotic replicative helicase, CMG, cannot bypass a roadblock on either the translocation strand (leading strand template) or the sterically excluded lagging strand. The structure of a fork-engaged CMG was used to explain this observation: duplex DNA is encircled by a B domain crown and the fork nexus is contacted by the C domain &quot;OB hairpins&quot;, which guard the single-stranded DNA interacting ATPase ring pore. Given this mode of binding, a roadblock on either strand of the duplex DNA would therefore be impaired from physically reaching C domain hairpins. Langston and colleagues now reconstitute a CMG-Mcm10 complex and find that Mcm10 makes the CMG a more vigorous helicase, capable of bypassing a roadblock on the lagging strand. The authors suggest that Mcm10 induces an isomerization of the CMG that might release the duplex DNA portion of a fork from the B-domain embedding. This event would occur upon initiation of DNA replication and when the replisome needs to bypass a roadblock on the DNA.</p><p>Although MCM10 clearly improves the ability of the CMG to bypass a lagging strand block, their conclusion that this is due to CMG/DNA isomerization may be premature. A simpler explanation is that the MCM10-dependent improvement in helicase activity provides the force needed to drive the CMG through the block. Notably, this is consistent with their previous finding that the CMG alone (in the absence of MCM10) can dislodge a block potentially mediated by a single streptavidin from either strand. Why, then, should not a motor with dramatically improved activity (30-fold!) be able to bypass two such potential road-blocks? Additionally, these conclusions are based on the premise that the CMG does, in fact, encircle two strands. However, the background biochemical work on which this manuscript is based (Langston and ODonnell 2017 <italic>eLife</italic>) came to this conclusion by comparing the CMG's ability to bypass tandem biotin-streptavidin blocks on leading and lagging strand templates, where they find both able to block progression. This result by itself would be consistent with this conclusion but provides no direct evidence for the model. Other models include an outside path for one strand that must interact with the outer surface. Further and perhaps more important beyond model building, for this work and previous studies from the group, they fail to mention in their paper that the two bulky adducts on the lagging strand are placed at half the distance as those on the leading strand. Although their recent EM structure suggests that DNA forks engage further within the protein than initially anticipated, the lagging strand is still, nonetheless, excluded, and double-stranded DNA never enters the central channel -how deep one must go to be in the &quot;central channel&quot; is, of course, perhaps semantics.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers thought that the issues raised above regarding the isomerization model were not convincing and needed to be either presented with more direct structural data or presented as a speculation amongst other possibilities. A revised manuscript should address the essential and minor issues enumerated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Their use of non-equivalent leading and lagging strand dual biotin-streptavidin roadblocks is misleading and correctly matched oligos should be ordered and the experiments repeated (including the basic finding that lagging strand adducts block translocation equally as well as leading strand adducts)</p><p>2) Their title overstates their findings â they have not shown isomerization, only that MCM10 improves the helicase function of the CMG. Either the idea is presented as a speculation along side other ideas or direct data supporting the point be presented as new information</p><p>3) Their work suggests an MCM10-dependent switching of the CMG between a double-stranded to single-stranded mechanism upon encountering a roadblock. But given the performance advantage of MCM10 on the CMG and, as the authors state, the persistence of MCM10 at forks, why should the CMG not always occupy this functional state, i.e. steric exclusion without ever occupying the (intermediate?) state they observe by EM. This should be discussed as a speculation. On the other hand direct biophysical or structural data provided.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> cartoon is a bit misleading. The MCM should be depicted as a 3 tier ring: from the bottom, ATPase, A-C tier and smaller B tier. Duplex DNA is engaged by B-tier only. At the moment it appears that fork nexus is found at the ATPase/A-C tier interface, which is not the case.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it would be good to include a control where Mcm10 is incubated with a fork in the absence of CMG. Also, one caveat of this experiment is that Mcm10 is a single-stranded DNA binding protein and the stimulation of the DNA unwinding activity might simply be due to single-stranded DNA trapping (effectively the same role of a DNA capture strand). It would be good to test whether another single-stranded DNA binding protein (e.g. SSB) has a similar effect on DNA unwinding by the CMG. Also, what is the supershifted band visible e.g. in lanes 5, 8 and 11? It would be good to acknowledge this band, since it is present in many unwinding gels throughout the paper.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. GINS subunits are notoriously difficult to stain. It is a pity that in the CMG-Mcm10 gel appears to be cut so that the GINS subunits are not visible. From looking at this gel alone one cannot rule out the possibility that Mcm10 and GINS compete for the same binding site on the MCM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> the MonoQ profile is shown where Sld5 is detected, however not Psf1-3. It is remarkable that the CMG-Mcm10 complex is stable at 300mM KCl concentration (indeed convincingly shown in the high salt FLAG pulldown experiment), however the Q column experiment alone does not rule out the possibility that Sld5 and MCM-Cdc45-Mcm10 simply elute at the same salt concentration from an ion exchange column. Could the authors produce a gel where all of the CMG components are seen together with Mcm10, after FLAG elution?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The observation that CMG plus Mcm10 is much better at unwinding longer stretches of duplex DNA compared to CMG alone is interesting. Why do the authors think that a fork with 160bp duplex is a better substrate than the 50bp duplex for CMG-Mcm10?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> lanes 11-13. CMG-Mcm10 can clearly bypass a leading strand roadblock, however the authors do not comment on this remarkable observation. Is SA kicked off of the DNA or is there a more complicated leading strand roadblock bypass mechanism to be uncovered? Using DNA-Protein crosslink (methyltransferase?) as a roadblock would address this issue. If SA is kicked off of the leading strand template, this might simply mean that the bypass effect observed here is due to a stimulation of the ATPase activity (CMG-Mcm10 powers through the roadblock). Could the authors address this point? Does Mcm10 stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MCM to a different extent compared to e.g. MTC, which the authors already use as an informative control in this study?</p><p>From these experiments it is not clear that streptavidin remains bound to the substrate after CMG passage, as invoked by the bypass mechanism proposed by the authors. This can be addressed by placing the 32P-label on the modified strand of the DNA substrate to observe the generation of single-stranded streptavidin-DNA products, and by performing the reactions in the presence of excess free biotin to trap displaced streptavidin. This seems particularly relevant, as the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> detects significant Mcm10-dependent bypass of blocks even on the leading strand â how do the authors explain this latter observation?</p><p>9) The four GINS subunits are not visible in the gel pictures of the isolated CMG-Mcm10 complexes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Evidence for their stoichiometric presence in the complex needs to be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29118.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Their use of non-equivalent leading and lagging strand dual biotin-streptavidin roadblocks is misleading and correctly matched oligos should be ordered and the experiments repeated (including the basic finding that lagging strand adducts block translocation equally as well as leading strand adducts)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment and have repeated the experiments as requested.

But the available cellular studies that address whether Mcm10 travels with the replisome are not settled in the literature, with reports and data going in both directions. Since we have not shown the persistence of Mcm10 (i.e. k<sub>off</sub> rate) with CMG at a fork, we discuss the possibility that CMG might travel with the fork all the time in the Discussion, as requested, but we also note that we cannot rigorously make that conclusion from the data of the current report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> cartoon is a bit misleading.

We did not intend to draw the unwinding point as far down as we did, and this was an artistic flaw of the original figure. We have now redrawn the figure to show a much smaller amount of dsDNA entering the CMG. We did not redraw the cartoon to have 3 tiers because describing the A, B, C domains of the N-tier is beyond the scope of the Introduction. We have dealt with these aspects in the structural study and in a few other reviews that are submitted and underway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it would be good to include a control where Mcm10 is incubated with a fork in the absence of CMG.

We should note that SSB/RPA canât be added to reactions before CMG as it prevents CMG loading (as we published earlier). Thus, we let the CMG helicase reaction proceed for 10 min, and then add either Mcm10, RPA or SSB. The result shows that Mcm10 provides strong stimulation of the CMG helicase while neither RPA nor SSB affect CMG activity.</p><p>â The supershifted band in lanes 5,8 and 11 has now been acknowledged and explained in the text. The second half of the first paragraph in the Results section describes these 3 points and reads as follows:</p><p>âControl reactions with Mcm10 alone, lacking CMG, show no unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Reactions with Mcm10 sometimes give a supershift of some of the substrate (e.g. lanes 5, 8, 11, 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which we interpret as a gel shift of Mcm10 that remains bound to DNA, as Mcm10 is a known DNA binding protein (Du et al., 2012; Robertson et al., 2008; Warren et al., 2008). To determine if other DNA binding proteins such as RPA or <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB stimulate CMG, we performed experiments in which CMG unwinding was initiated and then either Mcm10, RPA or SSB was added. The results show that the stimulation of CMG is specific to Mcm10 and that RPA and SSB do not substitute for Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. GINS subunits are notoriously difficult to stain. It is a pity that in the CMG-Mcm10 gel appears to be cut so that the GINS subunits are not visible. From looking at this gel alone one cannot rule out the possibility that Mcm10 and GINS compete for the same binding site on the MCM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> the MonoQ profile is shown where Sld5 is detected, however not Psf1-3. It is remarkable that the CMG-Mcm10 complex is stable at 300mM KCl concentration (indeed convincingly shown in the high salt FLAG pulldown experiment), however the Q column experiment alone does not rule out the possibility that Sld5 and MCM-Cdc45-Mcm10 simply elute at the same salt concentration from an ion exchange column. Could the authors produce a gel where all of the CMG components are seen together with Mcm10, after FLAG elution?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concerns and certainly agree that the GINS are notoriously difficult to stain. We have rerun the gels, but we should also point out that while this project was being performed, Mcm10 was demonstrated in the Bell lab to preferentially bind CMG, containing GINS, Cdc45 and Mcms (LÃµoke, et al., 2017). However, we have re-run FLAG and MonoQ experiments and re-run gels to the best we could, and have added those gels and the following text to the manuscript. We also note that Steve Bellâs recent paper on Mcm10 (cited herein) demonstrates that Mcm10 stabilizes the CMG complex.</p><p>â We have performed a repeat of the FLAG purification of CMG-Mcm10 and run the gel such that the GINS subunits can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

The result indicates the following stoichiometry: 1.0 Mcm2-7, 1.2 Mcm10, 0.87 Sld5, and 2.6 Psf1+Psf2 (they co-migrate for an average of 1.3 each). The Psf3 runs at the dye front and could not be quantitated. FLAG columns capture some free Cdc45 and thus overestimate the Cdc45-FLAG subunit; MonoQ analysis removes free Cdc45 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).â</p><p>â We have also re-run the MonoQ purification of CMG-Mcm10 complex in the PAGE such that the GINS subunits are visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

The CX-MS results are not included here, because they are part of our study on the structure of CMG-Mcm10, but they confirm that GINS and Mcm10 are associated with CMG, and that Mcm10 binds a lot of the CMG subunits, which probably accounts for Steve Bellâs observation in his recent study that Mcm10 preferentially binds the complete CMG, and facilitates formation of the CMG complex (LÃµoke, et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The observation that CMG plus Mcm10 is much better at unwinding longer stretches of duplex DNA compared to CMG alone is interesting. Why do the authors think that a fork with 160bp duplex is a better substrate than the 50bp duplex for CMG-Mcm10?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misconception in our text. We did not mean to imply that the fork with a 160bp duplex is a better substrate than a fork with a 50bp duplex. We meant to say that these appear to be equal substrates for CMG-Mcm10. We have clarified this point in the text of the revised manuscript. We have added the following statement to the Results:</p><p>âThe final extent of unwinding is similar for both substrates, so the delay reflects a difference in time of unwinding the two DNAs due to their difference in length rather than a difference in helicase activity on the two substrates.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> lanes 11-13. CMG-Mcm10 can clearly bypass a leading strand roadblock, however the authors do not comment on this remarkable observation. Is SA kicked off of the DNA or is there a more complicated leading strand roadblock bypass mechanism to be uncovered? Using DNA-Protein crosslink (methyltransferase?) as a roadblock would address this issue. If SA is kicked off of the leading strand template, this might simply mean that the bypass effect observed here is due to a stimulation of the ATPase activity (CMG-Mcm10 powers through the roadblock). Could the authors address this point? Does Mcm10 stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MCM to a different extent compared to e.g. MTC, which the authors already use as an informative control in this study?</p><p>From these experiments it is not clear that streptavidin remains bound to the substrate after CMG passage, as invoked by the bypass mechanism proposed by the authors. This can be addressed by placing the 32P-label on the modified strand of the DNA substrate to observe the generation of single-stranded streptavidin-DNA products, and by performing the reactions in the presence of excess free biotin to trap displaced streptavidin. This seems particularly relevant, as the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> detects significant Mcm10-dependent bypass of blocks even on the leading strand â how do the authors explain this latter observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and in fact did the excess biotin trap experiment before submission for the lagging strand streptavidin blocks. On hindsight we should have included that data in the original submission. In the revised manuscript, we perform both leading and lagging experiments using a biotin trap (and 32P-label on the biotinylated strand), and using the forked DNAs with equal 6bp spacing between the two biotin-streptavidins for both leading and lagging strands. The results show that Mcm10 enables bypass of the lagging strand blocks without displacing the streptavidin blocks, and that the leading strand streptavidins are in fact displaced from DNA (there was less efficient leading strand read through with the 6 bp spacing compared to the earlier 14 bp spacing). These data are now presented in a newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which shows the effectiveness of the biotin trap. The modified manuscript reads as follows:</p><p>âLagging strand blocks are bypassed while leading strand blocks are displaced. [â¦]Hence, Mcm10 appears to provide CMG with more translocation force than CMG alone, consistent with the increase in processivity of CMG in the presence of Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The four GINS subunits are not visible in the gel pictures of the isolated CMG-Mcm10 complexes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>.
