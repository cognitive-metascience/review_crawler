In budding yeast, Rad52 is the main mediator of Rad51 filament formation, thereby playing an essential role. The current model assumes that Rad51 filament formation requires the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51. However, we report here that Rad52 mutations that disrupt this interaction do not affect γ-ray- or HO endonuclease-induced gene conversion frequencies. In vivo and in vitro studies confirmed that Rad51 filaments formation is not affected by these mutations. Instead, we found that Rad52-Rad51 association makes Rad51 filaments toxic in Srs2-deficient cells after exposure to DNA damaging agents, independently of Rad52 role in Rad51 filament assembly. Importantly, we also demonstrated that Rad52 is essential for protecting Rad51 filaments against dissociation by the Srs2 DNA translocase. Our findings open new perspectives in the understanding of the role of Rad52 in eukaryotes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genome stability</kwd><kwd>homologous

conserved mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks. HR defects are associated with many hereditary and sporadic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerbinskaite et al., 2012</xref>), thus underlining the essential nature of this process. HR involves the interaction of the 3'-end of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule that is used as a template for DNA synthesis. In eukaryotes, the recombinase RAD51 forms a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA that performs synapsis and strand invasion of the homologous duplex DNA to form a stable D-loop. The resolution of the joint molecules completes repair (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Symington et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>RAD51 filament formation on ssDNA coated by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA requires additional factors, such as the mammalian mediator BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shahid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thorslund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) or the yeast protein Rad52 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Symington et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, Rad52 is the most important mediator of Rad51 filament formation and it was proposed that this function involves its interaction with both RPA and Rad51. A domain essential for interaction with RPA was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plate et al., 2008</xref>) and two motifs, FVTA at position 316–319 and YEKF at position 376–379, are each essential for interaction with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krejci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagawa et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In mammalian cells, RAD51 filament formation is mainly driven by BRCA2 and the role of RAD52 is still enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Heyer, 2011</xref>). RAD52 is required for the viability of BRCA2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2011</xref>), underlining the importance of its function. Recent studies revealed a role for RAD52 pairing activity in promoting DNA synthesis following replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>). However, RAD52 interaction with RPA and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 1996</xref>) suggests that RAD52 has a role in RAD51 filament regulation also in mammalian cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32744.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutations in the Rad51-binding domain of Rad52 suppress MMS and γ-ray sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary structure of Rad52.

Specifically, HR is accountable for the sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells to DNA damage. As Srs2 can dismantle Rad51 filaments in vitro, the accumulation of toxic Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells is probably responsible for this sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). The unproductive association of Rad51 with ssDNA could interfere with the normal progression of DNA replication forks or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboussekhra et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vasianovich et al., 2017</xref>). However, this control of toxic filaments suggests that functional Rad51 filaments are protected from Srs2 activity. The Rad55/57 and SHU complex, which contains Rad51 paralog proteins, was shown to provide such protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In several organisms, RAD51 paralogs also stabilize RAD51 filaments by inhibiting RAD51 dissociation from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Da Ines et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), thus ensuring the success of homology search. Rad52 might also share this role as shown by its association with Rad51 filaments after their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we proposed that this association is responsible for the toxicity of Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells because Rad52 mutations that do not affect Rad51 filament formation suppress the sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells to DNA-damaging agents. We also found that <italic>SIZ2</italic> overexpression promotes massive Rad52 sumoylation and leads to the suppression of Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that Rad52 sumoylation could trigger Rad52 dissociation from Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We sought to better understand the role of Rad52 in the formation of toxic Rad51 filaments. To this aim, we used a random mutagenesis approach to select new <italic>RAD52</italic> gene mutations that suppress the sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells to DNA damage. We found mutations that restrict the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51, showing that this interaction is responsible for Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. Unexpectedly, our genetic and molecular analyses show that the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 is not absolutely required for Rad51 filament assembly. Additionally, we found that in Srs2-proficient cells, Rad52 is required to protect Rad51 filaments from disruption by Srs2. Altogether, our results bring a different view on the regulation of Rad51 filaments by Rad52 and Srs2. We propose a unified model to explain the crucial roles of Rad52 and Srs2. The newly identified Rad52 role could be extended to other eukaryotes and to other mediator proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>rad52</italic> mutants that suppress Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells</title><p>To better understand the role of Rad52 in Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells, we searched for <italic>rad52</italic> mutants that upon DNA damage, suppress the lethality induced by Rad51 toxic filaments generated in the absence of Srs2.

To test further this correlation, we measured the MMS and γ-ray sensitivity of Srs2-defective cells carrying a mutation in one of the six well-conserved amino acids identified by sequence alignment in or around the YEKFAP domain of 12 Rad52 orthologs in fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

However, the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant did not fully rescue the phenotype of <italic>rad52</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), as indicated also by the six-fold reduction in survival at 200Gy compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).

The relatively lower γ-ray and MMS sensitivity of cells bearing mutations around the YEKFAP-binding domain compared with Rad52-deficient cells suggests that this interaction is largely dispensable for the formation of functional Rad51 filaments. This hypothesis was strengthened by the finding that inactivation of the <italic>SRS2</italic> gene fully suppressed the γ-ray and MMS sensitivity of <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,e</xref>). Therefore, the sensitivity of <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> cells to genotoxic agents is not related to a reduced Rad52 mediator activity, but results from Srs2 activity. This suggests a completely new view on Rad51 filament homeostasis because Rad52 appears to be essential for Rad51 filament assembly only through its interaction with RPA, whereas its interaction with Rad51 is dispensable. The Rad51-Rad52 interaction seems to be mostly required for the protection of Rad51 filaments from disruption by the translocase Srs2, and for the toxicity of Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> and <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> mutations impact the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51</title><p>To further address the relationship between the potential toxicity of Rad51 filaments and the interaction of Rad51 with Rad52, we tested the effect of Rad52 mutations around the YEKFAP domain on the capacity of FLAG-tagged Rad52 to co-immunoprecipitate with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

They also confirmed our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>) that Rad52 remains associated with Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The two Rad52 mutant proteins also remained associated with Rad51 filaments, albeit to a lower extent compared with WT Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This was surprising because the Rad52-Y376A variant harbors a mutation that largely impairs the interaction with Rad51 (our co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>). This difference could be explained by the low-salt concentration classically used for Rad51 filament formation in EM experiments (40 mM KCl). Indeed, Rad51 filament formation in the presence of 140 mM KCl led to a weaker association of WT and mutant Rad52 with Rad51 filaments, but Rad52-Y376A was still associated with Rad51 filaments.</p><p>Previous experiments showed that the in vitro φX174-based strand exchange reaction is significantly affected by <italic>rad52-YEKF</italic>∆ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krejci et al., 2002</xref>). However, we found that Rad52-P381S and Rad52-Y376A did not strongly affect Rad51 filament formation on φX174 ssDNA and that they efficiently promoted HR in vivo. Therefore, we tested the two mutated proteins in the strand exchange experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). As previously described, RPA pre-bound to ssDNA reduced strand exchange by approximately fourfold compared to the standard reaction, where Rad51 is added prior to RPA. The concomitant addition of Rad52 and Rad51 released the inhibition by pre-bound RPA and led to a threefold increase in strand exchange. We found that Rad52-P381S can release the RPA inhibition as efficiently as the WT protein, whereas Rad52-Y376A is affected, confirming the results obtained with Rad52-YEKF∆. Although Rad51 filament formation mediated by the mutated Rad52 proteins was only slightly affected, strand exchange in vitro was strongly affected. This is in contrast with our observation in vivo, suggesting that other activities could compensate for the Rad52 mutations in vivo.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether Rad52-Rad51 interaction stabilizes Rad51 filaments. This effect could explain how Rad52 triggers Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. We previously demonstrated that the association of Rad52 with Rad51 filaments is challenged at salt concentrations lower than those required to destabilize Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we challenged the stability of Rad51 filaments by incubation with excess ssDNA (ɸX174 viral (+) strand). This experiment could not be done by EM, because the competing DNA hinders the spreading of Rad51 filaments on carbon grids. Rad51 filaments were formed by adding Rad51 with Rad52 or Rad52-Y376A on a 400nucleotides (nt)-long Cy5-labeled ssDNA pre-coated with RPA. The previously described optimal stoichiometric conditions were used with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>; see Materials and methods). Analysis of glutaraldehyde-fixed-protein complexes by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>) showed that Rad52-Y376A assembled Rad51 filaments as efficiently as WT Rad52. This confirmed our EM observation and our in vivo results that the Rad52-Rad51 interaction is not strictly required for Rad51 filament formation. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min to allow Rad51 filament formation, competing ɸX174 viral (+) strand was added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 30 min. Surprisingly, the stability of Rad51 filaments assembled with Rad52 or Rad52-Y376A was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We confirmed this result using a benzonase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This suggested that losing the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 does not affect the stability of Rad51 filaments. However, we previously showed by EM that only 10% of Rad51 filaments assembled on the same 400nt-long ssDNA are associated with more than one Rad52 spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we cannot rule out that the amount of Rad52 associated with Rad51 filaments was too low to show an effect on stability in this assay and we cannot conclude on the effect of Rad52 on Rad51 filament stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Rad52 protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2 dismantling activity in vitro</title><p>To test whether Rad52 protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2 dismantling activity, we incubated Srs2 with Rad51 filaments assembled in vitro on ɸX174 ssDNA for 5 min, and analyzed the resulting nucleoprotein complexes by EM. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>), Srs2 efficiently disrupted Rad51 filaments when Rad51 was added prior to RPA. Only 11% of DNA molecules remained covered with Rad51 after 5 min of incubation with Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Conversely, when Rad52 and Rad51 were added together on RPA-coated ssDNA, 90% of complete Rad52-associated Rad51 filaments were still present after 5 min of incubation with Srs2. This result clearly indicated that Rad52 protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2 dismantling activity. This protection was weakened when Rad51 filaments were formed in the presence of Rad52-P381S or Rad52-Y376A (only 60 and 14% of complete Rad51 filaments after 5 min).</p><p>As Srs2 also inhibits the φX174-based strand exchange reaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>), we used this assay to confirm Rad52 protective effect. Addition of 66 nM Srs2 was enough to inhibit the strand exchange reaction when Rad51 was added to ssDNA prior to RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Conversely, when Rad52 was added with Rad51 on RPA-coated ssDNA, half of the products were still formed in the presence of the same concentration of Srs2. Double Srs2 concentration was required to efficiently inhibit the reaction in the presence of Rad52. Srs2-mediated inhibition was dependent on Rad52-Rad51 interaction because strand exchange catalyzed by Rad52-P381S was largely reduced.</p><p>Rad52 capacity to protect Rad51 filaments could be the consequence of a direct interaction with Srs2, and we found by pull-down assay that Rad52 and Srs2 interacted. This interaction was not affected by the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Moreover, Rad52 did not affect Srs2 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the presence of Rad52 within Rad51 filaments controls Srs2, probably through a competition mechanism rather than by direct inhibition of the Rad51-catalyzed Srs2 translocase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rad52 interaction with Rad51 is responsible for the toxicity of Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells</title><p>We previously showed that Rad52 is involved in the toxicity of Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esta et al., 2013</xref>). To understand the underlying mechanism, we conducted a <italic>RAD52</italic> gene mutation screen to identify mutations that could suppress the toxicity of Rad51 filaments without affecting their formation. Among the hits, we found several mutations in amino acid residues located within the Rad52 domain that contains an essential motif for its interaction with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krejci et al., 2002</xref>). The extended analysis of this domain by directed mutagenesis showed that there is a correlation between the impairment of the Rad52-Rad51 interaction by these mutations and their ability to suppress the Srs2-deficient cell phenotype. Specifically, <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> restores resistance to DNA damage in <italic>srs2</italic>∆ homozygous diploid cells exposed to γ-rays as well as viability of <italic>srs2</italic>∆ haploid cells in which a HO-induced DSB is repaired by SSA.

ChIP analyses confirmed that the impaired interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 does not affect Rad51 recruitment to ssDNA at DSB sites in Srs2-deficient cells. Thus, from these in vivo observations we infer that the suppression of the <italic>srs2</italic>∆ cell phenotype cannot be attributed to a lower mediator activity of Rad52-Y376A. In turn, this suggests that the potential toxicity of Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells is related to the association of Rad52 with Rad51 filaments. In agreement, our EM analysis of Rad51 filament assembly on φX174 ssDNA indicates that the association of Rad52-Y376A with Rad51 filaments is reduced compared with WT Rad52.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does Rad52 association with Rad51 filaments lead to toxicity in the absence of Srs2?</title><p>Surprisingly, we found that the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutation strongly impairs the interaction with Rad51 (co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments), while it affects only partially the association of Rad52 with Rad51 filaments observed by EM. We hypothesize that this mutation affects mostly the interaction between protomers, which could be the most common interaction in the nucleus. On the other hand, the interaction with Rad51 filaments could be complex. Besides its interaction with Rad51 through the YEKFAP domain, Rad52 could associates with Rad51 filaments through DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mortensen et al., 1996</xref>), or via interaction with residual DNA-bound RPA. Moreover, the Rad52 FVTA motif, which is essential for binding to Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagawa et al., 2014</xref>), could also be involved in the association of Rad52 with Rad51 nucleofilaments.</p><p>Similarly to what was proposed for the Rad51 paralogues SWS-1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>) and Rad55/Rad57 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), we suggest that Rad52 could be involved in the stabilization of Rad51 filaments in vivo in yeast. Although we did not see any effect of the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutation on the stability of Rad51 filaments (ssDNA competition assay) or on protection against benzonase endonuclease activity, it is clear that this mutation suppresses Rad51 filament toxicity and rescues most of the phenotypes of Srs2-deficient haploids and diploids cells. It is possible that the toxic effect of Rad52 binding to Rad51 filaments requires the association with the yeast Rad51 paralogues Rad55/Rad57 and the SHU complex. Rad52-stabilized Rad51 nucleofilaments might lead to different disturbances that cause the toxicity observed in Srs2-deficient cells. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vasianovich et al. (2017)</xref> recently proposed that Rad51 has to be removed from ssDNA to allow de novo DNA synthesis to fill in the gaps formed during the SSA process.

The physical interaction we found between Rad52 and Srs2 might have a synergic effect on Rad51 filament protection.

In WT cells, we suggest that destabilization of Rad51 filaments following Rad52 sumoylation is not fast enough and Srs2 is required to catalyze rapid Rad51 removal once Rad52 is dissociated to avoid the formation of toxic Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>).

Rad52 would be associated with Rad51 filaments long enough to ensure their protection against Srs2 and the stability required to promote homology search. Once this process is achieved, events, such as joint formation, D-loop formation or DNA synthesis, would trigger Siz2-dependent Rad52 sumoylation. Cdc48 would then induce Rad52 dissociation, allowing Srs2 to remove Rad51 from ssDNA. Srs2 activity would be essential to allow subsequent steps to occur, such as DNA synthesis, or to displace Rad51 to avoid improper dsDNA invasion. Srs2 might also be required to displace the invading strand and to promote synthesis-dependent strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupaigne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

Indeed, mice lacking RAD52 have a mild phenotype (for a review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Heyer, 2011</xref>), but RAD52 is required for the viability of BRCA2-deficient cells, the canonical RAD51 loader in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies revealed a role for RAD52 pairing activity in promoting DNA synthesis following replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sotiriou et al., 2016</xref>). This role is independent from those of BRCA2 and RAD51. However, RAD52 capacity to interact with RPA and RAD51 suggests a role in RAD51 filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 1996</xref>). Monitoring of RAD51 in U2OS cells depleted for the Cdc48 orthologue p97 and treated with zeocin shows a striking abnormal nuclear assembly of RAD51. Interestingly, these structures are strongly reduced by simultaneous depletion of RAD52, but barely by depletion of BRCA2. This suggests that BRCA2 is not primarily involved in RAD51 loading at these structures, but rather RAD52, like in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergink et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly to the situation in yeast, Cdc48/p97 might be required to unload RAD52 that would otherwise stabilize these abnormal RAD51 structures. Therefore, like in yeast, mammalian RAD52 might be involved in RAD51 filament formation and stabilization in contexts that remain to be defined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>RAD52</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>SGD: YML032C</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>RAD51</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>SGD: YER095W</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>Srs2</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>SGD: YJL092W</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Bacteriophage φ-X174</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">viral (+) strand of φX174 DNA</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>FF18733</td><td/><td/><td>Cell line maintained <break/>in E.

Whole cell extracts (1 mg) were incubated with 2 μg of a rabbit anti-Rad51 polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at 4°C for 1 hr. Then, 50 μl of Dynabeads coupled to Protein A (Invitrogen) was added, and the incubation continued for another hour. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 1X Laemmli buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by western blotting. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C Super membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal (Sigma, 1/10,000), rabbit anti-Rad51 polyclonal (1/2000) or rabbit anti-DPS1 polyclonal antibody (1/30,000, a gift from S. Marcand). Blots were then incubated with monoclonal goat anti-mouse IR800 or goat anti-rabbit IR700 or IR800 secondary antibodies (1/10,000, Advansta). Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using the Odyssey CLx system (Li-cor Biosciences). The presence of Rad51 in the immunoprecipitated fractions could not be detected to validate the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation because it migrates at the same level as the anti-Rad51 IgG. However, the absence of Rad52 in the <italic>rad51</italic>∆ immunoprecipitates confirmed that the detected Rad52-FLAG signals were related to the Rad52-Rad51 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ChIP experiments and quantitative PCR analyses</title><p>Cells were grown in YPD until late exponential phase. After inoculation in 400 ml of YPLactate, cultures were grown to a concentration of 5 to 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. A 50 ml sample was removed at the 0 hr time-point and then galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%. Incubation was continued and 50 ml samples were removed at different time-points. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, which was subsequently neutralized with 125 mM glycine. Cells were centrifuged and washed with TBS buffer (20 mM Tris pH8, 150 mM NaCl). Cell pellets were then frozen at −20°C. ChIP was carried out as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugawara and Haber, 2006</xref>). Samples were incubated with 2 µg of rabbit anti-RPA polyclonal (a gift from V.

Following washes, protein elution and crosslink reversal, samples were incubated with proteinase K followed by DNA purification with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). The primers used for QPCR were EMO102 (CCC TGT GTG TTC TCG TTA TGT T) and EMO103 (TAA GGC GCC TGA TTC AAG A) for amplification at 0.6 kb from the DSB site, EMO65 (CCA AAT AGC CAA TGG TGT CA) and EMO66 (CCA AGA TGC AAA CCG AAT AA) for amplification at 7.6 kb from the DSB site, EMO100 (AGC AAA GTT GGG TGA AGT ATG GTA) and EMO101 (CAA ATT TGT CTA GTG TGG GAA CG) for amplification at the <italic>ARG5,6</italic> locus. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and an Eppendorf Realplex system.

The resin was washed with large volumes (100–150 ml) of buffer Kc. Proteins were eluted with buffer Kc containing 200 mM imidazole. The buffer was changed with a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) to buffer K (20 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT) containing 150 mM KCl. Next, proteins were loaded to a 1 ml Hi-trap heparin column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 10 ml gradient of 150–500 mM KCl in buffer K. The Rad52-containing fractions were pooled and the buffer changed to buffer K containing 120 mM KCl with a PD10 column. Proteins were loaded in a 1 ml RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted through a 10 ml gradient of 120–500 mM KCl in buffer K. The Rad52-containing fractions were pooled, diluted to a final concentration of 200 mM KCl and glycerol was added (10% final concentration). Rad52 concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 30,495 mole/l/cm at 280 nm.</p><p>RPA was purified from the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5496 (<italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>, <italic>leu2∆1</italic>, <italic>his3∆200</italic>, <italic>pep4::HIS3</italic>, <italic>prb∆1.6R</italic>, <italic>can1</italic>, <italic>GAL</italic>).

Partial Rad51 filaments range from 1500 to 2500 nm while the size of complete Rad51 filaments is 2800 nm. Srs2 dismantling effect was tested by adding 200 nM Srs2 and 1 mM ATP to the Rad51 filament formation reaction at 37°C for 5 min. Of each reaction, 5 μl was deposited onto a 600 mesh copper grid coated with a thin carbon film, previously activated by glow-discharge in the presence of pentylamine (Merck, France). After 1 min, grids were washed with aqueous 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Merck, France) and then dried with ashless filter paper (VWR, France).

Standard reactions were done by adding Rad51 prior to RPA. The addition of 50 nM Srs2 and an ATP regeneration system (20 U/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 U/ml lactate deshydrogenase, 0.4 mg/ml NADH) initiated the ATP hydrolysis reaction. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 37°C using a microplate spectrophotometer (CLARIO Star, BMG LABTech) every 2 min for 20 min. ATP hydrolysis was expressed as the ratio between the absorbance at 340 nm at a given time and the absorbance measured before Srs2 addition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Molecular biology platform (Cigex) of our Institute, Eléa Dizet, Xavier Veaute and Didier Busso for cloning, directed mutagenesis and for RPA, Rad51 and Srs2 purification.

Your article has been reviewed by by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.

In contrast, the Srs2 helicase disrupts the Rad51 filaments and served as &quot;anti-recombinase&quot; to remove unscheduled recombination intermediates. In this study, Ma et al., screen for mutants of the Rad52 protein that are able to suppress the MMS sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells as a way to explore the role of Rad52 in Rad51 filaments in DSB repair and how this relates with Srs2 function. Surprisingly, the authors find mutations in the FAP and YEKF domains of Rad52, which are known to impair Rad52 binding to Rad51, among those suppressors. The study is focused in two of the mutants selected, rad52-P381S and rad52-Y376A with different degrees of suppression. Based on genetic and biochemical analysis of these rad52 mutants, including EM analysis of Rad51 filaments, Ma et al. concluded that Rad51-Rad52 association is important for the protection of Rad51-filament against Srs2 helicase that dismantles Rad51 filament in an ATPase dependent manner.</p><p>The Rad52's role in a post-assembly step of Rad51 filament by the filament stabilization is an important conclusion, since the role of Rad52 to promote the formation of Rad51 filament as a mediator in pre-assembly step is believed to be a main function of Rad52 for Rad51-dynamics in the recombination. Indeed, a similar role to protect Rad51 filament against Srs2 helicase has been reported to Rad55-57 complex by W. Heyer's group. The authors also provide evidence favoring that Rad52-Rad51 interaction promotes the mediator function, and that the role of the 51-52 interaction goes beyond protection against Srs2, which should be properly discussed. Although most results are convincing and the conclusions relevant, few issues should be addressed to get further mechanistic insight on how Rad52 stabilizes Rad51-filaments on ssDNA.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- Different results in this paper argue against the conclusion that &quot;the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 is not required for Rad51 filament assembly, but for preventing Rad51 filament disassembly by Srs2&quot;: (a) the SSA assay (Figure 4A) showing that cells lacking srs2 are impaired in SSA because Rad51 filaments are more stable, and that P381S and Y376A Rad52 mutants (in srs2Δ) rescues SSA because they reduce the stability/formation of Rad51 filaments, demonstrates that the mutations have a phenotype in the absence of Srs2, and the effect of the Rad51-Rad52 interaction is therefore not specific to protection from Srs2; (b) the Rad52-Y376A mutant accumulates more RPA and less Rad51 as shown by ChIP (Figure 5), and is severely impaired in strand exchange (Figure 6C), consistent with a Rad51-Rad52 interaction for the mediator role, and (c) if the interaction of Rad51-Rad52 were not important for HR but to prevent filament disassembly by Srs2, it would be necessary to explain why Rad52 P381S and Y376A mutants have such a strong phenotype without Srs2 (Figure 4B), The manuscript should be therefore rewritten to acknowledge these points.</p><p>- Do the Rad51 Y376A or P381S mutations affect interaction with the Rad51 filament? This could be tested by performing pulldowns with biotinylated oligonucleotides pre-bound with Rad51. The assay should also be used to directly test the effect of Rad52 on the protection of Rad51 filaments from disruption by Srs2 (e.g., see Figure 2 in Liu et al., 2011) by preparing Rad51 filaments on ssDNA, without or with Rad52, and challenging it with Srs2 or e.g. DNAseI. This will dissect whether the effect is Srs2-specific, or whether Rad52 stabilizes the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament.</p><p>- Most interactions of Rad52 mutant proteins with Rad51 had been tested in the presence of 140mM NaCl (Figure 2). However, EM analysis (in the presence of 40 mM KCl) clearly showed that Rad52 mutant proteins associate with Rad51 filaments to the similar extent to the wild-type Rad52 protein (Figure 6B). This discrepancy should be clarified by doing IP or pull-down experiments under the same condition for EM analysis and vice versa.</p><p>- Although Rad52 stabilizes Rad51 filaments against the translocase activity of Srs2, it is important to show biochemically Rad52 indeed stabilizes Rad51 filament even in the absence of Srs2 by examining the effect of Rad52 on Rad51 filament by high salt attack or challenging by excess amounts of ssDNAs (with ATP turnover). This can be easily tested by analyzing Rad51 filaments by EM or by measuring ATPase activity of Rad51. This approach would also reveal a mechanism on how Rad52 stabilizes Rad51 even in the absence of Srs2.</p><p>- Although Rad52 does not inhibit ATPase activity of Srs2, it is important to show that Rad52 by itself does not inhibit the helicase activity of Srs2, given that Rad52 and Srs2 interacts with each other.</p><p>- The ChIP-qPCR shown in Figure 5 for Rad52 seems to have been performed with a Rad52-FLAG. Since the authors are analyzing two specific mutants for Rad52, it seems that they are detecting is a WT copy of Rad52 carrying FLAG, so that the mutant rad52 proteins are not detected. Those experiments need to be explained better how they were performed. If the authors are detecting only wt Rad52, this needs to be discussed. It is unclear what would be meaning of those data because authors are not detecting the mutant Rad52, subject of study. The results as such are confusing and needs to be clarified.</p><p>- It is a bit surprising to use a SSA system that does not allow for identification of recombinants by a genetic selection of Leu2+ recombinants. However, authors should try to determine recombination via qPCR in the SSA assay used in Figure 4. It would be nice to see whether in the srs2 rad52-P381S and srs2 rad52-Y376S mutants the frequency of recombination accompanies the data of survival.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32744.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In yeast, the Rad52 protein has a recombination mediator function to load Rad51 on RPA-coated ssDNA, which facilitates recombination.

As stated in the last paragraph of the Introduction, we found previously that Rad52 is at the origin of Srs2-deficient cell MMS sensitivity, possibly through the interaction with Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments. We hypothesized that this association confers an excessive stability to Rad51 filaments in Srs2-deficient cells. We have defined such filaments as toxic, because they are responsible for MMS sensitivity in Srs2-deficient cells. In the present work, we designed a genetic screen to identify Rad52 mutations that suppress MMS sensitivity and consequently Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. In the first part of the Results section, we report that with this screen, we identified mutations in the Rad51 binding domain. This finding confirmed that the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 is responsible for Rad51 filament toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. Therefore, we conducted a mutational analysis of the Rad51 binding domain (second and third part of the Results section) to confirm this link. The finding that the stronger suppressor phenotype can be attributed mostly to mutations that affect the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 confirmed this link. In conclusion, Rad52 is responsible for the death of Srs2-deficient cells following exposure to MMS or γ-rays, because of its interaction with Rad51.</p><p>As underlined by the reviewers, we found that the Rad52-P381S and Rad52-Y376Amutants also rescue SSA in Srs2-deficient cells. In the first part of the Discussion section, we propose that the interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 is responsible for the toxicity of Rad51 filaments at the HO-induced DSB site in Srs2-deficient cells. Therefore, Rad52 would have at least two functions that are Srs2-independent: (i) displacement of RPA to mediate Rad51 filament formation, and (ii) stabilization of Rad51 filaments, which is the cause of their toxicity in the absence of Srs2. Nevertheless, we agree that we have not underlined enough the involvement of Rad52 in Rad51 filament toxicity in several parts of the paper, which could be misleading. For clarification, we modified the Abstract, the last paragraph of the Introduction section, and the Results section. We cannot introduce this notion in the Title because of character restrictions, but we added the idea that Rad52-Rad51 is facultative to filament formation, which is another conclusion about the Srs2-independent functions of Rad52 (see next section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The Rad52-Y376A mutant accumulates more RPA and less Rad51 as shown by ChIP (Figure 5), and is severely impaired in strand exchange (Figure 6C), consistent with a Rad51-Rad52 interaction for the mediator role.</p></disp-quote><p>About point (b), the reason we claim that the Rad52-Rad51 interaction is not essential to the formation of Rad51 filaments is based on several results we think it is important to summarize here before considering the ChIP experiment addressed by the reviewers. As explained in the Abstract and in the first two parts of the Results section, the double mutants <italic>rad52-P381S srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ are not sensitive to MMS or γ-ray irradiation (Figure 1). This shows thatMMS and γ-ray sensitivity in the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> single mutants are dependent on Srs2 activity. When Srs2 is depleted, the loss of interaction between Rad52 and Rad51 (as observed by co-IP and pull-down experiments) does not impact HR sufficiently to impair repair. Actually, measurement of γ-ray-induced HR frequencies in the recombination system between heteroalleles of the <italic>ARG4</italic> gene (Figure 3 and subsection “Rad52 interaction with Rad51 is dispensable for gene conversion”) shows that HR is not affected in the mutants. In addition, we observed that repair by gene conversion of a HO-induced DSB is not significantly affected by <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> (now in Figure 3). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that both Rad52 mutants, despite the weak interaction with Rad51, form Rad51 filaments. This notion is now added in the Title. It is true that other regions that would bind to Rad51 (even very weakly, according to the faint interaction we observed with the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant even when pull-down assays were performed with 40mM NaCl) could help the loading of the protein. We added a comment in subsection “The <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> and <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> mutations impact the interaction between Rad52 157 and Rad51” to underline this point. The domains that could be involved in the association of Rad52-Y376A with Rad51 filaments are discussed in the Discussion section. Nevertheless, the Srs2-independent role of Rad52 is related to the stability and not to the formation of Rad51 filaments.</p><p>Concerning the ChIP experiments (Figure 5), it is true that the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant accumulates more RPA and less Rad51, as it was explained in the Results section. Two hypotheses can be made from this observation. The first one is that <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> is not able to normally assemble Rad51 filaments. The second proposes that according to the genetic relationship we observed between <italic>srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic>, Srs2 removes more efficiently Rad51 filaments because they are less protected by the Rad52 mutants. We observed that in <italic>rad52P381S srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ double mutants, Rad51 is recruited at similar levels as in <italic>srs2</italic>∆ cells. This demonstrates, first, that Srs2 activity is responsible for the reduction in Rad51 recruitment in Rad52 mutants and, secondly, that both Rad52 mutants can form Rad51 filaments as efficiently as in WT, if Srs2 is depleted. To make this conclusion clearer, we modified the text in subsection “Rad52 interaction with Rad51 is dispensable for Rad51 filament formation at a HO-212 induced DSB but is essential for preventing Rad51 filament disassembly by Srs2” to develop this demonstration better.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewers, it is true that the Rad52-Y376A mutant is severely impaired in strand exchange (now Figure 5C). This point is mentioned in the Results section. However, the reviewers have not compared this result with our observation that Rad52-Y376A forms Rad51 filaments on RPA-covered ssDNA (now Figure 5A). The mediator activity of the mutant protein is robust because 15 min incubation of Rad52-Y376A with Rad51 on RPA-covered ssDNA leads to the formation of 70% of complete Rad51 filaments, compared to 100% with the WT protein and 25% in the absence of Rad52 in the reaction. We cannot explain why this large amount of complete Rad51 filaments cannot achieve strand invasion and we discussed this point in the Discussion section. However, it is important to keep in mind that, as discussed above, Rad52-Y376A forms enough Rad51 filaments in vivo to ensure proper DNA repair after MMS and γ-rays irradiation or HO-induced DSB formation. We also added to the Discussion section that the Rad51 paralogues Rad55/Rad57 and SHU can compensate the effect of the mutation in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) If the interaction of Rad51-Rad52 were not important for HR but to prevent filament disassembly by Srs2, it would be necessary to explain why Rad52 <italic>P381S</italic> and <italic>Y376A</italic> mutants have such a strong phenotype without Srs2 (Figure 4B), The manuscript should be therefore rewritten to acknowledge these points.</p></disp-quote><p>About point c), the strong phenotype of the double mutants <italic>rad52-P381S srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ observed in Figure 4B cannot be attributed to an inability of the Rad52 mutant proteins to assemble functional Rad51 filaments. As explained in the Results section, the new Figure 3B shows that the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant cells are not defective for the repair of a HO induced DSB at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus by gene conversion. Gene conversion absolutely requires the formation of Rad51 filaments to invade the donor sequence. Therefore, the only possible explanation for the finding that these two Rad52 mutants show only a slight decrease in viability after HO cut (not statistically significant for the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and barely significant for the <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant) is that Rad51 filaments are formed at the DSB site, which is observed at another locus in our ChIP experiments. However, viability of Srs2-deficient cells is very low after HO-induction in the gene conversion system. As explained in the Results section, this strong lethality has been described before (Ira et al., 2003). In Srs2-deficient cells, a large number of recombination events happening through the SDSA pathway are not resolved properly, leading to cell death. It is this defect that also leads to lethality in cells harboring the double <italic>rad52-P381S srs2</italic>∆ and <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ mutations. If <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ double mutant cells were sensitive to the HO-induced DSB because Rad52-Y376A cannot assemble Rad51 filaments, then, <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> cells also would be sensitive to DSB formation. This is not the case. Moreover, the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> or <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutants do not reduce γ-ray-induced HR, as measured in the <italic>ARG4</italic> system (Figure 3).</p><p>In summary, it seems that the way we presented our data was confusing because major conclusions were not understood. Consequently, we introduced major changes in the organization of the Results section. First, at the end of the second chapter, we explained the assumptions that can be made from our first results. Second, we grouped our two gene conversion assays together (<italic>ARG4</italic> and <italic>MAT</italic>) because they both show that the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutations do not affect gene conversion (Figure 3). Then, we decided to present directly the ChIP experiments because they confirm at the molecular level that the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutant cells can assemble Rad51 filaments in Srs2deficient cells. Finally, we present the results obtained with the SSA system. By presenting the ChIP experiments before the SSA system results, it is easier for the reader to understand that the rescue of the <italic>srs2</italic>∆ phenotypes by the Rad52 mutations is not related to a default in Rad51 filament formation, but more certainly to the destabilization of Rad51 filaments in vivo by the loss of Rad52-Rad51 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Do the Rad51 <italic>Y376A</italic> or <italic>P381S</italic> mutations affect interaction with the Rad51 filament? This could be tested by performing pulldowns with biotinylated oligonucleotides pre-bound with Rad51. The assay should also be used to directly test the effect of Rad52 on the protection of Rad51 filaments from disruption by Srs2 (e.g., see Figure 2 in Liu et al., 2011) by preparing Rad51 filaments on ssDNA, without or with Rad52, and challenging it with Srs2 or e.g. DNAseI. This will dissect whether the effect is Srs2-specific, or whether Rad52 stabilizes the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we counted the number of WT and mutated Rad52 molecules observed by EM on in vitro assembled Rad51 filaments (previous Figure 6B). This experiment shows a significant decrease in the average number of mutated Rad52 associated with the filaments (now Figure 5B). We now present this result in a clearer way in the text (subsection “in vitroanalysis of Rad52 activities when interaction with Rad51 is altered”) and we changed the representation of our data on the graph.</p><p>We agree that pulldown assays could have provided useful information on Rad52 effect on Rad51 filaments. However, a series of technical problems did not allow us to obtain results, despite several attempts to optimize the assay (see annex for technical details). Consequently, we assessed the role of Rad52 on Rad51 filaments formed on 400nucleotides (nt)-long ssDNA by using a gel shift assay we described before (Esta et al., 2013), to avoid the use of streptavidin beads. In fact, we did several preliminary experiments before submitting the original version of the manuscript, but we were not convinced that this assay would allow testing correctly the role of Rad52 when associated with Rad51 filaments. Indeed, we observed previously by EM that only 10% of complete Rad51 filaments were associated with more than one Rad52 spot (Esta et al., 2013). Therefore, we worried that experiments designed to study Rad52 effect on Rad51 filaments with this assay would be difficult to interpret. Anyway, following your suggestions, we decided to carry out several experiments to test whether we could obtain some positive data. These results are described below in the section concerning Rad51 filament stability because several questions overlap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Most interactions of Rad52 mutant proteins with Rad51 had been tested in the presence of 140mM NaCl (Figure 2). However, EM analysis (in the presence of 40 mM KCl) clearly showed that Rad52 mutant proteins associate with Rad51 filaments to the similar extent to the wild-type Rad52 protein (Figure 6B). This discrepancy should be clarified by doing IP or pull-down experiments under the same condition for EM analysis and vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. Consequently, we performed EM analysis in the presence of 140mM NaCl and pull-down assays in the presence of 40mM NaCl. We found that a light interaction could be observed by pull-down assay at this low salt concentration, and that Rad52-Y376A still interacts with Rad51 filaments at high salt concentration (43% of WT). These results were added to the manuscript and discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Although Rad52 stabilizes Rad51 filaments against the translocase activity of Srs2, it is important to show biochemically Rad52 indeed stabilizes Rad51 filament even in the absence of Srs2 by examining the effect of Rad52 on Rad51 filament by high salt attack or challenging by excess amounts of ssDNAs (with ATP turnover). This can be easily tested by analyzing Rad51 filaments by EM or by measuring ATPase activity of Rad51. This approach would also reveal a mechanism on how Rad52 stabilizes Rad51 even in the absence of Srs2.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer these questions, as well as the previous remarks concerning the potential effect of the <italic>rad52-P381S</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> mutations on Rad52 interaction with Rad51 filaments, we analyzed Rad51 filament formation on 400nt-long ssDNA using a gel shift assay. First, we showed that Rad52-Y376A could assemble Rad51 filaments despites its poor association with Rad51, confirming our EM observation on PhiX174 DNA. This is now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and is also detailed in subsection”in vitroanalysis of Rad52 activities when interaction with Rad51 is altered”.</p><p>We agree that it is important to test whether Rad52 can stabilize Rad51 filaments in vitro. However, this cannot be addressed simply by high salt attack because we published earlier that Rad52 is displaced at the low salt concentrations to which the Rad51 filament is not sensitive (Esta et al., 2013). This was confirmed here by the EM analysis of Rad51 filament formation. WT Rad52 is already strongly displaced from filaments in the presence of 150mM NaCl. Therefore, we decided to challenge Rad51 filaments by using excess amounts of ssDNA. Unfortunately, this experiment cannot be done by EM, because the competing DNA hinders the spreading of Rad51 filaments on carbon grids. Consequently, we set up experiments using our previously described gel shift assay (Esta et al., 2013). We challenged filaments with an excess of ssDNA (we used PhiX174 ssDNA at concentration 2 to 5fold higher than that of 400nt-long ssDNA). We found no difference in the stability of Rad51 filaments assembled with WT Rad52 or Rad52-Y376A (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). We also performed experiments with benzonase (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B), but again, we did not see any difference between Rad51 filaments assembled with Rad52 or Rad52-Y376A. As our EM observations show that only 10% of Rad51 filaments are associated with more than one Rad52 spot, it is difficult to reach a conclusion. We now explain that our result might indicate that Rad52 cannot stabilize Rad51 filaments or that there is not enough Rad52 associated with Rad51 in these experiments. It is important to remember that Rad52 concentration cannot be increased in these experiments because it results in an inhibition of Rad51 filament formation. We also tested Rad51 filament stability by measuring Rad51 ATPase activity using the assay described in Li et al., (2007). No ATPase activity difference was observed between Rad51 filament formed with WT or mutated Rad52. Therefore, we found no way to address the question of the stabilization of Rad51 filaments by Rad52 by biochemical assays. We present this problem in the text, and this justifies the use of PhiX DNA, which is larger (5 kb), to test the effect of the Rad52 mutations on Rad51 filament formation and protection against Srs2. Effectively, the EM observation of Rad51 filaments formed with the mutated proteins shows undoubtedly that Rad52-Y376A can assemble Rad51 filaments and that Rad52 protects Rad51 filaments from Srs2 translocase activity.</p><p>Concerning the effect of the Y376A and P381S mutations on Rad52 association with the Rad51 filament, we cannot address this question with the gel shift assay. Previously, we showed by western blot analysis of the different nucleoprotein complexes separated on agarose gels that Rad52 could be detected on complete Rad51 filaments (Esta et al., 2013). We could do this using an anti-Rad52 polyclonal antibody provided by Stephen Jentsch. Unfortunately, this antibody is no longer available. We tested recently a commercial anti-Rad52 antibody (Santa Cruz), but we found that it cross-reacts with Rad51. We also used an anti-FLAG antibody because Rad52 is FLAG-tagged in our experiments. This antibody revealed Rad52-FLAG in cell extracts analyzed by western blotting and was used in our co-IP and ChIP experiments. However, this antibody cannot detect Rad52 associated with Rad51 filaments in gel shift assays. The tag might be hidden in the context of the Rad52/Rad51/ssDNA complex, or Rad52 C-terminus could suffer proteolysis in vitro. Altogether, these results are disappointing, but we think that our EM study of Rad51 filament formation on PhiX174 DNA shows the effect of <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> and <italic>rad52P381S</italic> on the association of Rad52 with Rad51 filaments (now Figure 5B). We also used this gel shift assay to try to confirm the Rad52 inhibitory effect on Srs2 activity observed by EM (now Figure 5D). However, we failed. Again, this might be caused by the low number of Rad52 molecules associated with filaments assembled on 400nt-long ssDNA. Therefore, there might be a minimum size of Rad51 filament required to observe the effect of Rad52 on Srs2. We cannot exclude either that the PhiX174 DNA circular nature is important for observing this inhibition in vitro. These hypotheses will require to be tested in a complete study of the inhibition of Srs2 by Rad52. We decided not to include these results in the manuscript at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Although Rad52 does not inhibit ATPase activity of Srs2, it is important to show that Rad52 by itself does not inhibit the helicase activity of Srs2, given that Rad52 to Srs2 interacts with each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We faced a technical problem also with this experiment (see annex) and decided not to include it in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The ChIP-qPCR shown in Figure 5 for Rad52 seems to have been performed with a Rad52-FLAG. Since the authors are analyzing two specific mutants for Rad52, it seems that they are detecting is a WT copy of Rad52 carrying FLAG, so that the mutant rad52 proteins are not detected. Those experiments need to be explained better how they were performed. If the authors are detecting only wt Rad52, this needs to be discussed. It is unclear what would be meaning of those data because authors are not detecting the mutant Rad52, subject of study. The results as such are confusing and needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were done in haploid cells. Therefore, there is only one of Rad52-FLAG that is expressed (WT or mutant). The protein detected is WT or mutant and there is never co-expression of WT and mutant protein. This has been clarified in the text (subsection “Rad52 interaction with Rad51 is dispensable for Rad51 filament formation at a HO-induced DSB but is essential for preventing Rad51 filament disassembly by Srs2”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is a bit surprising to use a SSA system that does not allow for identification of recombinants by a genetic selection of Leu2+ recombinants. However, authors should try to determine recombination via qPCR in the SSA assay used in Figure 4. It would be nice to see whether in the srs2 rad52-P381S and srs2 rad52-Y376S mutants the frequency of recombination accompanies the data of survival.</p></disp-quote><p>A system that allows the formation of LEU<sup>+</sup> recombinants would allow the formation of prototrophes by gene conversion. The SSA system we used was designed by (Vaze et al., 2002) to allow the repair of a HO-induced DSB only by SSA and not by a classical gene conversion mechanism (DSBR). This is why repair events cannot be selected. As described in the 2002 paper, the amount of product in Srs2-deficient cells does not reflect cell survival. The amount of product is surprisingly high despite the low viability of Srs2-deficient cells. We repeated this experiment by using PCR with primers that specifically amplify the repair products and showed that the amount of product was roughly the same in WT and <italic>srs2</italic>∆ cells. We also found the same for <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic> and <italic>rad52-Y376A srs2</italic>∆ cells. Because this was described earlier for <italic>srs2</italic>∆, and was not changed by <italic>rad52-Y376A</italic>, we chose not to add it in the paper.</p><p><bold>Annex</bold></p><p>Pull-down assay</p><p>When trying to set up the pull-down assay, we faced several problems that are, in part, related to the complexity of Rad51 filament formation in vitro. As described by Esta et al. (2013), the addition of Rad51 and Rad52 to a 400nt-long ssDNA resulted mostly in partial Rad51 filament formation, and only 4% of the ssDNA molecules were completely covered by Rad51, as indicated by the EM results. RPA is essential to form complete Rad51 filaments. Additionally, the stoichiometry of RPA, Rad51, Rad52 and ssDNA has to be very precise to allow complete Rad51 filament formation. Increasing Rad52 concentration results in an inhibition of Rad51 filament formation, which makes difficult to test the effect of Rad52 on Rad51 filament stability or on Srs2 activity. We also observed previously by EM (Esta et al., 2013) that only 10% of complete Rad51 filaments formed on a 400nt-long ssDNA is associated with more than one Rad52 spot. This might decrease the chance to observe an effect of Rad52 on Rad51 filaments assembled on small molecules.</p><p>Therefore, first, we tried to assemble complete Rad51 filaments on a 60mer biotinylated oligonucleotide. The major problem we encountered was the high unspecific association of Rad51 with the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen). By trying different conditions, we could at best reduce Rad51 unspecific binding to 20%; however, in these conditions of salt concentration and temperature, Rad52 mediator activity could not be observed (i.e., there was as much Rad51 retained on beads coated with RPA-covered ssDNA in the presence or in the absence of Rad52). Additionally, because the affinity of Rad52 for naked DNA is high, it is impossible to distinguish DNA-bound Rad52 from Rad51 filament-bound Rad52 with this technique.</p><p>Then, to reduce the signal/background ratio, we used a 400nt-long ssDNA that shares homology with the biotinylated oligonucleotide to bind it to the streptavidin beads. Unfortunately, we observed high unspecific binding of the 400nt-long ssDNA to the beads in the absence of the oligonucleotide. We varied the salt concentration in the buffer used to coat the beads with the 60mer oligonucleotide. Yet, at best we still found 30% of unspecific binding of the 400nt-long ssDNA to the beads. We considered that we could not proceed on Rad51 filament formation with such a high background.</p><p>Srs2 helicase activity assay</p><p>We used a 200bp dsDNA substrate with a 400nt-long 3’ overhang, resulting from the pairing of a 600nt ssDNA with a complementary 200nt ssDNA. Srs2 must be loaded on ssDNA to be able to unwind dsDNA. It cannot unwind a blunted end dsDNA. Srs2 displays a poor helicase activity on this substrate. As described previously by several laboratories (REF?), Srs2 helicase activity is strongly enhanced by Rad51 pre-coated on ssDNA. To test the effect of Rad52 on Srs2 helicase activity, we formed Rad51 filaments by adding Rad52 and Rad51 on the substrate pre-coated with saturating amount of RPA. We found that Rad52 does not reduce Srs2 helicase activity. However, our controls show that saturating amount of RPA on the 3’ tail stimulates Srs2 helicase activity as efficiently as Rad51, thus preventing us to reach a valid conclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
