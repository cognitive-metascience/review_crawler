vesicular transport pathway plays major roles in synaptic remodeling associated with formation of long-term memories, but the mechanisms that regulate this pathway during memory acquisition are not fully understood. Here we identify miRNAs that are up-regulated in the rodent hippocampus upon contextual fear-conditioning and identify the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways as the major targets of the fear-induced miRNAs. We demonstrate that miR-153, a member of this group, inhibits the expression of key components of the vesicular transport machinery, and down-regulates Glutamate receptor A1 trafficking and neurotransmitter release. MiR-153 expression is specifically induced during LTP induction in hippocampal slices and its knockdown in the hippocampus of adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Our results suggest that miR-153, and possibly other fear-induced miRNAs, act as components of a negative feedback loop that blocks neuronal hyperactivity at least partly through the inhibition of the vesicular transport pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22467.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22467.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is widely believed that the formation of stable memories involves changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons that are activated during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kandel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lynch, 2004</xref>). At the cellular level, sensory experience results in altered neurotransmitter release at the synapse, which triggers membrane depolarization and calcium influx into individual neurons. This action initiates a cascade of downstream events including the activation of protein kinases, redistribution of neurotransmitter receptors, and induction of changes in gene expression, which together lead to stable changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). Although great progress has been made in describing how neuronal activation triggers downstream events, how the various induced pathways work together to coordinate changes at the synapse remains unknown.</p><p>Neuronal activation is associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in gene expression that are required for modulation of synaptic plasticity. The role of de novo transcription and the functions of several families of transcription factors such as CREB, C/EBPβ, Egr1, AP1, and Rel1 in synaptic plasticity and memory formation have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a major class of regulators that act at the post-transcriptional level and control the expression of numerous target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>), many of which are expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaidatzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lim et al., 2005</xref>). Neuronal miRNAs play major roles in regulation of synaptic development and plasticity, and have been identified as components of regulatory pathways that modulate memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012</xref>). For example, mouse miR-134 inhibits the expression of CREB, a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and modulates synapse morphology by inhibiting the expression of LimK1 protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have also identified activity-dependent changes in miRNA levels during memory formation. In one study, distinct populations of miRNAs that are up-regulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus at early (1–3 hr) and late (24 hr) times after contextual fear-conditioning were identified and were proposed to positively regulate memory formation by increasing protein synthesis through de-repression of mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kye et al., 2011</xref>). In another study, miR-132 was found to be upregulated in the hippocampus upon induction of seizure or contextual fear-conditioning 45 min after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nudelman et al., 2010</xref>). However, the precise roles of activity-induced miRNAs in the hippocampus in vivo remain to be elucidated. Multiple hippocampal regions, in addition to the CA1, have been identified with the acquisition of different types of associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Milner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rempel-Clower et al., 1996</xref>). Studies using selective lesions within the hippocampus have demonstrated that all of the hippocampal regions participate in memory formation following a period of associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jerman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Kesner, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2004b</xref>). The hippocampal regions with roles in the formation of memory associated with contextual fear conditioning are highly interconnected and may have distinct functions during memory formation. However, previous studies have not analyzed fear conditioning-induced changes in miRNA levels in the dentate gyrus region, which is also critical for the formation of memories associated with contextual fear conditioning.</p><p>We therefore aimed to identify fear conditioning-induced changes in the levels of miRNAs in the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus region. Using a global expression profiling approach, we identified 21 miRNAs that are upregulated in the hippocampus of adult rats 24 hr after contextual fear conditioning. Four of these miRNAs are specifically induced as a result of associative learning and 12 are predicted to downregulate targets that are involved in vesicle exocytosis and synaptic plasticity processes. One of the miRNAs belonging to both above categories, miR-153, is transcriptionally induced, specifically in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, after contextual fear conditioning. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine the role of miR-153 in both synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Consistent with its induction pattern in vivo, in hippocampal brain slices miR-153 is specifically induced upon LTP induction in the dentate gyrus. Knockdown of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus results in more robust fear memory, suggesting that it plays a negative role in the regulation of synaptic strength. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of miR-153 in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces spine volume. Finally, consistent with the ability of miR-153 to suppress the expression of components of the SNARE-mediated vesicle exocytosis pathway, such as VAMP-2, and in support of a role for miR-153 as a negative regulator of synaptic plasticity, we discovered that overexpression of miR-153 suppresses the delivery of the AMPA receptors to the synapse in cultured neurons. Our findings suggest that miR-153 is a negative feedback regulator that is transcriptionally induced after contextual fear conditioning to downregulate changes that lead to increased synaptic strength. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis of the targets of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs, together with the validation of these targets for one member of the group, suggests that down regulation of the vesicular transport pathway, which has previously been shown to be critical for synaptic remodeling, is a major component of the network of activity-induced changes in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of fear-induced miRNAs</title><p>To identify miRNAs that may function in formation of long-term memory, we performed expression profiling of miRNAs in the hippocampus of adult rats that were trained with the contextual fear conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanselow, 1980</xref>). Adult female rats were trained with three foot shocks in a training chamber. We reasoned that miRNAs that are important for long-term memory may exhibit increased expression 24 hr after behavioral training had ceased. Although the distinct temporal phases or processes that take place during memory formation continue for several days, the transcription-dependent phase is relatively brief and is completed within 48 hr after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alberini, 2011</xref>). Animals were therefore sacrificed 24 hr after training and the hippocampus was dissected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using a combination of the TargetScan, miRBase and microrna target prediction algorithms we identified over 3000 candidate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). We further reduced the number of candidates by requiring that the genes be expressed in the brain and possess binding sites for three or more of the 21 miRNAs. This strategy resulted in a list of 353 predicted targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Network analysis conducted with these genes identified pathways essential to neuronal development, vesicle transport, long-term potentiation and synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (See Experimental Procedures). The vesicle exocytosis pathway emerged as one of the top three enriched networks, with 15 genes out of the 40 known components of the pathway identified as predicted targets that could be co-regulated by the 21 miRNAs. Further analysis of the 15 genes identified in this pathway revealed binding sites for 12 of the 21 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). These findings suggest that this group of miRNAs may be part of a regulatory network involved in suppressing vesicle exocytosis, a process that is required for neurotransmitter release, insertion of receptors at the synapse, and memory formation. MiR-153 emerged at the top of the list of 12 miRNAs responsible for regulating this group of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), with 12 potential targets in the vesicle exocytosis pathway. Interestingly 8 of these targets contained binding sites for three or more of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs based on our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The remaining 4 components of the vesicle exocytosis pathway had potential binding sites for either miR-153 alone, or together with one additional fear-induced miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore chose to investigate the possible role of miR-153 in memory formation and regulation of vesicle exocytosis in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MiR-153 is a learning-induced miRNA</title><p>In order to form a long-term memory after contextual fear conditioning training, an animal must learn to associate a specific location (context) with a negative experience (foot shock). Several studies have indicated that contextual fear memory results from learning the context and shock alone, as well as the paired association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fanselow, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, distinct components of the animal’s experience during contextual fear conditioning could differentially contribute to activation of the 21 fear-induced miRNAs. To determine the effect of the foot shock on miRNA expression, we analyze the expression of the fear-induced miRNAs in the hippocampus of adult rats that were trained with either an immediate shock test or the contextual fear conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanselow, 1980</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Adult female rats trained with the contextual fear conditioning paradigm were trained with three delayed foot shocks as described above. Rats in the immediate shock group were taken from their home cage, placed into the conditioning chamber, and immediately shocked with three foot shocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This behavioral paradigm does not allow the animal to form an associative memory between the context and the foot shock, as indicated by the absence of a freezing response in the immediate shock test group 24 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fanselow, 1986</xref>). Animals were sacrificed 24 hr after training and the hippocampus was dissected. We isolated RNA from nine hippocampi for each naïve, immediate shock (‘experience’), and delayed shock (‘learning’) groups, prepared independent samples with pools of RNA from three animals in each group (three biological replicates each containing three animals), and using RT-qPCR, analyzed hippocampal miRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This analysis revealed three distinct classes of fear-induced miRNAs. Class I miRNAs (miR-153, miR-181a, miR-204, miR-218) were induced only in the delayed shock group, indicating that their increased expression required associated learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Class II miRNAs (miR-27b, miR-219, miR-347) were induced in both the immediate and delayed shock groups, but displayed statistically significant higher expression levels in the delayed relative to the immediate shock group, suggesting that they were experience- and learning-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Class III miRNAs (miR-9, miR-9*, miR-29b, and others) displayed increased expression in both the immediate and delayed shock groups, suggesting that they were experience-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The majority of the fear-induced miRNAs belong to class III miRNAs, which are likely induced after exposing rats to a novel context and the application of either immediate or delayed shock. Overall these findings reveal distinct classes of fear-induced hippocampal miRNAs, a subset of which is only induced as a result of associative learning and includes miR-153.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22467.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of three classes of miRNA that are induced in the hippocampus with contextual fear conditioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of experimental strategy.

LTP in the hippocampus is a lasting form of synaptic plasticity that has been implicated in mammalian learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin et al., 2000</xref>). One of the strongest correlations between the properties of behavioral memory formation and LTP is the evidence that each exhibits at least two mechanistically distinct phases of maintenance: an ‘early’ protein synthesis-independent phase that initiates synaptic changes and a transcription and protein synthesis dependent ‘late’ phase that contributes to activity-dependent structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Otani, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham and Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Matthies et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ostroff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Raymond et al., 2000</xref>). To assess whether the expression of miR-153 is induced during the maintenance of LTP, we examined perforant path-dentate gyrus LTP (PP-DG LTP) in acute hippocampal slices prepared from adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To facilitate further in vitro and genetic analysis of miR-153, we used mice as an experimental system for these and subsequent experiments. We note that miR-153 is highly conserved in vertebrates, displaying 100% sequence identity between rat, mouse, frog, and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mandemakers et al., 2013</xref>). Extracellular field potentials evoked by perforant path stimulation were recorded in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus before and after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). LTP was quantified by examining HFS-induced changes in the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Three hours after LTP induction, which is around the beginning of the late phase LTP, the dentate gyrus, and CA1-CA3 regions were isolated and expression of miR-153 was quantified by RT-qPCR. Control regions were isolated from the remaining acute hippocampal slices following 3 hr of incubation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of HFS, and expression of miR-153 was quantified by RT-qPCR. Consistent with the fear conditioning results, we observed elevated levels of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA1-CA3 regions, after 3 hr of PP-DG LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that miR-153 expression is specifically induced in the dentate gyrus region during the late phase of LTP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>miR-153 is transcriptionally induced from an alternative promoter</title><p>To better understand how fear-induced expression of miR-153 may be regulated, we surveyed for changes in chromatin modification patterns associated with active transcription after behavioral training. Histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) is associated with gene bodies of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Of the miRNAs identified in the microarray panel, miR-153 was the only miRNA that showed increased enrichment of H3K36me3 across the coding sequence in trained compared to naïve rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In mammals, miR-153 is located within the 19th intron of Ptprn2, a host gene that is conserved among a wide range of phylogenetic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Analysis of ENCODE H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data revealed two sites of enrichment within Ptprn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). The first site of enrichment is located at the promoter of Ptprn2; the second site of enrichment is located within the gene body, 100 kilobases upstream of the miR-153 coding sequence. Since H3K4me3 is generally associated with promoter regions, the second site of enrichment for H3K4me3 within the Ptprn2 gene body may represent an alternative transcription start site that could independently drive the expression of a miR-153 precursor transcript. To test this hypothesis, we measured RNA expression changes at the Ptprn2 locus close to its canonical promoter and downstream of the second H3K4me3 peak in trained and naïve animals. We observed low levels of expression close to the Ptprn2 promoter, which were similar in trained and naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the transcript downstream of the internal H3K4me3 peak, as assayed for the exon closest to the miR-153 coding sequence, increased 1.4-fold in trained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that miR-153 was probably generated by a separate transcriptional unit at the promoter found around the internal H3K4me3 region.</p><p>In order to gain insight into transcriptional regulation of miR-153, we first identified conditions in mature murine hippocampal cultures under which we could mimic the activity-induced overexpression observed in the hippocampus of trained rats following contextual fear conditioning. We performed a time course using mature murine hippocampal cultures, induced membrane depolarization by KCl, isolated small RNA at various time points, and quantified miR-153 expression by RT-qPCR. Expression of miR-153 was markedly increased 2–3 hr after membrane depolarization was induced with KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). On the other hand, an increase in the expression of the precursor form of miR-153 was observed 1 hr after membrane polarization, but was reduced to baseline expression levels 2–3 hr after KCl treatment, suggesting that a precursor RNA may be induced rapidly and then processed into mature miR-153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to gain further insight into how miR-153 transcription is regulated during neuronal activation.

Additionally, PolII Ser2 occupancy and H3K36me3 levels on the gene body of the miR-153 were significantly increased upon KCl stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We observed a dramatic increase in activity-dependent binding of each transcription factor following KCl stimulation with greater effects at the alternative promoter relative to the <italic>Ptprn2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). These results suggest that the activity-dependent regulation of miR-153 may be mediated by a group of transcription factors, which have previously been implicated in regulation of activity-dependent transcription in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Knockdown of miR-153 in the hippocampus enhances fear memory</title><p>We next examined the role of miR-153 in memory formation. To achieve this, we inhibited miR-153 activity in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus, via lentiviral mediated delivery of the miRZip-153 inhibiting vector with a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to confirm proper targeting of the dentate gyrus by stereotaxic injection of the miRZip-153 and miRZip-scrambled (miRZip-scr) lentivirus, and to confirm that the observed phenotype was not due to damage of the dentate gyrus region as a result of the injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further establish, at single-cell resolution, that the GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons were depleted of miR-153, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of dissociated hippocampal neurons from either miRZip-153-GFP or miRZip-scr-GFP mice and used them to prepare RNA for single-cell miR expression analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the levels of miR-153 in GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons containing miRZip-153 were dramatically reduced compared to GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons containing the scrambled control miRZip. Inhibition of miR-153 function in the dentate gyrus resulted in a significant enhancement of long-term memory in the contextual fear-conditioning paradigm, whereas lentiviral-mediated delivery of a scrambled sequence did not affect fear memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, long-term memory in the cued fear-conditioning paradigm, which is predominantly amygdala-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>), was not affected by knockdown of miR-153 in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Locomotion, anxiety-related and nociception behaviors were normal in miR-153 knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–M</xref>) suggesting that the effect of miR-153 inhibition is hippocampal specific and is not due to differential pain sensitivity, motor coordination or anxiety levels in the injected groups of mice.

Dendritic spines are specialized actin-rich protrusions of the dendritic shaft. They are the major sites of excitatory synaptic connections and undergo morphological changes during development and in response to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>). MiR-153 overexpression after fear conditioning and LTP induction, as well as the more robust fear response of mice after the inhibition of its activity, prompted us to explore a possible role for miR-153 in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology. We performed time course RT-qPCR assays to detect the levels of miR-153 using primary hippocampal neurons at different days in vitro. We observed that miR-153 levels progressively increased and reached maximum levels after 10 days in vitro, when hippocampal neurons are differentiated and have made many synaptic connections, thus being more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, to test the effects of modulating miR-153 expression on dendritic spine geometry, we suppressed or enhanced miR-153 function in cultured mature hippocampal neurons by introducing either a miRZip-153 inhibiting vector to block the endogenous miR-153 activity or a miR-153 overexpressing vector to increase its levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lovén et al., 2010</xref>). The efficacy of these approaches was assessed using RT-qPCR to quantify miR-153 expression in neurons in which miR-153 was inhibited or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Analysis of the spine size in mature hippocampal neurons in which miR-153 was inhibited showed no significant change of the spine volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B,E,F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although, we did not observe a change in average spine head width in miR-153 knockdown compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), analysis of the data as cumulative plots showed a significant increase in spine head width, most likely attributed to a group of spines of a particular size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, miR-153 overexpression resulted in a significant decrease of the average spine volume, which was reduced to about 50% of the size of spines in the control scramble overexpressing hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). Spine shrinkage in miR-153 overexpressing neurons was due to decreased spine head and neck widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Neither overexpression of miR-153, nor its inhibition had any measurable or significant effect on the average spine density or length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). The smaller effects observed in neurons where miR-153 is inhibited is likely due to the lower levels of miR-153 in un-stimulated neurons used in these experiments. Overall, these findings demonstrate that miR-153 activity modulates structural features of the synapse known to be associated with changes in plasticity.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22467.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of miR-153 decreases dendritic spine volume in hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Lifeact-mRuby images, used to visualize spines, of dendritic regions from representative neurons (DIV18) transfected with scramble (KD) control vector (<bold>A</bold>), miR-153 (KD) inhibiting vector (<bold>B</bold>), scramble (OE) control vector (<bold>C</bold>), miR-153 (OE) overexpressing vector (<bold>D</bold>).

We transduced cultured hippocampal neurons with miRZip-153 and miRZip-scr lentivirus and quantified the release of [H<sup>3</sup>] glutamate after stimulation with 55 mM KCl. Knockdown of miR-153 in cultured hippocampal neurons increased the release of [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate compared to the scramble control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with stably transfected and differentiated H19-7 cells, which are competent for glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akchiche et al., 2010</xref>) and in which miR-153 is also activity-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Furthermore, cultured hippocampal neurons transduced with miR-153 overexpression lentivirus and stimulated with 55 mM KCl secreted about 49% less [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate than scramble control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). The change in [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate release depended on KCl concentrations required to depolarize neurons as neither knockdown or overexpression of miR-153 under low KCl concentrations induced a change in [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). These findings suggest that miR-153 suppresses depolarization-induced glutamate secretion.</p><p>Previous studies have identified a unique SNARE complex, including VAMP2 with roles in the exocytosis of AMPA receptor subunits at the post-synaptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>). In order to assess whether miR-153 has a role in regulating AMPA receptor exocytosis, we monitored the exocytosis of GluA1 subunit using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We used differentiated neuroblastoma cells (N2A) that do not express miR-153 in order to examine the effect of ectopic miR-153 expression on AMPA receptor exocytosis. Differentiated N2A cells were transfected with a miR-153 expression vector or a scramble expression vector carrying an mCherry cassette to visualize cells expressing miR-153 along with a construct expressing the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor tagged with a pH-sensitive form of EGFP (Super Ecliptic pHluorin, SEP) that displays fluorescence when it is present mainly on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). This strategy provides the opportunity to capture exocytosis of GluA1 receptor when it moves to the cell membrane from intracellular compartments. Three days after transfection, differentiated N2A cells were photobleached to eliminate SEP fluorescence and images were acquired every 10 min for 150 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After photobleaching, SEP fluorescence in control cells gradually recovered by the end of the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>). In contrast, in cells expressing miR-153, SEP fluorescence did not recover to the same levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). The total levels of GluA1 were comparable between scramble expressing cells and miR-153 expressing cells as observed with western blotting, indicating that miR-153 expression did not affect GluA1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These findings suggest that miR-153 inhibits the transport of the GluA1 AMPA receptors to the cell surface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified a group of hippocampal miRNAs that are upregulated following contextual fear conditioning. Our analysis of their predicted targets suggests that components of the vesicular transport and synaptogenesis pathways are major substrates for regulation by these miRNAs. Further analysis of, miR-153, which is specifically induced as a result of associative learning, revealed that it inhibits the expression of several components of the vesicular transport machinery, regulates neuronal features, such as spine morphology, which correlate with LTP induction and learning, inhibits the transport of GluA1 AMPA receptors to the surface of neurons, and inhibits glutamate release/uptake. As would be expected from a functionally important learning-associated factor, miR-153 expression is specifically induced in dentate gyrus granule cells during LTP in hippocampal slices, and its knockdown in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus in adult mice results in enhanced fear memory. Together, our results suggest that microRNAs, such as miR-153, are experience- or learning-induced to act as negative feedback regulators of pathways associated with synaptic plasticity, such as the vesicle transport pathway, and may serve to attenuate changes associated with increased synaptic strength, such as the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse and neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The vesicular transport pathway as a primary target of experience- and learning-induced miRNAs</title><p>The functional adaptations that occur during LTP and memory formation often rely on rapid changes in the composition of postsynaptic membranes. In the mammalian brain, synaptic plasticity requires regulated trafficking of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses, which mediates learning-induced changes in the number and stoichiometry of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Matsuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whitlock et al., 2006</xref>). More specifically, NMDA receptor-triggered LTP involves exocytosis of GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits and an increase in their density at the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and Huganir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Passafaro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pickard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shi et al., 1999</xref>). Receptor exocytosis is mediated by the soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) pathway, which attaches intracellular vesicles to their target membranes and drives membrane fusion. In this study, we show that VAMP2 and SNAP25 SNAREs are post-transcriptionally regulated by somatodendritically localized miR-153. The negative effect of miR-153 on VAMP2 and SNAP25 expression as well as on the delivery of the GluA1 receptors to the cell surface, together with the well-established role of GluA1 receptor transport in LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shepherd and Huganir, 2007</xref>), provides an explanation for enhancement of fear memory following the knockdown of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, miR-153 expression is induced in the dentate gyrus during LTP in acute hippocampal slices via stimulation of the perforant path-dentate granule cell neuronal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This is the physiological pathway for input of fear-associated sensory information into the dentate gyrus. Together the results support the idea that activation of a learning-associated neuronal pathway induces miR-153 expression in the brain to modulate memory formation. Finally, our in silico analysis revealed an additional 11 fear-induced miRNAs that may potentially target vesicle exocytosis and participate in AMPA receptor trafficking at the postsynaptic area. Therefore, AMPA receptor trafficking is likely to be regulated by the coordinated action of a large number of fear-induced miRNAs.</p><p>The importance of the vesicle exocytosis pathway in learning and memory has been underscored by several previous studies. ShRNA-mediated knock-down of several SNARE proteins in combination with high-resolution live cell imaging has demonstrated a role for a unique SNARE-dependent fusion machinery in exocytosis of AMPA and NMDA receptors at the postsynaptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>). The R-SNARE protein VAMP2 and Q-SNARE protein SNAP25 are essential components of the postsynaptic vesicle fusion machinery that is required for neurotransmitter receptor trafficking during basal- and LTP-induced neuronal activity, suggesting that these SNAREs are important for both constitutive and regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>). VAMP2 contributes to constitutive and regulated postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, while SNAP25 plays a role in the constitutive postsynaptic trafficking of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>). In our studies, miR-153 overexpression in cultured hippocampal neurons resulted in decreased expression of both VAMP2 and SNAP25, indicating that both SNAREs could be regulated by miR-153. However, in vivo knock down of miR-153 in the dentate gyrus resulted in an increase in the expression of VAMP2 but not SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,F</xref>). The VAMP2 component of the SNARE pathway may therefore be the major in vivo target for miR-153-mediated regulation of AMPA receptor exocytosis.</p><p>The SNARE proteins also play well-established roles in vesicle trafficking, fusion and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Vamp2 and Snap25 were initially characterized as components of SNARE complexes that mediate vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Söllner et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">1993b</xref>). In addition, cytoskeleton associated proteins such as Bsn and Pclo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">tom Dieck et al., 1998</xref>), both of which are also miR-153 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), participate in vesicle transport at the presynaptic area. Our demonstration that miR-153 knock-down increases activity-dependent glutamate release is consistent with a general role for miR-153 in down-regulation of vesicle transport and fusion at both the pre- and post-synaptic areas. In agreement with a role for miR-153 in neurotransmitter release (this study), studies in zebrafish have shown that loss of miR-153 results in increased Snap25 expression and consequently motor neuron defects and hyperactive movement of early zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). At least one other miRNA, miR-137, has been implicated in presynaptic vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegert et al., 2015</xref>). MiR-137 overexpression results in the downregulation of presynaptic components of the SNARE complexes, such as Complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf, and Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to impaired vesicle release. In vivo, overexpression of miR-137 in the dentate gyrus results in changes in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired mossy fiber-LTP induction and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegert et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to miR-153, miR-137 expression was not induced in our studies. MiR-137 may therefore play an important role in the constitutive regulation of basal SNARE protein levels that impact presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The molecular machinery required for regulated secretion is conserved across different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mostov et al., 2003</xref>). We note that, in addition to the brain, both miR-153 and its host gene, Ptprn2, are expressed in the pancreas and affect insulin secretion following glucose stimulation in pancreatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mandemakers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Pancreatic beta cells express many of the components that are required for regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobsson et al., 1994</xref>). In fact, four of the predicted targets from the vesicle exocytosis pathway (<italic>Pclo</italic>, <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Snca</italic> and <italic>Vamp2</italic>) are also regulated by miR-153 in pancreatic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mandemakers et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, miR-153 downregulates vesicle transport and fusion to suppress neurotransmitter release in neurons and may function in a similar manner to suppress insulin secretion in the pancreas following stimulation with glucose. Moreover, Ptprn2 localizes to synaptic vesicles and facilitates the secretion of neurotransmitters in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2009</xref>). MiR-153 and its host gene may therefore have the capacity to negatively and positively regulate downstream targets, respectively. However, while in the pancreas miR-153 expression appears to be under the control of the <italic>Ptprn2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mandemakers et al., 2013</xref>), activity-dependent expression of miR-153 in the hippocampus is driven by an alternative promoter (this study), allowing it to act independently of its host gene. Further studies are required to determine the intriguing relationship between the activities of miR-153 and its host gene in neuronal and pancreatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Learning-induced miRNAs as barriers to neuronal hyperactivity</title><p>In addition to the regulation of the vesicle exocytosis pathway, our bioinformatic analysis revealed that fear-induced miRNAs may negatively regulate other pathways such as the immediate early gene expression program. In this regard, neuronal activity promotes the association of several immediate early transcription factors with the miR-153 promoter, suggesting that miR-153 is likely to be transcriptionally induced by the immediate early gene program in an activity-dependent manner. Similarly to the regulation of vesicle exocytosis pathway, activity-induced miRNAs may function as negative feedback regulators to suppress the expression programs that are required for the initial structural and functional changes at the synapse. MiR-153 and the immediate early gene, CBP/p300, are one example of this type of feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our findings suggest that miR-153 may negatively regulate the expression of CBP/p300 as a means of controlling CBP/p300 function and may help to prevent excessive CBP/p300-mediated activation of downstream targets. MiR-153 may act together with other fear-induced miRNAs to provide feedback control to return the immediate early gene program to basal levels of expression.</p><p>Experience-dependent rewiring of neural circuits is triggered by changes in activity patterns that initiate and ultimately produce long-term modifications of synapses. We speculate that miR-153, together with other fear-induced miRNAs presented in this study, are induced in response to neuronal activity and may perform at least two functions, which are not mutually exclusive. First, by suppressing many plasticity genes that are induced in activated neurons, late acting miRNAs, such as miR-153, may help stabilize firing rates and restore baseline function, thus enabling the circuit to process new information. Second, miR-153 class of miRNAs may set a threshold for linking the strength of excitatory signals to long-term changes in synaptic strength. For example, ready induction of miR-153 may dampen weak signals but allow changes in synaptic strength as a result of stronger signals. Consistent with the results presented here, other studies have shown that the expression of several mammalian miRNAs is rapidly induced after enhanced neuronal activity coupled to learning in various paradigms, such as contextual fear conditioning or olfaction discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smalheiser et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the dentate gyrus (this study), distinct populations of miRNAs are upregulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus at early (1–3 hr) and late (24 hr) stages of learning and have been proposed to regulate memory formation by increasing protein synthesis through de-repression of mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kye et al., 2011</xref>). Thus activity-induced miRNAs are likely to exert both positive and negative effects on memory formation. However, the vast majority of the miRNAs we detected have not been implicated in memory formation and with the exception of miR-9, miR-219 and miR-125a, their role in synaptic plasticity is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ifrim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kocerha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Malmevik et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, this set of miRNAs is a valuable resource for future studies. Comprehensive functional characterization of miR-153 demonstrated its role as a negative feedback regulator of synaptic strength that is fear- and LTP- induced, primarily in dentate gyrus granule cells. Further studies of fear-induced miRNAs are therefore likely to provide insight into how different regions of the hippocampus respond to learning-induced inputs.

Sex differences in laboratory rodent species have been reported during acquisition, retention and extinction in classical and operant conditioning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maren et al., 1994</xref>). In the classical fear-conditioning paradigm males outperform females, or are more resistant to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalla et al., 2009</xref>). Typically behavioral training does not include cohorts of female rodents because it is assumed that their behaviors are similar, but more variable, relative to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalla et al., 2009</xref>). However, we confirmed that overexpression of miR-153 after fear conditioning is not a sex-specific response by performing behavioral training with adult male wild-type mice. We observed an increase in hippocampal levels of miR-153 following training (data not shown). Rats were approximately 90 days old at the start of the experiment and were individually housed with ad lib food and water throughout the experiment. Two sets of four operant chambers (Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) located in separate rooms were used (counterbalanced).

Ventilation fans provided background noise of 65 dB, and the boxes were lit with two 7.5 W incandescent bulbs mounted to the ceiling of the sound-attenuation chamber. In one set of chambers, the front and back walls were brushed aluminum; the side walls and ceiling were clear acrylic plastic. Recessed 5.1 × 5.1 cm food cups were centered in the front wall and positioned near floor-level. The floor was composed of stainless steel rods (0.48 cm in diameter) spaced 1.6 cm apart from center to center and mounted parallel to the front wall. In the second set of chambers, the ceiling and left side wall had black horizontal stripes, 3.8 cm wide and spaced 3.8 cm apart. The floor consisted of alternating stainless steel rods with different diameters (0.48 and 1.27 cm), spaced 1.6 cm apart from center to center.

The cells were cultured as mentioned before and at DIV11 they were transfected with the vectors indicated in the figures and the text. Cultures were fixed at DIV18 with 4% formaldehyde/2% sucrose in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed 3 times with 1x PBS and then mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Life Sciences). Lifeact-Ruby neurons were identified by anti-RFP primary antibody and then a secondary Alexa-555. This procedure was similar to that used for dendritic spine geometry analysis. Neurons for the phenotypic analyses were imaged using either widefield or spinning disk confocal microscopy. Widefield images used for the phenotypic analyses were collected using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA R2 cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002368">SCR_002368</ext-link>).

Neurons were selected based on the eGFP staining. For this analysis, we obtained images from two independent experiments per condition and three coverslips for each experiment.

Similar to the dendritic analysis, in the Imaris Surpass mode, a new 3D filament was created using the Autopath mode and a region of interest (ROI) was selected. We restricted the spine analysis in secondary or tertiary dendrites to reduce variability and we analyzed about 100 µm–150 µm of dendritic segments from at least two dendrites per neuron. The dendrite reconstruction was created based on the eGFP signal and dendritic spines were reconstructed based on the Lifeact-ruby signal. After the completion of the analysis for each neuron we extracted the data for the spine volume, spine length, spine terminal diameter (head width), spine mean neck width. Spine density was calculated per neuron by dividing the total number of spines by the total length of dendrites measured in each cell. The means for these parameters were calculated for each neuron separately and then the averages from all neurons together were plotted as average numbers for each condition. Alternatively, all the individual values were used to generate cumulative plots. In addition to the unpaired t-tests, we performed multiple pairwise comparisons using one-way ANOVA: [spine volume: (p value = 0.04, F = 2925), spine width: (p value = 0.0124, F = 3904), spine length: (p value = 0,4231, F = 0,9476), spine neck width: (p value = 0,0046, F = 4741), spine density: (p value = 0,0154, F = 3731)].</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Microscopy of brain sections</title><p>To assess the efficiency of the virus injections mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS.

Neurons were rinsed with saline solution only and then incubated with 2.5 μM FM4-–64 in saline solution. The cells were washed three times with saline solution for a total of 5 min, followed by a wash for 10 min with 1 mM ADVASEP-7 (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline solution. FM4-–64 imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA R2 cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software with a Plan-Apochromat 40 × 0.95 N.A objective with images taken every 10 s at 25°C. A 1 min baseline was recorded, followed by stimulation with 55 mM KCl in saline solution for 7 min. Cells were excited at 558 nm and the emission measured at 734 nm. Images were analyzed in a blinded manner in ImageJ using the ‘time series analyzer v3’ plug-in. We analyzed potential functional nerve terminals located along the GFP-positive cells and calculated the average values for each neuron separately and then the average of all neurons per condition. The FM4–64 signal was determined by F = (F1 − B1)/(F0 − B0). The signal was normalized to mean fluorescence intensity measured at baseline condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Measurement of uptake and release of [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate</title><p>Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured and transduced with miRZip-153, miRZip-scr, miR-153 or scramble overexpression lentiviruses as described above. For uptake assays, [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate (1 µCi) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After removal of excess radiolabeled ligands, the cells were washed rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. The radioactivity remaining in the cells was extracted with NaOH and measured with a liquid scintillation counter. For the release assays, cells were incubated in neurobasal medium with [H<sup>3</sup>]-glutamate (1 µCi) for 2 hr and washed three times to remove excess radioactivity. The cells were then stimulated as described above (see Stimulation of neuronal cells) for 15 min at 37°C. The media were collected and rapidly centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 s at 4°C. The radioactivity in the supernatants was then measured with a liquid scintillation counter.</p><p>Rat hippocampal H19-7/miRZip-153 and H19-7/miRZip-scr cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates coated with poly-L-lysine at a density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 200 µg/mL G418, and 2 mM glutamine (DMEM-proliferation medium) for 2 days. The cells were grown at 34°C in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>.

Thus, to determine if the predicted targets are indicative of a specific function there needs to be a comparison to a random set of brain-expressed genes.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As suggested by the reviewer, to determine whether the predicted targets from the 21 fear-induced miRNAs are indicative of a specific function, we performed a comparison to random sets of brain-expressed genes. We obtained a list of ~20,000 brain-expressed genes (Lein et al., 2007) and used this database to generate random sets of genes for network analysis. Random sets of genes were created that were similar in size to the target gene list (3,986) and network analysis was performed with each random gene list.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> has been revised to include an additional panel with statistical significance (p-value) for each canonical signaling pathway as compared to the number of occurrences from random sets of brain-expressed genes (p-value column). As indicated in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, all 6 of the networks gave p-values of &lt;0.0001; the Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis, Transmission of nerve impulse and Long-term potentiation networks gave p-values &lt;10<sup>-24</sup>.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the in situ data appears to show an increase in staining in the whole hippocampus after training. In particular, the stratum oriens of the CA1 appears to have as intense an increase in miR-153 staining as does the DG. This is inconsistent with the conclusion that regulation is dentate specific.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, we observed an increase in staining throughout the hippocampus after training in our in situ hybridization experiments. These data contradict our RT-qPCR results, which clearly and reproducibly demonstrated that miR-153 expression was increased specifically in the DG after fear conditioning. We believe that this inconsistency is due to non-specific background staining in the in situ hybridization experiments, as high background was also observed with a scrambled negative control probe. Because we are confident in the RT-qPCR results, we have removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and the primary culture in situ hybridization data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>, and will present only the RT-qPCR data. We note that the RT-qPCR data fully support our conclusion that expression of miR-153 is primarily induced in the hippocampal DG region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The images of the dentate gyrus infected with the miR-153 knockdown lentivirus appear to show expression in about 10-20% of the granule neurons (A). This draws concerns about any behavioral changes that could be elicited by knockout of miR-153 in such a small percentage of the total granule cell population. Quantification of miR153 levels in the FACS sorted cells demonstrates good control of miR-153 by the virus in infected cells. However, an indication of the percentage of the cells infected or the overall decrease in miR-153 in the dentate of animals used for behavioral testing is needed. A plot of the correlation of freezing time in the contextual fear conditioning versus percentage of infected cells or overall expression of miR-153 could potentially strengthen the argument that the behavioral change is truly the result of miR-153 manipulation.</italic> </p><p>FACS sorting of hippocampal cells revealed 10% of the total cell population in the hippocampus was GFP+, from a total of 900,000 cells that were viable at the time of FACS sorting. Although the total number of cells is reduced relative to the quantity expected from the entire hippocampus, this value provides a minimum percentage of cells infected with the miR-153 or scramble control lentivirus. We have revised our Methods section to include the percentage of the cells infected with the miR-153 knockdown lentivirus in the DG. Long-term gene knockdown with the use of lentiviral vectors delivering shRNA has been successfully performed previously, for example, see Abbas- Terki et al., 2002; Chew et al., 2015; Seifert et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2010; Kanninen et al., 2009; Goshen et al., 2011. Our lentiviral- mediated delivery of shRNA against miR-153 into the mouse DG was intended to reduce miR-153 levels within DG granule cells. In our study, GFP<sup>+</sup> hippocampal cells showed a significant reduction in miR-153 expression relative to GFP<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the scramble control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Infection of 10% of the total cell population in the hippocampus was sufficient to elicit behavioral differences between both groups of animals. Our results suggest that increased neurotransmitter release and enhanced vesicle transport, upon knockdown of miR-153, are responsible for the behavioral adaptations observed. In future studies we will assess the impact of miR-153 expression on freezing time in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm but feel that these additional experiments are better suited for a separate manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “miR-153 Negatively Regulates Spine Size” it is stated that there was an increase in spine head width after knockdown of 153. This is not supported by the statistical analysis.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that results were not presented clearly. To test the effects of miR-153 perturbation on dendritic spine morphology and density and present the data, we used two different methods that have been used in the literature before. We calculated the mean values of each feature of the spine for every individual neuron separately and then plotted the average of all neurons per condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, we presented the data as cumulative plots including all the measurements of the individual spines, using similar numbers of spines per individual neuron for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Spine head width based on the calculation of the mean values had an increase of 0.04μm (stated in the main text), which was not significant compared to control cells. However, in the cumulative plots using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to calculate statistical significance, we observed increase in the spine head width in the miR-153KD neurons compared to the scramble KD, with a p value p&lt;0.001 and D=0.09, as we stated in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>. Since spine head width has a range of different values, presenting the data in the form of cumulative plots allows for detection of moderate changes. For example, changes that occur in a group of spines of a particular size, which would be missed otherwise. In the revised version of the manuscript, we modified the text to further clarify this point.</p><p><italic>5) The data demonstrating that the cellular function of miR153 regulates vesicle fusion is lacking. This should be more thoroughly addressed in neurons. The lack of any knockdown phenotype is a concern. Given the induction of miR-153 by potassium I would suggest morphological analysis of these cultures in highK after miR-153 knockdown.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have employed two strategies to test the role of miR-153 in vesicle transport in primary neurons. First, we used an FM dye-based assay widely used to image synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Gaffield et al., 2006). Specifically, we performed lentiviral-mediated inhibition of miR-153 in primary hippocampal neurons and used the FM4-64 dye to label and visualize their synaptic vesicles. We found that KCl-induced depolarization of the hippocampal neurons promoted exocytosis of the labeled vesicles at a higher rate in the miR-153KD neurons compared to control neurons, as indicatedby the faster depletion of FM4-64 dye.</p><p>Additionally, overexpression of miR-153 in hippocampal neurons resulted in the opposite effect, decreasing the rate of vesicle exocytosis. These new data support our conclusion for the role of miR-153 in regulation of vesicle exocytosis and are depicted in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (panels A and B) of the revised manuscript. Second, we assessed the effect of miR-153 knockdown and overexpression on neurotransmitter release in primary hippocampal cultures following neuronal activation using the biochemical assay that we had used in a cell line in the previous version of the manuscript. We observe increased neurotransmitter release after lentiviral-mediated miR-153 knockdown, whereas miR-153 overexpression result in lower levels of neurotransmitter release compared to control neurons (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). Therefore, we have confirmed the effects we observed previously in the hippocampal cell line, using this same assay, in primary cultured neurons. As expected, the results further show that miR-153 overexpression has the opposite effect.</p><p>Overall, this new data strengthens our claim that miR-153 regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Using two different approaches in primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated the key role of miR-153 in vesicle exocytosis.These new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and replace the data in the previous version of the manuscript from cell lines (now moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The only data indicating altered vesicle fusion/transport is panels D and E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> which come from the hippocampal cell line. While the gene expression data support the claims in the title, to truly substantiate these claims there needs to be stronger support for a functional impact on SNARE-mediated vesicle transport/fusion. Given that you have a system to manipulate miR-153 in hippocampal cultures or</italic> in vivo <italic>I suggest that there needs to be experiments demonstrating alteration of presynaptic function in one of these systems.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we examined the effect of knockdown and overexpression of miR-153 on neurotransmitter release in primary hippocampal cultures after stimulation. We observe altered presynaptic function after both knockdown and overexpression of miR-153, compared to knockdown and overexpression of a scrambled control. These findings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C-D</xref>. We do not observe any effect on neurotransmitter uptake after spontaneous activity (low KCl conditions), supporting our conclusion that miR-153 acts to suppress neurotransmitter release following a period of stimulation (high KCl conditions). The neurotransmitter uptake data as well as the results from the hippocampal cell line are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an impressive study from the Moazad lab, with input from the labs of Li-Huai Tsai, Chris Walsh and Mark Bouton, that describes a role for miRNAs, and in particular for miR-153, during fear-conditioning learning and synaptic plasticity.

To address the reviewer’s concern about down-regulation of miR-153 targets in the hippocampus, we performed RT-qPCR experiments for the six SNARE-mediated vesicle exocytosis targets of miR-153 (characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) using the same hippocampal RNA isolated from naïve and trained rats, which we had used for quantifying changes in miRNA levels. We found that five of the six target genes (<italic>Pclo, Snca, Snap25, Trak2</italic>, and <italic>Vamp2</italic>) were downregulated 24 hours following fear conditioning. These results are presented in the revised manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-F</xref> and strengthen our conclusion that the vesicular transport pathway is a major target for downregulation during fear conditioning. In future studies we will assess the impact of miR-153 manipulation on downstream targets in dentate gyrus granule cells after fear conditioning but feel that these experiments are better suited for a separate manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
